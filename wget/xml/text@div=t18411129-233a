                  </hi>. While the prisoner was in my service I missed some money—in consequence of that, and what happened in the last case, I had the policeman called in and the prisoner's box examined—I first had my man's box searched—the policeman examined the prisoner's box and found the money in question, which is the subject of this indictment—I had a forged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and that was found in the prisoner's box among other things.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear her swear that you never joked or took any liberty with the prisoner in her presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said not to my notice—I have kissed the girl in her presence once or twice—not often—I cannot say how often—I will swear it was not a dozen times—we made the girl one of our family—perhaps I may have kissed her a dozen times.</p>

               <p>wished the box opened in the presence of her mother—I first sent her away in custody, and then let the policeman examine her boxes—she re<lb></lb>fused to go up stairs, and insisted on her mother being sent for before they were examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath, was not your wife drinking brandy at the public-house yesterday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the public-house after standing some time, I believe I got her some—she tasted it—I found her sitting there by her<lb></lb>self—I said, "It is very foolish to sit here among the smoke, you will get overcome"—I <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> her up for being in a smoky-room—she had got damp in her feet.</p>

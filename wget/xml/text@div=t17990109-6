               <p>Q. Which said that? - A. They both spoke; I said they might if they pleased; they said they would search my pockets, and have my money; the shortest came up and stood foremost, and the other man stood with a pistol behind him; he then presented the pistol at me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they first pull out the pistol? - A. I saw it when they turned round, before they spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say they might have your money? - A.Because I was frit at them; they took three shillings out of my breeches pocket, and asked me for my watch, and one of them put his hand inside my breeches, but I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see them? - A. Last Monday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How light was it at this time? - A. I saw them, I suppose, forty yards before I came to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the men? - A. I am certain sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the man from you that had the pistol? - A. About the space of two yards, I don't think it was more.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the man who stood with the pistol is one of the men at the bar? - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What length of time might have elapsed between the time of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090015"></xptr>robbery and the time they were apprehended? - A. About ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. It was half after four, or near five o'clock? - A. It was about half past four.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, before you went into the office, that you could not undertake to swear to these men? - A. No; I said as soon as I went in, that if they were the men I could swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At Heston, about twelve miles from town.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that you knew they were in custody? - A. The constable came to me, and I told him I could swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, the man who had the pistol was about two yards distance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you saw the pistol before the man's hand was in your pocket? - A. Yes, as soon as I turned round, I saw it. I had twenty-three shillings in my pocket, and I had just before parted my money, and put the rest in my coat pocket; I was going a journey, but that having happened, I went into a public-house, and they advised me to go back to my master's, and see if I could find the men, and I went back.</p>
               <p>- HAYNES sworn. - I am constable of the parish of Hillingdon: On Thursday, the 3d of January, about seven in the evening, some people came in, and said I was wanted; I opened the door, and the two prisoners were given into my custody by the constable.</p>

               <p>Wallace's defence. I was at another place at the time.</p>

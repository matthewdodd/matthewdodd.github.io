                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live at Grove-cottage, St. James's-street, Old Kent-road. On 15th Aug. I was angling in the Surrey Canal—the prisoner and three or four other boys were on the canal in boats—he was alone in a boat, and was splashing about the water with his oars, evidently to annoy those who were fishing—we asked him and the others to go away—after some time they did so, but came back again—the prisoner broke the top of my fishing-rod—I jumped into his boat and gave him a slap over the head—he jumped ashore and said, "I will serve you out for this"—he got hold of the rope and began dragging the boat along the canal wilh me in it—he picked up a stone—I jumped out of the boat and ran after him to make him give it up, and just as I got up to him his father got out of a barge and came up to me with his fists up to strike me—the prisoner stumbled over a dog and fell—the father came up in an attitude to strike me, and just at that moment I received a severe blow from a stone on the right temple—it must have come from the prisoner who was on my right side—I bled very much—my hat was cut through the brimlining, and all—with the assistance of one of the bargemen I went to a surgeon, and was under his care for a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I was anglingin the canal—the boys were annoying me by frightening away the fish—I did not see Mr. Ilderton get into the boat, but hearing a laugh among the men I turned round, and saw him in it, and the prisoner pulling him along—I saw him pick up part of a brick—Mr. Ilderton ran after him—the father ran up to strike him—the boy fell, got up again, and after dodging about two or three times I saw him throw a brick, which struck Mr. Ilderton on the temple—he was only about four yards off at the time.</p>

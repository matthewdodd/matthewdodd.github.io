                  </hi>. I am a superanuated rigger, of No. 3, Globe Lane, Chatham, and am in the employ of Daniel Barnard, licensed victualler, who keeps the Railway Tavern in High Street, Chatham; there is a music hall attached—it is my duty to lock up the premises at night—there is a wocden fence about 6 or 7 feet high enclosing the yard at the back, in which there is a gate which is always kept locked—the bar yard leads by a door down a passage into the concert-hall, it has a panel in it which is usually kept open—there is another door leading out of the concert room into the bar; there is an opening over it into the bar large enough for a man or three men to get in if they liked—I fastened up at about 11.5 on 4th October—I had nothing to do with the bar door, they lock that when they go to bed—on the 12th October I went in the yard at about 10.50 and discovered the prisoner in one corner with his hat slouched over his eyes and his arms folded—I asked what he was doing there, but what answer he made I don't know, being deaf—the performance was all over then—I took him to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Barnard—on the morning of 5th October I got up at 5.20 and went downstairs and noticed one of the bar windows open, with a stick up under it; we always keep a stick under it when open, because there is no proper fastening—I turned round to make a report to the master and found the concert-room door was unbolted, and on searching over the place I found a large bundle of clothes behind the stage, done round with a handkerchief—the doors were all three unbolted, so that if a person were inside he could get out—there was a portmanteau there which looked as if the lock had been cut out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Barnard, who keeps the Railway Tavern, and manage his business—I was called by Williams at about 5.30 on the morning of 5th October, when I went down and examined the till, from which I missed about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper; it was not open but shut to again; I am not certain whether it was locked, I fancy it was left locked up the night before; we always lock it up after business, and place the keys in a drawer—about 11.15 is the usual time for closing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professional singer, of 151, Praed Street, Pad-dington—on the night of 4th October I was performing at Mr. Barnard's, Railway Tavern, Chatham—after the performance, according to my custom, I pnt some articles inmy portmanteau, a red silk handkerchief, a pair of white cotton gloves, and a wig were with them; I fastened the portmanteau and put the key in my pocket; these are the handkerchief and gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the morning of the 5th I examined my portmanteau, which was in the same place, but the lock had been cut and all the clothes taken out and tied up with this scarf in the hall, ready to be carried off; the portmanteau was empty, except the wig and one or two other little things.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Kent Constable</hi> 171). On the night of 12th October I went to the prosecutor's premises when the prisoner was given into my charge—I told him Mr. Barnard had given him into my custody for being on his premises for an unlawful purpose—he said it was not for an unlawful purpose, but he got over the wall to go to the rear—I took him to the sta<lb></lb>tion and searched him, when I found this handkerchief and a pair of gloves in his right hand pocket—I charged him with stealing the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the other articles, and also with burglariously breaking out of the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On the night of the 4th October I went to the hall. I don't know anything about the robbery. I picked the handkerchief and gloves up in the street, which I told the Magistrate. Of course any person might be walking along the street and pick up articles which might have been stolen. A good many evenings after the robbery I visited Mr. Bar<lb></lb>nard's music-hall, which several of his waiters know, and I daresay some of them saw me there five or six evenings. Do you think it probable that I should commit a robbery and go there every evening and be found on the premises a little more than a week afterwards if I actually committed the robbery, which I did not? The fence, instead of being 7 feet high, I should think, where I got over, is not more than 5 feet 6 inches; it is an old broken down, wooden fence.</p>

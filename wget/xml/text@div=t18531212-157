I saw the prisoner with another man at my mother's house on the 3rd Dec, about 9 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner pay my mother two half crowns—after that the other man came, alone—the prisoner was outside; I could see his head—the other man asked for change of a half crown, and said he owed Lonie a shilling—I gave him change, and put the half crown in the till immediately—I am quite sure there was not any other half crown in the till—my mother asked me for it in a few minutes, and I went to the till and got it out—I had been in the shop during that time, and no other half crown had been taken; and when I went to the till I found only one half crown in it—I put a cross on it, and gave it to my mother—my mother gave it to the constable.</p>

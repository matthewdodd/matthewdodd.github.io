I began building a manufactory seven months ago; I found all the materials - the prisoner was to find labourers, and do the carpenter's work. On Saturday, the 10th of April, I went to see if the workmen had come - I met the prisoner coming from my premises with some beads and timber - I asked him why he did not go on with his work; he said, "I do not mean to take these things, Mr. Emsley;" I said, "It looks very much like it"- he then said, "I did take them," and he went back and threw them down; I then went to another place, where he had a contract and was to find the materials - I there found two doors, which I knew belonged to me - he followed me- I said I should not leave him till I had given him in charge; he went with me to Bethnal-green, and I gave him in charge for stealing two doors, which he denied, and said he had them by him for twelve months - but at Worship-street he acknowledged he had taken them; I do not recollect the words he first used, but he said be bought them of Pain, my foreman - I knew the doors, and on the Tuesday following I found a partition that he was painting- I ordered him to desist, as it was mine; he said it was not, but he afterwards, before the Magistrate, said he bought them of my foreman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you any partner in this building? A. No; the prisoner is a master carpenter - he walked with me till I gave him in charge; the exterior of the doors was the same as they were before he took them.</p>

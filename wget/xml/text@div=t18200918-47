The Queen's carriage passed by, and there was a great rush, which carried everybody before it - at that instant I felt a violent snatch at my chain, I felt my watch rise in my fob, the chain broke or was cut, and the seal and key taken away. The prisoner was close to me at that moment, and he ran away as well as he was able, stooping down. I endeavoured to lay hold of the flap of his coat, but he slipped by me. I followed him about twenty yards, then seized him, and charged him with stealing my seal. I was within a yard and a half of him at the time. He said he had not got it. I shook him, and at that instant saw him fumbling about with his hands. I seized his hand, and the seal, key, and part of the chain dropped from it, I picked it up. He said he would not go with me. Several bad characters came round, and with the assistance of two persons I secured him. It was impossible any one but him could have done it. Some fellows behind him, said,</p>

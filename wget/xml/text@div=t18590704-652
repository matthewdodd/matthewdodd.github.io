I am servant to Mr. Ellis, a baker, at 55, Thread-needle-street—the back part of the house looks into Hercules-passage, and there is an entrance to it in the passage—part of the house is let to Mr. Johnson, a watch-maker—on 12th June, Whit-Sunday, I went down at 12 o'clock at night and fastened the street door leading into Hercules-passage—I then went up to bed—Susan Adams slept on the floor below me—I went to sleep for a little while—I was awoke by a noise down stairs like something dropping—I got up and came down one flight of stairs—I stood and listened for a little while—I heard a whispering in the house—I screamed out for the policeman through the window—I observed a man, standing on the leads over the street door, trying to make his escape, from the first floor window—the window was open—two or three policemen came up; after a time they</p>

I and Sheeren endeavoured to force open the door, but were not successful—I forced it open myself—I saw Stanley standing on the stairs in the house—soon after Middleton was brought in—I left the two prisoners in charge of some other officers and went up stairs—I went to Mr. Graves' room and there found this crowbar, this dark-lantern, which was alight at the time, this can of oil, and these two crowbar ends—these I found in Mr. Graves' office, directly over the shop of Mr. Johnson, jeweller—since the prisoners' commitment I have examined the door of Mr. Graves' room, and I find that the marks on the door cor<lb></lb>respond with the end of this crowbar—that door had unquestionably been forced from the outside, but that door is inside the house on the first floor—on searching Stanley I found this stock, which forms another crowbar, and the two ends which I found in Mr. Graves' office fit in this stock so as to make another crowbar—I also found on Stanley this centre-bit, which may be used for putting into the keyhole of an iron safe—here is also another thing, called a gully, another centre-bit, and a stock for a small key-hole; here is another end which fits in this stock, which may be used for cutting down—the gully is used to force a patent lock or make the hole larger—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Benetfink.</p>

               <p>hurt himself from the jump; it was a long way to jump—I searched him the station, and found on him this brace, made to screw in three parts; this part also fits the other part found on Stanley, which makes a brace for two persons to work at if required—since the commitment I have found that the hole here is used to fit three centre-bits that were found, to use as an anger—there is a breast-plate to rest the tool against while at work—I found that on Middleton, also three centre-bits to fit in a stock, and nine skeleton-keys.</p>

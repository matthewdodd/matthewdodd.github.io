                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright and coachwright, of Wharf-road, King's-cross—on 26th March, the prisoner came to me with another person, and I told him I would sell or let him a cab—he said that he had no money to purchase it then, but would hire it at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I said that if he liked to purchase it within two or three months for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the money that he paid should go towards the purchase; but I would not sell it to him upon any other condition—he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in advance, and told me not to let the cab to anybody else—he took it away on Wednesday or Thursday—it was part of the bargain that he was to pay a month in advance—a day or two after 28th March when the time was up, he came and paid me the other part of the money, and I gave him a book which mentioned that it was on hire—up to 6th June, I received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him for the cab—afterwards I went to the mews many times, and could not get my money—I saw the cab there on 9th July, and took it away—after that, the prisoner came and paid me 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for three weeks, but said nothing about purchasing it, though that was</p>

               <p>after the three months was over, and he said that he was going to receive some money from the country, and would come and pay me the greater part of the hire next Tuesday or Wednesday; upon that, I let him have it again upon the old terms—that was not with the option of purchasing, but at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a Week—though the three months were up, nothing was said about purchasing—I then could not find him for a long time, but on 12th September saw him at 19, sloane-square—nothing was paid to me after the second hiring—previous to that I said, "Where is the cab?"—he said, "What cab? I bought the cab of you"—I said, "You vagabond, what do you mean by that?"—he refused to tell me where it was—I had never sold it to him, and I understood that he was not going to buy it at all—I subsequently found it at Mr. Nichol's livery stable, Fulham-bridge-yard—it was not at McDonald's during the time the prisoner had the cab.</p>

I produce a bill of sale—I ordered it to be registered, and it is marked as such—I saw the prisoner sign it, and on its being executed I advanced him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cab was a portion of the security—it is in my broker's possession—Mr. Stephens has seen it since, and communicated with my clerk about it.

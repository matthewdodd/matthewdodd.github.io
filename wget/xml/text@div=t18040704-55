               <p>Court. Q. The girl laid hold of you, and you went into her house? - A. I did not go with the prisoner, I went with the other girl; it was in Old Pye-street, they wanted something to eat; I sent for some ham and some porter, and after that I sat down on a chair, and laid my arm on the table, and dropped into a bit of a dose, and the while I was in a dose, they undid the wrapper where the goods were in, and took all the goods out; when I awakened, I found all these goods gone, and they had left the wrapper behind; I had bought a pound of sugar and a quarter of a pound of tea for my wife; I had in my pocket twelve shillings and sixpence and a pocket handkerchief; they took that, and afterwards they locked me in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your property? - A. Some of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were pretty much in liquor? - A. I had been drinking, I found myself locked in; I pulled the door open, I was very much fatigued; loosing all my property, I went to Queen's-square, and got two officers to see after them; the officers proceeded after them, but they did not get them that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse this woman more than the other? - A. I do not, they were both together.</p>

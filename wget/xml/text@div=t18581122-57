                  </hi>. I am master of the brig <hi rend="italic">Thorn</hi>, which was lying in the Thames, off Milwall. On Sunday, 7th November, a little after 12, or on midnight of Saturday, I was walking towards Wapping to my ship, and met a man who offered to show me the way to it—he was a stranger to me—I followed him past the Thames Tunnel, and down a narrow passage—he said, "Come this way"—I saw a gas-lamp at the end of the passage, and, thinking I was not going the right way to the ship, I turned round and saw the prisoners behind me—they struck at me with their fists, and three more came up, laid hold of me by the coat, held me by my neck, and rifled my pockets of my <hi rend="italic">porte-monnaie</hi>—I then sang out, "Police! murder!"and they ran away, and in a little time the police came, when I was sitting on a door-step, being exhausted—the prisoners ran in one direction, and the three men in another—the prisoners went up a lane—I missed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, four sove<lb></lb>reigns, and my watch.</p>

I will take you off"—I got perhaps twenty yards down</p>

I brought out that morning—it was one of those notes that the butcher got—I asked the landlord for them, it might be half-an-hour afterwards—I was sitting inside his parlour having some drink—he refused to give them up to me till Mr. Waters came, and then he gave them to me—he did not say in my hearing that I was so drunk that he would not give them to me—I was not drunk—I do not know the landlord's name—I changed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at that public-house; I cannot exactly say what for—I had three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and two sovereigns—that was about 12 o'clock, and I was robbed at about a quarter past 12 at night—I was with my brother-in-law during those twelve hours, and I was at Mr. Waters' some time, and at Mr. Dower's, a grocer—I do not know how many public-houses I was in—I had never seen either of the prisoners before.</p>

I was at Green-Dank, Wapping, about tea or twelve yards from the place where the prosecutor says that he was robbed, and about half-past 12 or a quarter to 1, I heard money jinking, and saw three men counting some money under a lamp in King-street—Allen is one of them—he and another ran into a house, and the third ran away. I knocked at the door for some minutes, but it was bolted inside; a woman then came and opened it, and I saw Allen on the stairs—the woman said that he did not live there—I went up to the garret where the other prisoner was, but he escaped by the window—I did not see him, but I saw two go into the house—I took Allen, brought him down stairs, and the prosecutor identified him—he said that he knew nothing, about it and was innocent—I searched him, and found two sixpences, a fourpenny piece, and 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

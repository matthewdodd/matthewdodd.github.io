The prisoner came there to get some sheets for the binders - he came two or three times; on Saturday, the 15th of May, he brought a note from the bookbinders between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and brought back a sheet which he had had the day before - he turned to go out, and said he would call again; as he was going out I heard a rustling at the warehouse door - I followed, and found this bundle of paper on his shoulder: I had seen it in the office that day - he had not got above twelve yards from our warehouse - our door opens into the passage; I made him bring it back - he said he had picked it up in the passage as he was going out; this is it - it is what we call waste: it is worth 1l. 6s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not he say he was bringing it back? A. No - I tapped him on the shoulder, and told him to bring it back; I had been in the room where the paper was, but did not see it taken - there was only another person in that office.</p>

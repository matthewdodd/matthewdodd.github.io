               <p>Q. Did you lodge at the trunk maker's? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lock the money up at the trunk maker's? - I left the money at the trunk maker's, because the trunk maker's house was very near the house where I thought to move; the trunk maker did not know that I had left the money in the trunk, I had just bought the trunk, and left it at the trunk maker's, the trunk maker gave me leave.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your money? - In an hour after I left the money at the house</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come back again to examine the trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. Did you suppose that your money was very safe, when you left it at the trunk maker's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you return immediately almost to examine whether it was safe or not? - Because the landlord where I live, desired me to bring the trunk to his house, and said it would be very safe there.</p>
               <p>Court. Where, to the new or old lodgings? did you look into your trunk, and miss the money? - Yes; I went back to the shop, and the people of the house told me that the man at the bar had been to the trunk, and opened the trunk, and took something out.</p>
               <p>Q. And that led you to look? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner before? - Yes, I knew him a few days before; I happened to meet him, and he was my interpreter to many places where I went, and as I had the money in my pocket, he advised me to put the money in the trunk, as it was safer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see you put it in? - Yes, he was present, but I did what I could to put the money in the trunk without being seen by the prisoner, but I don't know whether the prisoner see me or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Who locked the shoes up? - The prosecutor, he pulled a parcel out of his pocket, and put it in the shoes, and he took the key; about half an hour after the prisoner came with two keys, as my mistress told me, I did not see him, I was called to take the key out of the trunk, and I took the key out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the same key that you sold with the trunk? - I did not take any notice about that, I was obliged to after the lock before I could get it out, I don't think it could be the same key. When I got it out, he went away.</p>

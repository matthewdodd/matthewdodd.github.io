               <p>ROBERT DUKE. On the 28th of February, I went with Bassett and Lloyd to Linton's premises, at Islingtongreen; I found about one hundred and fifty casks there, or more; I took away one barrel, one kilderkin, and two firkins - I took them to the Red Lion public-house, Islingtongreen, and saw them locked up in a coal-cellar - I desired that no person might have them but myself, or Lloyd; when we fetched them away, I found part of the head of the barrel, where the name had been, chipped off - I had made no alteration in it; one head was out when I found it at Linton's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Linton present when you took them away? A. Yes; I did not ask his leave.</p>

            . I am a cooper. On the 28th or 29th of February, the prisoner came to my shop, and told me to bring my tools; I went with him to the Red Lion, Islington-green; he went into the bar, and spoke to the landlord; the boy got the key, and went into the cellar - the casks were brought out to me in the skittle-ground; he told me to take the two little marks out - they were scratch marks; the same as we mark all our heads with - that makes the wood look clean; I never did a job for him before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at this cask, is it the one out of which you took two marks? A. It is; one head was out then; I asked him if it was his own; he said Yes, and told me to take them down to the shop, and cobble them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you know the cask by? A. By the top; I know no mark on it - I do not swear positively to it; I have known Linton twelve or fourteen years, but did no business for him; he did not ask me to do this privately.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What time of day was this? A. Between six and seven o'clock in the morning of the 29th of February - he said he had bought them.</p>

            . I am servant at the Red Lion. Paul had the same casks to cut as the officers brought - they brought three; Paul left them in the skittle-ground, and the officers fetched them from the ground; when the marks were cut out, the prisoner asked me to disguise the places where they had been cut out; I was to get some dirty water and mud, and put on it; he said he would give me 6d. - I did not do it; they were fetched away in two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you the key of the cellar? A. I got it from my master; he did not hesitate about giving it to me; I told him Linton wanted it - my master was not there when they were brought, and did not know of their being stolen.</p>

            . I am inspector to the brewers. I went to Linton's, on the 28th of February, with the officers; I saw this cask in the brewhouse; we took it to the public-house with others - there were about one hundred and fifty casks there with the names chipped out - there were about three hundred casks in all - this one was without a head; I went again on the 21st of March, and found the head in the brewhouse, under the same roof as the cask was - I produce it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Mr. Simpson's name on it? A. Yes; here is "Simpson, Lambeth," on the head - it was stowed away.</p>

            . I am a brewer, and live at Lambeth. I have lost a great many casks of all descriptions - I never sold one; this head belongs to the cask produced, and is mine; another mark on the other head has been partly scraped out - it is worth about 1l.</p>

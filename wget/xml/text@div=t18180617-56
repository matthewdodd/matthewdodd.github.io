On the 19th of May my husband was out in the afternoon - I was in the shop. I left the shop, and went down to the kitchen underneath - I had left the shop-door shut, and took the key with me; I thought I had locked it-there were watches in the window. In a few minutes I heard a noise in the shop, ran up, and found the prisoner coming out of the shop into the passage, with a silver watch in his hand. I stopped him, and asked him how he came by it? The street-door was always open. I asked him what business he had in the shop? he said he was coming in, and found it on the floor - I had seen it hanging on a hook in the window half an hour before; no person but myself had been in the shop. I held the prisoner; the neighbours came to my assistance. I took the watch from him, and gave him into the charge of Bennett. It is a silver watch, which came to be repaired-my husband made it about two years ago, and received 6l. for it. Bennett is not here. I saw the watch at Worship-street the same evening in his possession.</p>

No; when he was taken, he said he would make me any satisfaction for the loss of my goods; first he offered 1s. 2s. 3s. 4s. 5s. and then 10s.; I said I did not want any of his money, but I wanted my goods; at last he offered me a guinea; the constable said, you have not got a guinea; have not I, says he, and immediately pulled out a guinea, and clapped it down upon the shoes and boots in my shop; the officer desired me to take care of the guinea; he marked it, and I put it in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. It was dark, and the candles lit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was a stranger to you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. If you never lost fight of him, how came you not to observe what he did with the boot? - A. The man took my attention, and not what he had about him; he might have dropped it, or handed it to any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either you or the constable promise to let the prisoner go, if he gave you a guinea? - A. Neither.</p>

             sworn. - On the 24th of November I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw some people gathered together at the corner of Maddox-street; I went up, and found the prosecutor accusing the prisoner of stealing a boot; he said, he had seen him take it, and had never lost sight of him; I then said, I belonged to the Public Office, Bow-street, and he must go with me; the man very readily came with me; he said it was very hard he should be accused of stealing a boot that he was innocent of; the prosecutor said, he lived over the way; I took the man there, and the prosecutor searched to see whether he had lost a boot or no, and he said he had, but the prisoner had no boot upon him, or any thing of the sort; while the prosecutor was looking outside to see the situation of his boots, the prisoner talked about his family, and I said, perhaps the man might accommodate his temper bye and bye, and he might make it up; I called the prosecutor in from the door, and put the prisoner into a little shop that the prosecutor had, and left him there with the prosecutor and his man; I heard him offer something or other on account of his family, and he would not take it; the prisoner said, if he would make the other boot, he would leave a guinea till it was done; I said, my friend, I don't think you have got a guinea, you had better go before the Magistrate; he said, yes, he had got a guinea, and he threw it down upon the boots that were there; then I picked up the guinea, and said, I don't know what to make of the business; I desired the prosecutor to take the guinea, after I had marked it, which he did, and then I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When the prosecutor came back to the shop, he searched to see whether he had lost a boot or not? - A. Yes.</p>

            Then he was not certain whether he had lost a boot or not, till he had examined? - A. I cannot say as to that`.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This gentleman charged me with stealing a boot; I told him if I had stolen a boot, I must certainly have it about me; I know no more of it than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was the number of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100113"></xptr>policeman? A. I did not take notice of his number - I saw he had the police dress on, the blue coat - I know the police dress, and that was the dress he had on; that I am sure of - there was a linkman there, and he is here now- he had an opportunity of seeing what dress the policeman had on - Ellis did not give the shoes up to the prisoner at first - but he took hold of the toes, and Ellis had the heels - he took them at last - there was only Ellis, I, the linkman, and the prisoner there - I had gone to carry things to the ball with Ellis - I had a box on my head - my master's name was on the box - on the Saturday night afterwards, I was putting up my master's shutters, and saw the prisoner go past - my master went after him, and brought him back - my master questioned him, and he then went away - he was not detained then - it was about half-past ten o'clock - I had gone up to bed, after my master went after the prisoner, and was called down when the prisoner came.</p>
               <p>JOHN ELLIS. I am in the employ of Mr Partington.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure he said you had better mind what you said? A. Yes - I do not know what his number was - I did not think to take his number at the time - he had such a coat on as the policemen wear, but I did not take notice of the colour - I thought it was between a blue and a black - it was a great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you tell the magistrate it was a blue coat? A. No; I have no recollection of it - I might have said so - I did not see that he had a cape on - I will not swear whether he had one on - I know a policeman's cape - I do not think he had one on - I did not see it - I will not swear he had not one on - I did not notice whether he had an armlet on - I did not notice whether he had a lantern - I said before the magistrate that there were two linkmen there, and I thought there were - I had a box on my head with seven dozen of plates inside - my master's name was not on the box - the prisoner was brought to my master's on the Saturday night, and then let go - I saw him afterwards at the office.</p>

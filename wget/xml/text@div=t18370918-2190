                  </hi>. I am in the service of Edward Marlow, a farmer, living in the Green-lane, Islington. On Thursday, the 7th of September, I was driving my master's wagon—I left it about three o'clock in the afternoon, opposite the Lock and Key, Smithfield—there was a cart-cloth and two ropes in it—I went into the house, and remained there about ten minutes—when I returned my wagon was gone—I found it again about six o'clock the same evening in St. John's-square—nobody was with it—the cart-cloth and rope were missing—about an hour afterwards</p>

               <p>Brown was pointed out to me—I found the rope upon him that I missed out of the wagon—he said he had bought it of two men for a pot of beer I told him to come along with me and look for them, and gave charge of him to the first policeman—as we were taking him to the station-house, he said if we would go along with him he would find the man that had the cart-cloth—we went along with him—he mentioned no one—I did not know Ward before—I saw him at the Northumberland Arms—the policeman had him in charge about eight o'clock in the evening—I told him that I wanted my cloth—he would not tell us about it for some time, and then he told us he had sold it to Henry North—I went to North's house with two policemen, and Brown and Ward—I did not go into the house—I remained outside—the policeman came out and brought the cart-cloth that I was entrusted with—North, Brown, and Ward, were then taken to the station-house—the value of the cloth was about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the rope about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my master's name is on the cart-cloth in four places.</p>

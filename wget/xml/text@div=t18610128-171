                  </hi>. I manage an hotel at Ryde, in the Isle of Wight—in 1859, I was a commercial traveller—I met the prisoner at Southampton in March of that year—in April I was staying at the White Hart hotel, at Bristol—I was ill from the' 1st to 29th April—during that time, I was seized with temporary blindness—the prisoner accompanied me to Bristol from Exeter—he staid there a short time, and then left—he returned in rather less than a fortnight—at that time, he visited me on several occasions in my bedroom—I believe my watch, chain, and snuff-box were on the dressing-table</p>

               <p>in my bedroom at that time—this is my box—I bad it when I was laid up there—my ledger was not there at the time; it was sent four days after I was laid up—I can't say whether it was there when the prisoner returned the second time—I was about to go on the Wales journey at that time—I remember the prisoner leaving the second time—I did not miss my watch and chain and box, till 28th April—I was still at the inn—it was when I had slightly recovered my sight—I had got a little sight, after having lost it—I wrote to the prisoner the day we were starting from Bristol to the Isle of Wight—I had never given him leave to take my box—I believe 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the price paid for it—this letter is in the prisoner's hand writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated Manchester, June</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1859, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to the prosecutor, stating that he intended to hand him the accounts he had received, as soon as he could make up the amount, together with his watch and chain</hi>)—The gold watch and chain was worth 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this letter is also in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated Liverpool, June</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1859, <hi rend="italic">assuring him that the watch and chain were perfectly safe, and that the first</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">he could get, should be sent for it</hi>)—I never saw the prisoner again until he was at the Mansion-house—this is another letter of his—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated Carlisle, September 9th, 1859, assuring the prosecutor that the watch and chain had that night been sent off, and on receipt of an acknowledgment of the same, the box should be forwarded</hi>)—I never received either the box, watch, or chain—on recovering my sight, I tried to find the prisoner, on several occasions, but did not meet with him till he was at the police-court.</p>

               <p>wear that watch and chain, in order that he might cut a respectable figure—I did not know that he bad been wearing them before 1 left the hotel at Bristol—Mr. Smith did not to my recollection say to me, "Why, Sivier, Tite is a great <hi rend="italic">swell</hi>, wearing your jewellery"—I never heard him say so—I can swear that he did not say so, not to me—I never heard him make use of any such observation, not to me or in my hearing—my father is not here, be is at home at Ryde—while my father was at Bristol, he, the defendant, and myself dined together.</p>

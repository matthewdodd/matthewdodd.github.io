               <p>Ann Peterson. Last Saturday was Seven-night, between 7 and 8 in the Morning, Mary Elizabeth Homls came to me in <placeName id="t17320223-1-crimeloc4">Leadenhall-Market</placeName>

But pray look, says she, and so I did; but I could not find one single brass Farthing, for my Money was all gone. Well, says she, come along with me, and I'll shew the Woman that took it; and so she brought me to the Prisoner, and laid hold on her. The Prisoner had got the Money in her Hand, and went to put it into my Pocket again; but Holms would not let her, though I would fain have had my Money again.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it your own Money?</p>
               <p>Peterson. It was Money that I had borrow'd to go to Market with, there were 4 half Crowns, and the rest in Shillings and Six-pences; and so Mrs. Holms brought her before Mr. Basset the Constable, and put the Money into his Hands, and then we went before Sir

            . As I was sitting at the Rose and Crown Door in the Market, I saw the Prisoner hassle up to the Prosecutor and pick her Pocket, so I goes to the Prosecutor, and old Gentlewoman, says I, what Money have ye got? Why, 17 s. and 6 d. says she; but when she felt in her Pocket she found it was empty, and with that I goes up to the Prisoner (for I kept her in my Eye all the while) you bold Bitch, says I (for I did call her Bitch, my Lord, that's true) you have pick'd this good Woman's Pocket; I pick'd her Pocket

            , says she again, if ye speak such another Word, I'll make an Example of ye, and presently she took up the Prosecutor's Apron, and was going to put the Money into her Pocket again; but I would not let her, so I catch'd hold of her Hand, and took the Money out of it, there were 4 half Crowns, and the rest were Shillings and Six pences, which in all, made just 17s. the old Woman said, there should be 6 d. more, but whether or no that drop'd in the Struggle, or what became of it I can't tell. But I Bitch'd up the Prisoner again pretty handsomely, and brought her to the Constable; I had watch'd her several Days, because I thought she was a Pick pocket; and, I said, that the first time I catch'd her, I would have her prosecuted, or else I would prosecute them that made it up. A couple of Men came to me to Day, and they said they came from the Prisoner, and they offer'd me ten Guineas not to appear against her.</p>

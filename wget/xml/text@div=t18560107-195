                  </hi>. I am second master at the Philological school, New-road. On Sunday afternoon, 1st July, I was in Hyde-park; I was there till between 3 and 4 o'clock—I think it might have been 4 before I left—I remember being near the railings of the drive, on the north side, the grass side, near the east end of the Serpentine—there were a great many police in the drive, some arranged in single file close to the railings on both sides; and also bodies of police in different places in the centre, standing irregularly—there was a crowd along the side of the railing for a long way—I was at first behind the crowd—I saw parties of the police rush towards the crowd, and order them away from the railing; they seemed to me prin<lb></lb>cipally to stoop and come under the railing—the crowd behind, as soon as they saw the police moving in their direction, prepared to run away up into the grass—on one of those occasions, as the crowd settled back again, I happened to get down to the railings in front of the crowd—I was told by a policeman to stand back—I said it would be impossible to stand back while there was such a crowd behind me; that man seemed to think I was perfectly justified in saying so, and passed on—I also said it would be better to request the persons behind to stand back, and then those in front would be able to move back from the railing—the next policeman in this single line by the railing then spoke to me, and a gentleman who was standing with me—he spoke rather roughly, and said, "You must stand back;" and pushed at my friend with his staff—we then made a united effort to stand a little way from the railing, trying to push back the persons behind us—I said to my friend, "What can be the objection to standing with one's arm on the railing, when there is a crowd of people for half a mile doing the same?"—upon my saying that, or some words to that effect, a policeman that I had noticed before among those who stood in the centre of the roadway, called out, "Is not he satisfied?" and turning round to those that were standing near, he said, "Come on"—they then rushed in the direction where I was standing, and getting under the rail, or over it, in whatever way they could, they seized hold of me; the one who had called out to the others, caught me by the collar, and struck me on the arm with his truncheon—others seized me on the other side, and one by the collar at the back of the neck, and at the same time struck me several blows—the blows which I first felt were those on the arms—as soon as possible I said, "What is it for?"—they pulled me about, tore my coat open, and tore my waist<lb></lb>coat, and I received several blows on the back and shoulders—the man who said, "Is he not satisfied?" was D 20—the defendant is the man—I have seen him since, and recognised him in the street—it was the same man that said, "Come on"—he said it instantaneously, "Is not he satisfied? come on;" and it was the same man that first struck me with a truncheon—he was the first who collared me, and the first who struck me—he made no charge against me whatever—he did not take me into custody—as soon as they had struck me they let me go—I called out to 20 D, "20 D, I shall remember you, I shall remember your number"—he shook his staff at me, and mimicked my voice, and said, "Ah!" very angrily, because I had called out his number—there was a gentleman named Horton present at the time, among a great many others—he gave me his address, and wrote down the number of the policeman on the same piece of paper—that was immediately after the police left, in the Park, there and then—I have not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070066"></xptr>
               <p>got that piece of paper now, I thought thisaffair was all over after the com<lb></lb>mittee of inquiry, after I had been before the Commissioners, and so all the papers I had have been destroyed—it was only by accident that I heard of Mr. Horton again, or I should have had no witness—I left the Park within a very few minutes after—I suffered very much from the blows that I received on the arms, and back, and spine, and shoulders—some days afterwards I was in Wigmore-street, with a friend, a clergyman named Randall, and saw the defendant standing at the comer of Marylebone-lane, talking to some one—when I was within about fifteen or twenty yards of him, I said to my friend, "That is the man that struck me in the Park"—I then went up to the defendant, and walked round him to see his full face, and his number, and when I came on the pavement again, he said, "Do you want me?"—I said, "No, I do not"—he made some allusion to my looking at him—I said, "I suppose it is not illegal to look at you," or something of that sort—he then became very abusive, and said something to my friend for walk<lb></lb>ing round him; he spoke in a loud voice, so as to draw a considerable crowd—I said, "I hope you are not going to strike me again, as you did last Sun<lb></lb>day, with your truncheon"—he said, "I never saw you before;" and then in speaking to Mr. Randall, he said that he had walked round him also—Mr. Randall told him that what he said was untrue, or false, and that he was a clergyman—I took no part with those who were making a disturb<lb></lb>ance in the Park on 1st July—I usually go into Hyde-park on a Sunday afternoon, and that afternoon as I saw there was a crowd near the road, I went towards the Serpentine, towards Kensington-gardens.</p>

On Sunday, let July, I was on duty in the carriage drive, in the Park, near the east end of the Serpentine, to and fro, some distance on this side, and some distance up the Serpentine in the drive—I know the receiving house of the Royal Humane Society—it was right at this end of the Serpentine where I went, not near the receiving house at all—I was under the direction of superintendent Hughes, and Bewlay was my sergeant—we went into the carriage drive about half past 2 o'clock—I remained there till somewhere about 5 o'clock, as near as I can guess, when I left to go with a prisoner to Vine-street—I took a prisoner into custody for throwing stones, and took him away to Vine-street station, along with another constable—with that exception, I remained in the car<lb></lb>riage drive the whole of the time—my duty was in the carriage drive—I cannot exactly say how far I moved up and down, somewhere about twenty yards—we were posted to keep the carriage drive clear near the end of the Serpentine, a little distance this side, and a little distance up towards the receiving house—we were across the crossing—I looked to Bewlay for orders during the day—I kept my eye upon him the whole of the time, in case he should have orders to give me—I saw him once on his face on the ground, with his face towards the Serpentine—as near as I could judge, that was somewhere about a quarter past 4 o'clock—he was in the drive—I saw the head of a wooden hurdle lying by his side, on the ground—it was about a foot and a half or two feet long, and about a span round—I should not like to have had a blow with it—I went to him, and asked him what was the matter—he told me he had been knocked down by that piece of wood—after he got up he looked round, and said, "There is a man making his way</p>

               <p>through the crowd; I have no doubt that is the man that threw it"—he crossed the carriage drive (he was on the side near the Serpentine), and got over the rails—he attempted to get through the crowd, by putting his arm over the people's heads, with his staff in his hand, but he was unable to do so, the crowd pressed him back against the rails; he came into the drive again—he never left the carriage drive on any other occasion during the afternoon but that once, and during that time he was not out of my sight at all—he had no power to get away—I cannot say exactly how many men were under him; about ten, twelve, or fourteen, I think—I never saw him make a blow at any one, but whether his staff hit any one after he got over the rails, I would not swear—that was after he was knocked down—he never left my sight at all, he was not able to proceed any distance from the rails, not above two yards—he was forced back immediately by the crowd and the spectators that were there.</p>

On 1st July I was in Hyde-park for about three hours, and saw stones thrown at the police—I saw the mob with stones in their hands, and there was a great deal of shouting and hooting; they were attempting to frighten the horses as they came down the drive, and they succeeded in doing so—I have known Bewlay twelve years, and always as a discreet constable, acting with temper and mildness—I saw him in the drive that afternoon, but cannot say whether I had him in my eye every minute of the time—his clothes were dirty, as if he had been on the ground, and from that time up to half past 5 o'clock I might have lost sight of him, but only for a minute or two—after that time he did not use his staff about the person of any one; if he had done so, and had had a conversation which had lasted three or four minutes, I must have missed him, but I do not think I missed him for so long, as he was in the habit of passing with his men where I was standing—if he had said, "Come on, then," or any<lb></lb>thing of that kind, I think I must have heard it—the stones were thrown from the north side of the drive—I was not examined before the Commis<lb></lb>sioners, but I read the report in the newspaper, and believing Bewlay was not the man, thought it my duty to come forward on his behalf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of No. 54, East-street, Man<lb></lb>chester-square. On this Sunday I was in the Park—I saw Bewlay there, walking up and down, and clearing the drive—he appeared to be in com<lb></lb>mand of ten or a dozen men, who were patrolled from the crossing at the east end of the Serpentine to sixty or seventy yards away from it—I saw him knocked down, I suppose it was with a portion of a hurdle; it was a log of wood seventeen or eighteen inches long—I saw him attempt to get into the Park after the person who did it, and he was forced back into the drive—I remained till nearly 6 o'clock—Bewlay did not leave the drive while I remained there; if he had struck any one with his staff, or remained in con<lb></lb>versation with a person two or three minutes, I should have seen him—he did not do so—I read the report of the Commissioners about Bewlay in a newspaper, and came forward in consequence—I have known Bewlay up<lb></lb>wards of five years, in his capacity of a police officer; he performed duty often at many public places—I have seen him in that capacity, and never</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070075"></xptr>
               <p>saw him exceed his duty, or use any violence—I have known him nearly six years, and therefore have no doubt that the man I have spoken of was Bewlay.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector D.</hi>) On 1st July, I went into Hyde-park, on duty, about a quarter past 1 o'clock, and remained till 10 o'clock at night—the crowd began to assemble rather before 3 o'clock; and in the next two or three hours upwards of 50,000 persons assembled—the part of the Park between the east end of the Serpentine and the Park keeper's lodge, near the receiving house, was very much crowded—the mob was very riot<lb></lb>ous indeed for some hours, and a great number of stones and pieces of wood were thrown at the police; and the hurdles which mark the roadway were broken up and thrown at the police—upwards of thirty of my detachment were injured, and seventy odd, thieves taken—there was a pretty good sprinkling of thieves in the mob—the horses were being frightened by the mob on either side—Bewlay was a sergeant under me—I do not know a man of better temper, or of greater control—he has been speci<lb></lb>ally employed on many occasions in matters where temper and self<lb></lb>control are extremely desirable, where mobs are collected, and there is likely to be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I saw him at intervals during the whole of that afternoon; I may have lost eight of him for ten minutes at a time—I never saw him commit any act of violence—while I had my eye on him, he conducted himself with good temper and judgment—we were obliged to dear the drive at first to prevent the horses being frightened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of No. 14, Grove End-road, St. John's Wood. On 1st July, from 4 to 6 o'clock, I was on the north side of the drive, Hyde-park—I remember seeing Mr. Floyd there, per<lb></lb>fectly well—the police were walking up and down at that part of the drive, and I heard two of them request Mr. Floyd to move—the first one spoke in a good tempered, civil tone, and told him to stand beck from the rails—he was on the Park aide of the rails, the north side of the drive—the next one used similar words, but in a rough, sharp voice—Mr. Floyd said that he could not got back, for the crowd was so thick behind him, and I believe he made a similar remark to the second one—he was there before I arrived</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070076"></xptr>
               <p>but there was a large crowd behind and on all sides of him; he was in the front rank—after that an attempt was made to force those people back from the railings—I did not see Mr. Floyd struck—I firmly believe that Bewlay was not one of the constables who made a rush at that time—I went to the Court as a matter of curiosity, and recognised Mr. Floyd there—I told him I had seen him on 1st July, in the Park, and had heard the remark made by the first policeman, and had afterwards seen them rush under the rails, and drive him and others back, but with regard to identi<lb></lb>fying the policeman who attacked him I told the Recorder I could not do it.</p>

            . I am foreman to Messrs. Lucock and Fryet, who are pawnbrokers, and live in Whitecross-street. On the 12th of November the prisoner, Jones, pledged a watch for 12 s., in the name of Davis - I did not know him before, but am certain he is the person. I described him to the officer; the officer brought him to me to know if he was the man - he said he did not pawn it. I afterwards heard him say a man, who appeared to be a butcher, gave him 2 s. to pawn it.</p>

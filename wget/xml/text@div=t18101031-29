            . On the first of October, about seven o'clock in the morning, my landlady gave me information of the robbery. On my going across East Smithfield, the prisoner accosted me to go to drink with him, I had seen him once before, which I refused; he pressed me, and then I went with him to the Bee-hive, Nightingale-lane, this was about a quarter past eight; he there produced a duplicate of a silver watch, for one pound ten shillings, pledged at Mr. Watt's; he told me that he had been and pledged it. He wanted me to stay away from my duty to eat beef steaks and onions with him, he would pay all expences, I told him I could not do that. I went to the London Docks, and he went with me; I prevailed upon him to leave me, he did. When I had done my duty, I went to my landlady, and told her what had transpired, and in consequence of my landlady's advice, I went into the Three Crowns; I told the prosecutor of this. The prisoner shewed me one pound six and four-pence, as part of the one pound ten. We saw the watch that night.</p>

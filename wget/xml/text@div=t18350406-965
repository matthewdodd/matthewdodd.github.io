                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at West Moulsley. I recollect, in last May, seeing a man with a black horse, it was the first day of Epsom races—he went by the name of Sweeney, at Moulsely—I have heard him called by the name of Green—he put up at the Traveller's Friend, close to my house, kept by William Eggleton.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Traveller's Friend public-house, at West Moulsley. I recollect, about the latter end of May, two men and two horses putting up at my house—it was the first day of Epsom races—the first man had a black horse—we called him Sweeney—he lived just out of our village—some call him Green—I do not know rightly which is his name—I went to the races to take some things—when I came home at night, he was there—I went again to the races next morning, and never saw the other man afterwards—I saw Green afterwards—he took the horses away—I do not know who the other man was—Green left my house dur<lb></lb>ing my absence, and took away both horses—I do not know what has be<lb></lb>come</p>

               <p>of him—I saw the same black horse as he took from my house at Sydenham, last Saturday—the 10th of June was the last time he was at my house—I went with Verey, and saw it in a meadow at Sydenham—I do not know whose meadow it was—he showed me the same black horse that I saw at my house on the 10th of June, but it, has been greatly dis<lb></lb>figured since.</p>

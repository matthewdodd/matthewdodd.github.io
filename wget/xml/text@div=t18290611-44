               <p>MR. WHEELER. This is not the bag the purse was in, but it belongs to Miss Clarke, my wife's sister - my wife's bag and money were taken from behind her pillow; this coat and table spoons are mine, and all these things are Mrs. Wheeler's.</p>
               <p>ELLEN CLARKE. I was on a visit at Mr. Wheeler's. This tippet and bag are mine; the bag contained a green purse, with three sovereigns in it, when it was taken - I saw it safe the day before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence) written.) I was taken up for robbing my master of sundry articles of wearing-apparel, and some silver spoons; they have got down in my indictment that I had robbed them of some china and glasses; I know nothing about the under-mentioned articles: the purse I picked up in the dusthole when first I went to live there; I went up-stairs to my mistress, as she sat in the back-parlour, and told her I had picked it out of the dust-hole; she said that it was one that Master George had been playing with, and that it was of no value; I put it into my pocket. The first week that I went there I had a great deal of cleaning, and in the coal-hole I found a great many broken glasses, likewise in the beer-cellar a quantity of broken glasses, which I suppose the servant that lived there before had broken, and put them there; she told me to clean underneath the stairs, for there were some childrens shoes, and boots of my master's. I then found some more broken glass, and likewise china; I said to my mistress,"There is a great many broken pieces," which she saw; she said if she kept her other servant much longer, she would be the ruin of her, as she was such a careless servant. I asked her for an inventory of the glasses and china, but she put me off from day to day. I went to the mangling-woman, and told her what I had done to my master; she told me never to mind, not to go back, and she sent part of the articles which I robbed my master of: if it had not been for her, I should have gone back and delivered myself up to my master. My husband has abandoned me, and that was the occasion of my going to service. I have worked hard for my bread.</p>

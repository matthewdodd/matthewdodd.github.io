                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on Thursday, the 9th of February, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, and saw both the prisoners in company together—they passed by me in the City-road—they were about two hundred yards from Mrs. Greening's house—I had occasion to pass Greening's house a very few minutes after, and found the shed-Door open—it was about four o'clock—I called of the inmates—Mrs. Greening came first—I noticed about five tiles taken off one end of the roof of the shed, which was very low—it is a continuation of the roof of the dwelling-house—the whole family were called up—in consequence of information from Mrs. Greening, I and her son Adam searched the premises—we went over some gardens adjoining her field, and, after a long search, we heard a cock crowing—we went to the place the sound came from, and found two hens in one privy, and two hens and a cock in the next privy—the privies were the length of the field from Greening's house—Adam Greening took possession of the fowls—I afterwards received them from him, and kept possesion of them—in the first privy, where I found the two hens, I found this piece of list, and when the prisoners were apprehended I saw some list, found in Cockett's pocket—that was about three quarters of an hour after I left the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent to Greening's house by the inspector about twenty minutes to six o'clock—I found Sergeant Dubois, Adam Greening, and Fearne there—Dubois pointed out two privies to me—I went to them, and stopped there till twenty minutes past six o'clock, and saw Yarroll come down a passage from Shepherdess-walk—he had a bag under his arm—he came to within a yard or two of where I was standing—he looked round, and in a minute or so he went back up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183702270006"></xptr>
               <p>the passage, and I heard him say, "Come on, it is all right"—I saw Cockett and Yanroll return past where I was concealed—a short distance down the passage there is a door leading to some gardens, through which they passed and came into the yard where I was—the prisoner Yarroll went to one of the privies Duhois had showed me and opened the door—I heard one of them say, "They are gone"—they then separated, and I made my appearance—I attempted to lay hold of Cockett, and we scuffled—he endeavoured to get away—in the scuffle his hat fell off, and I saw this handkerchief drop from the hat, wet—I took it up and put it into my pocket—I took Cockett to Greening's house, and Fearne joined me in a few minutes, having Yarroll—we took them to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police officer.

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister. I know the policeman Fearne—he said to me that he should keep a tight hold of this job, and he would not be <hi rend="italic">humbugged</hi> as he was before—he said it in my father's shop, in the presence of my mother and several more—my sister-in-law had been to see if she could speak to the identity of some persons.</p>

I have known Yar<lb></lb>roll nine months—I have frequently driven the fowls out of my premises, and also once out of my own water-closet—that was the very morning the prisoners were committed, about ten minutes or a quarter to seven o'clock—my next door neighbour's wife saw it, I believe, and Spencer—the pri<lb></lb>soner has borne an honest character.</p>

I have seen the prosecutor's fowls frequently in my yard, and have driven them from it several times—I dare say fifty times within the two years and a half I have lived there—Yarroll bore an honest character—I have frequently been in com<lb></lb>pany with him.</p>

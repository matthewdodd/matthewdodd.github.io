                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, at 28, Poland Street, Oxford Street—on 15th August, about 8. o'clock p.m., I was at Harrow Green, Leytonstone—I had a little boy in my arms, and was about to enter a tramway car—I had a Geneva watch in my pocket at. that time attached to this chain—I saw the prisoner between me and the car, as I was about to enter, and a woman with a child in her arms was standing on my left side—my hat was knocked off from behind, and I directly felt my watch leave my pocket—the prisoner was as close as he could possibly be to. me then—I turned round and caught hold of him as he tried, to leave the crowd—I saw a constable close behind me, and I gave him in charge—as he was taking him to the station, the woman with the child came to me and said "For God's sake don't prosecute him"—the prisoner could hear that, as we were close behind—she repeated that two or three times, and said "If you don't prosecute him I will get your watch back, he has. not got it"—I said "No, he has not, but he stole it" she went to the pavement and. brought, the watch back to me—the ring which attached it the chain was off then—I charged the prisoner at the station with stealing the watch—he pretended to cry and made a great fuss, and asked me to let him off—I told the policeman about the woman returning the watch, and went out in search of her but could not find her, and when I went back to the station, I said to the prisoner "Is that woman your wife?"—he said "No"—I said "I suppose it is a woman you are living with?"—and he said "Yes."</p>

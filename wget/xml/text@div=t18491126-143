                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Stratford. I knew the prisoner in the service of Miss Hagg, where the prosecutor, Mr. William Postlethwaite, resides—I know that he lost his guard-chain—I heard that the prisoner was seen with one; I communicated it to him, and he requested me to see after it—I waited on the prisoner two days afterwards, at the residence of her uncle—I asked her for the guard-chain—she denied it at first, hut afterwards she said she had parted with the chain—I said, "You will have no objection to tell me where you parted with it?"—she said to a young man—she went up-stairs to her uncle, and he brought down the duplicate—I took it home to Mr. Postlethwaite; he is not here; he is ill, and not able to-attend—I have this certificate from another surgeon—this is Mr. Postlethwaite's chain; he identified it, and gave his deposition—I saw him this morning, and it is impossible for him to come here—(the <hi rend="italic">deposition teas here read</hi>—" William Postlethwaite, on his oath, saith: 'I reside at 3, High-street, Stratford. I am lodging with Miss Hagg. The prisoner was servant in the house. On the 4th inst. I missed a gold watch-chain from a drawer in my bed-room; I had seen it a week before; this is it. I never gave the prisoner the chain, or any authority to pawn it.")</p>

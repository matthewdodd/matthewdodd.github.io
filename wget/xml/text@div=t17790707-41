When we came there, we knocked at the door; no body came; we knocked harder; we found we could not get in without breaking it open; I think my brother got in first; we found a quantity of half-pence, part in papers, and part loose. In the cellar we found a cutting engine, and a large stamping engine; there was a candle burning, and the dies which were in the engine were warm. There was a large quantity (I suppose half a bushel) of halfpence; beside the engine, several of the halfpence were warm. On the Britannia side of the halfpenny, there is a little slaw upon the die, which flaw is almost upon all the halfpence struck with it. The moment we were getting into the house, there was an alarm, that a man was on the top of the house; there was a trap door at the top of the house. When he was taken to the Counter, I found these pieces of lead ( producing them) with the impression of a halfpenny upon them; the use of them is to try whether the dies are set perpendicular and true.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing else in the house? - Yes; materials to take the colour of the half-pence, brimstone and those kind of things.</p>
               <p>Did you find any sheets of copper? - Several, besides secil.</p>

               <p>Look at those halfpence; are they counterfeits? - Yes; those leaden dumps are what they set the dies by to see that they are exact, otherwise one side will be thicker than the other; the rest of the things are what are used in coining.</p>

               <p>In the articles there is mention made of necessary and leather, what is meant by leather? - It appears by the evidence that has been given here for nine years past that it means copper.</p>

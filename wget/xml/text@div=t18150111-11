               <p>Q. Did you loose any stockings from your shop on the third of this month - A. I did ten pair of worsted stockings on the third of January. About five o'clock the prisoner came to my shop, I was in my room at tea, he did not come in the shop he was on the sell of the door scuffling with John Brown; I came to the door, and saw them scuffling on the pavement. I can prove my property.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a smith at Brentford, on the 3rd of January about five o'clock I saw the prisoner on the threshold of Mr. Ride's door; he was reaching this bundle of stockinge from the window board. I saw him take his hand away from the window board and the stockings in his hand; no one being in the shop. I supposed he had stolen them; I took the stocking' from him; I called Ride, I threw the stockings down in the shop, and caught hold of the prisoner's great coat tail, he attempted to throw off his great coat, and ran away from me; I closed with him, and threw him down, and at that time Mr. Ride came to my assistance, I delivered him into his hands; we took him to the constable's house that night, and took him before the magistrate the next morning. The prisoner said I pushed him up against the window.</p>

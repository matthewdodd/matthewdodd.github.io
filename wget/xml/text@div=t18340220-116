               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you a watch? A. Yes; I had left it at home - I did not intend to get drunk when I went out - I had been drinking at a wine-vaults the other side of Seven Dials - I went there with a friend named Gower, and parted with him in Smithfield - I suppose I left the wine-vaults about twelve o'clock - I went there between ten and eleven - I swear it was after ten - we had three or four glasses of brandy and water, two pints of ale, and some supper; nothing more - I did not pay for it - my friend paid 3s. 6d. for his share and mine - there was three of us in company - I cannot swear whether we had three or four glasses of brandy and water - it was drank among three, and three pints of ale; nothing else - we had been nowhere else before we went there - I had been to Shoreditch, to Grower's house - he is a weight and scale maker - I drank nothing except three or four glasses of brandy and water, and three pints of ale - not at that house, I do not know about that night - I might have had a pint of ale in the course of the evening, but not before I got there - we had had one pint of ale between me and Grower.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say just now that before you got there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200073"></xptr>you had not? A. Perhaps I might; but I did not exactly call to my recollection at the moment, that we had a pint of ale at the Pitt's Head, going along the road - I was not five minutes in the Pitt's Head - I had been to no other public-house before we went to the wine-vaults - that is nearly two miles from the Pitt's Head - I did not set out intending to go to the wine-vaults - my friend asked me to walk with him to the other side of St. Giles's church.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you will recollect whether you had been talking to a woman - do you recollect the lady you had been talking to?</p>
               <p>A. No; I was talking to a woman of the town in Long-lane - that might be a mile and a half from the wine-vaults - she was standing, and I went and spoke to her - I was not quite sober - I drank nothing more than I have said - what I drank bewildered me - I might have talked to more than one woman, for what I know - as I go along I am free for everybody - I do not think anything of it.</p>

            . I am superintendant of St. Sepulchre's watch-house. On the 7th of July, about eleven o'clock at night, I was on duty in Smithfield. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and hastened to the spot, and found the prisoner in the custody of Rice, a watchman, who is not here - Pemberton said, he has tendered a forged 1 l. note to me, the prisoner appeared alarmed, and said, what is the matter, I have done nothing; I took him to the watch-house, Pemberton gave me the note, after having marked his name on it; I am sure it is the note he gave me - he said the prisoner gave his address, No. 54, Aldersgate-street, which I wrote on myself - I asked the prisoner his address, he said, No. 1. Wright's-Buildings, West-street, Smithfield, which I also wrote on it. Hare, the officer of the night, also put his name on it - I took it to the inspector of the Bank on Monday morning (Mr. Lees), I gave it to him - I asked how he became possessed of the note; he, at first, said he did not know, but on pressing him, he said he took it in the way of trade, of some person at Highgate, who he did not know, and he was a general hawker - I went to No. 54, Aldersgate-street, but they knew nothing of him; thirty-one shillings and seven pence halfpenny was found on him in silver and copper.</p>

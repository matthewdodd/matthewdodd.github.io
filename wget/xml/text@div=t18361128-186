                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Lindsey, who keeps a general shop at Lewisham. The prisoner was in our service for eight months—she used to dress in the top room—I had occasion to go up there, and found an article which ought not to be there—I called her up, and pointed out a large tooth comb, a small tooth comb, and hair brush—they are things which we sell—I asked her whose they were—she said they were her own, and she had bought them at London—I pointed out our shop mark on the brush—I sent for Mr. Barham the constable, and all the articles stated were found in a box which I had lent her—she had the key, but it was not locked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Lewisham. I produce the ar<lb></lb>ticles stated in the indictment—the prisoner slept in the kitchen, but dressed in the room up stairs—I found all the things in the box except the stockings which Mrs. Lindsey found in the bed, and the brush and combs—the stocking are old and very much darned.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the prisoner present when you found them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—as I was going along with her, she said the shop had been under great alterations, and there was great confusion in moving the things out, and a quantity of things had been taken up to the room; that her mistress sent her up for a basket, and these things being in it, in her hurry to take</p>

               <p>the basket down, she shot the things out of the basket into the box—there was only one article of wearing apparel covering the aritcles, and the box was not locked—on moving the first article, these things could be seen—I believe the shop was then finished.</p>

                  </hi>. I went into Mrs. Lindsey's house to order some things—Mrs. Lindsey said she had found out that her servant had robbed her—the prisoner was in the parlour, cleaning it, and could hear what passed—Mrs. Lindsey asked me to go up stairs to search her box—she called to the prisoner, and said, "We are going up, Susan, to search your box"—she said, "You are quite at liberty to do that"—we went up, and she said, "Now, Susan, let me look at your box"—she first produced a box with some rags in it—her mistress said, "Have not you another box, which I lent you?"—she produced it, and her mistress said, "Now, open that"—she opened it, and a pocket fell out—she said, "Now, take out the rest of the things"—she took out her gown, and the needles and pins fell out, and at the bottom were all the other things—the knives were loose, not in paper—they did not appear to have been used—we locked the door and came down—the officer was sent for; and after he had taken out all the things, her mistress said, "I suspect the comb you have in your head is the one I have lost"—she took off her cap, pulled it out of her hair, and said, "Yes it is"—when we were up stairs, and had found all the things I said, "Susan, you have done a very bad thing"—she wrung her hands and said she did not know what possessed her to do what she had done.</p>

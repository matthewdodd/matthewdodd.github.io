On the afternoon of the 31st of March I saw the prisoners in company with two others, going to different shops—I saw them pass the prosecutor's shop about fifteen yards and they stopped all four together in conversation—I saw Elliott go back to the shop and drag a piece of pork out—the others were quite near enough to see what he did—he then went down Seyraour-place, turned a comer, crossed the road, and joined the other three again, and seemed is conversation with them—they all went down Seymour-place together—he had the pork under his coat—I went up to him, and seized him—We struggled and tell, I undermost—when I got up I saw Bead running—I called "Stop thief," and after some time be was brought back—I secured Elliott with the pork, and in going to the station-house he said he did it through want—while I was searching Read, he said, "I certainly did speek to him, but I did not know any thing of him"—I had watched them, and seen them in communication at different shops—each could see what the others did.</p>

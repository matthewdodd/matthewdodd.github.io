                  </hi>. I live at 18, Old Bond Street—I am the care-taker of the premises—the prisoner was employed there as a porter last January—he left in the early part of the year—I am acquainted with his hand<lb></lb>writing—I have received letters from him since he left—I received this letter by post, it is in the prisoner's handwriting—the envelope is dated 9th August. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "80, Howland Street. Dear Sir,—I write to tell you that you must send me the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I asked you for, and if you have not got it you must borrow it for me, as I want to leave England on Saturday. If you don't send it to me you will be sorry for it; not for my sake, but your own, and your character. If I don't have it on Wednesday morning at my lodging, in two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, you can send them to the place. If you do, you shall have the money back in a short time; if you don't, you had better look out, for I know more than you think I do; so I hope you will send and get it for me, for I know you can, so don't write and tell me you can't, for I will have none. If I don't have the money on Wednesday morning you know what to expect. I won't write and ask you again. I hope you will send it, if you don't want to be exposed. Send it to Mr. Thomas J. Edwards, 17, Howland Street. I will never ask you again for anything, so don't forget what I say. Send it soon here, if you can, and I will not forget you.—Yours, Thos. Edwards.") I communicated with the police the following day—it appears to me a threatening letter—I did not put any particular construction upon it—I did not understand it as threatening anything in particular, because I know there is nothing that he could—I have other letters that I should like to call attention to.</p>

This is the last time. If I don't get it you can post. If you send it I will write as before, and say nothing.—From yours truly, Thos. Jno. Edwards.

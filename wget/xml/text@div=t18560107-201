                  </hi>. I live at Sydenham, and work for a grocer there. On Saturday night, 22nd Dec., about twenty minutes to 12 o'clock, I was pass<lb></lb>ing along Wells-road, Sydenham, on my way home—I saw the prisoner Earley lying on a sack at the end of the bowling green, by the tarred fence of the Fox and Hounds public house—I saw a man jump over the fence, but could not see who it was—he picked up the sack, and Earley held it up behind—I saw something fall from it, and Earley said that he could not keep the sawdust in—they went up the Wells-road with the sack—I afterwards spoke to Bradshaw, and went with him to the spot where I had seen the sack lying, and saw about a peck of black oats upon the ground.</p>

On Saturday night, 22nd Dec., about twenty minutes to 12 o'clock, I saw two men with a sack full of something, at the back of the Fox and Hounds public house, Sydenham—I went round to see what they had, but before I could get round they escaped—I met Duncan, who showed me about a peck of oats on the ground—I picked some of them up, and put them into a handkerchief—my ser<lb></lb>geant came up on horseback—I followed him up the Wells-road—he galloped on before, and stopped some men, but I was not close enough to see what they were doing, but went and found them with the sergeant in the Beehive public house—he delivered Earley over to me, and they were taken to the station—I went, by the sergeant's orders, to Ferrierr's house, the sergeant took him into custody, and I found this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his back garden, behind a shed, there were no oats in it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, P</hi> 41). On Saturday night, 22nd Dec., I saw Bradshaw, and from what he told me, I went up Wells-road, at the corner of the Springfields, and met Farrant and Earley coming back down the Springfields, in a direction from Ferrier's house, and about 200 yards from it—I was on horseback—I said, "Halloo, my lads! what are you up to here?"—they made no reply, but began to reel about as though they were drunk—I said, "What are you doing here?"—Farrant said, "I have been up to <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Ferrier's for a night's lodging; he has promised me a night's lodging, but now he will not give it to me"—they then reeled along till they came to the Beehive public house, and went in—I got off my horse, went in, and took them into custody, telling them they were charged on suspicion of stealing a sack of oats—Earley said, "I know nothing about the oats; you have had me two or three times before, but I always got over it, and so I shall this"—I then called the constable, gave Earley in custody, and took Farrant myself—on the road to the station Farraut said, "I am not going to get myself in trouble about Earley; I was coming up the Wells-road,</p>

I have not had any oats"—I said, "It is a serious charge, and I should advise you to be careful what you say, as I may have to make use of your words for or against you"—he said, "Well, there are a few oats in the bin which <hi rend="italic">they</hi> brought"—he went with me to the stable, and showed me the oats, and they corresponded—there were from three to four bushels—I told him that I must take possession of them, and asked him where the sack was—he said that he did not know, but he would lend me a sack to put the oats in—when we had got about two bushels in, he said to his wife, "Let us see, how many were there in before these were shot?"—she replied, that there were "<hi rend="italic">a goodish few</hi>"—I told him they appeared to be the same oats, and that I should take possession of the lot, which I did—I took him to the station, and asked him what he had given for the oats—he said, "Nothing;" nor was he to do so that he knew of—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a sample, they are rather a particular sort of oats.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Mrs. Green, of 5, Fulham-place, Paddington, and was so on 24th October—my mistress is an old lady, very infirm—she has not been out of the house for eighteen months, and not out of her bed<lb></lb>room for twelve months—her room is on the second floor—it was my habit to take her supper up-stairs of an evening, not always at one time, but from 9 to 10 o'clock—on the night of 24th October, a little before 9, I went down to the kitchen to fetch the supper—the cook was in the kitchen, and the prisoner Collett—I had ordered the supper beforehand—I was down stairs about ten minutes—I then went up to my mistress's bedroom with the supper on a tray—it was past 9 then—when I opened the door I saw two men in the room—one of them was standing over my mistress who was sitting in a large chair—there was a candle lamp on the table, at the foot of the bed—the other man was standing at the side of the bed, near the secretary—I had not time to notice the man much; it was a tall man who was over my mistress, and I heard him say that if she screamed he would murder her—they both had black masks—I think they were crape—they covered above the eyes, and below the mouth, and quite obscured their faces—I turned round, screamed "Murder," and threw the tray down stairs—the tall man had then returned from my mistress, and was standing with his back</p>

               <p>to the fire, with his mask off—I then noticed that he had whiskers—the other man was shorter: I did not observe that he was doing anything—the tall man rushed across the door, and I turned to run away—they both pushed by me two or three stairs, and ran away—they pushed me two or three stairs down, and then I went back to my mistress—I spoke to her—the said, "Go for a doctor," and I did so—blood was running down her head—she was bleeding very much from the head—a doctor afterwards came and a police<lb></lb>man—I did not fetch the doctor—my mistress kept her plate basket under the dressing table in the bed-room, during the time I have been with her, and her watch in a pocket at the foot of the bed—after the men were gone, I missed eleven silver spoons, some forks, a ladle, sugar sifter, tongs, butter<lb></lb>knife, and gold watch, with a short chain to it, which was safe when I was up there at half-past 8—I saw the watch in the pocket, and the plate in the room—I had heard no noise—I had seen Collett the night before, and once before that; three times altogether—the first time was about a fortnight before, when she came to the door, and inquired for Lucy, who was the housemaid before me—I opened the door—she said she had heard of a place which she thought would suit her—Lucy left when I came—that was about five months ago—I told her that Lucy was gone away—she asked how Mrs. Green was, and if she had a nurse to sit up with her of a night—I told her that Mrs. Green was very poorly indeed, but she did not have any one to sit up with her of a night—I saw her again on the night before the robbery—some gin was fetched that night, and I was asked to take tome of it by Mrs. Collett and the cook—I saw no gin on the Thursday night—a gentleman named Waite sometimes comes to see my mistress—he was there on the Wednesday night—I did not hear Mrs. Collett say anything about him on the Wednesday or Thursday night—I was asked to take some gin on the Thursday, but I would not have any; and I said that there was none to be fetched—Mrs. Collett asked me when she came in.</p>

I had a fire and a light in the room. I sent Elizabeth Askew as usual for my supper; I can't say exactly the time. After she left I was dozing in my chair, waiting for her coming up; some<lb></lb>one came to me right across from the door; I looked up and saw a tall man with a black mask on. My eye caught the shade of another man; he came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060039"></xptr>
               <p>round the foot of the bed, behind the tall man, and came between the bed, and the window; he was shorter than the other man, and netted to be stouter. The tall man began to hit me on the head four or five severe blows with something with a large knob; I think I should know the ball again. I prayed and begged of him to let me be quiet, and if he would take his hand away I would tell or do anything. When I said this he took hold of me by the throat, and pinched me till I lost my senses—I remained so for a minute or so, and then recovered. He came at me again and gave me some more blows on the head, and he caught hold of my throat, and I received a most severe blow in the left cheek, but I can't say from what. He clutched my throat again, and tighter much; I was then insensible, and I don't know any more. I could hear the other man up by the side of the bed, and heard something rattling. My desk was looked, and afterwards I found it broken open; I missed nothing from there. I saw the short man turn his arm and clutch my watch from my watch-pocket, at the head of the bed. My plate was in a basket under the table; I can't tell the quantity missing. One of the men seemed tall aud the other short, and the short one had a loose coat on; this must have made him look stouter. The prisoner Puzey seems to be about the height of the tall one, but I am not certain; the hands are like the man's; they were thin, long fingers. The life-preserver produced is like the thing I was struck with. When I recovered I found the room vacant, and nobody in it. I know the prisoner Collett well; she was employed by me as my nurse last winter; she sat up with me at night; it is seven or eight months ago, or more. She was with me twice; she left and came again. In consequence of my suspicion I discharged her, and gave notice for her not to come to my house. I heard about a fortnight before the robbery that she had been to my house. When Mrs. Collett was here I used to keep the plate in the bedroom, near the window, and my watch was always kept in the watch-pocket, at the head of the bed; she knew that well. I did not hear the men speak one syllable, that I could hear. Sarah Green."</p>

I am single—I now live at 2, Adam-street, Paddington—I have known Puzey about six years—I was cohabiting with him in Septem<lb></lb>ber and October last—I lived with him as his wife in September in the same lodging, 1, Nightingale-street—I knew George Reeves in October last—I recollect the circumstance of a robbery taking place at Mrs. Green's, Fulbam-place—I had known Reeves a fortnight or three weeks before that robbery—I first saw him when he came round to Nightingale-place to see Puzey—Reeves was then living at 27, Victoria-place, Bayswater, at a house kept by a Mrs. Duffin—the first time I went there was with Puzey, and I afterwards went there by myself—I went there on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—I know Puzey's sister—she was living with Reeves—I have slept in that house, but Puzey has not—I was at that lodging on 17th October, the Thursday before the robbery—I went out from there that evening, between 7 and 8, with Puzey's sister—Reeves and Puzey had gone out before—Puzey's sister went into a pawn<lb></lb>broker's in Church-street—we afterwards went to Bell-street—we came back down Church-street and Carlisle-street into Bell-street, where we met Puzey—that was between 7 and 8 o'clock—he came and spoke to his sister and showed her a latch door key saying, "I have been there and it will not fit"—he asked her to give him some money to buy another key, which she did—Reeves was not present when we met Puzey—he said he bad been with him but had mined him—Puzey left his sister and me and went to buy a key—I saw him a short time afterwards at the Weybridge; that is a public-house near Fulham-place—it is the Bridge House Hotel, but I call it the Weybridge—an appointment had been made to meet there—I went there with Reeves' sister—we waited at the bridge about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—Puzey came to as first, and asked if we had seen George; we said, "No"—a short time afterwards George came up—that is Reeves—we then went into the public-house, which I call the Weybridge, and had some rum and water—Puzey then had a bright key with him about the same size as the one he bad in Bell-street—he held it over a gas lamp in the public-house and it became black—we left that public-house after having the rum and water, and went towards Fulham-place—we separated; Puzey and Reeves went up Fulham-place and I and the sister went down a turning—we were to meet them at the other end of Fulham-place; that is near Pad<lb></lb>dington-green—we went to the corner of Fulham-place, and saw Reeves with his back against a lamp-post in Fulham place; about the distance from us of from one end of this Court to the other—Puzey came to him at the lamp<lb></lb>post, and then they joined us—when Puzey joined Reeves he came from the</p>

               <p>Warwick Arms end of Fulham-place—he was on the same side as Mrs. Green's house—that is near the Warwick Arms—Puzey said, "The key will not fit, it wants filing"—after that we went away from that neighbourhood towards Maida-hill, and I went home, leaving the three together—on the next evening, Friday, I went to Reeves' lodging again, between 5 and 6 o'clock, by myself—while I was there Puzey came in, and I went out with him to their lodging—Reeves and Puzey's sister went with us—we went out about 7 o'clock, and went from Notting-hill up to Paddington—the sister and I left Puzey and Reeves up against the Harrow-road, and I do not know in what direction they went—we went to James-street, Eastbourne-terrace, to the Queen public-house—Mrs. Collett was there—I had never seen her before that night—I saw her outside Mrs. Carr's, which is at the corner of James-street and Eastbourne-terrace—we had gone to that house before we saw Mrs. Collett come out, and Puzey's sister threw a stone down the area and said that she wanted to see some one—we walked about, and Mrs. Collett came out about half or three quarters of an hour afterwards and went from her house to the Queen, which is in James-street—we then met Puzey and Reeves at the bottom of Eastbourne-terrace—they were in the Queen when Mrs. Collett came out—she came out with a jug in her hand and no bonnet on—she spoke to Puzey's sister, and to Reeves and Pusey when she went in—Reeves was standing up—she continued talking to them about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes while I was there—she and Reeves were standing, and Puzey sat down by my side—Puzey's sister said to me, "Ellen, that is the woman where you are to go to place at," speaking of Mrs. Collett—I left the Queen by myself, as Mrs. Collett asked me to go up to her husband, to a public-house in Praed-street—I had seen him on that night before I saw Mrs. Collect, because while Puzey's sister was standing at the house he came round there, outside Mrs. Carr's house, and spoke to Puzey's sister—I went and fetched him and came back with him to the Queen—I was not away very long—I do not know the name of the place we went to after that—we went for a walk round the squares, Puzey and Reeves and Puzey's sister and myself, and Mrs. Collett went back to Mrs. Carr's with the beer—I did not notice what passed between Mr. and Mrs. Collett—Puzey was not still living with me at that time—he had ceased to cohabit with me on the Saturday in the previous week, the 12th—they did not tell me that any other woman was living with him after he left me—I know a woman who is called Mrs. Puzey, but they say he was not with her then—about a fortnight after this Friday I saw Reeves with Puzey's sister, in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove—Reeves had not then any moustache—he had a moustache when I saw him on the 18th—I did not notice whether he had any whiskers, or hair, about his face or under his chin—Puzey's sister said that they were looking for a lodging, and they had not been home lately, as the police were after them; that they had not been to Victoria-place lately, and that she had had to cut George's moustache off, and he had got a very bad cold through it; that she heard the police outside, and let George out by a side door, while she was fumbling about by the gate—I did not see Puzey after 24th October till I saw him at the police-court, in cus<lb></lb>tody—Puzey had slight whiskers when I saw him a week before the robbery—they went right round under his chin—I did not notice whether he had whiskers when at the police-court, I did not look at him—I have had this life-preserver in my hand before—I have seen it at Reeves' lodging—there was a string to it and a whistle—this is the same—I have blown the whistle—I also saw some black crape there on the Tuesday evening, the first</p>

               <p>evening I was there—Reeves was going out, and Puzey's sister tore a piece off and gave it to him—I never had the crape in my hand—I cannot say whether I have seen this life-preserver more than once at Reeves', but I saw it on the Tuesday.</p>

                  </hi>. In October last, I was cook to Mrs. Green, and was so for one year, seven months, and a fortnight—I am not so now—Collett acted as nurse to Mrs. Green last winter while I was there, and used to sit up with her—I remember the robbery; it took place on a Thursday night—on the day before that, Mrs. Collett called about half-past 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening, as near as I can remember—I let her in; she did not ring the bell, she knocked at the railings—March was the last time I had seen her there—she asked if Mr. Waite was there, and I said, "Yes"—he is a gentleman who has been in the habit of sitting with my mistress of an evening—he used to do so while Collett was there as nurse, almost every day—we then both went down into the kitchen, and Collett proposed having some gin—she went out and fetched a quartern—I did not give her the money for it—she was absent from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, and brought it back with her—she and I drank it, and the housemaid had some also—Collett stayed from half an hour to three-quarters, and then left—she came again on Thursday, from half-past 8 to 9, as near as I can remember—she knocked at the rails, and I let her in by the house door, which closes with a latch—it is opened with a key like a room door key, only smaller—we have only that door—she asked me if Mr. Waite was there—I said, "No, he is ill"—she went down with me into the kitchen and proposed that some gin should be brought—she fetched it—I did not give her the money for it either time—she was absent from five to ten minutes; she was very quickly gone—she brought it into the kitchen, and I gave her the door-key to let herself in—I told her to take it; we have generally been in the habit of doing so—she brought me the key into the kitchen and said, "Mind, there is your key"—after the gin was brought, the</p>

I live at 1, Fulham-place, Paddington-green, four doors from Mrs. Green—on the evening of 21st October I was standing at my door and saw a man walking up and down near Mrs. Green's house—his walk extended from No. 5 to the corner leading to Maida-hill, which is the next house to mine—I have said that I observed him for three-quarters of an hour, but it was more than that—he was a middle-sized man, rather dark, and had moustachios—I saw another man waiting on the other side of the street, leaning against a low balustrade, opposite No. 3—I observed that he had rather lighter clothes on—on 24th October I was in my garden at the time of the robbery—I heard the crash of the banisters, heard the door of No. 5 open, and saw one or two men come out into the garden—it was then about twenty minutes to 10—a middle sized man came past our house—he</p>

On the morning of 25th October I re<lb></lb>ceived information of this robbery, and a description of two men from my superintendant—I began to look out immediately after that for Puzey and Reeves—I knew them both before this occurrence—for some time prior to 24th October, I had seen them in the neighbourhood of Lisson-grove—I apprehended them on 17th November, at 15, Walmer-street, Marylebone—they were together in the same room—the door was opened, and I said, "Thomas and George, I want you for the robbery at Fulham place, for burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling house of Mrs. Green, and stealing a watch and other articles, value 20<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and assaulting her with intent to murder her;" neither of them made any reply—they had been in bed, but had put on their trousers to let me in—there was only one bed, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and surgeon to the Western General Dispensary—I have here a register of the accidents which I have attended to personally, with my signature opposite to them—I find an entry here on 20th September, "Thomas Peroy, 11, Cumberland-terrace; crushed finger."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect this man coming to the hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> May I look at his hands: (<hi rend="italic">doing so</hi>) I feel convinced from the aspect of the person that he is the man—I feel convinced that that is the finger—it is the long finger of the left hand; the middle finger: it is crushed and lacerated—I had to take off the nail—I dressed it the first time, and afterwards the assistant dressed it—I do not know how long it was before he was discharged cured; because the assistant always attends to them afterwards—he was not an in-patient—we do not take in-patients—I cannot tell you how long he was under our charge—the finger nail was taken off, and strapping applied to it—I should consider that it would be well in a fortnight—if I heard that on 22nd of next month be carried his arm in a sling I should certainly think that it was not from that accident—it required a finger stall, but not a sling—he came on 20th September.</p>

I live at 71, Crawford-street, Paddington, and am a painter and glazier—Reeves' father lodged at my place; he is a bootmaker—on Thursday evening, 24th October, about half-past 8 o'clock, which was the night of the robbery, the prisoner Reeves came to his father's place—I heard of the robbery next day, about 11 o'clock—I was standing at the door</p>

Inspector Dartrell stated that Puzey had been tried, with five others, for a robbery at Lord Foley's and sentenced to three years' penal servitude, from which he returned in March or April last, and immediately became the associate of the worst of thieves; and that Reeves had also been sentenced to penal servitude, the certificate of which was produced, and three months imprisonment since. Sergeant Potter stated that he had had Puzey in custody for a robbery and knocking a man down with a life-preserver, that he was acquitted of the robbery, but found guilty of the assault; and that Collett had been concerned in two or three similar robberies, but had not been convicted.</hi>

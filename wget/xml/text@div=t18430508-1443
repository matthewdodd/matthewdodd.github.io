                  </hi>. I live in Old Pye-street, Westminster. On the 21st of April I was at Mr. Teasey's public-house, at St. Margaret's, Westminster—the prisoner came up to me, and asked me to give her some beer—I said I had no money—a young woman gave her a pot—she drank some of it, and threw the rest over me, and before I could recover myself, she hit me on the head with the pot—my head bled very much—I was quite sober—she was a little in liquor—the wound is well now.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the public-house—the prosecutrix was sitting down—the prisoner crossed towards her—they had about half-a-dozen words—a person handed a pot to the prisoner—she threw the contents in the pro<lb></lb>secutor's face, and struck her twice on the head with the quart pot—it sounded very hard indeed—a great deal of blood came from her.</p>

About twenty minutes to two o'clock I was called, and took the prisoner—I produce the pot, which is dented at the bottom, and has blood on it—the prosecutrix was bleeding—the prisoner said she would serve her ten times worse as soon as she had her liberty—she was a little intoxicated.</p>

             Mortimer. On Saturday, the 13th of January, about two in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar called at our house, in Fleet-street; after examining several guns he fixed upon one, which he ordered me to send it to his address in Greenfield-street, Commercial-road; the gun was sent at the time fixed, and not knowing of the prisoner, I gave the man, who took the gun, a particular order to bring back the money or the gun.</p>

I waited about ten minutes before Mr. Cooper came in; he gave me a check when he came in, and I delivered him the gun. I returned home with the check and gave it to my master; the check was refused at the banking house; my master sent me back to Mr. Cooper's. The woman of the house informed me he was gone, he only took the lodging that morning; on my coming home I met Mr. Cooper in Aldgate, I told him the check was refused at the banking house; he said, no, it must be a mistake; I said, he must return back with me or give me the money; he said, he was booked at the coach, he was going into the country, I must go with him to a friend of his, he would borrow the money; he took me to a coffee house, told me to stop at the door while he went in; I told him I should not leave him; he said, I was an impertinent fellow, he would not go in, the porter was with me, I sent the porter for a constable, and afterwards he walked very pleasantly with me; the porter lost sight of me. At last the prisoner went into the Commercial-road, there I charged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210009"></xptr>the watch with him, and he gave charge with me; he threw the gun on my toes, he got out of the watchman's hands; he was pursued and taken to the watchhouse, and from there to Lambeth-street office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Cox, a shoemaker, and live in the City-road. The prisoner occupied a furnished room in our house. On Saturday, the 21st of August, he did not come home at night, and on Sunday morning I missed three pairs of boots, which had been safe in the shop as late as half-past twelve on Saturday night—about three the next afternoon I went up to the prisoner's bed-room, and to my great sur<lb></lb>prise I found him there—I asked him how he came there—he told me not to be alarmed, that he had got over the Lying-in-Hospital wall, and in at the back parlour window—he went out—I went up to his room, and saw the string of these boots part of the way out of his portmanteau, which stood under the window—I told my husband—he got a policeman—in the even<lb></lb>ing the prisoner came home, and was accused of it—he said he was guilty, and he meant to return them.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 12th of May, I missed these things - I had not seen the coat after Friday, when I put it in the drawer in my master's bed-room - it was not locked. I saw the shirt collars safe on Saturday morning; they were in another drawer.

            . I am an officer. I went to search the prisoner's apartments, which are not quite half a mile from the Hotel. The prisoner was just getting out of bed; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day - I told him my business; he said he had nothing but his own property, and I was at liberty to search. On my turning over his things, Foot claimed two waistcoats and some stockings - one of the waistcoats laid on a chair with the coat; the boot-hooks were on a table; I told him they were stolen from Limmert's Coffee-house; he said he bought them of a Jew some few mornings since at a public-house; that the Jew was a stranger to him. I asked if the publican was present; he said No, neither the publican nor any one else. I took him.</p>

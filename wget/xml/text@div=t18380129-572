                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the evening in question, did you all four come from Hounslow to near Mr. Murray's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—we got there about twelve or one o'clock at night, and went into a meadow near his house—there was a flock of sheep there—we drove them up into a corner, and took four lambs—they were not killed in the field—they were taken about three or four fields off, and skinned—we left the skins on the spot.</p>

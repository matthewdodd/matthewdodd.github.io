                  </hi>. I live at Church Street, Highgate. On 1st Sept. I kept the King's Head, Meeting House Lane, Peckham—on that evening I went up into my bed room, at a little after 6 o'clock, and saw a box safe with 100 sovereigns in it, also a canvas bag with 100 or 102 sovereigns, and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, with eight sovereigns rolled up in them, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes loose—I locked the door, but left the key in it—I had occasion to go to the drawer about half past 9 o'clock for some papers, and found the door wide open, the drawer broken open with a chisel, and the money gone, and the box except the lid—the blind of the front window was right up; there were no marks on it—there is a yard at the back of the house to the skittle ground, and a passage four or five feet wide—there is no difficulty in getting up from there to the window—a boy six years old could get up—there are two water butts, then the slates, then some wood work and a trough, and the back room window is about so high from the slates: that window was thrown open—there were footmarks across the bed, as if a person had come across it, and a chisel on it—a very small piece of candle was thrown on the front room bed—there is a yard at the back of the house, and a gate leading from there to the passage, at the end of which there is a very large lamp, and another at the front door—the door leading from the passage to the yard is always left open for people to go to the skittle ground—on that night I saw Brooks there—I had seen him there for a month previous, and in the skittle ground—I have frequently seen Richardson at my house, but cannot say whether I saw her</p>

Holloway" was on one of them—it was discovered that they had been paid in to somebody—there are not persons playing at I skittles every night—my potman attends to the skittle ground, but I know I there was no playing that night, for I had the key of the skittle ground in the bar—I always keep it locked till it is wanted—I gave evidence before the Magistrate next day—Brooks was not found then—policeman named Cox was there, but I do not know that he was in custody for that, only for a few words that he had said--l gave the evidence I have given to-day, but not against Cox—I do not think it was on 3rd Sept.—Cox was charged with saying that if he had had time that day he should be able to find out the man and the money—he was put at the bar alone while I was giving my evidence, but not for the robbery, only for saying that; but it was a romance that he made use of, it had no meaning in it—I was ordered to go to the station by Sergeant Bond, who told me Cox was in custody for making use of that observation—Coat has been in the habit of coming to my house two or three months—I did hot see him there on the night of the robbery; he may have been—he may have looked into the parlour at about 9 o'clock and said, "You look all comfortable; I will not disturb you"—I heard a person there say that, and they said that it was Cox, but I cannot say that it was—I do not know his voice—I saw him next morning, between 8 and 9 o'clock, and he said, in reference to the robbery, "What a bad job it is"—that was on the 2nd, and on the 3rd he was in custody, but I did not give him into custody—I swear that I saw Brooks at my house on the night of the robbery—I have never been asked the question before, but was always as certain of it as I am now—you will find that what I said on the 8th was just the same as I say now—I cannot say what Brown was doing, because I did not attend to the bar, but I saw him as I came from the parlour into my kitchen—my wife and my two boys of thirteen and fourteen were serving; they are not here—if he is convicted, I expect to get any money found in his possession.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 1st Sept., about 9 o'clock, I was at my window, and saw a man, with a light in his hand, come into Mr. Coleman's front bed room, on the first floor—he had a cap on; I cannot say the colour of it, but he wore it straight on his head—I only saw his side face—I went down to the station where Brooks was in custody; there were two or three other people there, and I pointed to Brooks, and said, "That is the man in every particular, but I cannot swear to him, because I did not see his full face"—the light was not in the room more than five minutes—my husband was sitting at the window; the blind was down at the top.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Meeting House Lane, Peckham, at the back of the King's Head. On Tuesday, 1st Sept., I went out about 8 o'clock or half past, and saw Richardson in the passage leading from my house to Mr. Coleman's, coming out of his back gate—there is a gas lamp four or five yards from the gate—I went into my house, and stopped about a quarter of an hour, then came out, and saw Peach, I believe, standing there, with a red shawl on, leaning against an iron fence—I cannot swear to her being the person—I stood there for about a quarter of an hour, waiting for a little boy of mine, and then saw Brooks in the passage—the roadway and the path there measures eighteen feet.</p>

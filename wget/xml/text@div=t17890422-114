             sworn.</p>

               <p>I lodge in Charles-street, Covent-garden; I was out on the 10th of March, at the corner of <placeName id="t17890422-114-crimeloc530">Cockspur-street</placeName>

I was going along with a friend; I had a great coat, with leather breeches, which fitted exceeding tight, so that I could not put one large seal in my fob; I had a friend with me, who is not here; there was a crowd in consequence of the illumination; I felt a person's hand on my fob; I immediately laid my hand on his wrist; after which I immediately felt a pluck at my seal from the hand which I had then hold of; I had hold of another person with my other hand; I quitted that person, and got hold of that person whose wrist I had got in my other hand; after which I still retained the hand, and I felt it evidently expanded open, there was at the time some soldiers coming past; with an amazing deal of trouble, I got into a house, and afterwards sent away to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did you lose your watch? - I lost my watch.</p>
               <p>How could the prisoner have an opportunity of conveying away the watch when you had hold of his wrist? - I had only hold of part of his wrist.</p>
               <p>What became of the watch? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. There was a very considerable crowd at that that place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you the same misfortune as you have now with your eye? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Had you been at Bow-street that day about your other robbery? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>You must recollect it? - To my knowledge I was not.</p>
               <p>You was going, as others were, to see the illuminations? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man was instantly secured with the seal in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The man was instantly secured, and the watch could not be found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What promotion have you in the army - I have sold it out since.</p>
               <p>What regiment was you in? - In the twenty-ninth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220112"></xptr>An officer, I conclude? - An ensign.</p>
               <p>Was you so at that time? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You must recollect; do you recollect at what time nearly, you sold out? - The sale of it was on the day the first gazette came out after the King's recovery, I was in the gazette.</p>
               <p>Your watch never was recovered? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Was this man searched? - I did not see him, the man who came from Bow-street said he was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

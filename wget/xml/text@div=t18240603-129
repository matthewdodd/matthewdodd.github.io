On Sunday morning, the 18th of April, I came down about seven o'clock; Murrell, who had set up every night since Christmas, gave me information. I found the cellar door wrenched off its hinges - somebody had got in that way, opened the wash-house window-shutters, and both the windows, and this property was gone. One of the boilers were brought in by a man, and the other three were found at a broker's. The Park is behind our house - any one can get over the wall into the yard - the cellar opens into the yard.</p>

I was getting up at five o'clock in the morning, and on looking out of the window, I saw Reynolds getting over the Park wall into Mrs. Phillips's yard; he had a dark coat and a red handkerchief on, and a kind of a shoemaker's apron. I thought at first that it was Phillips, but looked again and saw that it was Reynolds; he was getting on the flat, which is level with the wall.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Reynolds in Pump-court, Perkin's-rents. I found six men and three women in the room - a girl calling herself Ryley said she rented the room. I found an old copper boiler under the bed, wrapped in two old blue aprons, which I produce. I went to the premises; they appeared to have been broken open by some large instrument. I found the shaft of a chaise in the yard - it corresponded with the marks on the cellar door - it had been used to force the hinges off. I apprehended the other prisoner before.</p>

I am a builder, of Upper Sydenham, and agent to Mr. William Withall, of Great George Street, Westminster, who is the owner of an unoccupied house at Upper Sydenham—I had the care of it—in the beginning of October I saw a copper fixed in the wash-house—I have since seen one like it in the possession of the police—the value of it was about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen the prisoner in the neighbourhood—I know his father and mother very well.</p>

I am a marine store dealer, of 60, Willow Walk, Sydenham—on Friday, the 10th October, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I came down stairs and opened the shop door and found the prisoner—he had a copper which he wanted me to buy—he said it was a good one—I refused to buy it—I said it was an improper time to bring anything—he left it there, and I insisted upon him taking it back—I knew him before—he lived about thirty yards from my place—I put the copper into the back yard—I went up to the premises and replaced it.</p>

I lost my watch last Sunday week, about half-past eleven o'clock. I laid down outside the house, and went to sleep, and my watch was taken from my fob. I saw it the next day at a pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I am a packthread spinner. Ridley came to me as I was going to the pawnbroker's, and desired me to pledge this watch for him; I did not know him, but I took it and pawned it; I swear that I never saw him before - my husband is a sawyer - it was about half-past eight on Monday morning - he told me to ask 12 s. for it - I only got 7 s. I gave him the ticket and the 7 s. on the step of the door; he gave me nothing for my trouble. I did not see him again till this day week at a public-house. Mr. Price had come to me about it - he had traced it from the pawnbroker's to me - I had pawned it in my own name; I did not ask him his name.</p>

            Were you charged with stealing the watch - A. I do not know about that; I did not hear any body say that I had stolen it - it was after they found me out that I went to the watch-house. I went from there to the pawnbroker's, and then sent for him.</p>

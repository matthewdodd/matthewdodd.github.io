            . I am a Police-constable. On the 11th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I met Wilson in Gloucester-place carrying this bundle - I asked him what he had got; he said some things which did not belong to him - I asked where he got them - he said if I would go to Mr. Robinson's, No. 5, Little Lisson-street, he would tell me all about it; I took him to the Police-station, and said I would go to Mr. Robinson's - he then said he was so irritated at the time he did not know what he said, but if I would go to Mr. Cross, Park-street, Davies, the footman, would tell me all about it; I went there - Davies came to the door; I asked if I could see Mr. Cross - he asked my business; I stated to him that I had detained a man, and described the property - the butler then came to the door, and Davies said "Very likely it is our washerwoman's husband;" I asked him to describe him, and by the description I was positive it was not the same man - I then asked if there was a person of the name of William Davies in the house; the butler said, "Why your name's William Davies' - the butler then went away; Davies came out to the door with me, and said he recollected he did give the bundle to the man to keep it for him, as he had no place to keep it in the house - I said, "If it is all right I don't wish to detain the man;" I bade him good night, and was going away - he called me back and said,"Well, I suppose if the man is liberated, master will know nothing about it;" I said, "No, certainly not. I will go home and liberate him" - he said he hoped his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030035"></xptr>master would know nothing about it, as it might get him into trouble; I went to the Police-station and mentioned what Davies had said to a superior officer, who advised me to go and apprehend Davies, which I did - I asked him what clothes they were, whether they were saddle-cloths or what; he said they belonged to him - I said,"I suppose they are your perquisites?" he said, Yes - I went to Mr. Cross' again and told the butler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.When you went to Mr. Cross' did you tell Davies what the parcel contained? A. Yes I did, in the first instance; he did not say it would appear very odd for him to be charged with any thing whether he was guilty or not - he made no attempt to escape.</p>

            . I am housekeeper to Mr. Cross. These three table covers and blanket are his property - I cannot swear to the blanket; Davies had been there about ten months.. I gave them to him to take to wash; they certainly did not belong to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot swear to the blanket? A. No; there is no mark on the table-covers, but I had them in use every day - I think I could swear to them; I do not know of any perquisites being given, or of one or two being used in the stable - I cannot swear these had not been given him.</p>
               <p>Davies' Defence. When the officer took me he said if I would confess it should go better with me at the trial, and the butler said the same. <rs id="t18291203-80-verdict435" type="verdictDescription">

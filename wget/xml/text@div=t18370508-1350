                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Charles Burrell, at Low Hill farm, Walthamstow. The prisoners were his labourers, and lived in Marsh-street, close by—On Sunday morning, the 30th of April, they had been down to feed the cattle—I saw them coming out of the yard, with each a basket full—I suspected something was wrong, as they did not come the usual way from the yard, but jumped over the hedge—I went round and met them, and asked what they had in the baskets—they did not give me a satisfactory answer—I stopped Perry, and found some potatoes and three eggs in his basket—Burley walked on—I called after him, and found he had got potatoes in his basket—I am certain they were my master's—they had been in a shed which was locked up, and there was a board which was taken down—they had 20lbs. of potatoes, as near as can be—they are a sort of blue potatoes—I saw them come out of the yard, from the shed.</p>

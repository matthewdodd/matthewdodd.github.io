I was at No. 2 Warehouse, on the 30th of last month—about ten o'clock in the morning I was moving some mats—there was a cart loaded with wool—I saw the prisoner there—he was a stranger—he moved the cart—he came and stopped his own cart, and the wool was in it—he put his hand up, tore a hole in one of the bags, took some wool out, and put it into a little bag which was nailed to the axletree under the cart—he went away for ten mi<lb></lb>nutes, then drew higher up, and took some more out—I told the watch-man.</p>

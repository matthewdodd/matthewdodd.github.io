            . I belong to the Excise office. On Monday, the 4th of July, I was coming down the yard of the Excise office; I saw the prisoner. The basket stood in the gateway. The prisoner had two loaves under his arm. I saw him take one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060011"></xptr>loaf out of the basket; he put two under each arm, and walked out of the gateway. I went to the lad that belonged to the basket. I told him a person had gone out of the yard with the loaves. The lad went after him. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEONARD. I am a servant to Mr. Henderson. The first witness told me that the prisoner had taken four loaves out of my basket. I went after the prisoner, and found him by Wormwood-street with two loaves under each arm. He said a man gave him sixpence to carry them into Broad-street. I took the loaves from him. I am sure they were Mr. Henderson's loaves.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was not me that took them out of the basket; a bread man said he would give me sixpence if I would take them to the bottom of Broad-street.</p>

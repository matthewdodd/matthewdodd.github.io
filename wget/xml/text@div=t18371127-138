                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live in Great Chapel-street, Westminster. The prisoner Bond was in my employ for ten months as a carman, going from Westminster to Hounslow and Isleworth—he went down almost every day, to take manure, and bring back potatoes—in con<lb></lb>sequence of information I received at Covent-garden-market, on Saturday, he 4th of November, I went to Knightsbridge, and stopped at Mr. Bart<lb></lb>lam's shop—I saw a board there with potatoes on it for sale—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what passed I had Bond taken up, and told him I was going to give him in charge—he said, "What for, master? "—-I said, "On sus<lb></lb>picion of robbing me, selling my potatoes on the road"—he said he had not sold any—he told me he had left a bushel and a half, on the 2nd, at the Rising Sun, at Knightsbridge—I went there with Woodbery, and found a potato sack of mine with my name in full, but the potatoes were sold—we found Robins there, and took him—we made him no threat or promise—he at first denied buying any potatoes, and after that he said he had bought a sack for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and sold it to Bartlam next morning—I went into the kitchen of the Rising Sun with Robins and the officer, and found a sack in a basket, on a shelf, which I knew to be mine—Robins said that was the sack he bought the potatoes in on the 2nd—we brought it away, and took the potatoes off Bartlam's show-board.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Charles Edwin Kendall, Nos.4 and 5, Great Saffron-hill—between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 7th of January, I was in the shop—I saw through a hole in the window a hand—I went outside and saw the prisoner with these shoes in his hand, and I said, "Stop thief"—there was no one else near him—he ran away, and I after him—there were two others two or three yards away from him—when he was stopped by a policeman he had not the property with him—he had an opportunity of giving them to the others—he ran close by them—I have missed a pair of shoes from the window.</p>

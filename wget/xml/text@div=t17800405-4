             and her son knocking; I asked, who is there? She said it is Mrs. Simpson, you did not expect me so late. I said no indeed I did not. She said she was willing to bring the goods, and as they were not all come, the rest would come in the morning. I said I was sorry she was come now for I was not prepared to pay for them. I put them in the parlour where they were to be. She came down into the kitchen to me; I said you shall stay all night, and when the remainder of the goods come in the morning I will pay you. She sent her son home between ten and eleven; he returned. I did not know he had returned till some body knocked at the door very roughly. I asked who was there? They said it is us, let us in. What do you want? said I. They said they came for the goods, let us in. I said I will not let you in, I will not part with the goods. I said do not make a noration here, and disturb the neighbourhood, for in the morning I will pay you; the best bed in my house you shall lie in. My lodger was out upon a visit; she came home just at the time as the fellows were there. I said, Mrs. Cooper, I cannot let you in directly. Presently a pint of beer came; I went to open the door to let the pint of beer in, and the fellows burst in by force. The goods were then locked up in the parlour. Her son had got something; I asked, what is that? He run against me in the passage. I said, Mrs. Stevens, as to the debt between your husband and me, I am not going to take any advantage, you may stay and sleep in the house all night, and take the keys up with you where the goods are. Before you leave the house I will pay you the money. She bid the men go away, and said she would stay all night. She whispered to one of the men at the further end of the passage; after that the man said d - n me if I will, for it will be the same noise in the morning as it is to-night. I will take them by force. After she had whispered, she put her hand up to the side of the door, and said, take that; put your pick-ax in at the top of the door, that is the place to break the door. I said desist I beg of you, I will pay you in the morning at what time you please; you have taken me unprovided. One put his back against the door, the other bounced with his fists, and the son had the pick-ax through the middle of the door at the time.</p>

             thought fit. One fellow came, and she said what do you come for? He said to do any thing you bid me, by G - d, to pull the house down if you order it. There was only myself and this old gentlewoman; she pleaded with them that they would not make a noise in the neighbourhood; and said I should pay them in the morning. But by force they did take them away.</p>
               <p>What did they take away? - All that they had brought, which they had before sold me.</p>
               <p>Did they take any thing else, beside what they brought? - No.</p>
               <p>And which you had not paid for? - No. But they had not brought all I agreed for. She brought me a bill and wanted me to pay for all. I said no, If it was day-light I would not pay you till you bring them all; bring the rest. She said her son should bring them in the morning; that was when she first brought them.</p>
               <p>What happened when they had taken the goods, did they all go away? - Yes; and the men who were with them brought lanterns and candles to go with them, and would have gone in the cart.</p>
               <p>What was become of your husband at this time? - He was gone abroad before that; he has been abroad half a year in December. I expect him home every hour, and have done ever since the 14th of this month.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050008"></xptr>I suppose they wanted to be 
paid that night? - Yes.</p>


               <p>After this did you go before the justice to complain of this matter? - Yes I did, to the Rotation-office in the Borough, and asked them their advice, whether they thought it legal that they should do these things? They said no, it was not, and ordered a warrant, and had them taken up and brought before them, and they let them know what a capital felony they had committed, and begged of them to make it up with me; I was much against it; I told them I wanted no other making up but for them to send the goods for the money again, and if she sent them in day light, I would then pay her at such a time, naming the time. She kept me all day, at last the Rotation stopped, and they ordered them to be committed on this side of the water, and they were brought to this side of the water to be committed. There came a man on horseback from her husband and said to her do not stay here, you must go to Justice Fielding's directly, for there is a friend there who will acquit you. We went there; the gentlewoman said she had six or seven small children, whereas she has none but grown up children as strong as me.</p>
               <p>Were they committed? - No. He said well, I shall not add to your affliction; I shall not look upon it as a felony. They said at the same time to me, you may indict her for this transgression.</p>
               <p>And so you did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then she was taken up upon the indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you have done the most imprudent thing that ever was done in the world.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoners. The prosecutrix was most severely rebuked by Justice Addington.</p>
               <p>Court. I am very glad she was. Gentlemen, you will acquit these people, it is no more felony than it is murder. Let them be immediately discharged out of custody. It is a hopeless thing with regard to any future consequences, because this is a married woman. All I can do is to grant them a copy of their indictment.</p>

             sworn. I live in Rosemary-lane; I collect the rents in the Change. On the 12th of February, a little after eight o'clock, my little girl was coming through the Change, she told me there was a woman in there; I went up to her, and asked her which way she came there, she said she was very much intoxicated, and which way she came in; she could not say. I| saw a bundle lay by the side of her, I asked her what bundle that was, she told me she had brought it from the country; and seeing her have something in her apron, I opened it, and found two dimity petticoats wrapped up, she told me they were her own; I then went about the Change to see if all the lockers were safe; I found one open, I lifted up the lid, and found a vacant place, which had the appearance of something being taken out; I knew whose locker it was, I sent for the prosecutrix, and detained the prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GLOVER sworn. I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody; I produce the property (The property identified by the prosecutrix).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I awoke in the morning I did not know how I came there; the bundle I had for a pillow when the man came in.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Glover) Where were these two aprons. - A. They were tied round her person.</p>

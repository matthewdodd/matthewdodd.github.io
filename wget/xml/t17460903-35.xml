               <p>Kent. The 20th of April I got up and found my House robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave all your Doors fast?</p>
               <p>Kent. The last Thing I did I went and boked the Window and Doors, and every Thing myself: I thought I heard something in the Night, but I thought it was one of my Children.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time did you get up in the Morning?</p>
               <p>Kent. Between Five and Six o'Clock my Wife and I got up; my Wife came down first, and as she was coming down, says she our Windows are open; I said it might be my Boy that is gone to School, but says she here is your Chest gone; then I said I am ruin'd for ever, for there were 29 Pair of Hose, that were none of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any other Things?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174609030037"></xptr>Kent. Yes, six Pewter Plates, a large Pewter Dish: There were in the Chest two Silk Handkercheif; there was my Pocket Book, but it was not put into the Indictment, nor a Quarter of the Things; there were three Dozen of Worsted Stockings, four Pair of Cotton, and four Pair of Thread, all these were in the Chest locked up; there was a five Pant Copper Sauce-Pan, and a very particular Pair of Hose, Sky-colour'd blue.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find your House broke open?</p>
               <p>Kent. In the Window; there was a Plate of Iron a with seven Nails. This Plate of Iron was wrenched of; they endeavoured to take down the whole Frame of the Window; the next Day after I advertised, I found one of the particular Sky-coloured Stockings that were in my Chest.</p>
               <p>Q. What Clocks had they ?</p>
               <p>Kent. Gold-coloured Silk Clocks.</p>

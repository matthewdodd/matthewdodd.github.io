I was in Pell Street on Saturday night, the 6th November, about 12.30, when I saw the prosecutor crossing the road—I saw Kelly go up to him and strike him a violent blow in the stomach—he then fell forward—Kelly caught hold of his right shoulder and dragged his coat off, and Brian took the coat and gave it to another man, who ran up Pell Street—I don't know him—they ran off and I ran after them and caught Kelly—Brian turned round and said "You s—, let him go"—he then ran down Pell Street—I then took Kelly back to a house which prosecutor was taken into and asked him what had been done, and he said he had lost his coat, and he then came to the station and charged Kelly—about an hour afterwards I went down Graham Street, Mint Struct, and apprehended Brain and told him the charge, and he said he didn't know anything about it—the prosecutor had a slight scar on the forehead and was rather the worse for drink—I think the scar was done by the scuffle—he full on his face after the coat was taken off—in conse<lb></lb>quence</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the London and Victoria Docks—on Sunday afternoon, 29th July, I was engaged as a watchman on the C jetty—there were a quantity of casks of wine there—I saw the prisoner on that occasion go to a cask and move it a little—he took out the bung of the cask and poured wine from it—he took the bung out with this tickler or short piece of iron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he then pulled the cask a little towards him, and after having tilted it he put into the cask something such a pipe as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it in his hand when he took out the bung—I could not see the wine exactly—wine did run out into this pail (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the pail came from his shop; I saw him bring it—there was another man with him at a distance of three yards off—that is the sort of pail used by the smiths and engineers—I believe the wine was sherry—I had noticed the prisoner several times the week previous—I could not exactly recognise the other man—there was nothing to obstruct my view of the prisoner; I was three or four minutes observing him—when I found him do this I sprang out, and when they saw me come they both ran away—I spoke to some one else—I went down into the workshop the same day—I did not see the prisoner there; he ought to have been there—he is in the mechanic line—I can't say exactly what his business is; he works amongst the mechanics—I gave him in charge the following morning—I noticed his clothing on the Sunday afternoon—on the Monday morning he wore quite a change of clothing to what he had on on the Sunday—I had seen him several times during the week before—on the Monday he wore different clothes to what I had seen him in at any time before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the police at the docks—I remember on Sunday, 29th July last, from information I received I went to the C jetty at the docks—I found there a cask; the bung had been disturbed and the cask was tilted on one side—the bung had been taken out and replaced—I saw a pail with some sherry wine in it—in consequence of what I heard from Lane I went down to the blacksmith's shop, and from the description he gave me of Pegram I went and asked the timekeeper how many men he had had there—he told me seven—I asked to count them; we counted them—there were six—Pegram was missing—I searched the place through for him; all the shops—I did not find him—I went to his house, about two miles off—he was not there—this tickler was given to me by Palmer, a watchman—the pipe was given me by another watchman, Cocker—I saw Lane again next morning—I took possession of the pail and the wine and produce it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a slight portion of water mixed with it—I saw the prisoner on the following morning about 8 o'clock—he was then given into my custody—I have compared the tickler and syphon with the marks in the bung and they correspond—these instruments are not allowed in the docks—the prisoner being a blacksmith's labourer had access to them—this is not a tool that is used in the docks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you take out the bung? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We knock it on the side of the cask—this is not such a tool as a blacksmith would have; it is such as he could easily procure—when I took the prisoner into custody he said he was not there at the time; that he went over to Poplar—when I was taking him to Ilford gaol he said that he went out at the north gate and had a pint of beer with another man—it was between 12 and 1 o'clock on the Monday morning that he said that—he said that he went at 3 o'clock—the public-houses are supposed to close at 3 o'clock on Sunday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

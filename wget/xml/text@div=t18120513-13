            . I keep a pork shop in Tooley Street, No 208. These things were left in my house on Friday, the 17th of April. The prisoner came to my house and asked my man if she might leave the things there, my man gave her leave.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner - A. On the next day, about one o'clock at noon, she came for them, I asked her whether they were her own things, she asked me why I asked her that question; I said I wished to know; she then said they were not her own, she was to take them somewhere, but did not know the place nor number, she said a Mill Pond Bridge. I said my man should go with her; she took my man to East Lane, she told him they belonged to No. 5, Barker's Row, there were two No. 5. My man brought her back again, she said she lived in Helmet Place, Old Street; I was going to put down the direction; she first said No. 100, and afterward 124. I sent a person to enqire and there is only seventeen houses there; afterwards she owned she was in Phillip Lane, she there met a woman that gave her the things. I sent down to Phillip Lane and found out the owner of these things.</p>

The prisoner came on the 17th to our shop, she asked me leave to let her leave the things, I rather refused her at first, and as soon as she had liberty to leave them she put them down on the block; on the next day she came about one o'clock, she said that she came for the tub that she had the things in, I said if they are your's, but there was a man came in after you left the things and there was a bother about it; then my master came in and cross questioned her about it.</p>

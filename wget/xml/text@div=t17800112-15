               <p>On Tuesday last at three o'clock in the afternoon, as I was coming by <placeName id="t17800112-15-crimeloc76">St. Dunstan's Church in Fleet street</placeName>

The crowd was behind and she stood before me and kept me in the crowd.</p>
               <p>How long did she keep you in that situation - I believe about five or six minutes; I asked her what she kept me there for; she said why do not you go about your business; I said because you will not let me out. I got out by force with her striking me on the stomach; I got beyond the print-shop; I thought of my pocket; I felt my ring and money were gone; the ring and two guineas were in a box; the crown piece was loose in my pocket; they were all gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120030"></xptr>How long before had you felt the box in your pocket? - An hour before she stood before me. All the time there was somebody belonging to her on the side of me where the box and money were; she spoke to somebody in the crowd.</p>
               <p>What did she say to her? - I cannot say; I was in a great fright; I had things of value which belonged to other people in my hand.</p>
               <p>You did not see who she spoke to? - No, I did not; I did not think of her robbing me till after I got out of the crowd.</p>
               <p>When you missed the box out of your pocket what did you do? - I thought to follow her wherever she went, she walked by the side of me.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing to you when she came out of the crowd? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to her when you missed the box? - Yes, I said I had been robbed, and she was the person that had done it, for she struck me up in the crowd; she was sorry for my loss, but why should I suspect her.</p>
               <p>How long did she continue to walk with you? - Till she came to Water-lane; she turned down there; I told her I should have her taken up for she was the person.</p>
               <p>Did you call for any assistance to take her up? - Yes, there was a constable just by, and she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Was she searched? - Yes, they took her to a public-house, and the neighbours all came about me.</p>
               <p>Was any thing of your's found upon her? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of her before you had her taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Your things were never found then? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see her stop to speak to any body after she came out of the crowd? - No. While I was in the public-house, I said I would go and have the advice of a friend; when I returned they told me there had been two women lurking about to see what became of the prisoner.</p>

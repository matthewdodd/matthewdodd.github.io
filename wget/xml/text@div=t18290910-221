            . I am a bookseller. My shop is at No. 3, Great Ormond-street - my father is the principal turnkey at Giltspur-street Compter, and has been there eighteen years; I have had my shop in Great Ormond-street about three months, but I sleep at my sister's, No. 40, Great Alie-street. I first saw the prisoner about seven years ago, in the Giltspur-street Compter - I was living there at that time; when he got out I lost sight of him for some time, but saw him again three or four years ago - I saw him again about three months ago; his wife spoke to me about some books, and I saw him on my calling at his house - on Tuesday, the 4th of August, I met him against the dead wall in the King's-road; he asked if I could purchase any stamps - he took off his hat, and produced some stamps on parchment; I took them in my hand, and saw three 30l. stamps, and some that I concluded to be 10l., and some others at 10s. - they laid in my hand like a pack of cards, one over the head of the other; and the way they laid I was prevented from seeing them completely, but the three thirtys were at the top; I said I could not purchase them myself, but I would see some person about them - he said there were about 1400l. or 1500l. worth: that there were two of 140/. each, and the lot would he sold for 300/.; he said he was going to see a party about them, but they would not be gone by the next morning, if I would call at his house - we parted at that time, and I called at his house the next morning; he was not at home - I left word that I would call again at two o'clock; I went at that time and saw him - I had previously looked into the Times, and several other papers, to see if I could see any account of the stamps, as I concluded they were stolen from some law-stationer's; I saw an advertisement in the Times paper - I went to his house at two o'clock, and saw a list of the stamps which he said were to be sold; he then told me they were prigged, by which I understood they were stolen - having seen the list, I found it corresponded with the advertisement; what made me think it was the same, was the two of 140l. - he again told me the price would be 300/.; I left him and went to dinner, and then went to the Stamp-office - I received some directions there what to do, and went to the prisoner's house about nine o'clock in the evening; I left word I should want a copy of the list - he said if I could call in the morning I should have a copy of it; he then said the price would be reduced, and would be from 200l. to 250l., because a portion of the stamps, amounting to 280l., were not to be sold, and he added, that he should expect something for himself; I told him of course he would have something - I told him I had seen the party, and they would not give more than 170/., or there about - I treated him with a pint of porter; we then parted for the evening, and I agreed to see him again the next morning - I called again between ten and eleven o'clock the next morning; he showed me the list which he had shown me previously, but the stamps at the top were struck out; I made a copy of the list, omitting those which were struck out, by his direction, as he said they would not be included in the purchase - this is the list I made out; I believe it nearly tallies with the list he showed me, with the exception of those struck out at top- I of course cannot swear that it does correspond; he told me that the carriage-plate and pawnbroker's licenses were of no use without they were signed by a magistrate, and that made a reduction of 433/. 5s. - after I had taken the copy we parted; I never, on any occasion, asked to see the stamps - they were shown voluntarily; after I had taken the copy; I went again to his house, after that, because an alteration was made in the list - a nought was struck out in 140, and I went for the purpose of adding that; but in the mean time I had seen Ellis and Ruthven, who were then in the neighbourhood, and they had made some arrangements - I saw the prisoner when I went the last time; I said I wished to see the list again, to rectify an error - he allowed me to see it, and I made the alteration; he then placed it on a table, under the window, under some books or a tea-caddy - I then gave the officers information, but did not go to the house again; I brought the list away that I made, and gave it up to the solicitor of the stamps - I had made some figures on the list that I took this copy from.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. In his, or whose hand-writing was that list? A. I do not know; my father was a turnkey of Giltspur-street Compter, seventeen or eighteen years - I lived there seven or eight years; I cannot say how old I was when I left - I might be about eighteen: I am now twenty-five - I made no particular acquaintance with the prisoner while he was there; they do take in thieves and persons of that description, but my father's apartments are quite separate - I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100100"></xptr>prisoner after he left, but had no particular acquaintance with him till this transaction with the books; it was after he showed them me that I looked into the times - I am quite sure I did not show them to him, and ask if he could get rid of them; I concluded, of course, that they were stolen, and of course I knew there was some danger in possessing them - I have been a bookseller, perhaps, about three months, but I was brought up to the profession of the law; I was with Mr. Forrett, the barrister, as his clerk - that was in 1821, 1822, 1823, and part of 1824; I was not clerk to him as a barrister - I have been with his brother since, Mr. Robert Forrett; I have since then been with Mr. Norton and partner, in the Insolvent Debtors' Court - I am also a painter, and deal in pictures and minerals; the reward stated in the advertisement was 50l. - I never, except on that occasion, saw a single stamp in his possession; I cannot tell whether the paper which was left by the books or tea-caddy, was found by the officers - I was placed, for a short time, to the business of herald engraving, and engaged as a manufacturer of chess, backgammon-tables, and dice-boxes, with a person named Parker, in Plummer-street, City-road; I was with him nine or ten months - we parted on amicable terms; he made no complaint against me, except that I spoiled the work - I do not know Saunders, an attorney; I was never in his employ - after I had been to the solicitor of stamps I went to Ruthven and Ellis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it never occur to you, and did none of them, advise you to bring in some one as a purchaser? A. It was proposed, but it was thought better not; I cannot say who proposed it - there were four or five persons; it might be the solicitor - it was not proposed that I should take some other person to see the same thing, and to confirm what I said; but it was proposed that I should return and look at the list, and then take the person - I recollect Mr. Ruthven proposing that I should take some person as a purchaser, if I did not wish to appear; no one stamp has been found - the prisoner lived on Back-hill, which was in the way from my shop to Great Alie-street: I could not be accommodated with any thing more than the shop at Great Ormond-street - I was going to dine with my father at the Compter, the day I first met him - of course I did not choose to be present when this man was taken up; it was Tuesday when I first saw him, and he was taken on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you had seen the stamps, your notion was that they had been stolen from some stationer? A. Yes - it was the advertisement led me to the Stamp-office; in the list I made there were stamps of 140l., and stamps of 30l. - I lived with Mr. Forrett,(now the barrister) three years and a half, and after with Mr. Robert Forrett, who is an attorney.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was employed by the Stamp-office to detect this robbery; Ellis was first applied to, and he told me about it -I saw Balch, but I think not on the first occasion; Ellis and I took the prisoner - I think on Thursday. the 6th of August; I found this paper in a hat, with a handkerchief upon it - I do not recollect any proposition being made as to the mode in which the discovery should be carried on; we were puzzled how to go on with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many minutes elapsed from the witness coming out of his house and you going in? A. I should think not three - he passed by him, and I went in and searched the prisoner's person; I expected to find the list on his person, but did not - I have seen the writing of law-stationers very much like the writing on this paper; I have seen Balch's writing - it is not like this, according to my view; Balch told me he made the figures at the corner - I have been to the shop in Great Ormond-street, but did not search there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went into the house you left Balch outside, and expected to find the list on the prisoner's person, but found nothing? A. Yes; the hat on which the paper was found belonged to the prisoner - he put the hat on his head, and the handkerchief I believe he put into his pocket.</p>

            . I was sent for by a person from the Stamp-office; I was directed to apply to another person, and I applied to Ruthven; I was with him when the prisoner was taken - I was securing the prisoner at the time he found the paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you remember suggesting the propriety of sending some one with Balch, in order to confirm him a little? A. I am not quite certain - I do not recollect that such a proposition was made; I had several interviews with Balch, chiefly in the solicitor's office.</p>

            . I am solicitor to the Board of Stamps. Balch made a communication on the 5th of August, and Ellis and Ruthven, I believe, were sent to; a consultation was held between them, myself, and Balch, as to the best mode of taking the prisoner with the stamps in his possession - I do not recollect any proposition being made about sending any person with Balch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have said you do not recollect that there was any such proposition? A. I do not remember it - I have heard Balch say there was - he may be right; I cannot contradict it; it did not strike me that there was any thing very singular in what Balch told us - he explained how he became acquainted with the prisoner - it is better to have two witnesses to a fact where you can have them, and perhaps such a proposition might have been made - I do not recollect any meeting at which it was mentioned; if it had been made, I think I should have recollected it.</p>

            . Q. Did I understand you right that you made an invoice of the stamps from the requisition? A. There was an alteration - to the best of my recollection the medicine labels are put first, and I generally put them last - this list, I apprehended, is the same as the invoice - probates and administration stamps have blanks to fill up; the whole amount of them was 1,545l. 10s.</p>

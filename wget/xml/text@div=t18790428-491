                  </hi>. I am manager of the printing-office of William Dougharty, of Great Prescott Street, trading as Dougharty and Co., who have for many years done business for Brown, Gould, and Co., of Oxford Street—at the end of July the defendant called on me with this Mss. which he wished printed, and specimens of circulars we had printed for Brown and Co.—I do not recollect the conversation—afterwards he called again with this quarto circular MSS. and cancelled the other circular in my presence—he said he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187904280052"></xptr>
               <p>would have 1,000 circulars printed—I asked him if Mr. Gould was to pay for them—he said "No"—I asked him if he had recommended him—he said "Yes," or led me to suppose so—I then took the order, printed them, and sent them to him at Sew Bridge Street—we do not give credit to strangers—I did not ask him for a deposit—we generally ask for one-third—we printed the circulars believing he was recommended by Brown, Gould, and Co.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard Mr. Gunnell's evidence at the police-court—I am sure the defendant said he was recommended by Brown, Gould, and Co.—I said at the police-court in reference to the first interview, "I think he said he was recommended by Brown, Gould, and Co."—at the first interview he produced some printed circulars and said, "Were these executed by your firm?"—on the first order for the small circular we only sent a proof—I suppose I am responsible for the orders given, not Gunnell—I should enter the order in the book, and Gunnell would take it from there—I believe I gave the defendant an estimate for work—I said at the police-court, "He (lid not say anything; he answered my questions"—that was the second interview—I believe a letter was sent to the defendant asking for the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but that is the clerk's department—I never sent any one for it—I went with Mr. Abraham Gould and Gunnell to Messrs. Dod and Longstaffe respecting this matter, and gave my evidence—I do not know that an action was commenced by the defendant against Messrs. Gould and Co.; before these proceedings I heard it in the police-court—I believe Mr. Abraham Gould is paying for this prosecution—Gould's people, I believe, asked me what evidence I could give—it is the custom with printers to send a collector for the money as well as the invoice by post—Messrs. Dod and Longstaffe relinquished this matter in favour of Messrs. Wontner.</p>

I am book-keeper and cashier to Dougharty and Co.—the defendant came there in July and had a conversation with Hulse in my presence—he was asked whether he was recommended by Brown, Gould, and Co., and said he was—he then ordered some circulars to be lithographed—he said he should want a great quantity of work done and would give us it—the circulars were sent to him in due course, and the account for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about a month or six weeks after the order—it has not been paid.</p>

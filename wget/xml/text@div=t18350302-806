                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in the Hackney-road. I have known the prisoner six or seven years—she has not been of sound mind during that time—she was not always unsound, but occasionally so—I attended her about four years ago, in consequence of hypochondria—I have attended her several times in a similar way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the nature of her unsoundness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nervousness and melancholy in every way—she appeared to be very religious—she was always rather disposed to melancholy—she behaved with the greatest kind<lb></lb>ness to her children, and was particularly fond of them—I saw her in the early part of December, or the latter end of November—I called in on some business respecting Mr. Thomas Clarke, the brother of Mr. Clarke—I did not see him, but saw Mrs. Clarke—I was in the room about an hour; she appeared in a very melancholy state, so much so, that she never spoke to me—there had been a change in her pecuniary affairs, which appeared to have affected her spirits—I was with her nearly an hour, and she said nothing—I saw both her children—I believe the infant was in her arms part of the time, and sometimes on the carpet—I spoke to the prisoner several times—she made no answer to me whatever—I believe she knew me—I was very much surprised at her conduct, and mentioned it to her friends—I repeatedly asked her what was the matter with her, and got no answer—I considered her in a state of madness—I have not seen her since—I believe at that time she was in a state of melancholy derangement.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Fort-street. I have known the prisoner ten years, and have had frequent opportunities of noticing her conduct and disposition during the whole time, up to this period—her general disposi<lb></lb>tion is reserved—at times I have seen her collected, at other times other<lb></lb>wise—she was often at my house at dinner and tea—when sitting at my table, sometimes, she would be lost in thought, and would turn up her eye balls in a wild way, as if her mind was over powered with some over-whelming idea—this has happened frequently, more particularly lately—I have known her sit a long time without speaking, apparently lost in thought—I saw her three or four days before this happened—she was at my house—I considered her mind then overwhelmed, in a state of derange<lb></lb>ment—not fit to be trusted—if she had been under my care, I should have fastened every window down, and kept every thing out of her way—she kept throwing her eyeballs up, looking melancholy—her conversation was irrational at times; and three days before this happened, her conversation</p>

               <p>was incorrect—the child was with her when she came to my house—she always brought it, and appeared particularly fond of it—when I saw her, three days before, her conversation was incoherent, and her mind was overwhelmed with some idea—she staid late—we were obliged to say, "Now you must go; do go, Mrs. Clarke"—she seemed fearful of going home—we were obliged almost to force her to go—she never complained of her husband—he is a very young man, and very gay—she had 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he married her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Duke-street, Old-artil<lb></lb>lery-ground. I have known the prisoner ten years—she has been in the habit of visiting at my house—I have had opportunities of seeing her con<lb></lb>duct—it has not been always alike—at times I have noticed a strangeness about her—she would sit for a very long while at a time without taking no<lb></lb>tice of any person—I have known her spoken to by persons, and she has not replied—she never came to me but twice without the infant, and ap<lb></lb>peared very fond of it—she came to my house on the 26th of December with the child—her conduct was very strange then—she said, "Mrs. Cole, I feel very ill, in a very low way; I am getting into the nervous way I was in once before: I feel quite alarmed at myself"—she said nothing particular more than that—she looked very ill—her eyes looked very bad—I have seen her very low before at times—she always complained she was fearful of going into the nervous way she had been in before—when she was in that low way, she would sit a long time, then start up, and walk about the room, quite lost—she never talked to me about religion—the last time she was with me, she said she was afraid of herself, and expressed a dread of being left alone—she was always a kind mother to the infant, and was afraid to trust it out of her arms to any one.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner ever since last Novem<lb></lb>ber—she came to stay at my house—she had no home when she first came—on the Friday before this happened, she came to me between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, and stopped all night with the baby—I had weaned the child—on Saturday she asked me to let a child of mine go home with her, and afterwards she declined to go—I went home with her on Saturday night—she had put on her bonnet and cloak, to go home to dinner with the child, but changed her mind, and asked, if she stopped till evening, whether I would go with her, as she had a particular dread of go<lb></lb>ing home by herself—she was generally neat in her person and dress—on this Friday she appeared very respectable—she walked up and down my room on Saturday morning, as if she was distracted, and said she was afraid something would happen to her—I said, "Mrs. Clarke, what is the matter?"—she continued walking to and fro about ten minutes—I then asked her what she was afraid would happen—she said she was getting as bad as she was ten years ago in her head; and her mind was very much distressed, and she was afraid she should attempt to destroy herself—I went home with her at eight o'clock at night—she had put on her bonnet, and said she would go home in the morning, and sat in a very desponding manner for half an hour—she then said, "If you will go with me to<lb></lb>night, I will not go, for I fear going to my place;" and when I went home with her at night, she persuaded me very much to stay with her, saying, if I left her, the devil would begin with her, and she should not have another bit of peaces—I considered her in a state of madness on the Satur<lb></lb>day</p>

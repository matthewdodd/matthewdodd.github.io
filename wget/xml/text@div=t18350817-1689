                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Collins, and live in the parish of St. Leonard, Bromley, in Middlesex. I left our house on the 3rd of July, at ten o'clock at night—I left nobody in the house—I locked the door—the sitting-room window was safe, and fastened inside—all the doors were safely locked—I returned between twelve and one o'clock that night, and found a pane of glass broken in the bed-room window, on the ground floor, and the window was a little way open—it had been unhasped—any body could get into the house—I found the door locked, as I had left it—I missed my husband's hat—I called in a policeman, and then found my drawers open, and missed a gown, three shirts, a petticoat, a bed-gown, a waistcoat, and two child's frocks, which had been in two drawers in the room adjoining the bed-room—there is no door between those two rooms—on the Friday following (the 10th) I saw all the property at Hawes's the pawn<lb></lb>broker's but a child's frock—I know the prisoner—his mother lives nearly opposite us—he does not live with her—he referred me to No. 16, Stepney-causeway—he lodged there—this was on the night of Fairlop fair—I saw him on the saturdy, the day after the robbery, close to my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nearly twelve years old. I remember the night of Fairlop fair—I saw the prisoner that night, just by Mrs. Collins's gate, at a quarter to twelve o'clock—I had been to the Moor's Arms to see what it was o'clock, and it was just a quarter to twelve, and as I came back I saw him—it was just over the way—I saw him immediately I had looked at the colck—we had just come back form seeing the boats that night—the prisoner was standing by Mrs. Collins's gate—he was just by the bed-room window, as near as he is to me now—he had nothing with him at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 9th of July—I told him I wanted him on suspicion of a robbery at Mr. Collins's, at Bromley—he said, as I took him to the station-house, that he did not do the robbery himself, but he knew the parties who had done it—that the two men who had done the robbery had gone to Ports<lb></lb>mouth, and he knew where part of the property was left—that it was at Kirkham's, No. 16, James's-place, Stepney-causeway—he was remanded—I went to Kirkham's and found two duplicates, among several others, referring to Hawes—I went next moring to Hawes's, with Mrs. Collins, and found part of the property.</p>

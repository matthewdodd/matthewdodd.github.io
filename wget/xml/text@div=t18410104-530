               <p>Leather-lane. I was out marketing on Saturday, the 2nd of January—there was a throng of people in Leather-lane—I stood to look at them, and while I was standing still I observed some one at my pocket—I turned round, and the prisoner moved away from me directly—I put my hand into my pocket immediately, and missed 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am quite sure of the prisoner's person—I noticed him enough to know him again—I went and told my husband—he came with me to Leather-lane, and I again saw the prisoner there, standing near a woman, and his coat tail was over her—he had two holes in his pockets—my husband seized him—he said, "What have I done?"—my husband said, "I will let you know in a mi<lb></lb>nute," and gave him into custody for stealing 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—at the station I heard a direction to search him, and he immediately threw down tome shillings on the floor—after I had been robbed, I saw the prisoner's hands were in his pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not state that you went away and left me stand<lb></lb>ing at the place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not give him into custody when I felt his hand in my pocket—there was no policeman at hand, and perhaps if I had made an alarm be would have made off—I was unprotected, and I felt, rather flurried—as soon as he saw me look up he made off.</p>

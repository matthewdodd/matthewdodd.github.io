                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—he is a shoe maker—we live at 3, Bath Street, Bethnal Green Road—we have three children—on Easter Monday we went out together, and during the evening we separated, and he went home first—I went home about half-past two in the morning—he saw me at the door talking to a man—he had been looking for me—he asked me the reason why I was not in doors with my family, and struck me under my mouth—I did not see any knife, but directly afterwards I found my mouth bleeding—it was under the chin—I began crying, and a constable came and took him—we had both been drinking, and I was partly drunk.</p>

I was in Bath Street, heard a woman screaming, and I went to see what was the matter—I found the last witness bleeding under the chin—she said that her husband had stabbed her with something, but she did not know what it was—that was in his presence, and he said he would stab any one that would deceive him as she had done—one of the bystanders said that he had a knife in his hand—I took him to the station, and there fonnd a knife on him—there was a slight stain on it, but I cannot say that it was blood—the wound looked as if it had been done by a sharp instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of '237, Bethnal Green Road—I examined Louisa Creighton, and found an incised wound three-quarters of an inch long, dividing the integuments under the chin—it could not have been done by a blow, but by some sharp instrument, such as this knife—there was fluid blood on it at the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> About one o'clock on Tuesday morning I missed my wife. I went home and lit a candle to see if she was in bed; but, not finding her there, I went to look for her, and found her committing her<lb></lb>self with a man in the open streets. I struck the man, and he ran away, and then I struck my wife with my left hand. She has had no provocation for ever deceiving me. I have always been a good husband, and a good father to my children.</p>

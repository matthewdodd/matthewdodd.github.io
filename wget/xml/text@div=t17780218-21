               <p>On Tuesday, December the 9th, I was robbed on the <placeName id="t17780218-21-crimeloc119">Acton road, near Shepherd's-Bush</placeName>

               <p>Was it light or dark? - Very moonlight.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - I cannot say I had, unless he was the man I met before; he gave me a crooked shilling back, and said, here is a shilling to carry you to London; I told him I had paid the turnpikes; but I took it, and thanked him; it was, however, a bad one; I remembered I had a bad crooked shilling some time before; I told him it was a bad one; he took it again, and gave me another; I asked him to give me the bag again, that it was a bag I had had some time, and he gave it me; he shook me by the hand twice, and bid me a good night; I was as near to him as I could be; he turned back, and I came strait on for London; when I had got about ten or fifteen yards from the place where he robbed me, I turned my head and thought I saw him hold rather off towards the common; I thought he would not go back towards Acton, as I suspected he had robbed the coach I met, but that he would turn off towards town; as I thought I might meet with him at Hyde Park-gate, I gallop'd my horse all the way as hard as he could lay legs to the ground, till I came to Tyburn-gate; then I turned down Park-lane to Hyde Park-gate; I jumped out of the chaise, and I told the man at the gate that I had been robbed; I had a grey horse in the chaise; I took it out and put it behind the house, left if he came up he should know it; I had a large horse-man's great coat on; I went into the little hut at the gate, and laid it down on the table; I had not been there above two minutes before the prisoner came up to the gate; I said to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180024"></xptr> man at the gate, I believe this is the man that robbed me just now; I think this is he; the man flung the gate open, and I walked close up to the horse's shoulders and looked him full in the face; I saw he was the man that had robbed me; the moment I saw he was the man that had robbed me; I struck him with my hand on the face; he fell backwards a little on the horse's hips; I catched hold of him by the collar with my left hand, and pulled him down; when he was down, I struck him, I believe, a time or two in the face; I knocked him down, I believe, two or three times; in the struggle, I observed him put his hand to his pocket; I clapped my hand upon it, and found something hard; I d - d him, and said he had got a pistol there; I catched hold of him with my left-hand, and struck him in the face, and he fell down, and I took the pistol from him; he had not quite drawn it out; I searched him, and found another pistol in his pocket; I took them both from him, and then I led him by the collar into the house.</p>
               <p>[The pistols, which were very small pocket ones, were produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Did you not observe the colour of his horse when he robbed you? - Yes; a dark brown horse with a large white snip in his nose; I did not take so much notice of the horse as I did of his face; when he robbed me, I looked in his face all the while; before I led him into the house, I called out for assistance to the turnpike men, but they refused assistance and d - d me, and said they thought I had beat the man enough; I led him into the house, and tied his hands together with a silk handkerchief; I then brought him out and put him in the chaise, and brought him home to my own door; I gave a gentleman's servant a shilling to ride the prisoner's horse home; coming along the street, he wanted me to let him get out and run away; and said he would give me my money back again.</p>
               <p>What money? - He said he would give me my money back again; the three guineas he robbed me of; I told him if he did not sit quietly, I would tie his legs together; in short, I brought him home to my house, and sent for a neighbour to know what was best to do with him; he said, go before a Justice by all means; two or three neighbours came in, and saw me take him out of the chaise; we took him in a coach to Sir

            's; there is a gentleman here who heard his examination; I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I am very unfortunate in retaining a counsel who does not attend; therefore, I beg leave to ask the witness a few questions:</p>
               <p>I should be glad to know what dress the person was in who robbed you? - He had a brown coat on; I did not take so much notice of his dress as his face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you did not swear, before Justice Addington, that he had a great coat on with a cape buttoned up to his eyes, and a large flapped hat? - I cannot say; I said that he had a large flapped hat, and a long pig tail under his great coat that was not taken out when he came to the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had the person who robbed you a cape buttoned over his face? - He had a cape buttoned up under his chin, and his queue in behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you swear it was buttoned up to his nose or eyes? - I did not say so; it was not so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What conversation passed at the turnpike? - I have told the Court as near as I can possibly remember.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you did not tell me if I would go quietly, you would never prosecute me; but would take me to my friends, and would never hurt me? - No; my Lord, he begged very hard for it, and said he was a merchant's son.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You never promised me you would not prosecute me if I would go quietly with you? - I never promised you any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you are not exceedingly near sighted? - I am very near sighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you are not so near sighted as not to be able to know persons that pass you in the middle of the day? - I can see better in the dusk of the evening when the light is not very glimmering, than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180025"></xptr> in the middle of the day; my ball is too large for my sight when the sun is too glimmering; my eye-sight is very bad; I can see better in the dusk than when the light is very strong.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I was not the first man that came up to the turnpike after he complained of the robbery? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether from the time you took me at the turnpike, till you found the pistols upon me, you did not say, you only believed I was the man? - No; I was positive to him as soon as I went up to his horse's shoulder and looked at him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you ever said you was sure I was the man, till you found the pistols upon me? - I should not have struck him, if I had not been positive he was the man when I looked at him.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether you ever positively said he was the man, till you found the pistol upon him? - When I saw him coming, I said to the turnpike man that I believed he was the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether you ever said to any man before you found the pistol upon him, that is the man who robbed me? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I believe he has said that after he did find the pistol upon me, he never said if I would go quietly with him he would not prosecute me. Was there any other conversation at the turnpike? - I do not recollect that there was; I was alarmed when I found the turnpike men would not assist me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I was the son of a Mr. Dare, and that one of my trustees was Mr. Watkins, in Newport-street; the prosecutor said, Young man you have very good friends, if you will go home with me quietly I will not prosecute you. - I deny that any such conversation passed; he said he was the son of a Mr. Dare, and had good friends; that he was a merchant's son in the city.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You did not mention that you would take me home to my friends, and would not prosecute me? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You choose to swear that positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Who were at your house when I came home? - The persons are here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many were there of them? - My house was pretty much crouded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many went to Sir

               <p>I kept the turnpike, at Hyde-parker corner, the night this affair happened. Mr. Lucas came riding up Piccadilly very fast; he jumped out of the chaise; I helped him off with his great coat; I asked him what was the matter? he said, he had been robbed, and the highwayman was coming; I immediately shut the gate as he desired me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180026"></xptr> In the space of about a minute the prisoner came up on horseback. I had the key in my hand; Mr. Lucas said, I believe this is the man. I went and opened the gate; Mr. Lucas followed me close. As the prisoner came through the gate, I asked him for the toll; he said, he had paid me in the morning. Mr. Lucas came up directly, and catched him by the coat with his left hand, and struck him; he was then rather behind the prisoner; I was standing at the horse's shoulder; he repeated his blow twice; he struck him as hard as he could, and made the horse reel; then he pulled him down on the ground, and beat him unmercifully, and he called out to the turnpikemen to assist him; I was by him all the time; I said you don't want any assistance to beat the man; let him get up on his legs, and take him to the toll-house; he then dragged him across the street on his back; when he was down he had his knees on him, and kept beating him in the face; I said, what signifies beating the man? let him get up, and take him into the toll-house. At last he got him to the toll-house, and the prosecutor was there with him, I believe, twenty minutes; he tore the skirt of his coat off, and would have beat him in the toll-house, if we would have let him; he asked us for something to tie the prisoner's hands. The prisoner then called Mr. Lucas by his name several times; by what means he knew him I don't know, though, I believe, he had told him that his name was Lucas; when he had tied the prisoner's hands, he asked him who he was? The prisoner told him his name was Dare; the prosecutor said, you are but a young man.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say where he lived? - I don't recollect that he did. Mr. Lucas then said, I will take you home to your friends, young man; he repeated that several times, and that he would shew him mercy on that account; he asked him for the three guineas; the young man never confessed having the three guineas, or that he had robbed him, or any thing of it. Mr. Lucas took him in the chaise, and Sir

               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether Mr. Lucas did not say at the turnpike, that if I would go with him, he would not hurt me? - He did say so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I not say that Mr. Watkins was my trustee? - He might say that, but I don't recollect it.</p>

               <p>I keep a fruit shop. As I was standing in my little shop, at the back of the turnpike, I heard a great noise; I ran round to the gate; Soker was then taking the toll of the gate; I said for God's, sake, what is this gentleman beating the man so for? Soker said, he says, he believes he is a highwayman. I begged of Mr. Lucas not to beat him so; Mr. Lucas was standing over him. I desired him to get off, for he was repeating his blows as fast as possible; I got him up, and Mr. Lucas went to repeat his blows again. The prisoner staggered up against the wall; he again attempted to strike the prisoner, and several blows came upon my shoulders and arms; I said he should not beat him so; I kept him off; I asked him if he was sure that the prisoner was the man; he said he believed he was the man; I said he should not beat him so, if he was not sure, he might kill the man; he said again, he believed he was the man, but he was not sure that he was; then he wanted the prisoner to strip; I said, No; I had got him safe in my hands, and he should not; I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180027"></xptr> if you think he is the man, why don't you search him? Why do you stand damning and swearing here? he is as quiet as a lamb. Then Mr. Lucas put his hand to his right-hand pocket; he found something, and said, here is a pistol here; he took hold of his coat with both hands, and tore the stap intirely off; I said to him, Sir, why do you so? you might blow one's brains out, taking such a sudden jerk as that; why don't you search his pocket? then he put his hand into the prisoner's pocket, and took out a pistol. Now, says he, I am almost sure that you are the man. Mr. Lucas then d - d and swore very much, and tried to repeat his blows upon him; I told him he should not strike him, nor no man should while he was in my care; he d - d me for a rascal, and asked me who I was? then he took another pistol out of the prisoner's pocket. Mr. Lucas did not seem to be positive throughout the whole that he was the man. Then the prosecutor stamped and swore, and tore about very much, and said, that he was a better man than him. The young fellow (the prisoner) stood very quiet; he made no resistance in the world. Mr. Lucas took out a handkerchief, and tied his hands. The prisoner called Mr. Lucas by his name. Mr. Lucas asked what he was when he came a little to himself? The prisoner said, that his name was Dare, and that his father was a timber merchant in Long Acre. He begged very much for mercy, and the prosecutor said he would take him home to his friends, and would shew him mercy, and not hurt him, he repeated that seven or eight times; we were then very happy within ourselves, to think that the young man had fallen into such good hands that would not hurt him, after beating him in the cruel manner he had done; then we conducted him to the chaise, and Mr. Lucas said, he would take him home to his friends, and would not hurt him, but would shew him mercy; therefore we took no more notice of it.</p>

               <p>From the Prisoner. Did I make any confession at the turnpike? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Because the word mercy might convey tan idea as if I had made a confession; was not the word mercy relative to his beating me?</p>
               <p>Court. What did you understand by the word mercy? - From his beating him.</p>

I asked where he was? he said at my house; I went with him; we met Campbell, and went to the prosecutor's house; the prisoner said, Good God! is it come to this - Mr. Lucas, you will not prosecute me? I said I believed he could do nothing else; the prisoner said again, Good God! you will not prosecute me. Did not you promise not to prosecute me?

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I have a great many other gentlemen here; if your Lordship thinks it necessary, I will call them. I think the evidence of the prosecutor much contradicted by the rest of the witnesses. I desired mercy when he was beating me. I never made any confession at any time. The prosecutor is so very short-sighted, that he did not know the turnpikeman the next day, though he was with him in the toll-house for half an hour; yet he swore that he never saw him.</p>

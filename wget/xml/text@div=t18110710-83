On the 21st of last month I received information that the prisoner was robbing us, that I should find three pieces of lead, I did so, and saw them, about three o'clock, two of them pieces of lead were taken away. About a quarter before nine o'clock the prisoner came to shut up the premises, I watched him, I desired the servant to inform him, when he had shut up the shop to ring the bell. After he had shut up the premises, I saw him go to the lower part of the premises, he returned and rang the bell, the servant came down, he said to her

             every thing is done up as tight as a bug in a rug, good night; I then pursued him across the road, brought him back and told him that he had got property that did not belong to him. I shook him by the collar, he let this lead fall from him on the ground, he begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>HANNAH TOMKINS. I saw the prisoner brought back; when master shook him this piece of lead fell from him, and the two lesser pieces I saw him put on the window out of his pocket.</p>

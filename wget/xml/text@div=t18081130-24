On the 31st of October last, I left the house to go to my employment, I returned home at seven; I found these articles gone; I was informed the prisoner had been enquiring for me, she formerly had lived in the house as a lodger; on the 1st of November about one o'clock, I saw this girl in Harrow alley, Petticoat lane; I asked her what she wanted at my house and what she wanted with me; she told me she had not been there, and she wanted nothing of me; I told her she had been there; I had a strong suspicion that she had robbed me of the things I had lost; she denied it; I sent for an officer. She confessed every thing at the office.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of November, I took the prisoner in custody; she was crying very much, she said she had pawned the things. I asked her what she had done with the money; she produced ten shillings, she said that was part of the money she had pawned them for at Mr. Langar's; she had this bonnet on her head, which the prosecutrix claimed; I think she said she had destroyed the duplicate. I searched her and could not find it.</p>

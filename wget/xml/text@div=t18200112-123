            . I am watchman in Barton-lane, Ealing. On the 10th of January I was calling two o'clock, a cart came towards me, the prisoner was driving it. I asked him what he had got in it? he said hog potatoes, that he was going to London, and had brought them from Southall. I asked him why he came that road? he said Brentford was a better road than to go through Hanwell. He hesitated, and said his master was coming up - I told him to stop his horse till his master came up. He said,</p>
               <p>"Now, now, we shall all be transported!" He got up in the cart, put his feet on the tail-board, broke it to pieces, and threw out six sacks of turnips on the ground. I said if he touched the cart again I would shoot him - he ran away. He gave me the name of

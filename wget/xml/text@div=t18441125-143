                  </hi>. I am in the service of Edmund Pontifex and William Pontifex—the prisoner was in their employ about six months—these screws, nuts, and sheet copper, are Messrs.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 106.) I saw the prisoner on Saf<lb></lb>fron<lb></lb>hill, on the night of the 19th of Nov., a little after eight o'clock—I I noticed his pockets, and took hold of his arm—he ran off, but I overtook him, and took him to the station—I found in his pockets these articles, which are produced—I learned from him that he was in Mr. Pontifex's service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Since I have been in custody, Mr. Pontifex has discharged one man, because he would not come and take a false oath as to the things in my custody; the man that has come has no more proof about them than the man that has been discharged; he had a great deal more of them in his possession than this man has, and he would not take a false oath; I never was in custody before; my father is a poor man, and has been out of work, or I could have had friends to come for me; I have got a job to go to with my uncle, if I were out of the hands of the police; I worked as hard as any lad from morning till night, and I could not earn more than 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a<lb></lb>week; I took it all home, where there are three more children, younger than myself; we have sometimes had nothing but potatoes for dinner.</p>

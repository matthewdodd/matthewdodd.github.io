                  </hi>. I am traveller for the firm of Francis Henries Gregory, No. 27, Cheapside. I went to Greenwich on business, on 19th Nov., in a four wheeled <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>—I had a great deal of lace with me, and other property of my employers—I showed it to a customer there—I then put this parcel of lace under my feet in the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>—it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I I returned home to Cheapside about half past 5 o'clock—the lace was safe at my feet all the time—I went into the warehouse for about a minute, and when I returned the parcel was gone—these are the articles—our private mark is on the cards.</p>

I said, "Cards;" he said, "Let me see," and he took me to the station; I did not know the goods were stolen.</p>

Haines said, he was head constable, and Hall said, he was a con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190012"></xptr>stable, and that they would take me to the watch-house; they dragged me through Hammersmith; I told them that I had a licence, and if they would come to the light, I would shew it to them; they took me into a dark lane. I said, I would give them all the money I had got if they would let me go; they said they would not till they got to the watch-house. Haines asked me if I was ever on board a ship, I said, yes; he took two pieces of black stuff from me; when they came to a house in the lane, they hallooed out, and a man let them in-Hall beat me in his presence. The woman went for a constable. I had two pieces of Irish which they took from me. I produced my licence, and wanted to go out for a constable; I got out, and met the constable, he asked me if I had not been robbed, I told him I had. I was in great alarm. I might have dropped my money. I am sure the prisoners are the men; I went back with the constable. The master of the house said he would fetch him. I believe the door was open; they did not attempt to hinder me from going out. Hall stopped in the house. The constable took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. It was in the high road. I told them that I had a licence; I was quite sober; I asked the women to give me a bottle, and I would get some liquor, in order to get away. Hall said he would be five-pence towards some gin, and the prisoner Haines, went with me to look for the constable; we found Hall still within the house. The woman of the house is not here, because she is in labour. I did not know that it was necessary to bring her husband.</p>

            . I am a corn merchant. In consequence of information I went to the Admiral Keppel, on Chelsea-common, on the 18th of November: Dunford is <rs id="t18311201-67-deflabel376" type="occupation">ostler</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have many sacks of this description? A. Yes, and whether that was taken from my premises that day, or any other, I cannot tell; black oats are not uncommon - when I spoke to Dunford he said he knew nothing at all about them.</p>

            . I keep the Admiral Keppel. Dunford supplied the horses there with corn, on his account - he had been with me about three years; the sack was found in the small shed, which is used to keep sacks and small articles in - there were a few black oats in the sack, and some white ones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did this shed belong to Dunford? A. It is appropriated to his use, and is generally locked, but was not then; the sack appeared to have been used both for black and white oats.</p>

I know Dunford by sight - on the 18th of November I saw a cart near his premises: I did not see the name on the cart, but I know it belonged to Mr. Wright, and Knight was driving it - I stopped opposite the stable, and saw Knight take a sack from the copse of the cart, and carry it into the stable; it appeared full - he came out again, shut the door, and left the sack there; I did not see Dunford there.</p>

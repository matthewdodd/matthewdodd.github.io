                  </hi>. I am a police inspector. I went, on 23rd March, to a house, No. 3, in Unicorn-court, Kent-street, Borough, about 10 o'clock in the morning—we gained admission through the adjoining house, and we proceeded to the house in question, and to the first floor room—the door was fastened, and serjeant Richards commenced breaking it with a sledge hammer—on his doing so, the top part of the door gave way, and I had an opportunity of seeing what was going on inside—I saw White jump on a table which was under the window, and he jumped out of the window on a roof, and he was followed by Cockran—when we gained admittance, Nevill followed them in the same way; he jumped out of the window on</p>

               <p>the roof, and pursued the prisoners, who were soon afterwards brought back—on the table which I saw the prisoners jump on, there were nine half-crowns, twelve florins, 129 shillings, and 125 sixpences; and on the floor near the table, I found an oyster shell containing lampblack and oil, which is used to take the bright hue off the coins—White had jumped out of the window without his hat, and when he was brought back he asked me for his hat, and he pointed out to me where to find it; it was behind the partition—I gave it to him.</p>

I went on the 23rd, with the other witnesses, to the house in Unicorn-court—I went to the first floor room, and found the door fast—I broke it open with a sledge hammer—I saw the two prisoners getting out of the window—Cockran got out first, to the best of my belief—they were both on the push on the table to get out—they were near together—I saw them brought back—I found in the room eleven half crowns, seven florins, ten shillings, and twenty-two six-pences, and some tissue paper was hung upon a string in front of the window—I have been in the habit of passing by that house lately, and have seen both the prisoners up that court, perhaps three or four times a week.</p>

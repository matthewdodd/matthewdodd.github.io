On Saturday the 23d of April last, about 4 in the Afternoon, my Wife had fetch'd down a Bag of Money, to change 2 or 3 Guineas for a Customer, and being in a Hurry, she put it into a Seat in the Bar, which had no Lock to it, and while she was busy about the House, the Prisoner (as we afterwards found) took that Money, and went away with it. I advertiz'd it in the Evening Post, of Tuesday, April 26. by which Means I with the Prisoner in Duke-Street, Picadilly; and got between 40 and 50 l. of my Money again, which he at last confest was mine, tho' for a long Time he deny'd that he had ever seen me before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sarch thus depos'd. I live in Germain-street, near St. James's Church. The Prisoner came to my Shop on Monday Morning to buy a Holland Shirt, we agreed for 7 s. and then he asked if he could not have Ruffles set upon it, I told him-Yes. Then says he, I want some Scarlet Camblet for a Suit of Cloths. - Upon this I began to view my young Gentleman, and finding that he had got a Sword by his Side, and but indifferent Rigging, I asked him where he came from He told me from Dublin. Which Way, Says I. Why from Dublin to Cork, says he, and so to West-Chester: But why did you come without better Apparel, says I. Why, says he, my Father and I disagreed, and so I left him. - But how many Yards will make me a Suit? I don't know exactly, says I, but I'll call down my Taylor, and he shall take Measure of ye, which was quickly done. I must go to the Play to Night, says he, and therefore pray let the Ruffels be set upon my Shirt time enough. - Have ye ne'er a Coffee-House or Tavern here-abouts. Yes says I, there's a Tavern hard by. He went thither, and cameback in about half an Hour, a little Fuddled, and said he had drank three Pints of Mountain. - Then he went in the Neighbourhood, and hir'd a Lodging, for which he gave half a Guinea earnest, and returning to my House, and seeing a young Woman there, he invited her to go and take a Glass with him, but she refusing, he said he'd sent for a Pint home. I told him he should send for none to my House, but however he went to the Tavern himself, and sent a Pint over. - When he came back again, he went up to lye upon my Bed, and let fall a Bag of Money. I took it up, and counting it over before Witness, found there were 40 Guineas and an half, 2 Moidores, and half a Broad-piece in it. I had a violent Suspicion of my Spark, and while he laid upon the Bed, I look'd over the Advertisement in the Weekly Journal, and found one that to my thinking, answer'd the Description of the Boy, with Directions to carry the Person to Mr. Webster, in King-street. When the Prisoner got up, I began to talk with him, and shew'd him the Advertisement, he look'd on it, and said, I am not the Boy. - Well, then says I, will ye go with me to Mr. Webster, he read the Advertisement again, and after a little Pause, he consented. We went, but Mr. Webster did not know him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Webster thus depos'd. A young Gentleman having left his Father, the Father desir'd me to let him advertise for his Son to be brought to me, that he might be expos'd as little as possible. It was I suppose upon reading this Advertisement that Mr. Sarch brought the Prisoner to me; but tho' he was not the right Person, I thought there were many suspicious Circumstances in his Case, and therefore I privately desir'd Mr. Sarch to take care of him, for at least a Day or two longer, and I did not doubt, but that I should make some Discovery. Accordingly next Day I examin'd the News Papers, and found the Prosecutors Advertisement, by which means I found him out, and brought him to the Prisoner. Is this your Servant, Sir, says I. Yes, Sir, says he. What's that's you say, Sir, (says the Prisoner to him) do you pretend to know me, and thus he brazen'd it out for a long while, but having search'd him, and taken the Money from him, he at last confest that the Prosecutor was his Master, and that he had robb'd him of that Money. We have since heard that the Prisoner was this time 12 Month, try'd at this Place, for stealing a Guineas of

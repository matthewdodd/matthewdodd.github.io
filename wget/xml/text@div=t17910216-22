Lucas and Spencer years; I was coming from dinner, I live in King-street, Seven Dials, their shop is in Phoenix-street, St. Giles's, about half after two o'clock; I went into White Lion-street, which is the way to the shop, and I met the prisoner with the kettle in his hand, coming towards me; it is better than a quarter of a mile, half a mile I should imagine; when he saw me, he immediately put the kettle on his head, I was in the dress of a lamp-lighter, in a greasy jacket; I am perfectly satisfied he saw me, he was about seven yards off, I walked up to him and met him, and I asked him whose work he was going to do, and who he was going to help; he then gave me a good many sawcy answers, which induced me to think he had stolen the kettle; he told me cheeks, that was the word he said; I followed him across the Seven Dials into Short's Gardens, at the corner of Belton-street in Short's Gardens; he took the pot off his head, and set it down under a grocer's window; I then passed him up Short's Gardens, he then came out into the middle of the street, and beckoned as if to somebody, I cannot say whether he saw me or not; I then turned myself about in order to come at Short's Gardens again towards him, he had then taken the kettle up again, and was coming towards me with the kettle on his head; I laid hold of him and said, now young man, where are you going with that kettle? he told me to ask his a - ; I still held him by the collar; I said, you rascal, I believe you have stolen this kettle, it is my master's property; (I knew it to be so at first by a particular bruise) he then said his brother-in-law gave it to him; he refused to tell me his name, I took him to the watch-house; says I, that is where your brother-in-law lives you rascal, and he was committed; I left the kettle at the watch-house till six o'clock; I took off the cover and found oil in it.</p>

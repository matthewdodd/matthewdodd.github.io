                  </hi>. I live at Mr. William Simmons's, at No. 8, Marlboro'-place, in the parish of Newington—I think that is the only name. I am his servant of all-work—he is a barrister, it is his dwelling-house—on the 3rd of March I went to bed, at near twelve o'clock—I fastened the doors, and barred the back door leading to the yard—I made all the doors safe when I went to bed—I was awoke between two and three o'clock in the morning by my mistress—I went down stairs to open the back door, at there was a noise at the door—I opened it, and saw the prisoner and an officer—a pannel was out of the door—the bar which had crossed the pan<lb></lb>nel inside was taken away—it was a wooden bar—I saw the bar afterwards outside the door, against the water-butt—the officer took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman of the Walworth station, P division. I know Mr. Simmons's house—it is in the parish of Newington—I have not heard any other name for it—on the 3rd of March, I was walking along the Walworth-road—I turned down Hanover-street, and heard wood crack<lb></lb>ling as if it was on fire—I immediately went to the garden wall of the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house, and heard somebody whispering—I immediately jumped down, and saw a person making his escape—I ran towards the back door, and sprang my rattle—I looked towards the left, and saw a person jump over the wall; he escaped—I turned to the right, and saw the prisoner standing in a corner about four yards from the door where the pannel was cut out—he was in a corner of the yard—I took hold of him, brought him about half-way across the yard, and heard something like iron drop from him; and about half a yard from there I found a bunch of six skele<lb></lb>ton keys, and a small crow-bar—I found a knife on the step where he was standing, and a gimblet I found on the water-butt—I found the pannel of the back door cut out and lying on the steps—the servant opened the door to me—I went into the house, but could see nothing amiss there—I saw the bar standing against the water-butt, about three yards from the back door—it was not the same water-butt as the gimblet was on—I brought the bar away with me—I took the prisoner to the station-house, and searched him—I found a piece of crape on his person—whether it was to put over his face as a mask I do not know—I found a box of matches on him; they are called "lucifers," on the label of the box—this dark-lantern was found there, but not by me—I found the other things that night while the prisoner was there, and the gimblet—I found the matches and crape on him—he was locked up in the station-house.</p>

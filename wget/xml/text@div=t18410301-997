                  </hi>. I am constable of the parish of Wimbledon—I have a house and mill on Wimbledon-common—I was at home about five o'clock in the afternoon of Saturday, the 12th of September last—I saw a four-wheel gentleman's private carriage, drawn by two horses, just against Mr. Currie's, nearly a quarter of a mile from my place—it was on the road which turns off the high road, leading to the mill, about 100 yards from the high road which leads from Wandsworth to Wimbledon—I saw two gentlemen coming from it, making their way further on the com<lb></lb>mon—they divided, one went into Wandsworth parish, and one remained in Wimbledon—about the same time I saw another carriage on the high road—the two carriages were about a quarter of a mile apart—I saw two gentlemen come from that carriage, and divide, one meeting the other in Wandsworth parish, and one going into Putney parish—I then suspected it was a duel, and called my wife upon the stage of the mill to watch—I attended to the mill for a few minutes—as soon as my wife called to me, and said she thought it was a duel, I went into the house and got my staff, with intent to go to the ground—I went towards the ground where the gentlemen were then assembled, and in the act of firing—there were four gentlemen there, two were firing—there were two shots fired just as I got to my gate, which is 220 yards from the ground—I heard the noise—I then advanced towards the spot—I got within about fifteen yards of the spot when the second shots were fired—two of the gentlemen were standing side face to each other, about twelve yards apart, and two were to the right of them—I heard two reports—I thought the gentleman nearest me was wounded, because he put his hand to his head, and stood limping, for that reason I went to the furthermost—I afterwards under<lb></lb>stood the wounded man to be Captain Tuckett—the other one that was standing with his face sideways was Lord Cardigan—I do not see any of those who were on the right, to be positive.—(<hi rend="italic">At the request of Captain Douglas, three gentlemen were allowed to sit with him is the bar</hi>)—I went up to Lord Cardigan—I know nothing more of my own knowledge as to the gentleman being hit—I did not see any</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Hunt Dann—I was at home about five o'clock on the 12th of September last—I had not observed any thing before my husband spoke to me—my husband gave me some intima<lb></lb>tion—in consequence of that, I went to the slage of the mill—I saw five gentlemen in different directions on Wimbledon Common—I cannot say how far they were asunder—I saw one carriage standing on the road leading to the mill, and one on the high road—there were two gentlemen stooping down opposite the gate of the mill, about two hundred yards from the mill—they were stooping down three or four minutes—they got up again when they had been down three or four minutes—there was no other gentlemen near them—the others were walking at a distance, where they were before—they then drew near to the gentlemen who had been kneeling down—they were beckoned to by the two gentlemen who had been kneel<lb></lb>ing down, and they hastened towards them—when they came up, the two that beckoned them, handed each of them a pistol—upon that, the two gentlemen who had received the pistols, turned a side face to each other, and fired—there were two pistols fired—I heard two reports near each other—about that time I gave information to my husband, immediately after the first shot—he was just outside the gate—I called to him to run—he was going to<lb></lb>wards them—I did not go any nearer—I saw another shot fired—I was still standing on the same place, on the stage of the mill—the second shots were fired as soon as they had received the second pistols—they stepped a few paces and got the pistols, and then stepped back into the same place—the fifth man was standing at a greater distance, at the end of Mr. Currie's garden, about two hundred yards from the others—the garden is between the high road from Putney to Wimbledon and our mill—after the second shots had been fired, I remained on the stage of my mill—the gentlemen moved towards the mill—two came first, and three afterwards—I saw the two that came first, move from the spot where the firing had been, towards the mill—they went past the mill into our house—I was still upon the</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and am the son of Thomas Hunt Dann. I was at home about five o'clock in the evening of the 12th of September—I was with my mother, on the stage of the mill—I observed two carriages, one was on the road leading from the high towards our mill from the common, and the other on the high itself—I saw five gentlemen when J was at the gate, and they were on the common; two in one part, two in another, and one by himself, at the cor<lb></lb>ner of Mr. Currie's garden—the first two were on the common together, and the other two were together—the first two were in Wimbledon parish, and the other two were in Putney parish—the two parties separated, and walked about for a little while—one of each party then joined, they went and knelt down together—I saw them get up, and go and stand back to back—the other two were walking about at that time—the two that knelt down then walked five or six paces, and beckoned to the other two—when the two were beckoned to they were separate, and two gentlemen came up ac<lb></lb>cordingly—when they came up, they each took a pistol and fired at each other—they stood side-face—there were two shots fired—it was both toge<lb></lb>ther—I am sure there were two reports—there were two smokes from the pistols—the reports were together—it was one sound, as if it had been one pistol—I then came down from the stage of the mill, and went behind my father about fifty yards—we were going towards them—as we were going, I saw and heard another shot—it sounded as one—there were two smokes—when I got to the gentlemen I found one of them was wounded, and I saw the fifth man undo his trowsers—I saw some blood just on the hip—the gentleman put his hand to his side, and walked very limping—I went with them to our mill—I walked with all of them—one was gone for a carriage—two of the gentlemen walked on, and two were behind with my father—I saw them both upon the ground, and walking towards our house</p>

I was so in Sep<lb></lb>tember last—a little before six o'clock in the evening of the 12th of Septem<lb></lb>ber last two cases of duelling-pistols were given me by Dann the miller—I have still the custody of them—they are here—I know Lord Cardigan—he came into the station before the pistols were delivered—I know nothing of the duel—Captain Douglas was with Lord Cardigan—he gave his name, "John Douglas, Captain of the 11th Hussars," by word of mouth—that was on Saturday evening, before there was any inquiries before the Justices—they did not go before the Justices till Monday morning—I took down the charge from Dann, who gave charge of them—it was taken in writing—I have not got it here—I was not ordered to bring it—I had it at the House of Lords—I took down Captain Douglas's address, "At Lord Cardigan's, No. 26, Portman-square"—I took down what Captain Douglas said in writing, in the original sheet, which is always sent in to Whitehall—I took down the name of Captain Douglas in writing, as well as the charge pre<lb></lb>ferred by Dann against Lord Cardigan and Captain Douglas—I know the person of Captain Douglas—he is the second gentleman sitting, from here, in the bar—Lord Cardigan and he were together in the station till they were bailed, which was almost immediately after—when Lord Cardigan came in, he said he was a prisoner, he believed—I said, "What for?"—his lordship put his hand into his pocket to give me a card, and he dropped some—I took them up—he gave me one—he said he was a prisoner, he believed—I said, "What for?"—he said, he had been fighting a duel, he believed, and as Captain Douglas came up the steps, he pointed his fingers over his shoulder, and said, "So is this gentleman also, my second, Captain Douglas"—a' part of the conversation took place before Captain Dougras came up; and Lord Car<lb></lb>digan said he was a prisoner, he believed—Captain Douglas could hear that—he was close euough to have heard it—I do not remember that he</p>

On the 28th of August, about eleven o'clock, I observed a boy going out of the shop; I went out and saw the prisoners in the street - I was going after them to know what they wanted, when Levesque threw down these handkerchiefs out of his apron; they were all loose; he then ran off - I caught hold of Newton, who was with him; I gave him to Collins; he did not say anything - we took him and the handkerchiefs back into the shop - they had been at the further end of the counter, quite away from the door, on a brass rail; there are sixty-nine of them.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I saw the prisoners run from the door-post of the prosecutor's shop - I did not see them in the shop - I did not see anything in their hands - I saw Mackie running out of the shop; I turned and saw the two prisoners ten or twelve yards behind me - Levesque dropped the handkerchiefs, and I took them up.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see them come from the shop? A. Yes, from the door; they were both together, and were walking; Newton was caught before he ran, and Levesque directly.</p>
               <p>Newton put in a written defence, stating that he was merely looking in at the prosecutor's window, and that his fellow-prisoner was unknown to him.</p>
               <p>Levesque's Defence. I was walking along and a man called me to earn a few half-pence; he told me to stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050096"></xptr>while he got a parcel, and he went and got these for me to carry.</p>
               <p>Newton received a good character.</p>

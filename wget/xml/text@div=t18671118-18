                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 3, Ludgate Hill—on Friday, the 8th November, the prisoner came to my establishment and spoke about a ring that he had seen the night before; he said he should like to see it—I showed him a tray full of rings—he looked at them, but did not touch them—he asked the price of one he had seen the night before—I referred to my book and told him the price—he spoke about an order that ho had men<lb></lb>tioned the night before as to some spoons and forks—he had been in several times—he asked me if I would send a ring that he selected on the follow<lb></lb>ing morning for his wife to see—he gave me his address, 11, Craven Street—after he was gone I missed a ring, not that ring—I gave directions to my assistant immediately.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>did not say that he was going to Regent Street, but I think he said he would bring an impression back—he gave his name, "Mr. Braine, 11, Graven Street"—at the time I was showing him the rings he had no handkerchief or anything on the table—I noticed he had nothing.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. West—on the day in ques<lb></lb>tion I received certain orders from him—I went to an address that was given me, and I saw the prisoner come out of 11, Craven Street—I watched him, he went to Mr. Whistler's, into the private office, and then to Mr. Attenborough's—he there rang the office-bell and went into the office—I went into the front shop and made some communication to the assistant—I then went into the back room and saw the prisoner, and when he saw me he said the ring belonged to Mr. West—this is the ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is Mr. West's property—I received it from Mr. Attenborough's assistant—it is worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Attenborough, pawnbroker, of 32, Strand—on this Friday the prisoner came to our shop and produced this ring—he asked me the value of it—I asked him who it belonged to, and he declined to say—he said, "I simply want to know the value of the ring," and he did not think we were gutting a proper question to him—I had previously had some description Of the ring—I called in Mr. Steadman and said, "Is that the gentleman it belongs to?" and he said, "Yes, it is"—nothing further took place—he was given into custody.</p>

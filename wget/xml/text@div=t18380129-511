                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Clark, he is a warehouseman, living at St. Pancras. I saw the prisoner, between four and five o'clock on the 11th of January, at the White Bear-tap—I was attending there—he came in, and appeared as though he had hurt his leg—three females followed him in directly afterwards, and said they hoped he was not hurt—he said, no, what would they take—one said a small glass of brandy—he gave me a crown-piece—it was a bad one—I refused it—he gave me a half-sovereign—I gave him a crown, half-crown, and 25.3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in a minute after he asked me to give him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the half-crown—I feel sure the half-crown I gave him was good, but I could not swear it was not the same he gave me back—I suspected he had changed it for a bad one, and asked a gentleman to give me change for it—he refused it—I returned it to him—the gentle<lb></lb>man advised me to send for an officer—the prisoner said it was the same I had given to him—I was certain it was not, and he threatened to sum<lb></lb>mons me for it the next morning—I then sent for an officer; and while he was being kept, he attempted to swallow the half-crown, but was pre<lb></lb>vented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. On the first examination she stated that I offered no crown but only the half-sovereign. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I stated the same that I do now.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present—this half-crown was handed to me to give change—it was handed back to the prisoner—he took it in his hand and walked about, and then I saw something in his mouth—one of the people seized him, and it fell from his mouth—a young man caught it and marked it, and gave it to the officer.</p>

               <p>the prisoner was searched—he then appeared very ill, and retched, and two crown-pieces and one halfpenny came out of his mouth—they were warm tod smoking with heat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He said he was not positive that they came from my mouth—he saw them on the ground. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He had been stripped naked before, and they could not have come from any part of his body but his mouth—they were warm and wet, and he was retching at the time—his face was down.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at Guildhall when the prisoner was searched—after he had been searched, and his clothes put on again, I saw him retch very much, and I watched him very closely—I saw him going to pat his right hand up to his mouth, but I prevented him by knocking it down, and two five shilling pieces and one halfpenny came out from his mouth.</p>

I did not say so—I am a cabinet-maker by trade, and live at No. 7, Evan<lb></lb>gelist-court—I never had such a job in my life before.</p>

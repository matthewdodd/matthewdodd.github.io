On the 18th of January the prisoner came to me and wanted to hire a harness on the following day to try a horse, for which he paid 2s.; he was to be home that evening, and if he was late was to send it home next morning - I had seen him before, and knew him well; next day, a man who had been with him came with a note, stating that he wanted another harness for a friend of his, who was going a few miles to try a horse, and would return it to-morrow; I questioned the man and let him have the harness - I received another note on the Monday - (I do not know in whose handwriting;) it stated that he had been detained, but would return on the Monday with the harness; the value of the first harness I lent to the prisoner was 2l.; I never saw him again till this day week, when I took him into custody - he seemed to have no knowledge of me; I said,"You recollect the harness" - he then offered to give me the key of his furniture, and do any thing if I would let him go; he said I had better take some remuneration than to prosecute him - he did not deny having it; nothing was said about the other harness.</p>

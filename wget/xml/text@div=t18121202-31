               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you recollect his being at your house on the 7th of October - A. Yes, I do. I conveyed him there. He came to sleep at my house with my permission. He went to bed along side of me. He got up early in the morning, between four and five.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. And after sleeping there what happened - A. He got up, and took two coats, and a hat, away, and two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they your property - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him get up, or was it without your knowledge -

            I was asleep. When I awoke in the morning he was gone. I went in search of him. I did not find him until eight days after. I apprehended him myself, going up Holborn. I charged a constable with him: and when I got him to the watchhouse I told him it was for robbing me. He owned to it.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he get out of your house - A. I should suppose he opened the door; it locked inside. I locked it myself. He saw me lock it.</p>

            . I am a patrol in Bloomsbury parish. On the morning after Henry Thomas was robbed, he said he had been robbed by a black man. I could not find him. He gave me every discription of him, told me if I saw him to take him up. Eight days after I heard the cry of, stop thief. I ran, and stopped the prisoner. He had the prosecutor's hat on his head. I took the hat to Marlborough-street office, and marked it. The stockings he had on his feet, and the coats he said he had sold over the water, and found the man that had bought the coats, his name is

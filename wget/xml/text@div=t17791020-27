Upon Friday the 17th of September, at night, the maid came down and told me something was the matter with her; I went up; she told me she had been robbed, the drawer was open and her gowns were taken out; I sent round to the pawnbrokers and offered a guinea reward for each gown and coat if they were stopped; I knew it must be somebody that knew the room by their going in particular to this drawer. I keep an inn; it is the room we put gentlemens things in who come out of the country, when their things come first.

On the Monday following something was said that induced me to suspect the prisoner. I was advised to go to Monmouth-street; I did, and found the gowns at a Mr. Sheriff's; he described the person he received them of to me; I then knew it to be the prisoner; I went with his man to the prisoner's room; I went up first, he followed me; I desired him not to say any thing if she was not the person, and I would make an excuse for coming up; he came up and said that was the woman who brought the gowns to his master's; I said to her, Mrs. Manning, I dare say you know what I am come upon, I have found my gowns; the person describes you as the person who brought them to him, and this young man confirms it; she denied it; I asked her if she would go with me to my house without an officer; she said she would, and went with me, and then I took a coach and went with her to Mr. Sheriff's; as soon as he saw her he said to her, you are the woman that sold me the gowns; she denied it all, and said she never was in the house in her life; I took her back to my house and charged a constable with her; she was taken the next day before my Lord Mayor, and there she denied knowing any thing of them. The prisoner well knew where the gowns lay; for some little time before the robbery, she asked my niece to shew her the make of her last new gown, and she took the gowns out of the drawer, and shewed them to her.</p>

I have left her alone in the house; I never missed any thing; she came again on the 18th, at about ten o'clock, as near as I can recollect, and staid with me till after one; I asked her to stay dinner; she would not; I am certain she was there till after one.

            . I keep this shop; I was in the parlour, I saw a man in the shop, he was looking at a seal; I saw him run out of the shop as hard as he could, I followed him as fast as I could; I saw the same man that had been in the shop, about two or three doors off, a man said to me what is the matter; Sir, I said, that man has stolen a seal and I am so ill I cannot run after him; he said Oh, then I'll catch him; he ran after him; I saw him when he was brought back. I am sure he is the same person that ran out of the shop with the seal in his hand. He was taken to Marlborough-street office; and the man that took him, brought the seal to the office; the value of the seal is three guineas.</p>

            . I am a constable. In consequence of information I had received, I gave instructions to a man named Larom; I gave him one crown, one half-crown, and ten shillings and a sixpence, and marked one part of the money, and Perry marked the other. I had searched him previously - he had no other money about him but this 18 s. - we went in company to the house of the prisoners, in Petticoat-lane, on a Saturday evening: Larom and a man of the name of M'Carty, who was to introduce him, went into the house - Perry, and Drew, a brother officer, stood near the house, and I stood a little further off: after they had been in nearly an hour, Larom came out, and he said he had got twenty shillings and four half-crowns for 9 s.; we then went to the house and there found the prisoners and M'Carty: I asked Daniel Driscoll what money he had about him; he said very little; I pulled this sixpence out of his pocket; he said "That is a good one, is it not?" I said "Yes;" it had my mark upon it. I found on Armstrong two shillings, one has my mark, and the other has Perry's: I then searched Thomas Driscoll, and found on him a sixpence of my marking: I took from Larom twenty counterfeit shillings, four counterfeit half-crowns, one crown piece, and a half-crown of the marked money. I found on Thomas Driscoll, one shilling which was not marked, which I gave him back; the counterfeit money was wrapped in a rag with some paper inside.</p>

I then said I would take 20 s. in shillings: I then gave 3 s. more to Daniel Driscoll, and said could he get me four half-crowns - Armstrong said she would try: she then went out and was gone about eight minutes, and returned with two different parcels - one contained twenty shillings and the other four half-crowns; she opened the parcel with the twenty shillings, and said, "Here, my dear, here's the 20 s." - she then opened the paper with the four half-crowns, and took some tallow off the candle with her thumb, and said she would make them look dull, and I must rub them all alike, and they would look like good ones. Thomas Driscoll then came round the table and rubbed one of the shillings in the same manner: he then got a piece of rag and wrapped them up in it: I told him he had no occasion to do that as I could do it when I got home: this is the money which the officers took from me: I then said if they could let me have a sovereign I should be glad, and they said, a respectable young man like me, with a horse and cart, could easily pass sovereigns if I had another person with me; Thomas Driscoll said, I could easily take a bit of grease from my cart and make them look dull; I asked if it was all right, and they said yes; they had been there sixteen years, and had never got into trouble about it. When we were all in the room, in custody of the officers. Armstrong said "For Christ's sake make a bolt;" I said to James M'Carty "What a pretty mess you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190055"></xptr>brought me into;" and D. Driscoll said "It is all right, never fear."</p>

               <p>DANIEL DRISCOLL'S Defence. When these men came into my room they brought half a pint of gin and a pot of beer - the witness gave me a half-crown to get some more beer - they then said "There is no tobacco;" I gave a shilling to get some, and I then had 1 s. 6 d. in change; that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>ARMSTRONG'S Defence. They brought in the liquor and the beer, and told me to give them a glass, to drink some gin in; he made me take two glasses: he said that as he was coming down the lane two men asked him if he wanted any thing, and said they could get him some bad money, and perhaps, as I lived near, I might know how to get it better than him: I said I had not any thing to do with it; but he pressed me to go, and gave me 9 s. to go; I went to the door and then returned and said I could not get any; he pressed me to go again and very unfortunately I did go, and a man, who I think is here now, gave me the money wrapped up in a bit of paper, and said it was 9 s., - I took the paper but do not know what was in it - I gave it to him - he put it into his pocket, and then went down and brought up the officers to take me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DRISCOLL'S Defence. I did not get off my seat at all; I was just going to bed and had been but a short time from the country: I had nothing to do with the money: the sixpence I had given to the man was what I had given for my lodging.</p>

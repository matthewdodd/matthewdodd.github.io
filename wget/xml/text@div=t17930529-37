             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a plaisterer; I saw this man about Mr. Fitzgerald's coach, on Wednesday, the 18th of April, and I saw one of them, Gastrell, go up and take the box coat from the box, the other two were close by; he delivered it to Johnson, and he put it in his apron, and the coat was so big he could not put it in, and they went away with it; they were not taken till the next morning; I was at work in a building, in a garret, and there were no stairs, and I could not go down; I gave the alarm out to a carpenter, who went to Mr. Fitzgerald's coachman, and then they got off in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they strangers to you, or had you seen them before? - I had seen them before, but not to say to know them.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from the stable where you see them from the garret? - One hundred and fifty yards I suppose; I cannot speak with certainty, as to the men I take it was Gastrell that took it; I am confident to Johnson; as to the other I cannot positively swear, because I was only looking out of the window, and so far off, not nigh enough to speak to them.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you to be so positive to the other? - Because I see him so plain, and I knew him before, better than I did Gastrel.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Johnson after this? - I saw him two days after,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290080"></xptr>when he was at the justice's, at Marlborough-street I was then positive it was the man that had the coat in his apron.</p>

               <p>I am a bricklayer's journeyman; I saw the prisoners go along with Mr. Fitzgerald's great coat, Johnson had it in his apron, they were coming along Baker street; I was at work at the very next door, at the sign of the Globe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Baker-street? - It a great way distance from where they took the coat, not a mile; I saw the coat hang out and I saw a bit of the sleeve; Gastrell was in company with him, they were talking together, they went along a little past me and Johnson turned down Davis-street with the coat in his apron; there were three of them in company, and the other two kept along Baker-street. I went the next day and apprehended them with the constable; Johnson and Gastrell were together at the Spotted Dog, in Oxford-road; the great coat has not been found at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Johnson. If he saw me with the great coat, why did not he stop me? - There was another bricklayer along with me at work, and he persuaded me to have nothing to do with it, he saw him go along the same as I did.</p>

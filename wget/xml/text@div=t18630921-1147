                  </hi>. I was cook to George Roberts Smalley, who resided at 22, Victoria-road, Charlton—on 13th August, about a quarter to 2 o'clock, I was sitting in the front kitchen, and heard a noise like a jerk in the pantry, and then like one spoon sliding upon another—I looked through the window and saw a woman standing at the back door—I gave a dreadful scream, and ran through the kitchen into the pantry and missed the plate basket, which I had seen safe a quarter of an hour before—I ran and called the house<lb></lb>maid—I waited a minute on the stairs, and went into the pantry a second time to be sure—I then opened the library door, and found the basket on a table Tight by an open window—I had seen the prisoner before that day looking in at the window—I only saw her back when I screamed, but I saw her face afterwards, and said what business have you got there?—she was then in the house—she went outside, and then said, "You have made a mistake, I was not there"—as I went up stairs she said, "Come, and look in my basket, I have taken nothing, what have you lost?"—This was before I had seen the plate in the library; it was when I ran out on hearing the noise—the library and the pantry are all on one floor—the library is under the drawing-room at the back of the house; you go up stairs to it—the prisoner was standing inside the house at the library door—there is a window which I saw through, and I saw the shoulder of a person, and then screamed—the library door was shut, but the window was open, and the plate could be put in there in a minute—a person in the passage could get to the library window quicker than I could—and I went down stairs again to make myself sure before I spoke to the woman at all—one of Mr. Smalley's sons came in and went out again, and brought the prisoner back—the basket contained spoons, forks, and a fish slice, value about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

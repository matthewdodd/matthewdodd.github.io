                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS NORTH JENKINSON</hi>. I am a butcher, of Kingsland-road. Daniels was in my employ about six months, it was his duty to take out the fat, go round with the meat, and assist in killing—on 6th Oct. I sent him to the City with three sacks of killing fat, to make candles—I had no more fat in my house—at six next morning I heard a knock at my door, I looked and saw it was the prisoner Taylor—after he had knocked, the shop was opened by Daniels and another man that I have, a board was put out, and Taylor went and sat un the board till Daniels went to the Basing-house for the cart, and Taylor followed him down; that was about half an hour after the knock at the door—soon after an officer came to my place, and I went to the station and saw Taylor there and a bag of fat; the greater portion of it was mutton fat, one calves fat, and part of a bullock's fat—it was like the fat which Daniels ought to have taken in the City, and I thought he had taken it, but he had not, the fat he took in was all stale fat, there was no fresh fat at all went in, what other fat I had was shop fat—I had killed seven or eight sheep on the Friday, 5th Oct.—I went afterwards to the tallow-chandler, and they complained to me of it—they wanted fresh fat, and ought to have had it—I gave both the prisoners into custody, one for stealing, the other for receiving the fat—there was about forty pounds of fat in the bag—the quantity I sent in the day before was fifty-four stone, it was not weighed before it left my premises—this is the bag, it does not belong to me—I believe, on the Thursday morning previous to the Saturday, I had seen Taylor come to my shop, and go out with a bag similar to this, loaded—I saw a basket at the station on Saturday, it was mine, and was used to carry corn down to the horse, and to carry meat—I noticed that it was greasy, as if fat had been in it—the bag was found on Taylor.</p>

On Saturday morning, 6th Oct., I saw Taylor go up to the prosecutor's door, and knock three times—he then went to a coffee-stall, ten or a dozen yards from the shop-door—he then went back, and placed himself on a board in front of the prosecutor's shop—in about a quarter of an hour Daniels came out with a basket, apparently full of chaff and corn, but from the manner in which he carried it, it appeared to have something heavy in it—he went from the prosecutor's shop towards the Basing-house yard—another officer spoke to me, and, in consequence of what he said, I went towards the Basing-house yard—I remained about a quarter of an hour—I saw Daniels go to the entrance of the yard—he waited two or</p>

I am innocent"—I said, "I saw you carry out a basket this morning with chaff in it"—he said it was nothing but chaff—the weight of the fat was 40lbs.—no other butcher has a stable down the Basing-house yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am laundress to Mr. Smith of New-qure, Lincolns Inn, where he has chambers—the prisoner is my son, and lives with me. On Monday, the 26th of December, I returned from Mr. Smiths chambers, about twelve o'clock in the day—I put the keys of the chambers into a basket in my sitting room, at No. 9, Great Turnstile—the prisoner came there to dinner about half-past one o'clock, and went out about three o'clock with his sister, who is about fifteen years old—he came back about five o'clock alone, and remained about half an hour, to the best of my recollection—he then went out alone, and I did not see him again till he was in custody—I went to Mr. Smith's chambers about eight 0'clock the same evening, and found three drawers partly open in a room there, which I am usually in—I had left them shut—I think the closet door was a little open—1 missed a pair of sugar-tongs, which I believe were safe when I left the chambers in the morning—in consequence of what I discovered I went down stairs, and knocked at the door of Mr. Turner, the clerk, I begged him to come up, and I remained there till Mr. Smith came in, which was between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister, and have chambers at No. 8, New-square, Lincolns Inn, in the parish of St. Clement Danes. On Monday afternoon, the 26th of December, I left about four o'clock, I returned at eleven o'clock, and found Mrs. Matthews there—in consequence of what she stated, I looked at the drawers in my bed-room, and missed six waistcoats, and one handkerchief—and from the servants' room, three tea-spoons, the sugar-tongs, one salt-spoon, a table-spoon, and a great coat—I think the whole were worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at the lowest—I hate since seen two of the waistcoats, and the great coat—the prisoner lived with me several years formerly as clerk and servant, but not just at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The clothes were in a different room to the plate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the great coat was in the passage—I am not so sure of the coat—I have some little doubt of its identity—the prisoner left my service once, and I took him again—he continued about a year the second time, and left about August last—there are three sets of keys to my chambers—one the laundress had, one I had myself, and one a clerk would have had, if I had had one, but I had no clerk at the time, and the third set were in a drawer in my room—I never missed them—I had my own keys with me that day—I cannot say how long before I had seen the third set—I had seen the I waistcoats about a week before—when I came in the drawer was open, it had not been locked—I think it was drawn out—all the waistcoats were in the same drawer—I had not missed any of them before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Edward Baylis, a pawnbroker, of Hampstead-road. On Monday night, the 26th of December, the prisoner I came to our shop—I did not know him before—it was very near eight o'clock—he brought a great coat, and two waistcoats, on which I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the name of George Robinson—I have the counterpart of the du<lb></lb>plicate—this one which the policeman has produced is the same I delivered to the person pawning the goods.</p>

I and a quantity of other articles—he said he was accosted by two men near the pawnbroker's, who requested him to take these things in and pawn them—and when he came out, the men were gone, and he retained the duplicates—he said he had seen one of the men about Lincolns Inn Fields, but could not describe him sufficiently to be apprehended.</p>

                  </hi>. I am at Ilford, in the parish of Barking, in Es<lb></lb>sex. On the night of the 21st of July, I was disturbed between two and three o'clock—I heard a noise, and went to the window—I looked out, and saw the three prisoners proceeding to force the flap of Mr. Wright's cellar open—they were all three forcing the flap up—I stood and looked at them till they got into the cellar—I then put on my clothes, and got a young man, who lodged with me, to go down, and we appre<lb></lb>hended them in the cellar—it was just getting a little day-light then—I could not see their faces when I first looked from my window, but if I had been in front of them I think I could—when I got over to the cellar, they were just making their escape up, and I did not perceive that they had got any thing—two of them were very saucy—I did not say any thing to them, only that I had got them, and they should not get away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the house; it is the sign of the Britannia. I was alarmed, and proceeded to the cellar—I had first looked out of the window, and called a lodger of mine—I told him to go out at the door, and I would take a gun and follow him—I did so, and found him at the cellar-flap; and Dance had hold of one of the prisoners—I said, "Let him go, and I will shoot him if he run away"—Dance said, "Don't shoot him; there are two more in the cellar"—I went to get a light to see for them; and when I came back, the other two prisoners had got out, and had been taken—I went into the cellar, but there were no more there—I found a cock turned, and some beer let out, but I cannot say that they did it—I told them it was a good job I did not come first, for I should have shot them—they said, "If we had been here half an hour</p>

               <p>we should have done something for you"—I went into the cellar afterwards, and found a phosphorus-box, some matches, and a chisel.</p>

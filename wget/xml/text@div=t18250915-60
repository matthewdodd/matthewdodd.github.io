The prisoner came to our house, to hire lodgings, on the 14th of July - she was to give me two guineas and a half a week, and to take them for herself, her husband, and her brother, who was a foreigner; she came the next day, and desired me to get her a dinner and some wine, and then tea, which I did - she said she would pay me the next morning, as she had only a 5 l. Marlborough note, and a 35 l. cheque - she then desired me to get her some more tea and sugar, and asked me to lend her a sovereign, which I did not do. While I went out in the evening she went away - she had locked the drawers, and taken the keys - she had not put the tea in the caddy, but had taken it away, with a napkin which I had lent her. I do not know whether the napkin was to be considered as part of the furniture.</p>

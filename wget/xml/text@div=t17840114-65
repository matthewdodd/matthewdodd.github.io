               <p>I had a brown mare sent to my farm by Mr. Rickards about seven weeks ago, she continued a month, and my people missed her the 19th of December; I saw her then; on the Saturday night I heard of her being missing and I rode up to London to tell Mr. Rickards; I heard of a mare, and I stopped at Shoreditch to see if it was the same, and she was the same, a cropped brown mare; then I went to Mr. Rickards and informed him of it, and he came with me to Basinghouse, Kingsland-road, where the mare was, and he immediately knew her to be his.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Councel for Prisoner. I believe you have known the prisoner many years? - From his infancy.</p>
               <p>What is your opinion of his honesty? - I never heard any thing amiss of the boy.</p>
               <p>Did you always believe him to be a man of sound understanding? - I always took him to be an ignorant fellow.</p>
               <p>Was he a man that knew his conduct as he should do? - If he had he would not have stole this horse.</p>
               <p>You are very right, because I believe in order to steal the horse from the situation in which you had left it, he must necessarily pass before your own door. - Certainly he did, and saw me through the window, and it is a thousand to one but I had seen him.</p>
               <p>It appeared to you like an act of insanity, and I believe your opinion of him very well warranted it? - I said so at the justice's, he was always an ignorant fellow.</p>
               <p>What was the state of the fences where this mare was put? - Very good next the road.</p>

               <p>A month ago last Friday, I was going from London home, through Kingsland turnpike, and I saw the prisoner getting off a mare in the road? I asked him where he was going with her, I never saw the mare before, he said to Smithfield; I asked him if she would draw, and he said yes; I asked him the price of the mare, and he said seven pounds I said she is in a very bad condition to sell, I think you will not get that money for her; and his answer was, I believe my master must abate something of it: Says I, is your master coming, he said no; then says I, how can he abate anything, he said I must abate it myself, I said where do you bring the mare from: he said, he brought her from one Mr. Goring's; says I, she is in a very bad condition to sell, I said she was in a sweat; says he, I will lead her to Smithfield, and she will get cooler by then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Hall, what are you? - A labouring man.</p>
               <p>Never saw the prisoner before? - Never, I saw him again the other day.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in Smithfield-market? - No, I have no contract in Smithfield-market.</p>


               <p>What sort of business is yours, a labouring man is a very general description; are you sure you never deal in old horses? - No.</p>
               <p>No concern in the boiling house at all? - No.</p>
               <p>What made you enquire about this mare? - It is a natural case, when any body is going to Smithfield, and one sees a horse in sweat and dirt.</p>
               <p>A natural case. what do you make it your business? - I was going home.</p>
               <p>And do you ask every man you see with a horse in a sweat and dirty, in Kingsland-road, where he is going with him? - I have asked several.</p>
               <p>And I suppose several have asked you what you meant by asking the question; what had you to do with him? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>And yet you say it is a natural case: who are you Mr. Hall? - I live at Winchmore-hill; I split wood and bring it to town.</p>

               <p>I keep an errand cart from Endfield, I was in London the 19th of December with a load of goods, and I stopped at the Basing-house, in Kingsland-road, and I saw the prisoner talking with Mr. Hall, with a horse or mare in his hand, I did not observe which; after they parted, Hall comes to me and said, he had a good stout strong mare; I saw the man and the mare go into the Crooked Billet yard, and I went down there; there were two men with the prisoner and the mare, one of them had his head up, and spoke softly and said, I will give you four pounds for her; the prisoner made answer, no, I must have four guineas. The man that was about buying her, says to the prisoner, hold out your hand and strike me, and I will have her; with that he bid the prisoner get off the mare and go into the house and take his money, and he said, gentlemen I have bought her; with that I advanced down upon the man and the mare, and said, if you have bought her I think you have bought the property of a man which he had no right to sell; with that I accused the prisoner where he had her from, his reply was from Mr. Goring White Webb's; that is in Enfield parish; I told the man that bought her, says I, I shall keep this man in custody on suspicion, for I think Mr. Goring would not give him toleration to sell her for that price, and I would have taken the mare into custody but the man that bought her denied me; I said I was going down to Enfield where he said he brought the mare from, and I would take the man down to Enfield with me to know the rights of it; with that one of the men asked me if I was an officer, I replied, yes; I took the prisoner to the Basing-house in Kingsland-road, then an officer came to assist me, and the master of the Basing-house said, you may as well come in; and then the prisoner replied, if you will come in I will tell you the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did the prisoner tell you any thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then stay a minute before you mention what he told you; had you threatened him to carry him to jail, or did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then my Lord will tell you that you are not now to tell us what he said.</p>
               <p>Court. No.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of last month I saw this prisoner leading the mare along with a halter over her head, I asked him where he was going with it, he told me to Smithfield,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140095"></xptr> I asked him whether it was to be sold before he got to Smithfield, he told me it was, I asked him who was the master of the horse, he said he brought it from White Webbs, it belonged to one Mr. Goreham, or Roreham, at White Webbs, I cannot tell which; I asked him the reason of his master's selling it, he said his master had got more than he knew what to do with at that time; I asked him how old it was, he told me he could not justly tell the age, I asked him if it would carry safe, and I lifted my leg upon it, he said his master did not tell him whether it was found or not, I asked him how much money, he told me six pounds, I told him I thought it was too much, if it was not found it was not worth near the money, but he said if he could not get that, his master told him to sell it for less; I told him I thought four guineas was the full value of it, but said I, what value does your master set upon it? he said his master told him if he could not get six pounds, to sell it for something less; the agreement was four guineas, but there was no money passed, and one Hall that is here in Court, said, he imagined it was stole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Never mind what he imagined? - I said, if it was stole, and he knew the man to be the thief, why did not he stop him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This was on the market-day Mr. Stuck? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And so of a market-day you chuse to take your walk into the road to buy horses, instead of buying at Smithfield market? - This is the first time I ever did so.</p>
               <p>I fancy not, however the first question you asked the prisoner, seeing him with this horse was, whether it was to be sold? - No it was not.</p>
               <p>I have it down so my friend, was that the truth or not? - I am as able to tell truth as you are.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not say this moment, that you asked him whether the horse was to be sold at the market, or whether it might be sold before? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. You did say so friend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, he said so expressly, which he has now twice as expressly denied; now be so good Mr. Stuck as to tell us, whether you said what my Lord has told you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? did not you say just now</p>
               <p>"I asked the prisoner whether it was to be sold, and he told me yes?"</p>
               <p>Court. I have told you what you said on your first examination, if you made a mistake you may say so, but you certainly did say that when you saw the prisoner, you asked him whether the horse was to be sold before he got to Smithfield, and he said it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you ask him whether the horse might be sold before he got to Smithfield, or did you not? - I never mentioned that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - You would not have me swear again.</p>
               <p>Yes, I would have you swear again, and in the most unequivocal manner? - I might forget what I said.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you ask that question or not? - Ask what question?</p>
               <p>Did not you ask him whether the horse might not be sold before it went to Smithfield market? - Yes, that I will agree to.</p>
               <p>You had forgot that now a minute ago? - I should be very sorry to forget the truth.</p>
               <p>Did you ever buy a horse at Smithfield market? - Many a one.</p>
               <p>But you like them better before; who is your partner in the boiling business? - I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Did you never keep a boiling-house? - No.</p>
               <p>What have you kept? - Why a slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>For horses? - For hogs.</p>
               <p>Did you never kill a horse in this town to boil for meat? - Never in my days.</p>
               <p>What was you to have bought this horse for? - To have sold again.</p>
               <p>You are a dealer in horses? - I deal some little matter.</p>
               <p>O you deal some little matter, but you like an unsound one better than a sound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140096"></xptr> one? - I am quite a different man, I slaughter nothing for myself, unless it be now and then a hog.</p>
               <p>Is your's a slaughter-house where any thing of beasts are killed, either horses or hogs? - Quite different, it is a slaughter-house which is open day and night.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Allen-street, Clerkenwell, No. 32.</p>
               <p>How many boilers of horse flesh live within a few yards of you? - None for six or seven yards.</p>
               <p>What did you want to buy this horse for? - For my own use, and for no other but for my own use, to sell again.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a cart? - Yes, and it goes to Leaden-hall-market every morning in the week except Sunday.</p>
               <p>How many horses did you buy in the course of the last twelve months? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>But you must? - I cannot guess.</p>
               <p>Aye but you will? - Did you buy so few as seventy? - I never bought so many.</p>
               <p>Fifty? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you buy so many as fifty? - Not so many.</p>
               <p>Forty? - I cannot tell, it is impossible.</p>

               <p>Did not you buy so many as forty? - I do not know that I did or did not; I will swear I did not.</p>
               <p>Thirty, or any given number that you choose to fix upon? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Fix upon any given number? - I do not know, I do not keep such things in my head.</p>
               <p>What do you buy them in so inconsiderable a way; why what must the Jury think of you, friend? - The Jury have a right to think as they please.</p>
               <p>It is very fortunate they have, it is a very fortunate thing in the constitution of this country; and you would have them believe you, when you say you keep no account? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect them with any precision? - I do not imagine they might be so many.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did they not amount to forty? - I cannot swear any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Jury. You must be a very capital dealer? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell within ten or a dozen? - I do not keep any account.</p>
               <p>Do you sell them again? - I do sell them again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I must have an answer to my question; I must ask you upon your oath to say what number you bought in the course of the last year; will you venture to tell the Jury upon your oath, that you did not buy forty? - I will tell the Jury, or any gentleman upon the matter of truth, that I do not know that I bought thirty.</p>
               <p>Only one more question and that you are not interested to tell me a lie about; you know that White Webb's was at Enfield? - I do not know that.</p>

               <p>I was called to take a man in custody for stealing a mare, and we had some private discourse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This was under a threat.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell us any thin about a confession, because the man said before he promised him it would be better for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord does not want to hear it.</p>
               <p>Court to Richards. Did you see this mare? - Yes, it was my mare.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Richards. I believe you know Stuck? - No, Sir, I never saw him before that day; he came as a witness.</p>
               <p>I dare say you have no acquaintance with him, I am sure you would be ashamed of that? - I know I gave nineteen guineas for this mare, and he was buying her for four.</p>
               <p>If you know any thing of his character it is your duty to the poor man at the bar to tell what you do know. - Upon my word I know nothing at all of him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I believe you, some years ago, lived in the same family with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140097"></xptr>That was the family of the late Alderman Bird, Alderman of this city? - Yes, he was <rs id="t17840114-65-deflabel353" type="occupation">coachman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17840114-65-defend720 t17840114-65-deflabel353"></join> there.</p>
               <p>What character did he bear for honesty there? - He did not come till the Alderman died, my mistress always had a good opinion of him; I never heard any thing amiss of him before; I have known him for ten years to this present time; he has left the service of Mrs. Bird about twelve months; she at present resides at Coventry.</p>
               <p>I believe you have lived before with a gentleman that was out of his mind? - Yes, three years.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing particular happening to the prisoner? - About six years ago, either in January or February; he was taken all of a sudden, and was, as we thought, quite out of his mind; there was a doctor sent for, and he bled him and blistered him, and he was kept quite close up in a chamber, and the windows of the room were fastened down; he was so outrageous at that time, that if he could have got at any of the maids he would have done them a mischief; he said they were washing their hands in his heart's blood; he was kept close for three weeks; I did every thing for him, carried him up his victuals and drink; nobody else could master him; my mistress knew I had lived with a gentleman that was out of his mind.</p>
               <p>And in your judgement during that three weeks he was a mad man? - I think that during that three weeks he was as much out of his mind as any person that was in Bedlam, and we always looked upon him, that very often, at different times, he was not the person he should be; he did many things that we thought he was not right in his head.</p>
               <p>Did he drink? - He was kept as much from it as possible, but if he got a little drop it set him quite bad again, that he hardley knew what he did.</p>
               <p>Was he considered, after this illness in the family, as a man of found understanding? - No, never; I was with him in the family between three and four years.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Mrs. Bird permit him to drive her? - Yes; and after I left her, she tried him as long as she could, and the reason she gave for his going away was, that he was so bad at sometimes, that she was afraid to trust herself with him any longer.</p>
               <p>Jury. When was the last return of the frenzy that you remember? - He had frequent returns; the last I remember is three years ago; she said they could not rule him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. No man can be guilty of a criminal offence unless he is a free agent; if a man is under any habitual insanity, it would be very hard for him to be condemned for committing a crime when he is under the visitation of God; therefore the first question is, whether he was in such a state of mind as that he did not know what he did? for if so, you would not find him guilty if he did steal the mare.</p>

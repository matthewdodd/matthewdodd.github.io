                  </hi>. I am assistant to a jeweller in Newington-causeway—my brother-in-law, Henry Wilkins, of New Zealand, owes me money—this bill of exchange in the name of Henry Wilkins is my correspondent's bill—this endorsement, Thomas Barnes, is neither written by me, or by my authority, or knowledge—the prisoner is my brother-in-law—this "George Lane" on the back of the bill is, to the best of my belief, his writing—it came to my knowledge that it had arrived, and had been cashed at the Oriental Bank—the prisoner did not come to me till after I had put the law in motion—he then came with his brother, and said that he had come to know what terms I would come to—I said that I had written to the bank, and before I could do anything I must write to the bank authorities again—he said, "I will pay you in two months"—I said, "That will do for me if it will do for the bank, but I am afraid it is too late"—the brother said that I could not do anything until Wilkins came home, and wanted to know when he should see me again—I said that he might call on Saturday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was your brother present as well as his brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—they did not come to me again—I only saw the prisoner after that when I went with the detective—nothing was said about my receiving 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Saturday, or about my receiving two instalments before June—I have known the prisoner eight or nine years; he and I married sisters—I lived with him about six weeks—I have not had more than two dealings with him—I believe he has lent me half-a-crown—on my oath I owe him nothing for board and lodging—I was lodging at his house last Christmas</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he leave his wife, or did she leave him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say; but they are not living together—the first information I had about the money having been received in London, was the communication from my uncle in January, this year—up to that time I was not aware that the bill had been received—I told my uncle that the prisoner had received this money and given a receipt for it—I then wrote a note to the prisoner about the end of January or beginning of February, saying, "I have a letter in my possession which says that the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been sent to you, and unless you send it to me in a few days I shall put it into other hands"—I never received any reply till April, when I took active steps about it, and never saw him again till he called and asked me to compromise it—the half-crown was lent when I was out of a situation and my wife was confined, and I went round and asked his wife to lend me half a crown—there is no pretence for the suggestion that I authorized him to receive money or appropriate it to his own use.</p>

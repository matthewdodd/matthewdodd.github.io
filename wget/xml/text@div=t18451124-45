                  </hi>. I am gatekeeper of the London Docks. On the afternoon of the 4th of Nov. I was at the principal entrance—I saw the prisoner leaving the dock, going through the gate—he looked bulky—I stopped him, and asked him if he had anything about him—he said he had a little biscuit—I searched him and found some biscuit, and in the thigh of his trowsers I found a bottle with a pint and a quarter of Geneva in it—I asked what ship he belonged to; he said to the <hi rend="italic">Tallentire</hi> a ship that was there, and he had been working on board; that he picked the bottle out of the ballast in the ship's hold, and supposed it fell out of a case.</p>

                  </hi>. I received the prisoner from Hamilton—he said he had been working a ship at the jetty, he did not know the name of it, that he was carrying a case along the ship's hold, one bottle fell out on some stones, and was cracked—I found this bottle which had been taken from him was quite sound—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Tallentire</hi>, and found a case which had</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, in the employment of Means. Hickson and Sons, West Smithfield—on Friday, June 26, about 6.30 I saw Hebden there—I have seen him there before, about once in a fortnight, for the last three months—he asked me if there were any pieces of leather for him—I told him to go to Lewis—Lewis was a sorter of the different kinds of leather—the waste pieces of leather passed through his hands—he would know what was required for manufacture, or what was waste—Hebden brought an empty bag with him—he came first between 3 and 4 in the afternoon, and left the bag, and came again about 6.15—when he came back at 6 he saw Lewis—Lewis afterwards brought the bag to me—I was busy at the time—he said "20 lbs., Mr. Grout"—the bag was full—I did not see inside the bag before it was taken away—I made out this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 20 lbs. of waste leather pieces—the largest piece ought not to be larger than my hand—it was 51/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb., and Hebden paid me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these skins and half-skins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are never sold by us at any time—Lewis has been with us some years—he have never sold leather of this description.</p>

I was on duty in Cheapside about midnight on June 26—I saw Hebden running down Cheapside with a barrow as fast as he could—there was a sack in the barrow—I asked him what he had in the rack—he said, "It is all right, Charley, you know me very well"—I said, "Yes; but I want to know what is in the sack"—I have seen him frequently—he said, "It is all right, here is the bill," and he handed me this piece of paper—he then opened the sack, and took these small pieces of</p>

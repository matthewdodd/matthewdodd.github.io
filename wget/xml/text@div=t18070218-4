            . - Mr. Knapp. You are one of the officers of Hatton garden office. - A. I am. - On the 25th of January I received information of this robbery. In the evening, in company with Chapman, I went to the prosecutor's house, where I understood the prisoner Higgins lodged, and where I saw the last witness, Lyons, he lodged there likewise. I found the prisoner Higgins laying in the bed, apparently intoxicated, he appeared to be so more than he was; we took him in custody on suspicion of the robbery, which he denied; we questioned him after that about the other prisoner Quin; he acknowledged that he had been drinking with him, but that he knew nothing of the robbery whatsoever. He was taken before the magistrate the next morning, and committed for re-examination till we found Quin. On the 31st of January, I received information that Quin was at work in Apollo gardens, in Surrey; we took Quin there. When I went up to him I asked him if his name was not Timothy Quin, he said no, it was not; I told him I was an officer, I had come to take him in custody on suspicion of house breaking. As soon as he saw my brother officer, Chapman, and the prosecutor, (the prosecutor had concealed himself) I said, do you know that man that is coming here, he says yes, he knows my name is Quin. I then searched in his pocket book; I found this duplicate of a watch pledged at T. Melton's, Westminster Bridge road, for eight shillings, in the name of 
               <persName id="t18070218-4-person136">

            . I made enquiry there and found the watch, in consequence of that ticket; this is the watch I now produce. After that we brought him away; coming along he denied any knowledge whatever of the robbery, except of saying that Patrick Higgins gave it him to pledge. Afterwards he acknowledged where the clothes were, they were at his lodgings somewhere near Vauxhall gardens; he was some time hesitating where his lodgings was, at last he recollected, he said it was No. 2, White Lion court, where I went on Sunday morning; when I went in the house I saw nobody below, I walked up stairs very gently, I went into a room where a man and a woman were talking; I found these things sewed up in a bed, they have been in my possession ever since. After the prisoner was put to the bar for final examination, Higgins said the other prisoner had made a piece of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180019"></xptr> hemp for them, if I would go along with him to the back of Hearn's house, (he keeps a public house near to where the prosecutor lives), he would shew me where he had burried the money in a dirt heap.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise. - A. None at all; he said it at the bar, he called me to him and told me I went with him and Chapman the officer, he told me. where to dig with my cane, and there I found twenty one guineas and a half, two seven shillings pieces, and a gold ring.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. You found Higgins in bed at this house. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He denied committing this robbery. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say as Quin had made a piece of hemp for himself, he would tell you where the money was. - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN. - Mr. Knapp. We need not go through all that Trott has told us, tell us whether you heard Quin say any thing or what. - A. When I had Quin in the public house after we had taken him; Trott wanted to go somewhere, he left him with me, Quin said it is bad company that has brought me to it, what have I to say, I shall say when I came before the court, I shall not say any thing more.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Look at these articles, and look at the ring first. - A. That is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the watch, was that the watch that you had to keep for Higgins. - A. Yes, it belongs to Higgins all these articles, I have seen them; that is a ribbon that is mine, they are all mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the money in a glove. - A. It was in a glove, but this is not the glove; it is all my property, there is a good deal more missing.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

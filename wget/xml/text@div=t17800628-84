             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Crown Court, Newgate-street. I observed the prisoner had got a gallon pot concealed under her petticoats. I stopped her. I asked her what she had got and where she was going? She said, what is that to you, I am going to hell. I said, you may as well give me my pot before you go. I went to catch hold of her, and she fell down by the kennel and said I was going to rob her. I took the pot from her and charged a constable with her and sent her to the compter.</p>
               <p>Was she in liquor? - I do not think she was, but she might be.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280199"></xptr>Did not you think the answer she made was more like a drunken than a sober woman? - Yes, one would have thought she had been drunk by that, but she went along the street very well.</p>
               <p>(The pot was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into this man's house, and had a pint of beer; the gentlewoman asked me to get her some water. I did not intend to take the pot when the man laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Where did the pot use to stand? - In the passage with pump-water in it; there was water in it that had been brought by my boy from St. Paul's pump. She had been in my house and had a pennyworth of beer.</p>

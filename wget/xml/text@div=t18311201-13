On Wednesday night last I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock; I was the last person up - I bolied and barred the front door, and my sister or the servant secured the back; the windows are generally kept fastened - we have no occasion to open them in general; they were fastened with a hasp - I know they were fastened that night, for I looked at them; I got up on Thursday morning, about half-past seven o'clock, and found the kitchen window, at the back of the house, open - it appeared they had attempted to take a square out; they broke sufficient of it out to get a hand in, and unfasten the hasp- they could then open the window, and get in; it was open - it was fastened the night before; there were marks all over the kitchen - the table was marked with red;the bricks are generally done over with red ochre - there were red footmarks all over the kitchen, the window of which was opened; we traced the footmarks to a part of the wall, where they got over - six silver tea-spoons were missed out of the kitchen cupboard, which is nine or ten feet from the window; I had not seen them there that night - I saw five of the spoons at tea time: a salt spoon was also missed off the dresser, by the side of the cupboard - I had seen that at dinner time: the spoons belong to my father - I am in partnership with him, but I have no interest in them - he keeps the house, and pays the rent and taxes; I live there</p>
               <p>Q. Are the rent and taxes paid out of his pocket, or out of the business? A.Generally out of the business; my father pays the servants' wages, and the house provisions, and 1 allow 10s. 6d. a week for my board and lodging - I generally pay it every week; we never divide the profits of the trade - I am a tailor by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Then are you in partnership with your father in the pawnbroking business? A. I have part of the profits- what little money I have in the concern I reap the benefit of, in proportion to the money I put in; when I saw the silver salt-spoon at dinner time it was entire - in consequence of information on Thursday morning I went to Attwell, a silver smith and pawnbroker, at Uxbridge, between nine and ten o'clock, and told him what had occurred; while I was there the prisoner Rogers came in, and sold three of the spoons, which I have in my hand- here is the handle of one spoon, the bowl and handle of the salt-spoon, and one entire spoon; they are my father's - I can only swear to the salt-spoon; we have the fellow, and it has been in the family many years -Rogers received 2s. 11 1/2d. for them. and then left the shop- I borrowed the spoons of Attwell, and took them to my sister; she recognized them.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You closed the front door, and nothing else? A. No; I looked to see that the back doors were fastened - every place was fastened; we are very particular about it - I carry on the business of a tailor in the house; my father and I have settled no account at present - I have been in partnership with him nearly three years; there is a running account between us; the business has been decreasing some time, and I am trying to bring it round - my father pays the servants' wages, but I have nothing to do with them; my father did not sleep in the house that night, only my two sisters, the servant-maid, and myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You pay 10s. 6d. a week, is anything else paid on account of rent? A. No; my father pays the rent out of his own pocket - it is a charge upon him only, and not on the profits.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoners were examined before Messrs. Clark and Newdigate, the Magistrates - what they said was taken down in writing by Mr. Richards, the clerk; it was read over to them afterwards - they said nothing to it - (looking at it); this is Richards' hand-writing - I cannot read well enough to say whether it is correct.</p>

            . I was present at the examination; Mr. Clark said, "Now, prisoners, you may say any thing you think proper, but it is not necessary to say any thing"- he did not make them any threat or promise; what they said was taken down by Richards - he read it over to them; they said they had no further remark to make, that what was read was correct - I believe this to be Richards' hand-writing; I saw him writing while they were examined - this is an accurate account of what was said (read).</p>
               <p>Rogers voluntarily states, that yesterday morning, about half past seven o'clock, he met Anthony and Brown in the street at Uxbridge, near the Grapes; Anthony said."Will you buy these old broken spoons?" they were dirty with soot; I said,"Perhaps you did not come honestly by them!" they both said they found them in the soot: I bought them for 2s. 6d., and a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Anthony voluntarily says, "I found two spoons as I was coming out of Acton - I found them among some dirt, picked them up, and that is all I know; we slept at the Green Man."</p>
               <p>Brown voluntarily states, "I do not know any more than what he says - we were together when he picked them up; we laid in the loft at the Green Man."</p>

            . The spoons were on the table when this examination was taken.</p>
               <p>Anthony's Defence. When I came along the road I picked them up in the dirt on this side Acton - I went as far as the Green Man, and laid all night in the loft; I got up in the morning, and went to Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I was with him when he picked them up - we laid at the Green Man, and in the morning went to Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Roger's Defence. I went out to send a little boy to London in the waggon, with some rabbit-skins - I met these two men opposite Drinkwater's, who asked me to buy these articles - I asked how they came by them, and said I was fifty-three years old, had a large family, and would not wish to he disgraced; he said, "We found them in the dirt;" I said I had only 2s. 6d. and a few halfpence - they said, "Give us the half-crown and stand a pot of beer;" I left them, and went home - shortly after I wanted money to go to buy skins, and sold these - the constable then came. and told me they were stolen; I told him who I bought them of - we could not find them, and the constable said he would lock me up till he could;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010017"></xptr>Davis was in the shop, and I should not have sold them if I had known they were stolen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant D</hi> 4.) On Friday, the 18th of November, I went to no. 4, Harrow-street—I knocked at the door—the prisoner Thomas Russell opened it, and asked me what I wanted—I said, "I want to come in, open the door"—it was then half open—he en<lb></lb>deavoured to push me out—I put my foot against it, and got in—this was the outer-door—there is an inside parlour door, on the right hand—I rushed into the parlour—the prisoner, Thomas, rushed by me, and ran to the mantelshelf, which was opposite the parlour door—I ran after him, and saw him take something off the mantelpiece—he hallooed out, "<hi rend="italic">Bill, Bill"</hi>—when he got to the mantelpiece I hit his elbow, and knocked out of his hand several pieces of coin—I called for help, and Procter came in, I saw the prisoner's hand up to his mouth—I took hold of his threat, and said, "I will choke you"—at the same time I desired Procter to pick up the pieces I had knocked out of his hand, and not let any body touch them—I then, in the scuffle, got to the back-parlour door, between the two rooms, and I observed the prisoner Henry with his hand to his mouth several times—he was in the back-room, apparently gulping—I took hold of him by the throat, and said I would choke him also—at the same time I had hold of Thomas—Cooper came in, and he took Thomas out of my hand, and I was thrown down—both Henry and I were down together—Henry kept his head to the ground, and I endeavoured to get my hand</p>

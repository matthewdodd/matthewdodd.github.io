               <p>Did you know who the young man was? - No; she said his name was Baldwin. She lent it before me, on the Thursday before , at the camp. This was on the Monday.</p>
               <p>How many times had you been at the camp? - But that once before. I said I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180043"></xptr> could not go that day, I was going to my mistress.

            ; she said she must go and speak to him.</p>
               <p>Which way were you going? - Through the Horse-guards into the street.</p>
               <p>Who was along with Morris? - There was nobody with him. She ran up to him and spoke to him. I stood there. Then Morris came down to me and asked what did I stand there for? I said I waited for the woman. He took my handkerchief out of my hand, which was a silk one.</p>
               <p>What did he do with it? - He did not give it to me again. I went up and asked her if she was going home? She said yes, she was going home presently. She said she should go home Pimlico way; so she went that way.</p>

               <p>That was not your way home? - No, but she said that was the best way. She went that way till she came into the fields.</p>
               <p>You both went that way? - I did not know my way home.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you? - Yes, there were these two men.</p>
               <p>You have said nothing yet of the other man, when did you first see Mills? - As we were going out of the Park towards Pimlico she saw Mills.</p>
               <p>At the time she said she would go Pimlico way was Mills there or not? - He was not there.</p>
               <p>You agreed to go Pimlico way? - Yes, because she said that was the way home I went with her.</p>
               <p>Did you say nothing to her about the handkerchief? - I asked her to get the handkerchief. She said she would.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go to Pimlico? - We went up the camp again , in the park.</p>
               <p>At what gate did you go out of the park then? - Out of a great gate the upper end of the park, close to the great house (the Queen's Palace) I walked with her till I got into the field. We met Mills as we were going out at that gate.</p>
               <p>What passed between Mills, them, and you? - They spoke to the woman, they neither of them said any thing to me. When we came into the fields, she and Mills ran away and left me along with Morris.</p>
               <p>How far did they go from you? - A distance.</p>
               <p>Did they go out of sight? - I did not see them. It had been dark a good while.</p>
               <p>What o'clock might it be? - About ten. Morris pushed me down. I halloo'd and cried. Nobody came to me till he gave a halloo, then Ann Lock came.</p>
               <p>What was done to you before she came? - He pushed me down.</p>
               <p>What did he do with you when he pushed you down? - He laid with me.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by lying with you, was you ever laid with before? - No.</p>
               <p>You must tell the jury what injury you received, if you complain of an injury from that man. You was examined before a justice of peace, was not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him what the man did to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you must tell me what he did to you? - I told him he threw me down; he would not let me get up, not when I halloo'd out so.</p>
               <p>Was that all he did only to refuse to let you get up again? - He would not let me get up.</p>
               <p>I dare say your mother has told you you must tell the jury all that passed between you and him, you say he threw you down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Go on to describe what he did to you after that? - He vowed he would have his ends of me. I told him he should not, and I cried and halloo'd.</p>

               <p>What did he do to you in order to have his ends of you, had he his ends of you? - Yes, the last time.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180044"></xptr>What did he do the first time? - I would not let him get his ends.</p>
               <p>What did he try to do in order to get his ends, you know what it is you complain of; you say you was never served so before? - No.</p>
               <p>What was it he did to you? - He pushed me down in the fields against my consent.</p>
               <p>When he had thrown you down what was the next thing he did; you told your mother what he did to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you tell your mother? - I told her he had lain with me.</p>
               <p>You had never been lain with before? - No. I would not let him have his ends the first time nor the second.</p>
               <p>When had he his ends? - The third time he swore he would.</p>
               <p>What did he do to you the first time when he had not his ends of you? - He pushed me down.</p>
               <p>What did he do the last time when he had his ends of you? - I do not understand it.</p>
               <p>You can tell what he did to you, what you mean by his lying with you? - He hurt me a good deal.</p>
               <p>Where? - In my private parts.</p>
               <p>What did he hurt you with? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it what you call the first time, the second, or the last time that he hurt you? - He hurt me all the times.</p>
               <p>What was the difference between the first time and the third time when you say he had his ends of you? - He did not hurt me so much the last time.</p>
               <p>Why do you suppose that he had his ends of you the last time rather than any other time? - Because he swore he would.</p>
               <p>You said he swore he would at first, what makes you suppose that he had his ends of you then more than the first time? - Because I was examined as soon as I went home by a midwife.</p>
               <p>But that would not inform any person when he had his ends of you; tell me every thing that passed, just in the manner in which it passed; you said he threw you down, what was the next thing he did? how were your clothes when you fell? - Wet.</p>
               <p>Was any thing done to your clothes? - I was very wet.</p>
               <p>Were your petticoats up or down when you fell down? - He pushed me down and pulled them up.</p>
               <p>What was the next thing he did after he pulled up your petticoats? - He began pulling me about. I struggled, and halloo'd out murther!</p>
               <p>You was upon the ground, where was he? - He was upon me.</p>
               <p>You say he hurt you in your private parts, what was it he hurt you with? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath do not you know? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>You say your clothes were wet, when was that? - The first time.</p>
               <p>Did you fall down in a dirty place, or upon grass, or where? - Upon grass.</p>
               <p>What part of your clothes were wet? - The hind part of my shift and petticoat.</p>
               <p>How long was he lying upon the ground with you in this manner? - Not a quarter of an hour in all. I halloo'd and cried, and they halloo'd at one another.</p>
               <p>You say he used you ill during this time three different times? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you say he had his ends of you the last time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you observe that makes you suppose he had his ends of you the last time rather than the first time? - I did not know till I was searched by the midwife when I came home.</p>

               <p>But she could not tell whether it was the first or last time; why do you say it was the last time? - He hurt me all the three times.</p>
               <p>In a quarter of an hour he halloo'd, and they came back? - I was crying.

I asked her if she was going home? She said yes. When we got a little farther she ran away from me and left me along with Morris again. Then he pushed me down and served me the same again, and I halloo'd and cried murther!<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180045"></xptr> upon which two men came up to my assistance.</p>

I halloo'd and cried out murther! then Mills came up and swore at me, bid me lie still, and he hit me a knock over the eye with his bayonet , and then he went away again. I cried so that Morris got up from me, and halloo'd to them; then Mills and Lock came up to me. Then we went on farther still; they said they were going home; we all walked on , when they came into another field she ran away from me again, and left me alone with Morris.</p>

I halloo'd and cried so that he got up at last. The two men went away the last time he got up, and left me and

When it was light she got up, and was coming home to the Old Change, where she lodged; I was going to Watling-street. She came the park way. When she came into the park, she said she would go and ask the man for my handkerchief, or else my mother would make a noise at me. She went into the camp to ask for my handkerchief. She staid a good while; as she staid so long, I went in after her to see if she would come home. As I stood asking her to come home, my mother came after me.</p>
               <p>How did she know where to find you? - I do not know. This woman had staid out all night. As she could not find me any where where I used to go, so she came to the park to see if I was there.</p>

I directly set out for the camp; when I came to the little gate, which faces Whitehall, I asked the sentries if they had seen a woman and a girl go through that way. They said they saw a woman, about twenty-six years old, and a girl about fourteen, just pass by. I asked where they thought I should find them. They said if I went to the next sentry, he would tell me. I went there. He said, a woman about twenty-six years old, and a girl about fourteen, had just walked along, and he thought they were gone into the farther tent. As I turned my eye, I saw my girl stand at the corner of the tent; I went up to her; she met me, and ran out of the camp; for I was in a great passion.</p>

When I had her home she cried very much. She told me how she had been used, as soon as I came out of the Park into a convenient place. When I got her home I asked her the particulars; she said she would not make it publick before company, but if I would take her by myself she would tell me the rights of it; I took her to her own lodgings and examined her, and I found things not right; I saw she had been plainly ruined.</p>

               <p>Was this all that passed between you and him that day? - Yes; I took him up by a warrant the next Monday.</p>
               <p>How did you find out his name? - I enquired of the soldiers in St. Paul's Church-yard if they knew one Morris; I had got his surname, but not his christian name.</p>
               <p>How came yo u to know his surname? - My daughter mentioned his surname.</p>
               <p>Where had the girl lived, from the time you came out of Oxfordshire , till she came up to London? - I left her at school.</p>

             said, That is a pretty young man. I saw them both laugh; I went up to them, and asked them which way they were going. They said they were going to look at the camp. I said I will go along with you, if it is agreeable. Martha Linett said it would be very agreeable, if I would go with her. I went along with them, and asked them if they would drink. They said they would; and they drank with me at the booths in the camp. By that time it was near eight o'clock at night. I told them I must be absent from their company, for I must go to the roll-call at eight; I went. They said they would stop for me till I had done at the roll-call. I said that might detain me half an hour.

             said she did not care, she would stop for me; and she did stop till I was dismissed from the roll-call. It was then about half after eight. We went to the same booth we had been at before, and had a pot of beer; then we walked about the camp till about half after nine. I said I could not stay longer, I must go to my tent; for we might be roll-called again. She begged I would stay a little longer. I told them, if I staid longer I must miss my roll-call, and be out all night. Then she directly begged me to stay all night. I said I would. She said, could we go to no other place but the camp. In the discourse this man came up and asked me how I did, and this gentlewoman and we all fell into discourse together. These two women said it would be better for us to go out of the camp; we went out; it was then a little after ten o'clock, I believe; Buckingham gates were shut up; we took a walk to Pimlico; we went, I think it was to the Queen's Head, and had two pots of beer and some bread and cheese; it being late they were going to shut up; they begged we would leave the house; I paid the reckoning. Then we went to Chelsea Five-Fields; we sat down in the fields, I suppose an hour, together; then we came down to the publick-house again; I had left my black stock behind me; the people were gone to bed; we took a walk round the King's Road; then we took a walk across<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180049"></xptr> the fields, where the patroles were patrolling; there we sat down for, I suppose, half an hour. I asked her the question, if I should have to do with her. She said no, I should not; she would not be hurt by any man. I said, rather than hurt her, I would not meddle nor make with her. We walked about till near one in the morning; then we all four left the fields, and went across the road into the other fields; five or six gentlemen came down from Chelsea; the girls seemed afraid of them, and made great noises. Mills said, You have no occasion to be afraid, no person shall hurt you. The gentlemen seeing us soldiers said, they are comrades; one gave us sixpence, and another threepence. They asked me if I would let them kiss my wife. I said, You shall not hurt any person with me; I was lying down upon the ground, and they all three stood up; Mills said, Do not injure or hurt the girls. They said they would scorn it; they went away, and wished us a good night. As soon as they were gone from us we went down the road to the Wheat-sheaf at Pimlico; there we had three pots of beer; the patroles drank with us and the watchmen; we told them we were going to the camp; we parted with the two women, and told them to go home. They said they would not go home, but would walk about till such time as they should not be taken notice of to come into the camp again. They came in after us, about eight o'clock in the morning; the girl staid in the tent with me till her mother fetched her away, which I believe was about eleven or twelve o'clock. The mother fetched this gentlewoman and

             out of the tent from me. She said when she got them out, O you villain! I will hang you for ruining my daughter! The girl said, No, mother, what was done I was as willing as he. The girl and mother went away from me. The mother and another woman came the next day and made a great noise in the camp, and said they would take me up with a warrant. She said she would hang me for ruining her daughter. On the next Monday following she took me up with a warrant; I was taken to Bow-street office; Justice Addington examined me; the girl swore to me; I was committed for further examination to Tothill-fields prison; she was ordered to appear against me on the Wednesday; she did not appear against me, but the mother came; then the mother and she were ordered to appear against me again on the Friday. On the Thursday the mother and daughter came up to the prison to me, and asked me what I thought of myself. I said I was innocent of the thing that was charged to me. They asked me if I knew any thing of Mrs. Lock. I said I knew nothing of her at all. She said if I could find out where she was, nothing should come to me. I said I knew nothing of her, nor where to find her; upon which she asked me who was to pay the expences she had been at, if she did not appear against me. I asked what the expences were. She made the warrant, and serving and all, to amount to three shillings. I said I would give her three shillings, and seven more, which made it ten, to make the whole affair up with her. She said she would ask an acquaintance of her's about it, and I should give it to the person she lodged with; and if her friends approved of it, she would take it, and not appear against me. The next day she took the money, and did not appear against me; whereupon I was discharged at Bow-street office. Then she came down to the camp to me, and asked me several questions if I knew any thing of this Mrs. Lock. I said I did not. She told me, if I could not find Mrs. Lock she would take me up again; then she left me; that was about the 24th or 25th of July; I was taken up again a month after. I have a dozen witnesses who heard the girl say that what was done she was as willing as me; the mother and daughter were both together then.</p>

               <p>To S. Linett. What do you say to that? - I did not take any money. He had got a a woman with him; he drawed this girl out of the lodgings; the woman would not let my daughter be at rest one minute in a day, but she desired her to come down to prison to him, and that he would make her his lawful wife, and use her as a father and a husband. I told the woman who came after her , that she should not go to the prison. That woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180050"></xptr> pretended to be Morris's sister. She cried, wrung her hands, and asked her to go down with her. I told her she could have no regard for such a man.</p>
               <p>Did this woman get the girl to go to him? - Yes, she drawed her there twice.</p>
               <p>How came you not to appear the day he was discharged? - The serjeants and his acquaintances who were there persuaded the girl not to appear, and kept her back, and persuaded her that as soon as he was discharged she should have a husband; and she, a silly girl, minded them more than me They kept her back, and this woman, who pretended to be his sister, proves now to be his lawful wife.</p>
               <p>So he was discharged because you and your daughter did not appear? - He sent for me to the prison. I beat the girl in the street. I told her she should not go down to the prison, but the woman desired her to go, and said he was a-bed, and like to die, and she should lose her brother if she did not go; and she told her she would buy a ring and she should be married in Houndsditch, and they would make a gentlewoman of her at once.</p>
               <p>I asked you a short question, was he discharged because you and your daughter did not appear? - For want of appearance.</p>
               <p>How came you not to appear? - They told me I could be of no service without my girl, and the expence would be so much it would ruin me.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the reason why you preferred your indictment at last was, because you found that other woman was his wife? - No; the reason I did it was, the child did not prove to be so much injured then as she did after; when it came to be proved she had the foul disease, I chose to see her righted. I went to Mr. Addington and Mr. Wright, they told me to indict them all three, and see them punished. Morris sent for me down to Bridewell to him; he drawed writings and gave her. When I found he was a married man, I threw the writings away. I searched and would not let my girl be married to a man who was married before. He sent for me into Bridewell. He said, mother, as I am going to have your daughter, I know you have been at great expence, will you take this money? I said no, I did not do it for benefit. He said will you let Patty have it? I said no, I do not do it for lucre of money, but to see my child righted. I said I would not take it. A young woman sat by me she said shall I take it? I said you may do as you please, but I will not take it. The other young woman had the ten shillings.</p>
               <p>What was done with that ten shillings? - Four of it was spent amongst them; the other six I received for my loss of time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Customs, and inspector of the Thames police. On the morning of 19th Nov., between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was in the police galley with three constables, very near Mr. Cockerell's coal wharf—as we were rowing up I observed Geal and Warren on the deck of a sand barge, alongside of a loaded coal barge, and Bennett in the coal barge—I saw him stoop down once or twice—he had his back towards me—he stooped towards the coals, and lifted himself up towards the sand barge, and reached to the sand barge—the coal barge was down lower in the water—the sand barge was light—when I first saw this I was about three boats' length from them, going towards them—when we went towards them they all three began to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> the sand barge from the side of the coal barge, and after the sand barge got astern of the coal barge, Bennett jumped on board—they were then all three on board the sand barge—I turned my light on, and saw that coals had been taken out of the coal barge by no frost being on the places where the coals had been taken out—there was frost on the other parts, but where the coals had been taken it was black—I had my boat put alongside of the sand barge, and Geal went down in the cabin as fast as he could—I went after him, with a constable—the other two prisoners were on the deck—when I got down I asked Geal how many coals he had got on board the barge—he said, "None"—I said, "Are you sure of that?"—"I am positive of it," he said—I opened a locker, and found four very large pieces of coal with frost on them—I then asked Geal to move himself—he did not seem to like to move—I lifted his legs, and found a very large lump of coal, with the frost on it—I said to him, "I believe you have stolen these coals from Mr. Cockerell"—he made no answer—I then moved the steerage ladder, and found sixteen or eighteen large pieces of coal, in the space leading from the main hold into the cabin—I said, "I believe the whole of these coals have been stolen from Mr. Cockerell, by the frost being on them"—he made no answer—I went on deck, and found on the starboard side a large number of pieces of coal under some boards in the forecastle—by that time the other two prisoners were gone—they were just at the end of the wharf, going through the wharf—I and another officer followed them, and took them just on Blackfriars-bridge—I saw them stop, and look over the bridge—I took</p>

               <p>Bennett, the other constable took Warren back—I said, "I believe the whole of these coals were stolen from Mr. Cockerell's barge"—Bennett said he knew nothing about the coals—I went back to Mr. Cockerell's; I found three coal barges there—I found a great many marks in the <hi rend="italic">Clara</hi>, where a great many pieces had been taken away—the whole of the coals I found in the sand barge was 890 lbs.—the whole of them had frost on them—I took the prisoners to the station ship; I then went back for the coals, and took them—I took the prisoners to the Wapping station, and after they were charged, and were going to the cell, Bennett said, "Mr. Jones, I hope you will be as lenient as possible with us; we are not allowed coals in the barge"—Warren made the same observation, and Geal said the same—I went over the barge afterwards with Mr. George Jones.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning; it was a very nice sharp morning—there was no fog at all at the time—I could see these men quite plainly—I had seen them all before—they are employed in the sand barges—there were two others with me; Dell was not before the Magistrate—I did not look at the coals in the barge before I went in the sand barge—I put my light on, and that showed me at once a deficiency—the frost was not very thick on the coals; it was a slight frost—there was a frost on each lump of coal—I examined three places on the barge by my light—there was one barge by the side of the sand barge, and three or four more—only two of them were loaded, the other one was empty—the other barge was loaded with different coals; small coals—they were all covered with frost, which was not disturbed—I went in Mr. Cockerell's barges after I went with Mr. Jones—West macott was with me—we walked round the gunwale; they were filled with coals—I did not examine before only with my light—I did that when I came alongside the coal barge—the sand barge was close by the coal barge; when we got up they <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her away—I have seen Geal above one voyage in that barge—the prisoners repeated one after another," Mr. Jones, be lenient"—the same words.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weigher, in the service of Mr. George Joseph Cockerell. We had some barges of coals on the evening of 18th Nov.; three were loaded, and one partly loaded—I went over the barges that evening—there were several large lumps of coal lying on the top—on the morning of the 19th I examined the barges with James Jones; I missed several large lumps of coal—I have seen the coals found on board the sand barge—I have no hesitation in saying they were a part of Mr. Cockerell's coals—I have been in the business three years and three months—I know Geal by sight—the prisoners had no business with any of these coals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have been three years in the coal trade; does that enable you to distinguish Mr. Cockerell's coals from all others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I missed coals that morning, and these coals were found with frost on them—I saw them in the galley soon after 5 o'clock, and the frost was still on them—there were other sand barges there, but no coal barges but Mr. Cockerell's—it is Mr. Cockerell's wharf—Mrs. Cockerell had three barges loaded, one half loaded, and two empty—there were no other coal barges nearer than Blackfriars-bridge, which is 100 yards off I dare say—there were no barges with small coals.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose the large pieces were all on the top? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is according to how they come out of the ship; I had noticed them the night before—I always notice whether the small or large are at the top—I left at half past 5 o'clock the night before—the barges had not lain there above one day—I saw them at 5 o'clock on the evening of the 18th—there is no watchman on the premises, who has charge of the barges—I saw them again soon after 5 o'clock in the morning—I heard of the robbery from some of our men, and I went down and saw where the coals had been taken from—they had been taken from all three of the barges—it was not daylight, but we had lights in the other barges which were on shore—it was not a very clear morning; it was clear enough for me to see that—there was a heavy frost that night—two of those barges were emptied on Monday, and one was kept there six days—I have a book which contains an invoice of the amounts of the coals in the barges—one barge was 61 1/2 cwt. short; I know that by the invoice—it is not here—I was not present when the coals were weighed from the ship, but I was when they were weighed from the barge.</p>

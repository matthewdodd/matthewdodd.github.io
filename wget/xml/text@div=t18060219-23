               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 25th of January going with Mrs. Banks from Fleet-street to Russel-square. A. Yes, I took the coach myself from the stand; I saw seven parcels put in the coach, there was a man to help me, there was a black writing-desk put into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mrs. Banks put down. - A. No. 9, Russel-square, fronting Woburn place; I handed six parcels out to the coachman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take such notice of the coachman so as you should know him again. - A. Yes, I took particular notice of him; the prisoner was the coachman, I am sure of it. I paid the coachman his fare.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the coachman. - A. I understood that I was to give two shillings to the coachman; he said he must have half a crown, I gave him half a crown, he said I was not half up to it; are you going back, I said; I am going back, he said, I will give you a ride back.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the writing desk again if you was to see it. - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. I live at No. 5. Bateman's-row, Shoreditch; I am a cabinet-maker.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190025"></xptr>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes, he lodged with me for more than two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember him coming home on the 25th of January in the afternoon. - A. Yes, on Saturday evening between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. He served his time to a farrier; lately he has drove a hackney coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he bring home that evening. - A. A black writing desk; I was at the top of the house at work, he called me down; when I came down he asked me to open it; by his desire I opened it, he looked in it, I looked over him, I did not put my hand in it, I saw nothing but two or three papers, I fastened it again, it was slightly fastened with a brad at the bottom; he took it in his hand, and asked me what it was worth, I gave him no answer, he said it was worth a pound or fifteen shillings, he said he would leave it there; I went to my employ again, I was very busy at that time, I believe he went out to his employ. My brother came to dine with me on Sunday, he had spoke to me to fix him a temporary desk against the partition of his house; he had seen this desk, I told him it was to be sold, he asked me what it was worth, and authorised me to buy it for him, not to give too much money for it. I told him it was worth thirty shillings, I look upon it that was the value of it. On Monday morning I asked the prisoner if he had sold it, he said no, but he was going to sell it; I told him my brother would give him thirty shillings for it, he said my brother should have it. He owed me fourteen shillings, and I was to give him sixteen shillings to make it up the thirty. On Monday evening he came home at ten o'clock, I was in bed, he told me it was his club night, he wanted some money, I got out of bed, and gave him a pound note, I had no less change. On Tuesday I was going to take the desk to my brother, whom I bought it for; I examined it and found a private drawer, containing eleven pounds and a miniature picture likewise. I took the money for my own use, I thought if it was enquired after in a little while, I could make it up again; I was short of money at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You was pretty sure the prisoner could not enquire for it. - A. On the next Wednesday I took the desk to my brother, he was not at home. I left it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. You are by trade a cabinet maker. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you knew very well the value of a desk of this kind. - A. I never saw a desk of that kind before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the cabinet line. A. I worked for my master in Camomile-street seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the first time you saw one of them writing desks. - A. Yes, a black writing desk.</p>
               <p>Q. You say because it is black; am I to understand you never saw a writing desk like that; you say you are a cabinet maker. - A. It is not in the cabinet line at all.</p>
               <p>Q. This man is the driver of a hackney coach, he lived at your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come home. - A. Between seven and eight, I do not say exactly to the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at work at that time, do you usually work so late as that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were called down. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What persons were present at that time. - A. My wife, she let him in, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when you first saw the man at half after seven. - A. My wife and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The first question was he asked you to open the desk. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give that any ceremony. - A. No, I thought it was right.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was right to open it, taking it for granted that it belonged to this coachman. - A. I really did not give it a thought, I was very busy, I opened it at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not put your hand in to see what sort of papers were there. - A. I did not examine the papers.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the man go away. - A. I do not know, directly almost.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord that the man asked what in your opinion the desk was worth. - A. Yes, I did not give him any answer.</p>
               <p>Q. When your brother came to you on Sunday, it so happened that your brother wanted such a desk. - A. He had been speaking that he wanted a desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell your brother the value of the desk the next day. - A. I told him it was worth about thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you discover this private drawer, was it about half past eight or nine. - Q. That was on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not discover it that night. - A. No, I never touched it.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother came to you on the Sunday. - A. Yes, he always comes to see me on Sundays.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you agree to send it to your brother. - A. On the Wednesday I took it to my brother, and on the Wednesday he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box left in your custody from the time the man came home till you delivered it to your brother. - A. It was left in my house, not particularly in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not left in your care. - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the desk left in your custody. - A. He might come and take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the desk left in your custody; the man went away and left the desk in your hands. - A. Not in my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your table then; what became of the box when the man went away. - A. He laid it down.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it afterwards. - A. When I bought it I considered it my property, it remained where he put it, and there it continued till I took it to my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your brother that purchased this desk on a Sunday, did he examine it all. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he that was to purchase it did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190026"></xptr>look at it at all. - A. He knew it was a desk, he only examined it on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you never examined on the inside to see whether it was proper for him to buy. - A. Not before the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you discovered this private drawer. - A. On Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after you had given the man the money he wanted for his club. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the money for your own use, you thought if any person enquired for it you should be able to make it up. - A. Yes, and if ever any body enquired for the desk, they might always have it at my brother's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did understand it was not his property. - A. I thought if any body enquired for it they might have it.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any person enquire for it when you conceived it to be the property of the prisoner. - A. I knew he was an hackney coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any person enquire for that which belonged to the man himself. - A. He might have it left in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a suspicion that it might not be his. A. Yes, when I saw the money in it, I did not know how to act.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you was anxious to return it to the right owner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that in this private drawer that your ingenuity discovered, you found a miniature picture, and there you found the bank notes that you mentioned. - A. I did not examine any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. That will not do, did you find any letters in that private drawer. - A. There might be two or three papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any letters in the private drawer. A. I cannot tell whether they were letters or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you the curiosity to open them to see what was contained in them. - A. Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them. - A. The desk with the papers went to my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were papers in the private drawer at the time the desk was delivered to your brother. A. I cannot say whether they were in the private drawer, there were some in the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that the miniature picture and some papers were in the private drawer, what became of them. - A. They were burnt at my brother's.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether there was any thing written upon them. - A. I did not examine them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there were any figures upon them or receipts. - A. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of the private drawer did you find the notes. - A. They were by themselves, I do not know what part of the drawer they were, they were loose.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the magistrate did not you, did not you say before the magistrate that there were letters that you had not read. - A. Not in the private drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Now recollect, I do not ask you about the private drawer, did you say there were letters in the desk. - A. I might, but I do not know whether they were letters or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not directions upon them of the prosecutrix, the papers that you had the curiosity to read. - A. No, not in the private drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not shuffle about the private drawer, were there any pieces of paper that you did not read. - A. Never a one that I read through.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you whether you read through or in part, did you read any one paper whatever. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say there was some papers that you read. - A. No, that I looked at; it is so long ago, I really cannot tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bank notes. - A. I spent five of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the others, where did you put them. -</p>
               <p>Witness. My lord, must I answer.</p>
               <p>Court. You must answer the question. - A. I made use of five pounds, the others were secreted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Where were they secreted. - A. They were secreted in the chimney in a bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. So you put them in a bottle, and put them in a chimney. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you deny before the magistrate, and swear before the magistrate that you never found any, bank notes in that desk. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that you never saw any bank notes in that desk. - A. I said that I opened the desk, I never saw any bank notes.</p>

I went to see my brother; I had previously spoken to him about erecting me a temporary desk, my brother said there was a desk to be sold, which he told me would suit me, and save him the trouble of erecting me a temporary desk; I told him to buy it, but not to give too much money for it; as I did not understand it, he knew better what it was worth than I did.</p>

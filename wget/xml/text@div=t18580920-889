                  </hi>. I am metropolitan police-sergeant—I know Henry Smith; he is too ill to travel—these depositions were taken in the presence of the defendant—they are signed by the justice before whom the enquiry took place—the defendant's attorney had an opportunity of cross-ex<lb></lb>amining Henry Smith—(<hi rend="italic">Read: This deponent Henry Smith, upon his oath, said as follows</hi>:—"I am sergeant of the metropolitan police force (detective). From information we received from Portsmouth, through the Board of Ad<lb></lb>miralty, I went with the officer Robinson to-day about 11 o'clock, to 5, Windsor-street, Bishopgate-street-without, and outside the door I saw the prisoner—I asked if his name was Cohen,—he said, 'Yes'—I then told him I was a police officer, and asked him if he had received two casks—he hesitated and went inside—I went in with him—I repeated my question; and he said, 'Yes, I have,'—I said, 'Who from?' and he told me 'Mr. Warren, of Portsea,'—I asked him what Mr. Warren was; and he said, 'A. marine-store dealer'—I then said, 'I suspect they contain metal, the pro<lb></lb>perty of Her Majesty, and have you any objection to our searching your place?' he said, 'I have; you shall not search it'—in the passage of the house where we were, I saw two casks—I opened the head of one of the casks, and I saw it contained copper nails and bolts, marked with the broad arrow—I asked him if he knew the contents; and he said, 'No, I do not.' I had previously seen these two casks at Mr. Harris's, a carrier at the Nag's-head in the Borough, and I had watched them delivered at this house—on the desk of the counting-house, where we were talking, I found the bill I pro<lb></lb>duce, for the carriage of the two casks, made out to Mr. H. Cohen—I said, 'You must consider yourself my prisoner, and you must go to the station'—he resisted very much, and gave orders to his men to bolt the doors, and shut us out, and tried to get away into the street—we secured him with assistance.</p>

               <p>the property in it, bearing the mark of the broad-arrow—he then told the defendant he must consider himself in custody on that charge—Smith then took charge of Cohen, I taking charge of the property, the two casks—the workmen were then called in by Mr. Cohen—we asked to search the place; he said, "No"—a signal was given to the workmen to close the gates, and get us out—a great mob of people came round and tried to get the prisoner away, and prevent me taking the casks, but I did ultimately get them out, and get them into a cab—Smith charged Cohen with having in his pos<lb></lb>session government stores, the property of Her Majesty—that was after the sign had been given to the workmen—he said he should not go, he did not know anything about it—I took charge of the two casks, and took them to the station—I have them below stairs; they are a great weight—I stood by the side of Smith when he opened the cask head—that was after he had told the prisoner he was in custody, and after the resistance was made.</p>

Cohen, wholesale metal merchant, Windsor-street, Bishopsgate, I believe—I have seen the paper—it was not made out from Warren of Portsea, that was the carrier's—it stated "metal, weight 3 cwt. 71/4 lbs."—perhaps the casks might weigh about one hundred weight and a half—they are small in size—a large number of people assembled from the neighbour<lb></lb>hood, hearing the row—Smith had his warrant-card with him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a warrant-card, on which you may apprehend anybody—it is merely to vouch for your being an officer—we had no special warrant to apprehend this young man, his father, or any one on the premises, nor any search warrant—I am not quite certain whether the defendant asked to see Smith's warrant; there was a person asked to see the warrant—Smith showed the warrant in the cab—I went in the cab—I did not see it shown, I could not swear to that—Smith and I were in plain clothes—Smith opened the top of the cask himself; it was in the passage in the house—it had not been opened before—that was during the row.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the prosecution were bound to show not merely that the articles in question were constructively or even manually in the possession of the defendant, but that he really knew that those articles had upon them the particular mark which rendered his possession of them illegal; they had proved that two casks containing metal were consigned</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">to the defendant; but they had also proved that he had not had the opportunity of opening or looking at them, when he might have accepted or rejected those that were marked with the broad-arrow; he referred to Rex</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Wilmett, in support of his argument</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WEST</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the word "knowingly" used by Mr. Justice Coltman in that case did not apply to the knowledge that they were the Queen's stores, but to the knowledge that they were in the possession</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON WATSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that it was necessary in order to convict a person under this statute that he should have knowingly in his possession goods marked with the broad-arrow, that he must have knowledge of the possession, and that he must have knowledge that they were marked with the broad-arrow; the statute was couched in very general terms; it did not state in so many words that he must have in his possession, power, or custody "knowingly." but that was the true meaning of the statute; the word possession imported knowledge, it implied that he received into his possession something marked with the broad-arrow; therefore, it was necessary first to show possession, and secondly, to show that the thing possessed was so marked to the knowledge of the defendant. As to the question of possession, if it were necessary, in this case he should leave it to the Jury, with the observation that although the casks were brought to the prisoner's premises, there was no evidence of the terms upon which they were sent, nor was any time given for examination, or of exercising a power of adoption or rejection. The case of Rex</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Wilmett, before Mr. Justice Coltman, was precisely on all fours with this, and specifically pointed to a knowledge of the mark being there, otherwise there could be no conviction; that view appeared to him to be one of sound law and sound sense, and gave a reasonable interpretation to the statute; in his opinion it was necessary in point of law to show that the defendant did know the articles had the broad-arrow upon them, supposing they were in his possession, and there was no reasonable evidence to go to the Jury to support that</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE HILL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of the same opinion; it was no offence under the second section unless the party charged had possession of the goods, knowing them to be marked; this was made clear by a reference to the recital in the first section; the possession in the second section was put in exactly the same category with the concealing, which was a positive act done by the individual in order to constitute the crime; in his opinion it was necessary to show that the party sought to be fixed with a crime under the second section, had a knowledge that the goods were marked with the broad-arrow, and if he was ignorant of that fact, he was not guilty of any offence within the meaning of the statute; and the application of common sense to the construction of the statute showed that this must be so; if there had been ordered a couple of casks of old metal, obtained from ships, and out of 1,000 pieces, one only bore the objectionable mark, could it he said that the person to whom the casks were sent was guilty of any criminal offence, before he had opened the casks and seen the metal? and yet if this application of the statute was insisted upon, the Crown must go the whole length of contending for that absurdity. It appeared to him therefore to be applying plain common sense to the construction of the statute, to say that no offence was committed against the second section, unless it was shown that the individual in whose possession or custody it was alleged the goods were, knew that they were marked with the broad-arrow</hi>.</p>

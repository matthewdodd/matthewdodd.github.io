               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you known the prisoner long? A.

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When on the chair did she appear sensible? A. No, she kept groaning as she did before.</p>

            . I am a beadle of St. George's, Hanover-square, Grosvenor-place district - King-street is in that district. On the 6th of August I was on duty in Queen-street, and was called, from the opposite side a few minutes to eleven o'clock, and found Mrs. Bryant, her son, and another woman standing there - I was informed that mischief was likely to happen at No. 3, King-street; I gave them a reply, and went into Queen-street again; a little after four o'clock in the morning, when I got to the watch-house in Robert's-buildings, two or three hundred yards from King-street, Weeks came to me, and I went with him to No. 3, King-street; we found the prisoner there, and about a dozen women - a woman laid on a bed on the ground floor very bad; the prisoner was sitting by the side of the bed, and said his wife would soon be better -Mrs. Myers was there, and kept rubbing her breast; she said, "Oh, my heart! oh, my belly! give me some water!" and, "Turn me, turn me!" she appeared in great pain -I could see her flesh rise up, she was swelling so fast; Myers then put her arm round her shoulder, and sat her up in bed; the prisoner did not leave till she died - he was by the side of the bed; Myers said to her, "Ann, how did this happen?" she answered, "It was father did it - he first ill-used me, and then threw me out of win<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100030"></xptr>dow" - she asked her a second time, and then she said, looking at the prisoner as well as she could, and pointing to him, "It was you that did it - you first beat me, and then threw me out of window; you did it, so help me God!" the prisoner told her not to tell lies, for if she did she would not go to Heaven, she would go where they make horse-shoes - that is all that passed in my hearing; Myers said something to her about dying, which I do not recollect - she died about six o'clock, about an hour after this conversation; the prisoner said she had attempted to drown herself previous - that she had been drinking with other people the day before, and when he came home he had nothing but potatoes for dinner; this was after her death, when I went up stairs with him to get his things to take him to the watch-house, about half-past six o'clock - Mr. Martin had bled the deceased in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether the prisoner is a foreigner? A. He appeared so - his manner of expression was curious; I think the woman was too much in pain to be intoxicated - there were eight or twelve people in the room; I was about a yard and a half from the bed side - I cannot say whether she smelt of liquor, or not; there was a smell in the room as if there had been liquor there, but so many people were there I could not say who it was from - the prisoner was sitting on the bed side when I went in, and I should think sat there for an hour or more; he rose, and said he wanted to go backwards once - I told him to stop; he went backwards: he had neither coat nor waistcoat on - he had breeches or drawers on; I saw a man in the house, who appeared a foreigner - I sent him for a coach; I did not hear him called Francis - there were a good many people in the room; I saw no men but the prisoner and the foreigner.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When the prisoner went backwards, did you go with him? A. I went to the door, so that I could see him; the room that smelt was on the ground floor - he said she would soon get better, and he would make her answer for it; he slapped the side of her face, and kissed her repeatedly.</p>

             - we lived on the first floor front room, under the prisoner and deceased. On Friday morning, the 7th of August, about three o'clock, I heard the rattle - I awoke, lifted up the window, and the deceased was laying on the ground under our window, which is straight underneath the prisoner's; I had heard no previous noise - she groaned very much; I saw Weeks, and shortly after that I heard the prisoner come down stairs - I had not heard his window open; I had remained in my room all the time till he went down - I then went down, and saw the deceased brought in and placed on a chair; she spoke in a few minutes - the first thing she called out was,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God! Kennedy, you have murdered me;" he was present - I cannot say whether Weeks was there; a great many women were in the room - I assisted her as well as I could; the prisoner was down by the bed side - she was on a chair; he and I helped her on the bed - she had nothing on but her shift and a pair of stockings; no cap or handkerchief: she was about thirty-five years old - I stood by her till she died; I turned her often, because she called to me, "Jane, dear, turn me - oh, my back! oh, my heart!" that was her cry in the prisoner's presence, she was in such pain and agony - I do not think she would have said any thing, but I said, "Ann, my dear, like a good soul, will you be so good as to tell me how this happened, that you are in this state;" the prisoner sat by her at the time - she said,"Father done it;" she always called the prisoner father - I said, "Like a good soul, with the dying words in your mouth, be cautions what you are saying;" she said, Kennedy did it, so help her God, putting her hands together; I replied, "Ann, my dear, this is death and life, be very cautions what you say" - she replied quite sharp, "How often will I tell you, Kennedy done it;" she was an Irishwoman - he replied, "You blackguard, don't tell lies - if you do you will never go to Heaven, but your soul will go where they make horse-shoes;" nothing was said about her wounds, or her coming out of window - she said he beat her and ill-used her, and was so savage he threw her out of window; I am sure these are the words she used before he replied, "You blackguard, don't tell lies" - the prisoner at this time seemed very much in trouble about her; he sat patting her on the cheek and kissing her, very much in trouble, and cried very much - he seemed quite sober; Mr. Martin came between five and six o'clock, and heard what she said to me - she appeared in a dying state at the time she made these answers; she took death to her, and prayed to God to take her in mercy - she had not any appearance of being in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether she had been drinking the day before? A. I was out at work all day, and cannot tell; my husband works in the same factory as the prisoner - we sleep under the room they lived in; I had been in their room about seven o'clock in the evening - I think it was about half-past eleven when they went to bed; my husband went to bed before them, but it was twelve o'clock when I went - I cannot say whether she slept in her stockings; there are three rooms in the house; the prisoner cried very much, and seemed greatly distressed - Weeks came into the room when the deceased was brought in; he had to go to call the hour - she was put on the landlord's bed; my husband came down about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Mr. Martin was there when all this conversation took place; do you recollect at what time he came in? A. I should think about five o'clock, I cannot positively say - I was there when Mr. Bond came, between three and four; the deceased did not speak much then - her name was

            . I am watch-house keeper of Grosvenor-place district. On Friday morning, the 7th of August, about six o'clock, the prisoner was brought in by Southerwood; I asked what the offence was - he said in his presence, that he charged him with throwing his wife out of window; he was near enough to hear it - I knew him, and said "Kennedy how in the world did you come to do such a rash act;" he said"Oh, I was in a passion, Mr. Jones" - he was crying, laughing, and singing all the while he was in the prison, and he said he did not care about hanging himself, only his poor Nancy; but he did seem to know what he was about - I cannot tell all he said, he talked in such a manner.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Queen-street, Pimlico. I was sent for about half-past three o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner and deceased - she was in the parlour, on a chair, and was quite insensible; there was no external injury to be observed - I heard what had happened before I arrived, and she presented the appearance a person would under such circumstances; I spoke to her, but got no reply - she did not groan loud, but appeared suffering great pain, and to be seriously hurt internally; her eyes indicated internal injury - her pulse was very slow and weak; she was at that time not in a fit state to be bled - I did not bleed her, but ordered her to bed, and sent her medicine; I called again between eight and nine o'clock, and found she had expired about six - I then examined her body more particularly, it was very much swollen; there were some marks of bruises about her breast, and a slight bruise on one foot - if the lungs had been ruptured, and the air escaped through that rupture, it would account for the swelling; falling or being thrown from a second floor window was very likely to produce a rupture of the lungs - I believe the body was not opened at all - I have no doubt the violence received was the cause of her death; the prisoner appeared anxious about her state, and kissed her several times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And appeared in great distress of mind? A. He appeared anxious - I did not observe him cry; the cause of death was so evident, I did not think it necessary to open the body.</p>
               <p>Q. In cases of habitual drunkenness, and great excitement arising from that, have you not known blood-vessels to burst? A. I have not known such a case - it may have happened; but that would not rupture the lungs, and I am certain they were ruptured; it was evident, because the whole body was distended with air from the lungs; that could not be in the manner this was, without the lungs being ruptured - she had nothing but her shift and stockings on - I had a full opportunity of examining her body, there was no external mark at that time; if she had been beat, there would have been marks.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were the indications she presented such as a person would being treated as described? A. They were, except that she was not fractured.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would not the bursting of a blood vessel occasion those appearances? A. No; I have no doubt her being thrown out of window occasioned her death - if she had been thrown out with violence I should have expected to have found bones broken.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had fallen without violence, should you have expected it? A. It is impossible to say - I have known a man fall ninety feet without breaking any bones; a man fell from the clock of St. Martin's church.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If you had bled her when you first went, would it have tended to hasten her death? A. It would; she would never have recovered her senses if she had been bled at that moment, for her pulse was scarcely perceptible - she was very cold, and the pupil of the eye dilated; I considered it a fatal case from the first moment.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could a rupture of the lungs have taken place without perforation by a fractured rib? A. It is very possible to have happened without it; the concussion might do it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Eden-square, Pimlico. On the 7th of August, about six o'clock in the morning, I was desired to attend, and saw the prisoner and deceased; her face, neck, chest, and abdomen were very much swollen - she appeared sensible, and had a natural pulse; she presented appearances which might be expected in a person being thrown, or having fallen from some height; I attribute the swollen appearance of her body to a rupture of the lungs - I did not conceive medical aid could save her life; I bled her in half an hour, as re-action had taken place - I did it to prevent inflammation; the pulse had quickened from seventy to ninety - I was sure inflammation would follow such an occurrence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might not a pulse be quick from irritation and debility as well as inflammation? A. Yes, it might be quick from irritability - when I first saw her there was not great nervousness and debility.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You made no internal examination? A. No; I attribute her death to a rupture of a blood vessel in the abdominal cavity as well as the lungs -I think it very likely to have been the mesenteric artery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you mean before by saying you attributed her death to the rupture of the lungs? A. I attribute the swollen state of the body to the rupture of the lungs; the air escaping from the lungs would occasion the swelling of the body - I attribute her death to the rupture of the artery in the abdominal cavity.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If the artery you speak of was ruptured, would bleeding tend to remedy it? A. It would not.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How much blood did you take? A. About eight ounces; my object was to prevent inflammation - I had no notion of a rupture of the abdominal artery then; the blood I took from her could in no ways contribute to the immediate cause of her death - if I had known a blood vessel was ruptured I do not think I should have taken the eight ounces of blood; if the case occurred again I should not bleed - I do not think it in any way hastened her death; if the case occurred again, and I had been aware of the circumstances, I should not have done it - I should be guided by the state of the pulse and the state of the woman; I do not think bleeding would do good when an artery is ruptured; I examined her body - no bone was fractured; her eye was closed with the swelling - I tried to open it, but could not; she had a fair natural pulse; I had not seen Mr. Bond.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you first saw her was she sensible? A. She appeared so - I considered her case fatal from the first; I have no reason to know whether she thought so - I did not hear the conversation between her and Mrs. Myers - I was there rather more than an hour; I left the room twice, for about five minutes; I had no conversation with her as to what had happened; she complained of a violent pain at the chest and belly - I did not tell her she could not recover, nor give her hopes of recovery - I did not hear her say any thing to the prisoner; he now and then asked how she felt, and appeared very anxious.</p>
               <p>MR. BOND. I considered it a hopeless case from the first; her pulse was by no means natural when I saw it.</p>

I was not there when Mr. Bond came; Mr. Martin came about five o'clock; I had been down stairs about an hour and a half then; the conversation which I had with her was after Mr. Martin came; it was a little before she was bled, and I thought Mr. Martin was within hearing; Southerwood was there; I did not notice when Mr. Martin went out of the room - there was a great many people there.</p>

            . I am the wife of Thomas Bishop, a watchman, and live at No. 7, King-street, opposite the prisoner. On the morning of the 7th of August, I was awoke by a cry of Murder! from a female voice, and after that I heard something fall like a parcel of flower pots; I then heard a rattle spring; I looked out of window directly- my bed-room window faces the prisoner's; I saw nothing of him; I saw the watchman come to the body, and say,"What is this! here is a naked woman" - Kennedy was then at his own window; I saw him at the window, but did not see him come to it, nor hear it open; he said,"What is the matter, is that you Nance? she is my wife;" and then he said, "Good God! how came she there, I was fast asleep in bed - I undressed her last night and put her to bed, and we went to bed together" - I then saw him strike a light; he came down stairs; I went into the room afterwards; the cill of the window comes up to about my breast; the deceased was rather taller than me, and rather stout.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home to dinner: my wife was drunk; I had to run back to my work for fear of quarrelling with her; this was the Wednesday night before; Mrs. Myers came up and offered to lend me a shilling; I and my wife were in bed: I said "I don't want it," but my wife might put the shilling on the table, and she did; in the night we began to quarrel about the shilling: I said,"I must go to work in the morning, you go and give her the shilling back again in the morning." Well, next day she and Myers were drunk together, and in the evening, when I came home, my wife was drunk again; the tea-things were on the table; I was afraid she would throw them down, and I undressed her and put her to bed: I went out with Myers, and had two pints of beer at different places, and I thought I would take my wife a pint home, supposing she was sober. Well, she came and met me round the corner, and called me a blackguard; I said"Come home, here is a pint of beer;" she came home and sent for half a gallon of beer; I went out afterwards for another pot; I got her to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and about four, I always used to call her - I said"Ann, did you hear the watchman call out, for I must be up at five." Well, I felt in the bed and she was gone; I said, "Now she will get to her foolish tricks again, and hide herself;" she had gone to the water-side four times to drown herself; she had been married before to a Dutchman, who ran away from her, because she was always drunk. I could do no work when I came to this house, this woman of mine was always drunk with Mrs. Myers, for she would make her sell the last shift she had on, and has stolen my wife's money from her pocket when she was drunk; I could not keep the woman sober, but that was all the fault of that woman; she sold all my furniture for 7s. 6d. which was worth 3l. 10s., and that woman robbed her of the money; she was always beastly drunk in the street.</p>

            . I am a physician, and have been so nearly nineteen years - I have heard the evidence of both the medical gentlemen, and gave it all the attention in my power. I should say decidedly that the cause of the woman's death could not be ascertained without a post mortem examination.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you come here at the prisoner's desire? A. I came here accidentally, and sent the prisoner's counsel a note, disagreeing with the whole of their opinion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have heard the situation in which the woman was found, having either fallen or been thrown out of window, and no account of any illness before, and have heard what the appearances were at this time? A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state that you have any doubt whether being thrown out of window was the cause of her death? A. Such a cause would certainly produce death very rapidly; but as the body was not opened, and whatever violence was done seems to have been internal, and the body not opened, no man can draw any positive inference as to what was the injury; I should suspect her death arose from the fall, but not be able positively to ascribe it to that.</p>

            . I am landlord of the house the prisoner lodged in. I saw Harris the day before her death, about ten o'clock in the morning; she came into my room in liquor - I saw her all day going backwards and forwards in liquor: I saw the prisoner come home to dinner - he came down directly with two cold potatoes in his hand; I saw Harris after, and heard her, at half-past ten, talking to my wife.</p>

            . I saw the deceased at nine o'clock on the morning before her death, intoxicated, and saw her at six in the evening in the same state; the prisoner was not at home then - I gave her a glass of spirits that night, for she had teased me all day for it; this was about half-past three in the afternoon - I afterwards went out with the prisoner; we had half-a-gallon of beer together, between six and seven; he brought a pot home into my room for Harris - she took part of it; they staid there drinking till about half-past nine, and went to bed at a quarter to twelve - their bed-room is immediately over mine; I heard them going to bed - I could hear footsteps; I heard no quarrelling in the night.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. At what hour did you go to sleep? A. I suppose about a quarter past twelve. I was awoke in the morning by my wife and daughter shouting out that Ann was thrown out of window; I did not hear the rattle spring, nor any cry of murder.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave a drunken woman spirits? A. She teased me so long for it, I gave her two-pence to buy it; I got up immediately after the alarm, and was in the par<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100033"></xptr>lour where the woman lay for about ten minutes - I went away at half-past five to go to work - I had got up about half-past three; I was in my own room all the time, except for about ten minutes - my wife was in the room with the deceased; she was sober - I did not hear her say any thing to the deceased, or the deceased say any thing to her; I was not in the room then - she was groaning when I was there - I saw Mr. Martin; I suppose a dozen people were in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did your wife and daughter say? A."Murder, murder! Ann is thrown out of window!" They were in my room then; they awoke me telling me so - they were clapping their hands and shouting out; my wife had opened the window, it seems, to look out - she was naked.</p>

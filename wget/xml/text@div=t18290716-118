I left the house at four o'clock on Monday afternoon, the 6th of July - all was safe then; we have a porter lives in the house- my father had not been in town that day; I returned on Tuesday morning, and had information from the porter - I examined, and found a strange key in the warehouse door, which is connected with the hall; it cannot be got at without entering at the street door - it is an inner door; I afterwards saw the real key in possession of the porter - I missed ten pieces of silk from the warehouse; they are valued at 80l., which is considerably under the value; I had seen them safe when I left the house - I have seen nine of them since, and am certain of them; (the prisoner is an entire stranger to me) he was then in custody at Worship-street; the warehouse is part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Your father does not sleep there? A. No, he has not for six years - the servant sleeps in the lower warehouse, from which the goods were taken; they had been sent from Colchester, in a basket, two days before the robbery; my brother put tickets on them, with the length and quality, and those tickets were on them when I saw them at the office; some of them have come off since, as they have been handled about. I think I can identify them without the tickets, but will not say till I see them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Comber; I have slept there these twelve months as his servant. I went to bed on Monday night, about nine o'clock; the house was all safe then - I was not disturbed in the night; I got up between six and seven - the warehouse door was secure, as I had left it at night; I had left the key in the door: after I got up I went into the upper warehouse, where I have a little room - I remained there till between seven and eight o'clock; when I came down I unlocked the warehouse door, put the things right, came out at eight, double-locked the warehouse door, and took the key up stairs with me - all was safe then, and the street door also; I came down about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, and had to go about eight doors off - I was gone two or three minutes, and as I came back I found the warehouse door ajar, and a strange key in the key-hole; I stepped into the warehouse, and saw a letter lying on the floor - it belonged to the gentleman who had sent the silk up, and should have been in the basket - I was then certain the basket which contained thirty-one pieces of silk, had been opened; I found only twenty-one pieces left - I had left the street door ajar, and found it still so: some person belonging to Mr. Smith's family, who live up stairs, had opened the street door; I saw the silks at Worship-street last Saturday, and the prisoner in custody - the silks were wrapped round with square pieces of paper, attached to each piece, but at Worship-street the paper had been taken away, and was loose in the bag, but the tickets were on the silk; I am certain of its being the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are the prosecutor's servant? A. I have charge of the warehouse, and sleep there; I pay no rent, and have not less wages on account of sleeping there - the property was taken from the lower warehouse; I saw it safe that morning - I am certain it was safe at eight o'clock, for I am sure nobody had been in the warehouse then: I went to No. 10, at twenty minutes to nine - the warehouse was broken open between eight and the forty minutes I was up stairs; I am quite sure I locked the door.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. A little after nine o'clock, on the 7th of July, I went to Whitton's house- the street door was open; I found the prisoner's wife in the room - I asked her if she had any thing there that did not belong to her; the prisoner was not present - I searched under the bed, and found a black bag, containing nine pieces of silk, which were afterwards claimed by Mr. Comber; I took the woman to the office, with the silk, returned to the house, and in a little while saw him go in in company with another man - I followed, and took them both into custody in the passage; I asked the prisoner if any property had been brought in there, for I took him for some silks - he said he knew nothing of any silks at all, for no bag of silks had been brought in before he went out; I took them to the office - the other man was discharged; Mrs. Whitton lives in the lower part of the house: I found in the room two skeleton-keys on the top of the drawers, and four other keys - I tried one of the skeleton-keys to the warehouse door, it would open it with difficulty;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160054"></xptr>I saw the key which was in the warehouse door - that was a skeleton-key; some of the silks had papers round them, and the paper of the others were loose in the bag - there were nine papers in all, and tickets to the silks - some were loose in the bag; here are five papers which were loose in the bag - the tickets have all come off since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you kept them ever since? A. Yes; I found only his wife at the lodgings at first - the prisoner made no resistance; I handcuffed them - the wife did not refuse to go with me; she told me there was nothing there, and when I found it she said it was brought in by somebody who she did not know, while her husband was asleep.</p>

            .

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Tuesday morning, the 7th, about eleven clock, I was seat for to Mr. Comber's warehouse; I examined the premises, and found the skeleton key in the door - I took it out, and tried it; I at first could not unlock it, as the key was bent a little; I got a locksmith, took off the lock, and found it would unlock it, but it had been strained in unlocking it; when I got back to the office I found the prisoner in custody with the bag, and the silk - I saw the silk in it; Mr. Comber swore to it, and described the tickets before he saw them - they corresponded with his description.</p>
               <p>MR. COMBER. I know the hand-writing on the tickets to be my brother's - I am positive of the silk; I know nothing of the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know the silk by the tickets? A. That is a very strong corroborative circumstance; the goods are manufactured at Colchester - there is a particular make about the Colchester goods; I could not identify it by the fabric by this light, but I saw it by day-light at the office. and have no doubt of it; we are the only manufacturers at Colchester - we make for wholesale business - retail dealers would have such goods no doubt; I think I can identify them without the tickets, which were on the goods at the office, and I know them by the peculiar manner my brother folds them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out about nine o'clock; I had been out about two hours, and heard my wife was taken; I instantly ran home to see what she was taken for, and does it stand to reason, if I could be concerned in the robbery, I should have run home to get myself into danger?</p>

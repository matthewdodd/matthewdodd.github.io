                  </hi>. I am assistant overseer at the North-Western District post-office in Eversholt Street, Camden Town—the prisoner was also an assistant overseer there—we were both on duty on the evening of 3rd November—about 6.15 or 6.18, while I was at the sorting table, the prisoner came up to the table on the opposite side—I noticed something at the bottom of the right <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> of his trousers—it was the white (edge of a letter; I was about to speak to him about it, but he walked away too quickly, and as he turned round it fell lower down and then on to the floor he then walked round on my side with some letters in his arms, and put them down on the South-Western Railway table—I picked up the letter and handed it over to the inspector—about five or ten minutes after<lb></lb>wards the prisoner went out into the lavatory, where the closets are—he was there about two minutes, and then returned to the sorting table and examined some letters as though looking for something; he then walked up to the letter carriers' seat, where probably the letter would have" been if it had been sorted in its proper place; but all the letters had been cleared from there he then walked away to his general duty—the letter 1 picked up was addressed to Mr. Wootton; it had been folded and the corners had been a little squeezed, as though squeezed in the hand—it was stamped for delivery that hour; it would come to the table where he was—he would have access to any letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> So should I—we occupied similar positions; he—had been raised from a letter carrier and sorter during ten years to that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220108"></xptr>
               <p>position—the room in which this letter was discovered is about three times the size of this Court; sixty or seventy men were employed in it carrying letters to and fro—on this night there had been a failure with one of the railway division of letters—they had been forgotten—I am not aware that the prisoner called Mr. Whitbread's attention to that; I did not—the boy who ought to have brought the letters was off sick, and his duty was for<lb></lb>gotten at the moment—those letters had been sorted and should have gone out at 6.16—there was no confusion at the time I picked the letter up—the duty would be over then—I did not see any letter lying on the floor—the prisoner was carrying some letters in his arms when I picked this up—it was crumpled; it had not been trodden on; it was clean—when I first saw it projecting from his trousers I thought it was his pocket handkerchief—I did not see that it was a letter till I picked it up—I should have spoken to him at first if he had not walked away so quickly—I did not speak to him after—I don't think I should have been right in doing so—he went off duty 8.10 that night and came on again at 4 a.m.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At the time he first came up to the table he had no letters in his hand but in stooping forward to take up a bundle of letters this letter dropped—there was nobody near at the time—no one else could have dropped it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers at the North-Western District—I was on duty there on the evening of 3rd November—at about 6.20 this letter was brought to me folded as it is now—I kept it in my possession till duty was over, 8 o'clock, when I went with Hoddy to the postmaster's private residence—it bears the stamp of the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police officer attached to the post-office—on 4th November about 2.30—I went to the north-western office and saw the prisoner in the post master's room—I showed him this letter addressed to Mr. Wootton and said "This letter was seen last evening to drop from your trousers leg on to your boot and then on to the floor by one of the officers"—he made no reply—I said "How do you account for that?"—he replied "I deny it; I know nothing about it"—I searched him and found a hole in the bottom of his right hand trousers pocket 4 inches long, large enough for the letter to go through, if doubled up.</p>

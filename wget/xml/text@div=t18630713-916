                  </hi> am a sailor—on 24th June, about 8 o'clock in the evening, I met Hayes in the Back-road, Shadwell, and went with her to a house in a narrow lane to a room in the first-floor—Rook came in from another room shortly after I went in, and I was asked to send out to get something to drink—I gave Hayes 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she sent a woman out—I asked if the drink was coming—she said, "Don't be in a hurry"—I told her I would not stop any longer, and got up to go, having waited five or ten minutes—I went to the door, and found it locked—I asked her to open it, and let me out—she said, "No"—I told her I would break it open if she did not, on which Hayes seized me by the collar of my jacket, and tried to get it off, but I was too strong for her—Rook then came, and caught me round the waist in front, while Hayes was behind, and she took hold of my legs, and tripped me up on the floor—they then both got on top of me, took my jacket off, and took 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket—I said nothing about the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before the Magis<lb></lb>trate—they also took some certificates of character from the ships I had served in—they were in my jacket pocket—Hayes passed my jacket to Rook, and I got up, and made a rush at the door after Rook, and got it; but before I got to the door a man came from one of the rooms, and struck me on the head with a piece of wood, which knocked me down senseless—I had not noticed the door by which he came in—when I next remember anything the door was open, and they were striking me all over my body—I got my senses again, and they took me to the door, kicked me out, and told me</p>

               <p>to go away—I sung out, "Police,"—both the prisoners kicked me, and some other person—McKay came up while Hayes was at the door, and I pointed her out to him—I am still an out-patient of the hospital for bruises on my head—I have not been able to go to sea.</p>

On 24th June, about 9.30 at night, I was on duty in the Back-road, and heard cries of "Police" down Angel-court—I went down, and found Robertson, who said that he had been robbed of his jacket and money—he was bleeding from the back of his head, and his face and his shirt were Saturated with blood—I took Hayes in custody—she said, "I had Only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of it"—she was locked up—next morning I took Rook; on the way to the police-court with Hayes she said, "I know nothing at all about it," but before the Magistrate she said, "He gave me the coat"—the prosecutor recognised them both when I took them.</p>

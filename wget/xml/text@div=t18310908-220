            . I occupy a house in Swan-place, Old Kent-road, and am in the employment of Mr. Marchant, of Ingram-court, Fenchurch-street, printer, and have been so nineteen years, seven of which I was an in-door apprentice. On the 12th of August, 1830, I dined at a venison-feast, in Stationers'-hall - I left the hall about halfpast nine o'clock, perfectly sober - I met the prisoner opposite Apothecaries'-hall - I had never seen him before, but have not the smallest doubt of him; he accosted me as I was going through into Bridge-street, and said, "How do you do?" - I said, "I am very well, but I don't know you;" he said, "That's all nonsense, you know how you and I have been situated, I want 2s. of you, I am out of work" - I told him I had no money to give any one; he said, "I will have it, and will follow you wherever you go" - I was in such fear and tremble at the time, I did not know what to do, and thought I would consult a friend - I had the money, but said I had not - I said, "Here, take my handkerchief, wait here, I will go and borrow the money" - I went to Mr. Rowe's, in Shoe-lane, who keeps the Globe public-house, to ask his advice, but he was from home - I came back, gave him the money, and released my handkerchief, considering it was worth more than the money - I then went towards Blackfriars-bridge; which way he went I do not know, but he did not follow - I saw him several times afterwards, and on the 16th of this month I gave him in charge to Betterton, a Policeman - I had related to Betterton, in his pre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080102"></xptr>sence, the whole of the transaction which had passed, but did not state to him any thing of the present charge - I was greatly in fear when I gave him the money.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled, that the language used on this occasion was not sufficient to constitute the offence charged.</p>

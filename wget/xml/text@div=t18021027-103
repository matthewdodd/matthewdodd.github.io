             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. A servant to Mr. Page, in St. John-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with Pamphlin, the deceased? - A. Yes, about six months before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you meet with him on Monday the 4th of October? - A. About 20 minutes before nine o'clock at night; he came to the Bell public-house, Clerkenwell-green, where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any thing there? - A. Yes, we had some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree to go away together? - A. No, Pamphlin went first about three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor? - A. He was not quite drunk: he was the worse for liquor, but was able to walk and talk.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of beer had you? - A. There<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270077"></xptr>were seven or eight in company, and I suppose we had a pot of beer a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see Pamphlin again? - A. At the steps going into the Sessions-house, Hicks's-hall, by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up to him, was it proposed and agreed to that you should go home together to Goswell-street? - A. Yes; I live in Old-street, Pamphlin lived in Pear-tree-street; we proceeded as far as Aylesbury-street from the steps at Hicks'shall, when I told him my nearest way was to turn down St. John's-street, and go down Sutton-street, towards Old-street; he said it was no great round for me to go along Compton-street; upon which I agreed to go that way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to Compton-street? - A. About half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got in Compton-street before any thing happened to you? - A. Close to the <placeName id="t18021027-103-crimeloc574">Harrow public-house, in Compton-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were you then walking a-breast or not? - A. I was before Pamphlin about two or three yards, as near as I can say, walking one after the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you come to the public-house, is there a fruit-shop? - A. Yes, a green-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You being before Pamphlin, what occurred there? - A. I passed two young women.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - A. At the green-shop, one was half and half in the door-way, and the other standing on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Pamphlin seem as if he was speaking to them? - A. Not at first; I cannot say whether he missed his step, and caught hold of the young woman to save himself, or whether he caught hold of her wilfully, I cannot say, for I kept walking on, and might be six or eight yards before him when I missed him.</p>


               <p>Q. Whether from his missing his step or not, did you hear the women say any thing? - A. I heard one of the women say, "I am not one of that sort;" says Pamphlin,</p>
               <p>"I like you the better for that;" then I heard the name of Jem called out, but I cannot say by whom; I returned back to Pamphlin, and asked him to come along home; as soon as I spoke, three men came round him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they come from? - A. From the Harrow, as near as I can say; they did not come further than from the public-house door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any person of their description in the street before that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the three persons that you suppose came out of the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Briscoe was the first, and another, of the name of Smith, was close to him, and Denham.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say that Smith, was the first who made any attempt? - A. No, Briscoe; I saw him make two attempts at Pamphlin, first with his fists; and observed that three or four more came round me, so that I was separated from Pamphlin.</p>
               <p>Q. Who surrounded you? - A. I know none but Denham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other attempt made by any body on Pamphlin, except what you have stated? - A. No, because I was separated from him, and drawn to the other side of the street, where I tried to make my escape, which I did at last.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you made your escape, did you receive any injury? - A. I did not know of any, except one blow in the face, which I had a black eye through; that was all I knew of till I got home to my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see Pamphlin? - A. He overtook me before I got to the top of Compton-street, into Goswell-street, and asked me how I came off; I said I had a blow in the face, and was afraid I should have a black eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any complaint? - A. He complained of his sides being very sore, and did not know what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you part? - A. Just at Mr. Gordon's, in Goswell-street; he went up Peartree-street, and I went home, to No. 3, Dolphin-court, Old-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley, Counsel for Briscot and Denham. Q. Your back was towards Pamphlin when this affray took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These young women had been buying fruit, or something? - A. I cannot say; I passed them.</p>
               <p>Q. The first thing you heard was one of them say, we are not of your sort? - A. Those were the first words.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say you turned round, and saw Pamphlin strike against one of them? - A. It was before she made use of those words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see whether it was between her thighs, or upon her thighs, that he happened to strike? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't know whether it was about the thighs that he happened awkwardly to take her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That woman he struck turned out to be the wife of Briscoe? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of the women run to the publichouse before any of the men came out, and make an alarm? - A. I don't know; I heard the name of</p>
               <p>"Jem</p>
               <p>"called out.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether it was by accident or design he fell against the woman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for her saying, I am not one of your sort, unless he put his hand upon her by design? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any of the polite language he made use of? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any observation made by him? - A. I heard Pamphlin say, he liked her the better for that.</p>
               <p>Q. When the men came out, Briscoe squared at him with his fists? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270078"></xptr>Q. Pamphlin was a strong sturdy fellow, was not he? - A. He was a strong young man.</p>
               <p>Q. As big again as Briscoe, was not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After Briscoe squared at him, did you not see him knock Briscoe down? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Briscoe on the ground at all, as if he had been knocked down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Smith was the second person who came up? - A. Smith was close to Briscoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Denham was third man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you were separated from Pamphlin by the other people that came round you, Smith remained with the deceased; he did not attack you? - A. I cannot say whether he did or not; I partly judge he was one of the party, but cannot say positively only to Denham.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Smith one of the persons that remained with the deceased? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you say whether he was one who attacked you? - A. I partly think he was one by his size and description.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say whether Smith remained with the deceased, or came up to you? - A. I cannot tell where Smith was after I was separated from the deceased; he was first with Briscoe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you never said that Smith was the person who used the knife, and cut you? - A. No, I saw no knives.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see a knife in the hands of Briscoe or Denham? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say what time it took up? - A. It might be about five minutes from the first commencement till Pamphlin overtook me; it did not last longer than three or four minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect what passed that evening? - A. Yes; Mrs. Briscoe and her sister went out to buy some apples, and returned; in about half an hour they went out a second time; I went to the door to make water, and saw two young men come up to the girls, and behave very impudent.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what they said or did? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they do any thing? - A. No; when they were impudent, Mrs. Briscoe went in for Briscoe.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell us what they said and did? - A. They said they would - them fairly; then Mrs. Briscoe went in for Briscoe and Denham, and Briscoe came out first with an open knife in his hand; he opened it first as he came out of the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he get it? - A. It was in his pocket; I saw him take it out; then Denham came out afterwards, and opened something that he pulled out of his pocket; it opened like a razor; Briscoe went up to the two young men, who were together, and Denham followed; Briscoe cut the man several times, and Denham cut him too.</p>
               <p>Q. Which man did they cut? - A. I cannot say which it was; they were both together at the time; they both cut away at the men, and then the men run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them struck before at Briscoe or Denham? - A. No, I did not see either of them; we then went back-again into the house.</p>

I said, "no further than seeing the papers;" he said, "he, his wife, her filler, and Denham, were together at the Harrow, with some more, on Monday evening; that about half past nine his wife and sister went to buy some fruit, and met two men; that one of them said to Mrs. Briscoe, come here, and I'll turn up the lap of your liver, and to the other he said, go home, Ma'am, or I'll kick your a -; that then Briscoe went up to him, and asked him what he wanted; that the man said, to wring his nose, and Briscoe said, he stabbed him in the side with a knife."</p>

Yes, and he told me, that in the morning when he awoke he looked at the knife, and found it all blood in the socket, which was caked like bullock's liver, and that he threw it down the necessary; he said he thought the man would know him by the white buttons on his coat; that he would get his white buttons cut off, and have others put on; that a few days before he had sharpened the knife, and tempered it so, that it would not turn against any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the reward offered? - A. Yes, fifty guineas; but I did not do it for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in company with Briscoe and you? - A. Yes, a young man.</p>
               <p>Q. An acquaintance of your's? - A. No; I have not seen him above three or four times; his name is Joseph, but I don't know his other name, or where he lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Briscoe acquainted with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This man heard the conversation as well as you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when he came home on the 4th of October? - A. I was sitting in the chandler's-shop where we lodged, he went to bed and I followed him; he appeared as if he was rather in liquor, and he laid himself down on the bed; I told him to get into bed, but he did not; I then got into bed, and he lay as he was, till the candle went out, which might be about an hour; I called to him to get into bed, for he would get cold; he said, he could not, and asked me to help him; I went down stairs for a candle, and when I came up again, I told him to strip, he said, he could not; I pulled off his cloaths, and got him to bed, but I found a great quantity of blood, when I pulled his cloaths off, on his left-side, rather behind, under his arm; I fetched a surgeon, who dressed his wounds; one was under the blade-bone, and the other at the bottom of the belly; these two were found out that night, next morning, another was found on the other side his belly, just answering the other; he was then taken to the hospital.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You are housesurgeon, at Middlesex-hospital? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday the 5th, did you see the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe his situation? - A. He had three wounds, one in the right shoulder, and two in the belly; two were not very considerable, but one was mortal.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. On the left-side of the belly; I cannot say how far it had penetrated, but it had wounded the intestines; it appeared to have been given with a sharp pointed instrument, but flat at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a knife likely to inflict it? - A. I think very much so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the patient live? - A. From Tuesday nine o'clock in the morning, till about half past five next afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that wound the cause of his death? - A. I have no doubt it was; I have every reason to suppose it, though I cannot positively say, perhaps neglect might be partly the cause, though I don't think it was curable; the other wound was not sufficient to kill him, but that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the deceased? - A. I asked him if he had had any quarrel? - A. He said, no, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to believe he was conscious that death awaited him? - A. I don't think he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You are of opinion that his wounds being neglected might occasion his death? - A. We look upon all wounds in the intestines, as mortal, but notwithstanding that, there have been some cases where such wounds have been cured.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no doubt also, that a wound may be inflamed, and that inflammation may be promoted by a variety of means? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not intoxication have that effect? - A. Yes, certainly, but he had lost a considerable quantity of blood, which would counteract that.</p>
               <p>Q. All you mean to say, is, that you believe it was the cause of his death? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was there any thing to justify your opinion, that neglect had taken place? - A. I don't think in any great degree, because inflammation don't come on so very quick, and we had him within twelve hours after the wound.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. A constable, and produce a jacket belonging to the deceased, and a knife which was taken from Baker; as I stood by his side in the office, he offered it to somebody to give it to his father, and heard him say, "give this to my father."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. That is not a buck-horn handle knife? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Briscoe's defence. I have only to say, that I went to the assistance of my wife, but had no weapon of any kind whatever; I am thoroughly innocent of the charge made against me, and firmly believe the witness, Smith, to be the person who did it.</p>
               <p>Denham's defence. My Lord, I am innocent, but I really believe Smith to be the man who did the mischief.(Baker was not put upon his defence.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley here submitted to the Court, that Mrs. Briscoe was a competent witness in behalf of Denham, although she could not be so for her husband, but inasmuch as her husband and Denham were both trying upon one indictment, Denham was intitled to the advantage of the evidence.</p>
               <p>The Court were of opinion, that she could not be admitted an evidence for Denham, without being an evidence for her husband, which, according to the cases determined, could not be admitted, and therefore rejected her testimony.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. A coal-heaver, and live in St. John's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Smith, the witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the Thursday after this unfortunate affair, seeing him? - A. Yes; at his father's garden, No. 8, Sleigh's-alley, St. John's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about himself? - A. Yes; he said he came out of the Harrow on the Monday night, when the name of Jem was called, that he was the first that came out and stabbed the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. How came you to be at the garden? - A. He sent his sister for me, and she said her brother wanted to speak to me.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the Thursday - did you see any bills up about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what had happened? - A. No, not till he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you, when his sister found you? - A. At my father's, No. 13.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he introduce the conversation? - A. When I went in to him, I asked him how it was, and what he wanted me for.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by how it was? - A. I wanted to know what he wanted with me; it was rather a mistake in speaking the word; then he told me the affair that happened on Monday night, and said, Briscoe and Denham were of the party; he said, that the two girls went out, and were insulted by two brewer's servants, and that being used so very ill, Briscoe's wife called out Jem.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who came out of the house? - A. He said, he was the first, and that Briscoe followed, and Denham followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Only those three? - A. Only those three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you whether he stabbed more than one? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you whether he stabbed him once, twice, or ten times? - A. No, he told me he stabbed him, and that satisfied me, and I asked no further, but went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Briscoe? - A. Yes, about five or six years; I knew Denham only a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they were, either of them in custody at that time? - A. I heard Briscoe was taken up on Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not some suspicion it was for what he, Smith, had done? - A. No, he did not tell me any thing about his being confined.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding Briscoe was taken up, and Smith telling you he was in his company, did it not come into your mind he was taken up for the same thing? - A. It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand Briscoe lives in the same alley with you? - A. He had for a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not call upon his friends and tell them this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The bills were posted up on the Wednesday? - A. I did not see or hear of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you know there was suspicion against Briscoe? - A. When Smith told me on the Thursday, that they were taken on the Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. They lived in the same alley with you - Briscoe's wife and sister were taken up, were they not? - A. Yes, on Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you first? - A. Royston.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that? - A. Smith used to be called so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you Briscoe was taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he sent to you to tell you he was the man that had done it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you went before a Justice and told all this? - A. No, I did not; I did not relate it to any body, till the prisoners were sent to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Those men, being your friends, did you not know they were examined five times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any one of the times? - A. Yes, the officers came and fetched me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell what you have told now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith and Briscoe there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Denham? - A. No, not till the last day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing of Smith accusing them? - A. No; I did not know that he had turned any way against them; I understood they were all to be tried for the murder in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not tell the officers you knew nothing about it? - A. I did, and I knew nothing about it; they asked me if I was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened you to mention it now? - A. Because I thought it very wrong for any person to be accused wrongfully, and when I knew he went to speak against the others, I mentioned it, or I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been at work since Tuesday? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at work on Thursday, when Smith sent for you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never mentioned this, till the prisoners were in Newgate? - A. No, because I did not know Smith had turned against them, which I first heard at the Hat and Tun public-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. So long as Smith did not accuse any body else, you did not accuse him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you found he did, you told his secret? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does you employment lead you to? - A. To Mr. Eddington's, at Blackstiars.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you return at night? - A. About dark, and go about five in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he come to the prison? - A. Last Monday, he came to me, and told me, he came to surrender himself, concerning a bill that was stuck up in Compton-street, about a murder; I refused at first to receive him, but he insisted upon stopping.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you refuse to receive him? - A. I told him I did not know any thing of him, neither had I seen any of the bills.</p>
               <p>Q. He importuned you, however, till you did receive him? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been tried, or discharged? - A. I was discharged at Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you confined there? - A. In a cell; I was let out morning and night.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were there, did you happen to meet with Smith, who has been a witness here? - A. Yes, he answered to the name of Royston</p>

               <p>Q. Where was he? - A. Close to the place where I got the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen, that while you were in prison, you talked with each other, about what you were confined for? - A. Yes; I spoke to him two or three times, by the name of Royston; I was getting a pot of water, and I heard him at his cell door; I went up to his cell.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there an opening near where you get the water? - A. There are some bars where I could just see the head of the man, and his handkerchief; he had a red silk handkerchief on; he got up upon the lock of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man gets up upon the lock, can he be seen on the outside of the cell? - A. Yes, he can; I said to him, young man, what are you confined for? he made answer, and said, it is all right with me; I made answer again, and said, how do you make that out, (this was in the evening) and he said he had been called down in the morning, and said, he should be anevidence; that he stuck the man.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it for granted you had never been in that prison before? - A. Yes, I had, the more is my misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. More than once? - A. No, not more than once; I was put in because I would not pay a fine; I was put in fourteen days.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see into the cell, without getting upon the lock? - A. Smith got on the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say you could only see his head and his handkerchief? - A. I could only see that.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. Yes, I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see any other part of him at all? - A. No farther than seeing him go down the stairs once.</p>
               <p>Q. But at the time you are speaking of, you only saw his head and his handkerchief? - A. That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. On Thursday, about the day before I came out; it was the very day before I came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, perhaps, you are not in the secret that he was admitted an evidence only last Tuesday? - A. I don't know, only that some gentlemen had been with him, and he said, it was all right with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure what he said, was the day before you came out, the day before Friday week? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he was the man that had stuck the man? - A. Yes; he said he had stuck the man in the side.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never heard when he was admitted as an evidence? - A. Not till he told me the gentlemen said he should be admitted as an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you desired to come here? - A. On the Thursday evening last; they told me I was subpoened here.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you so? - A. The father belonging to one of the prisoners told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in that strong place since the prisoner has been committed? - A. I have been once; I went there this morning, and took their breakfasts.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a little conversation on the business, I suppose? - A. All the three prisoners said, I must come here and speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You told them what you could say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath you never told them? - A. No, upon my oath, I never told them what I should say here.</p>
               <p>Q. Smith, you say, told you a week ago, he should be admitted an evidence - how soon did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270085"></xptr>tell that to any body? - A. On the Friday that I came out of prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that you told of it? - A. Mr. Burt.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is he? - A. I believe he is one of the constables.</p>
               <p>Q. Belonging to where? - A. I cannot tell, whether he belongs to Hatton-Garden, or whether he belongs to the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him of it on the Friday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not tell the prisoner of it, or any solicitor of theirs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you swear you were subpoened? - A. On Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean in the prison? - A. No, Thursday last, the night before last.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you subpoenaed? - A. The father of Briscoe told me I was subpoenaed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had you any subpoena served upon you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the New Prison the only prison that you know? - A. Yes, the only prison I was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Except Newgate, you know? - A. Not for any misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in any other jail? - A. Never.</p>

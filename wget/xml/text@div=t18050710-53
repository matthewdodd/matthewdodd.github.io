               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, he has lodged with me in a fictious name about three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he come with? - A. He came with the name of Franklin.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know which is his real name? - A. Before the Magistrate in Marlborough-street he gave the name of Fountain, and on a letter that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100064"></xptr>came to him it was addressed Fountain; I lent him two shillings to pay for the postage of that letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take the money from? - A. Out of the till behind the counter; I left the key in the drawer, and when I let the postman out of the shop, I went to my sister to let her know that she must take care of the shop while that man was there while I was out; as I was going out, and while I went to call her, the prisoner was in the shop, and he took the money out of the till, it was in a purse.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you there which he took in your purse? - A. Five guineas, six half-guineas, and seven seven-shilling pieces, and thirty shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the money since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that nobody else came into the shop in the mean time? - A. Nobody else could come in, I had bolted the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you came into the shop did you find the purse was gone? - A. In about ten minutes, the prisoner was then in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he remain in the house after you had missed it? - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any steps to secure him? - A. No, I was not positive it was gone, I thought I might have left it in another place; I did not think he would have the assurance to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are not quite sure that you left the money in the till? - A. I was not at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be more sure of it now that you were at the time? - A. I was sure of it in a quarter of an hour afterwards that it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that it was there at all? - A. Yes, I did, by taking the purse, and giving him two shillings out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the purse to see what was in it, when you gave him the two shillings which you had taken out of it? - A. No, I knew what was in it before; I was certain of the money, because I had it to go and lay it out in shop goods.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the prisoner apprehended? - A. The Monday after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The day this man lost his purse I was absent; on the Monday following he had me taken up; I have lodged with him about three weeks, I was in the parlour talking to his sister at the time he went out to get the warrant to take me up; I am as innocent as the child unborn; he took me up on suspicion, he searched me, and found no money on me.</p>

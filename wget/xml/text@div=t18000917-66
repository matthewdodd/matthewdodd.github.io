(Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. They will not answer the purpose of any other stocks? - A. No; the taps are for the axletrees, and the stocks are to screw the nuts on; it is a thing I never suffered to go out of my shop, it is a right-hand and a left-hand stock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You missed these some days after the prisoner had left you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had them in your possession while he was with you? - A. I saw them every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you not to miss them for several days? - A.Because we did not want to use them.</p>
               <p>Q. Will not that tap fit a die from one inch even to two? - A. We can screw them up to four or five inches.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it will sit a die, from one inch to two? - A. No, it will not sit; the nuts will be of no use, when the work is done, it will not cut a clean thread, unless they are made for each other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you knowledge enough of the subject to say whether these taps are finished by a right or a left-handed man? - A. The taps are one righthand, and the other left-hand, there must be two men employed to use it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember buying any taps of him? A. Yes, somewhere about the middle of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these taps? - A. I am not so well acquainted with them as the man that works with me; I believe these are the same, I gave five shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Pike. They cost me twenty-five shillings new, and they are the better for being old, because they are seasoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy any taps of the prisoner before? - A. No; the taps laid in my shop, I suppose, three weeks before I paid for them; I had them valued by a screw-maker, at four shillings.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had you any stocks to those taps? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are not certain that these are the very screws that you bought of the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did I understand you rightly, that in the begining of your evidence, you said you had no doubt they were the same? - A. I have not much doubt.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any other taps in your house about this time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other man bring you any taps? - A. No; when I bought them, they were very much out of repair, my man was a day and a half repairing them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think any man is able to swear to taps? - A.It is impossible, unless he has a private mark.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Suppose they fit the stocks? - A.There are so many, it is impossible to swear to them; I have two pair with me, the same tap may fit different stocks.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Mr. Pike has said, that it will not answer the purpose, though it is of the same size? - A. It certainly will answer the purpose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do not you think a man could swear to a pair of taps if he had no other in his house? - A. I think he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you employed Tweedie to procure you a pair of taps? - A. No, I had not. The prisoner called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

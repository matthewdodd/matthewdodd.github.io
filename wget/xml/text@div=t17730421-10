On the 12th of April, between two and three in the morning, the house was broke open; it was all fast when we went to bed; the shutters bolted, the sashes put down, and padlocks at the bottom of the sashes; there was nobody in the house but Mr. Baker and myself; I lye in the back parlour and he up stairs; I was the last up. I heard the breaking of the parlour door; I thought it was a noise from the wind which was very high; my parlour door was open; I saw a light and three men; the little one of the prisoners (Oates) immediately put his hand upon my mouth, blast you, says he, if you stir or speak, I'll blow your brains out, I have a loaded pistol here; then he took the pillow from under my head, and clapped it on my mouth to squeeze me down; I said for Christ's sake do not murder me! take what you find; he made no answer, but called to the other men to put out the light; I always burn a rush light, and by mistake I suppose they put their own out; they put out both lights; then they went into the sore parlour and fetched their tinder box, flint and steel and turn screws, which they brought with them, and came and struck a light on the other side of the bed where the escrutore was. All this time Oates was kneeling on my bedside; then the other two broke open the bureau and took what money they found there; there was as nigh as I can remember 12 l. of gold and silver; I saw the money the day before; I looked it over on Saturday night before Mr. Baker paid his men. Then they took the plate out of the closet in the back parlour; there were the pieces mentioned in the indictment (repeating them); Collins asked if I had any thing to drink; I said I believed there was some rum in some of the bottles; but there did not happen to be any, so they took a bottle of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see Collins then to know him?</p>
               <p>Baker. No; I knew him by his voice: just before he asked me if there was any thing to drink, as Oates was kneeling upon the bed, Collins said to him, Strangle the bitch, blast her; then Oates asked me if I was alone in the house; I said yes; he said are you sure; I said yes; for I was afraid if they found Mr. Baker they would kill him; then the other two left Oats centinel over me whilst they went down stairs into a parlour on the ground floor; they broke open an escrutore there, and took out a tray, a silver cream pot, a green purse with about three guineas and a half or four guineas in it, and in a box about twelve or fourteen shillings in silver. (Repeats the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment). Oats still kept guard over me, and asked where the candles were; I told him in a box under the stairs; then he asked where the key of the outer door was; I told him behind the door, hung upon a hook that the chain was put on; then he called one of them to bring his shoes and put them on as he was kneeling on my bed; then he said if I stirred or made an noise for near half an hour, there were several more of them, and they would come back and blow my brains out; then he said you have got a key to your room door, I will lock you in; then I asked how I should get out in the morning; he said, O blast you, somebody will let you out in the morning; they unbolted the door and all went out at the outer door; they found great difficulty in breaking the house open. I believe they might stay in the house about three-quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Oates's face?</p>
               <p>Baker. Yes; I never took my eyes off, and shall never forget it; I have never slept since. I observed he was pitted with the small pox.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you clear as to his person?</p>
               <p>Baker. Yes. We were informed the same morning that they were taken in Duke's Place, offering to sell the plate; I went to Sir

             should know two of them, one that knelt upon the bed, and another by his voice; when he was examined, Sir John put several questions to him that I might hear his voice, and I immediately knew Collins's voice; it is a remarkable voice.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very well satisfied as to that man to his voice? +</p>
               <p>+ Collins has a remarkably deep voice.</p>
               <p>Baker. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing to say to the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Baker. The other I never heard speak; he lighted the candle and was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. In this confusion and terror you must certainly be in, could you make observations upon the dress of the men?</p>
               <p>Baker. They had all great coats on; the great coat that Oats had on when he knelt upon me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210018"></xptr> was exactly the colour of the coat Collins has on now, about brick dust colour. They said they were three unfortunate fellows, they came for money and money they must have; I said I am very sorry for you, so am I says Oats. I really was very much composed; I was not so much discomposed as I am at this moment. Oats said just before he went that I might thank God that they did not serve me as Mrs. Hutchings, at Chelsea, was served.</p>
               <p>Q. from Collings. Whether you know any of my features?</p>
               <p>Baker. No, only his voice; I did not see his person.</p>
               <p>Q. from Oats. In what manner did you distinguish my features?</p>
               <p>Baker. I looked at you steadfastly the whole time you leaned upon me; he held what he called a pistol to my face, and said, blast your eyes, you bitch, don't stir, don't stir; and pushed it into the corner of my eye; the moment I heard them gone from the door, I put too the private brass bolt of the door, and then knocked up the people in the house; I then went down and found the street door open: they got in at the fore parlour window adjoining to the steps; they broke first a pane of glass at the top; then the window shutters, the bottom of the sash was padlocked within side; they broke the glass, then the padlock.</p>

I said I would give him 6 s.

            . I have known him not a fortnight. I have nothing to say any more than I called upon him, and gave him money, and he wanted to go on board a ship on Tuesday. I called upon him on the Sunday night this robbery was done, by his father and mother's order, and gave him some money. His father kept him at Rouston; I heard him say above a twelve month, and had sent down 50 l. to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Beddo, Hulbert &amp; Hulbert—the box was missed on the afternoon of 7th October—on Thursday, the 28th, some patterns were brought to me from Messrs. Vyse, and that led to the tracing of these goods—I went with the officer to the prisoners' shop—I believe Green asked them if they had an invoice of the gimps, and they said "No"—I cannot say which spoke—these goods produced are made specially for us, and for no other house in London—they cost us from 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I also missed eight pieces of braid, exactly the colour of this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). In consequence of instructions from my inspector I watched Walwyk on Thursday, 10th July last—I saw him in Aldgate about twenty minutes past 8—he had nothing with him that I saw—he went into a music shop kept by Ebblewhite's father, and I saw him speak to the prisoner Ebblewhite at the shop and receive a parcel from him—I then followed him to the shop of Mr. King, a tobacconist in Leadenhall Street—he went in and spoke to Mr. King, came out again, and went back to Ebblewhite—he spoke to him and then returned to Mr. King's, they are about 300 or 400 yards apart—he vest into Mr. King's, I want to the window and saw a lot of amber mouth-pieces on the counter, similar to those (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw some<lb></lb>thing given by Mr. King to Walwyk, but was not able to see what it was, Walwyk then left—I went and spoke to Mr. King and then followed Walwyk to Ebblewhite's shop—I there saw him give Ebblewhite some money—he was in there five or ten minutes—he came out and went into the Three Nuns public-house, where he was joined by a man named Edlin—they had something to drink—on their coming out I arrested Walwyk and Underwood arrested Edlin—I said to Walwyk, "We are two detective officers of the City Police—you have sold eight dozen amber mouth-pieces this evening to Mr. King, of Leadenhall Street"—he said "You seem to know all about it, it is no use my denying it, I did"—I then said "What you say to me now may be used against you before the Magistrate"—he said "Well, there is a young man getting them for me, and I am selling them for him; if I tell you the whole truth will it make any difference to me?"—I said "That I don't know"—he said "Well then, it is young Ebblewhite at the music shop"—I then gave him into the custody of Underwood, and I went to Oxford Street, Mile End, and saw Ebblewhite; he lives there—I said to him, "I am a detective officer of the City Police; I have a man in custody of the name of Walwyk, and he makes a statement against you; he says that you gave him eight dozen mouthpieces to sell this evening"—Ebblewhite said "I have not seen him, and I know nothing about it"—I then took him to Seething Lane Station, where Walwyk and Edlin were, and they were all three put in the dock—Walwyk said to Ebblewhite, "You know you gave me those to sell to-night"—Ebblewhite denied it; he said he knew nothing about them—they were then charged—next morning I went to Mr. King's, and received from him 3 meerschaum pipes, 1 cigar<lb></lb>holder, 5 dozen and 8 screw mouthpieces, 1 dozen and 6 mounts, and 10 amber mouthpieces and 1 silver mount I received from Mr. Charreton—7 dozen and 11 I received from Mr. King the same night I arrested the prisoners, and on searching Ebblewhite I found in his pocket one exactly like those which made up the 8 dozen—on the morning of the 11th I showed Walwyk the whole of these goods, and told him that I had received</p>

               <p>them from Mr. King and Mr. Charreton, of Leadenhall Street—he said "Yes, I received the lot from Ebblewhite"—Ebblewhite said "It is no use my denying it; I will tell the truth; I did give them to him to sell the whole of them; I have been getting them from a boy named Ansell who is employed by Mr. Posener, a pipe manufacturer; I am old enough to know better, and I am sorry for what I have done; he has been getting them for me, and I have been selling them"—I afterwards received from Mr. Charreton 41 screw mounts, which I produce.</p>

I live at 65, Great Prescott Street, Minoxies—I was in the employ of Mr. Posener, my uncle, as errand boy for 12 months, up to July last—I am getting on for 15—I first knew Ebblewhite about seven months ago by going over to his father-in-law's to fetch water—about seven months ago he asked me to give him a pipe to smoke—I did not give it him till he asked me several times; I then gave him a briar pipe—I got it from Mr. Posener's warehouse—about a month afterwards he asked me to give him some ambers—I said "I can't get you any"—he said Oh, yes you can"—I did not give them to him—he said something about telling my uncle about the pipe if I did not give him any ambers—I then gave him 2 1/2 dozen—I got them from Mr. Posener's warehouse, about 10th March—he did not give me anything for them—after that he asked me for some pipes—I told him I could not get any—he said the same about telling my uncle—I then gave him three meerschaum pipes, that was about 15th March—I did not receive anything for those—about a fortnight afterwards I got him 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4 dozen or 2 dozen screw mounts from Mr. Posener's warehouse—there was a threat then—he did not give me anything for them—the next was about 3rd April, I then got 3 dozen ambers and gave him; and about the middle of April 3 dozen mounts that did not screw, and about three days after that I got him 3 1/4 dozen ambers—I did not get him anything more till about the 2nd or 3rd June, I then got him about 3 1/4 dozen ambers—he used to</p>

               <p>give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now and then, but not for the articles, I mean not at the time I delivered them to him—he did not say why he gave it me—he did not owe me anything—I cannot fix the date when he first gave me any—about 15th June I gave him 4 dozen screw mounts, and about 23rd June 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4 dozen mounts, not screws—on 28th June I gave him two meerschaum pipes—on 1st July one pipe and one cigar holder, and on 5th July three cigar holders—that was all I gave him—I got them all from Mr. Posener's warehouse—I had no authority from my uncle to take them, I took them unknown to him—I had seen Walwyk—I was at Mr. King's shop on a Wednesday, I don't exactly know the date, I was talking with Carter and smoking a cigar when Walwyk came in; at his request I went out of the shop with him—he then asked me if I had seen Ebblewhite—I said "Yes," and walked away—I had seen the prisoners together before that—I had spoken to Walwyk before—I gave all these articles to Ebble-white—he knew where I was employed; he was at his father's music-shop in Aldgate when I took the articles to him—I took them to the side door.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLS</hi>. I had known Walwyk about a month—all he said to me outside Mr. King's was "Have you seen Ebblewhite?"—I never gave Walwyk any goods, nor did Ebblewhite give me any money in Walwyk's presence—as far as I can say he knew nothing of this robbery—the first time I took the things' was in March last, long before I knew anything of Walwyk—he has never been present when I gave Ebblewhite the goods.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. I am a distant connection of Ebble-white—I did not tell of this till after it was found out—I told my parents—it was after I took things that Ebblewhite gave me money—I did not ask him for it—I don't know where it came from—I had no idea what it was given for; I accepted it and asked no questions—I did not say at the police-court that it was for bringing the things—I don't know how much I received altogether—I was about twelve months with my uncle—I am not still in his service—I lived in Prescott Street, near the premises—I was never about the premises with my cousins—Mr. David Posener has a son, Mr. David was in partnership with my uncle—I never heard about a burglary at the premises—I could not swear that I was not engaged in that burglary, I don't recollect anything about it—I said at the police-court "I don't recollect ever breaking into my uncle's warehouse, I can't say whether I did or not, I never heard it said I did"—my mind is a perfect blank about the burglary, I don't remember anything about it—I don't remember whether I did it or not—I never set up business on my own account—I never told Ebblewhite that I sold goods—I never took anything from my uncle's on my own account that I did not give to Ebblewhite—I smoke, I always buy my own tobacco and pipes—I know a boy named Simmonds; he was at school with me—he has never been accused of burglary that I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I know what burglary means, breaking into a house in the night time—I did not break into my uncle's house in the night time that I can recollect—before I went into Mr. Posener's service I lived with my parents—this Mr. Posener has a very little son, not old enough to be my playmate—Mr. David Posener has a son that I used to play with. Adolph Posene R. I am a pipe manufacturer and importer of fancy goods in Mansel Street, Goodman's Fields—I did not know the prisoners till after the arrest—Anse 1 is my nephew—he has been in my employ about 12</p>

               <p>months as errand boy—he had no authority to deal with any of my goods—to the best of my belief the goods produced belong to me—I cannot swear to them, as they have not my trade marks on them, but I handle them so often I may say they are my children; I see them every day, and am very familiar with their appearance—these mouthpieces are made specially for me at Birmingham by Mr. Gilliver—I supply him with the amber—they are primer primer quality—I have no doubt these all earns from my stock—they correspond in every respect—I never sell the screw mounts in this state, only fixed on pipes—the price of the seven dozen and 11 mounts is 39<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., per gross wholesale and the eight dozen 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen and the screw mounts 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—the price paid for them by Mr. King is very much under the price; in fact they could not be got at that honestly; it is 60 per cent under, or more in some instances.</p>

About four or five years ago David Posener, my brother, was in partnership with me—I do not remember a burglary in my premises four or five years ago—I did not hear of it—my brother said nothing to me about it—I heard of a loss; I know nothing of it personally—I did not sign the charge sheet in this case because the prisoners were taken before I knew of it—the police communicated with me the day or the day after they were in custody—I gave Ansell 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, more than I should give a stranger, to encourage him to be honest and straightforward—I intended to promote him in the business.</p>

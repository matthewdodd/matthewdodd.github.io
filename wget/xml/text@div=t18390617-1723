The prisoners came in about nine o'clock in the evening, and asked for some fringe—Little spoke, and had two yards cut from a piece of blue—she paid for it—I went for change—Bolland was close to her—in: consequence of what somebody said, I went and fetched them back—I know this fringe—it was shown to them five minutes before it was missed.</p>

On the afternoon of the 12th of August I was at work in the livery-stable yard, and saw the prisoner draw this coat out of a headed chaise, get inside the gateway, wrap it round his arm, and run out of the yard—I called to him, followed him, and he dropped it about thirty yards from the gate—I took it up—Jones came up, and I gave it to him.</p>

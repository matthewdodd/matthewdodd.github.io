               <p>the 18th of May the prisoner came to my shop—after she left I had a communication with my apprentice—I went out, and saw the prisoner at the corner of Steven-street, with another woman—I requested her to come back, as she had made a mistake—she came back—I said there was some lace missing—she denied that she had any—the boy said he saw her take it, and put it under her arm—she and her friend were very abusive to the boy—she persisted so much in her innocence, that I was induced, from the possibility of charging her wrongfully, to let her go—they went on to Bedford-square—I sent a policeman after them—he returned with them, and immediately after the beadle came, and said, "There are eight cards of lace thrown down an area in Bedford-square," and another policeman brought in the lace, which I know is mine—it has my private mark on it—the prisoner went near the place where the lace was found.</p>

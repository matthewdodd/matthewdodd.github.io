               <p>ANN FREAK. I am a widow. On the 5th of October I was at the corner of <placeName id="t18291029-258-crimeloc1449">Monmouth-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ask me to lead you out of the public-house? A. I am not saying contrary to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She threw her shawl off when she was sitting on the step of a door, and was sick from the effects of the liquor - she told me to take care of it - I was holding her when the officer came up.</p>

            . I was on my beat that evening, and saw this old lady, who had had a drop, but was not incapable of taking care of herself; the prisoner was with her - she set her down, and then drew the shawl from off her back, and tucked it under her hams; I said to my serjeant,"Do you see that?" he said Yes; I went and asked the prisoner to assist me up with the old lady; she said she was not able; I got her up, and the prisoner took the shawl from her hams, and went away; my serjeant stopped her.</p>
               <p>PHILIP RILEY. I am serjeant of the Police. I saw the prisoner shifting the shawl under her - I said to her, "Why don't you assist the woman?" she said, "I am very bad, and can't;" she went away with the shawl, and I stopped her. She and another sat on the step - the old lady sat on the flag-stones; the prisoner had got as far as the public-house when I stopped her.</p>

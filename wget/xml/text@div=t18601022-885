                  </hi>. I am an assistant in the service of Messrs. McCullock; wholesale druggists, of 5, Coleman-street—the firm consists of William McCul<lb></lb>lock and one other—on the afternoon of 24th September, a few minutes before one, in consequence of directions I received, I watched the prisoner, and saw him take a packet of pills out of the drawer, and put them in his trousers pocket—Frampton's pill of Health was kept in that drawer—there are half-dozen and dozen packets—from the size of the package I could see that it contained a dozen boxes—he then went down stairs—the pills were not in a drawer upon a floor on which he was employed—after he went down stairs, he returned in, I dare say, four or five minutes, and then pro<lb></lb>ceeded to his own department, and then he fetched a parcel out, which I believe contained trousers, but I did not see them—he then went down stairs in a direction to leave the premises—I did not follow him—I cannot tell whether he left the premises—Blair's pill was kept in the drawer as well as Frampton's.</p>

               <p>him take a dozen of Frampton's pills—the prisoner said he had not taken anything off the premises—he gave it a flat contradiction at once, and protested, over and over again, that he was perfectly innocent—a police-constable was sent for, and he was taken away—there were several young men in the department where I saw him take the box, but they were washing preparatory to going to dinner—they would be in the same room as the prisoner was—it is a long floor—there is a number of rows of drawers right across the room, which would prevent their seeing, as the supports go from the floor to the ceiling, and underneath are casks—there is no one here besides myself, who saw this act of his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the service of Messrs. McCullock—from information I received I watched the prisoner—on 24th September, in consequence of what Bishop told me, I followed the prisoner into Swan-yard, where he met a strange man—they walked together into Moorgate-street towards the Bank—they went down on the right hand side towards the Bank, and near the end of Moorgate-street they parted, the prisoner going into Coleman-street again, and the other person towards Finsbury-square—I did not observe that before they parted, anything had taken place between them; they were not out of my sight—during the time they went from Swan-alley to Moorgate-street they were in conver<lb></lb>sation, I should imagine, from their closeness—they both walked rather rapidly, close to each other, but not arm in arm—I did not, during the walk, see the arm of either person raised—the prisoner returned to the warehouse again, and during that time I lost sight of him—he came out again and I followed him again—after the strange man and the prisoner parted, I followed the prisoner into Coleman-street again, into the Three Tuns dining-rooms, and told him he had better come back to the warehouse with me—I did not say why—he asked what I wanted him back for—I told him he would see when we got back—I took him into the counting-house—we sent for a policeman, and he was given into custody—I went to Marl<lb></lb>borough-street—he was accused of taking scammony and, pills from the warehouse—Mr. Squire spoke then—the prisoner said he had not stolen anything—Bishop was not sent for—Mr. Squire, who is one of the principals, was there—Bishop came down into the counting-house after the prisoner was brought back—Mr. Squire asked him, in the prisoner's presence, what he had seen the prisoner do, and he said he saw him take these pills from a drawer—the prisoner was searched at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When Bishop said he had taken a parcel of pills oat of the drawer, surely the prisoner said something? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he said he had not taken anything—he repeated his denial all along from the very first moment we accused him—I had had some communication with Mr. Bishop previously—Mr. Bishop is one of the persons employed at the establishment, as the prisoner was—I saw the prisoner leave the establishment and return—I did not lose sight of him from the time he parted with his friend till he went to the Three Tuns—the place which has been described as where the pills are kept, is on the first floor—the ground-floor is devoted to business purposes too—the prisoner was there for the purpose of finishing off bottles of castor oil—he had nothing to do with the making of the pills, he was there for the purpose of finishing off bottles of castor oil—my department is on the ground floor—I was at the station when he was searched—taking</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you, in consequence of information received by you, gone to Swan Alley on previous occasions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I began on 18th September—I should say I had gone there seven or eight times, and I saw the prisoner meet a person that number of times—the person whom I saw him meet on the 24th and walk with to Moorgate-street, was the same whom I had seen on previous occasions—when I used to watch the prisoner followed him from the premises into Swan Alley—I recollect him meeting that man on Thursday the 20th—on that day I saw a whitey-brown parcel passed by the prisoner to the strange man, who carried it away with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the prisoner being taken into custody did not he give the name and address of the person whom he had met? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor was it procured through him—that person was watched by an officer now in Court, and was given in custody on the 25th, the very day afterwards—he was examined before the presiding Alderman, and discharged—the officer who took him is not here. <hi rend="smallCaps">

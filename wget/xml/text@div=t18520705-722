                  </hi>. I live in Aldgate, and have taken new premises, at 57, Houndsditch. I have had the house repaired there—the prisoner was at work there—I had twenty slips of paper there for the walls—it was green, with gold—there were three yards in each slip or piece—the paper came in, about a month or five weeks before I missed it—I counted it when it came in—it was all quite correct—it was kept in the parlour, which was on the ground floor, in a line with the shop—the prisoner could go to that room—I have seen him there during the time the paper was there—he was left on the premises to work—he did not sleep there—he came to me for the key in the morning, and brought it back in the evening—on Thursday, 17th June, I</p>

               <p>went for another purpose to Mrs. Franklin's, in Crown and Shears-court—I there found this paper—it is the same sort as those I purchased—I then missed one piece, instead of twenty I had only nineteen pieces—I have the fellow piece here to match with this—I also lost seven decanters—I saw them all safe on the Sunday previous to 17th of June—they were in the attic locked up—I went to the premises on the following Thursday morning and found the street door burst open, and all the decanters gone—I have seen two of them since—these are them—they are mine, and were in the attic on the Sunday, with five others—when I got to my premises on the Thursday morning I left a brother of mine in the street to mind the door, and I went to the attic, which had been locked—I found it broken open, and all the decanters were gone—no one sleeps on the premises—on the Wednesday morning I gave the key to the prisoner—he was to do his work on the pre<lb></lb>mises and return the key at night, which he did not—I saw him at his house in Gun-yard on the Thursday, and I said, "How is it you did not bring me the key home last night?"—he said, "I will get it for you," and while he was gone up I called in the policeman and gave the prisoner into custody when he came down with the key—I gave him the key on the Wednesday morning.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>This coffee was in the warehouse that I take care of; it has a King's lock under the excise; the warehouse belongs to Cornish and Brown, rented by them; I am the locker of it, under the King's lock, under the excise; I saw it on Saturday the 19th of July in the warehouse, at two o'clock in the afternoon; on Monday following the King's lock was broke off, about ten o'clock in the morning: I saw the bag afterwards before Alderman Hart, I knew it to be the bag and the coffee.</p>
               <p>By what do you know the coffee? - It is a very singular case, this coffee in this bag is part of a bag of coffee out of seven hundred that we shipped about four months ago, and this fell into the Thames, and was brought back to the warehouse, and was spread abroad, and became mouldy, I have a sample of the bag, the remainder of that was left in the warehouse not being all taken away; this corresponds with the sample, I can swear to the bag, it is lot 131, I lotted it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. It is not impossible for any other coffee to be in that situation, to drop into the river? - Unless another bag had dropped into the river, and then it would not have been the same as that.</p>
               <p>Is it possible for another bag of coffee to drop into the river? - It is possible it might; this coffee was re-bagged in the warehouse where it lay, it was taken part of it away, and part of it split on the ground, and the coffee I can swear to.</p>
               <p>I believe you would be much concerned if you stood in the situation of the prisoner; now pray how many bags of coffee do you suppose go down, and come up the river Thames in the course of twelve months? - A many thousands, twenty thousand; but I never knew an instance of this kind before.</p>
               <p>And in twenty thousand bags, you suppose it impossible that any other bag should be marked in the same way? - I am very positive.</p>
               <p>You are a very positive gentleman as ever I heard of in a Court Justice? - I say, that the coffee that came into the warehouse is of such a complexion.</p>
               <p>And so in twenty thousand bags you can discriminate one bag? - I can discriminate the bag itself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100145"></xptr>Those other people that have the care of warehouses, do they mark their bags, or are they mere blanks? - Upon my honour I do not know, I have nothing to do with other people.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether other people do or not? - I know nothing of other people's business, it is possible they may.</p>
               <p>Do you know it or not? - I do not know it, this I know, this I ascertain.</p>
               <p>You are a very positive and uninformed person? - I deny it, Sir.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is that bag your own marking? - It is, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>On Sunday night between eleven and twelve, I was on my duty, the prisoner past by me, I wished him a good night, I perceived he had a bag on his shoulder, I called to him, he seemed not inclinable to stop, but kept his road; I called to him again and he still went on; I stept after him about fifteen or twenty yards, says I, what have you got here; he said, he came from on board a ship; I said, you must go to my officer, this is the bag, I think I can at any rate swear to it, I observed when I came down it was marked with an H.</p>
               <p>Do you swear it is the bag? - To the best of my knowledge, the bag I took from him I gave to the constable.</p>
               <p>Court to Hish. Was it the bag he gave to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jones. He struck me over the breast with the whole length of his arm, and dropped the bag and ran away immediately? the two men took him, I think that is the man, but it was a dark night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Then you are doubtful whether the prisoner is the man or not? - No, there does not hang a doubt with me, because there was no other person in the way, nor could be.</p>
               <p>Did you notice the person as he passed by you? - Most certainly, he was the other side of the way, he was as far off as I am to you.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make the best haste yourself after him? - No, I kept to my stand, I believe him to be the man, but I will not positively swear to him.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner called two Witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Howell. What weight was the bag? - When it was last weighed there was one hundred weight and a quarter, the bag was cut open, and left one part of it in the warehouse; there might be half a hundred left; there was a stock-lock which was opened, and the door was shut, it was not a spring-lock, I had the Custom House key; the stock-lock, was not broke, I opened that.</p>
               <p>How did they get in then? - I cannot tell, I should imagine by a picklock.</p>

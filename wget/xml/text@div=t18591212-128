                  </hi>. I live with my aunt, Charlotte Rowler, who keeps an eating-house at 4, Belvidere-road, Lambeth—on Thursday, 1st December, about twenty minutes or half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop and asked for a pennyworth of pudding—I served him—while I was serving him another man came into the shop, spoke to the prisoner, and said, "Halloa, mate, where have you been to?"—the prisoner said, "I don't know, about; I am now going home to bed"—I served the prisoner with the pudding—he gave me a shilling in payment—I gave him a sixpence, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, in change, and he left the shop—I laid the shilling that I had received, on the counter—when the prisoner went out the other man remained in—he asked for some pudding also—I served him—he gave me a shilling in payment—I saw that it was a bad one—I bent it in the de<lb></lb>tector, and gave it back to him—he gave me a penny in payment for his pudding, and then left the shop—before the second man left the shop I took the shilling that the prisoner had given to me, off the counter, and on examining it I found that it was bad—the second man when he left, went in an opposite direction to that which the prisoner had taken—I came outside the shop, and looked after the prisoner—when I got to the shop door, I could see nothing of him—shortly afterwards I heard a whistling in the street—I then saw the prisoner—he was coming towards me so as to go the way that the other man had gone—the other man was in sight then—when I saw the prisoner going after him, I went up to the prisoner and laid hold of him—I said, "You have given me a bad shilling"—he said he had not; that he had never seen me before—I said, "You have, and not five minutes since"—he said that he was going after his mate—I said, "Yes, I know you and</p>

               <p>your mate also gave me a bad shilling"—I said, "If you do not come in and give me a good shilling for the bad one I shall give you in charge"—he came in and gave me a good shilling—the other man was then a very little distance off; I cannot say how far—the prisoner said that rather than have any bother he would give me a good shilling, but that he had never been there before—I gave him back the bad shilling that I had received from him—when I did that he put his left hand close to his side, and from it dropped a paper—when he dropped it, he moved his head about as if looking for something—when he left I picked up the paper and examined it, and found that it contained four bad shillings—I crossed the road and gave the paper and the four shillings to a police-constable—I gave information to the constable, who shortly afterwards brought the prisoner back in custody—the prisoner said he was innocent, and had never been in the shop until I fetched him in—he asked me to let him go—I declined to do so, and the policeman took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman at Cornwall-road, Lambeth—on 1st December I was in a parlour behind Miss Kidder's shop, with the door open—I saw the prisoner served with some pudding; the other man came in before the prisoner was served—I saw Miss Kidder bring the prisoner back into the shop—he said, "I have not been in the shop at all, you must have been mistaken, but rather than I would be detained from where I was going I will give you a shilling out of my pocket, than have an accusation against me," or something to that effect—he gave her a good shilling, and took the bad one—I was close to Miss Kidder when she picked up a small parcel containing four shillings—the prisoner had then scarcely got out at the door—it was close by where he had been standing—he was brought in directly afterwards by a constable—I looked at the money and said, "What have you done with the other shilling"—he said, "I have thrown it away."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said that if the shilling was bad, it was no use to me, and I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it out at the door; as for the paper it never was in my possession at all.</p>

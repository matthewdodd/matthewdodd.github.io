               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any charge made against the prisoner about the silk stockings before she left the house? A. Yes; the whole of her wages were not paid - she was taken up some days after she left my service; I had given the officer directions to take her, but he put it into another officer's hands - I gave instructions to the officer that night, but she was sent home on account of her illness; we had another servant coming that night, and did not think it right to keep her in the house - I sent my <rs id="t18290910-199-deflabel1111" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>COURT. Q. You say you had not paid her wages? A. No; her arrangement was that she should have what she wanted at a neighbour's shop - she got into debt 1l. 5s. and I had undertaken that should he paid, the rest was paid to the prisoner - I stated that I should prosecute before any application was made for her wages; I knew what was due, but she could not give me change.</p>

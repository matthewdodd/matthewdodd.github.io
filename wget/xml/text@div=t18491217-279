                  </hi>. I am ten years old, my mother's name is Clara Jermyn; she is a widow. On a Saturday, near the end of last month, I was in Exmouth-street, Commercial-road; I had a bundle of clothes which my mother sent me with—it was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner met me—I had seen her before, she asked me if I would go on an errand for her—when we got to Sidney-street, I saw a name on a door, milliners and dress-makers—she told me to go there, and ask for two dresses in the name of Walker—I left my own bundle with her; she told me if I took it with me I should crumple the dresses—I went, and could not find the place—I came back, and she was still sitting on the step with my bundle—she said I had been to the wrong place—she told me to go back, and try to find it—I went; and when I came back she was gone, and my bundle too—I did not see her after that.</p>

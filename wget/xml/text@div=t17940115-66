               <p>Q. Tell us what you observed on the 28th of December last? - The butcher, William Amos desired me not to serve dinner without he was present, so I went to look for him, and they told me he was gone up the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this alley? - Nigh the slaughter house, I saw him at a distance in it, and called to him and he made me no answer, and I called to him again, and I saw a man running down to meet the prisoner, and the prisoner opened his coat this way, and gave out a large piece of beef to this man, and I ran after him to see which way he went, and he went past master's door, he ran with this beef, and when I came to the prisoner, I asked the prisoner whether he was not ashamed of what he had done? he said he had done nothing to be ashamed of; and I went home, and told what I had seen to the baker.</p>

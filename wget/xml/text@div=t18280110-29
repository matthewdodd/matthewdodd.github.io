               <p>REBECCA CLUTTERBUCK.

               <p>Q. Did you tell her you had been out, and got drunk, but where you had been, or with whom you were, you could not tell? A. I did not, nor any thing of the kind; I did not say I was found lying on the step of a door, in Sydney-street; I said the prisoner gave me a blow there, which knocked me down; I did not say I could not swear who had robbed me, nor did I say no violence had been used to me; I know Thomas Murrell, but never spoke to him about it - he lives in the neighbourhood - I have known him three or four years, as my father lived in the neighbourhood; I had not been at home all that time; I accused nobody else of robbing me; I did not show the watchman any mark of violence.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Saturday night, the 15th of December, at a quarter-past eleven o'clock, as I went my rounds, I found the prosecutrix sitting on a step in Sydney-street; I asked what she was doing there; she said she had been robbed of her shawl and umbrella, and the young man had gone round the corner; I got her up with the assistance of another person who came by; she seemed very stupid - I cannot say whether from intoxication, or what - she did not smell of liquor; I took her as far as Bedford-square, Commercial-road, intending to take her to the watch-house; she then got perfectly collected, and said she had been to the other end of the town for her character, and was going to live at No. 18, Sydney-street - this was about ten minutes after I first saw her; she said she lived in Lady Lake's-grove, and I took her home; she said she should know the man who had robbed her again, but did not describe him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not a young man listening to part of your conversation, and helping you? A. Yes; I called his attention to her - he only stopped three or four minutes; he did not say he had seen her before that evening, and she had no shawl on; he was not a young man - he was rather elderly; he lives at No. 7, Henry-street; she said something about her shoes, which I could not make out - I understood her to say "shawl;" the young man remarked something about her shoes being on her feet - I never said she appeared quite drunk; I know Hale - I never told him so - he lives three doors from my box; I never talked with him on the subject; I did not ask what kind of a person had robbed her; she did not complain to me of any violence being used to her; she said never mind- she believed she had near a sovereign left - all she minded was the umbrella, as it was borrowed; I took her to the light - she examined her handkerchief, but did not unfold it - she felt satisfied that her money was safe; when she got home she fell into hysterics; it was found afterwards that 6s. remained in her handkerchief - the handkerchief was in her hand when I went up to her; she did not mention losing her money that night.</p>

            . I am a clerk to a gentleman in the City. I saw the prosecutrix on this night; I did not come up at the request of the watchman, but I gave her into his charge; I saw her lying down at a door in Sydney-street, and seeing her genteelly dressed, I stooped down, and shook her three or four times - while I was so doing, this watchman came up; I said, "Here is a decent person lying here, you had better take her to the watch-house;" he assisted me to take her up - as we went along, I asked her name - all I could get out of her was "Clutterbuck;" she pronounced that name three times, not very plain; she said she had lost her shoes; I looked down, and said, "You have got them on;" she said she had lost her shawl; she said nothing about her umbrella, nor complained of violence having been used; I went with her as far as my house, No. 7, Henry-street - we might be five or ten minutes going there- it was I that called the watchman's attention to her; I saw the watchman again on Friday night last; he said, "I have got into a pretty trouble" - that his brother watchman had told him she had accused him of taking her shawl; she appeared quite in liquor on the night in question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what way did she appear stupid? A. She appeared stupid, and could not walk straight; she did not tell me she had received a blow; not knowing that she had been knocked down, I concluded that she was in liquor; I did not smell any liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. Supposing she had been knocked down, would it have appeared the same as if she was stupid from liquor? A. It might if she had been knocked down a minute before - if I had heard she had been knocked down, I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100029"></xptr>have looked for the blow; I should have attributed her appearance more to liquor, because she staggered.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Might not her receiving a blow have deprived her of her recollection? A. I should think a violent blow might.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. She gave you no answer - what makes you say she did not appear sober? A. She smelt of liquor - I smelt her - I did not put my face near her mouth - she smelt of rum - I merely passed by.</p>

I never had any quarrel with her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to have this conversation? A.

            . I went to the premises in the City-road, which are the subject of this inquiry, in the latter end of November last; I found them considerably dilapidated - a roof, which had formed a covering for a general ride, was entirely taken away, and in a back building, at the extremity of the premises, I found the timber and boarding of a floor had been removed - the stalls, which had been in the stable, were taken away within a short time, and the doors and chimney-pieces in the house had been removed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you inspected the lease? A. No, but I know generally what the terms of the City leases are; I do not know that I have seen this lease, but it was done in my office, and when I went to the premises the counterpart was put into my hand - I will not swear I read it, but I looked at the plan and at the premises; I believe this lease applies to these premises, but I have not read the lease; I do not think the plan was drawn in my office, but I have known the premises these fifty years.</p>

            . I am a broker. I was employed by the City Comptroller to distress on these premises; I went there on or about the 10th of November - I went again, I think, on the last day of November or the first of December; I then found that some joists and boards had been taken away, and some doors and chimney-pieces.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you state what property was taken from the first time you went to the last? A. The joists and boards of a whole floor had been cut away, but whether they had been taken off the premises or not, I cannot tell; the stalls and racks had been taken before I went.</p>

            . I live next door to the premises, and have known them these forty years; I think it is eight or nine months since the prisoner came there - when he had been there about four months he began pulling down the place; he first took off the covering of the ride where the horses go under, and on the 10th of November I saw a van loaded with doors, partitions, joists, and flooringboards, but I did not see the prisoner then; I met him about that time in Gee-street, and he said, "If you don't pay me my rent, I will serve you with an Exchequer writ" - I hold a four-stall stable and a loft, which are part of these premises; I saw Mr. Smirke in company with the prisoner about that time.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, the 28th of July, the prisoner went to the George and Vulture tavern, with a pair of hinges for a shutter; when he came back, he said the carpenter told him to go and fetch a bar for one of the windows in the garret, and it must be taken directly; he came home, and cut a bar of iron, and made a flap to it, and went, as I thought, to fix it up; it was for the maid's window, at the George and Vulture tavern; he being gone an hour or more, I went after him, and found there was no bar wanting or ordered by any body; I found the bar afterwards by his direction at a public house in the Borough.</p>

               <p>I was in liquor, but I remember the carpenter ordered a bar to be made for a window, and I went home to my master's, and made it, and took it to the house, but could not find the carpenter; I never pawned it, nor made away with it in any respect, but left it at a public house in the Borough where I had been drinking with an acquaintance.</p>

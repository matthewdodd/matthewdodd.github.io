            . We went in about half past five or a quarter to six in the evening. We remained there until six in the morning. About five minutes past six in the morning, I heard a key or a pick-lock enter the lock of the warehouse door. I proceeded from the place we were concealed to the door, and placed myself where in such a situation as to be behind the door it opened. I heard the bolt of the lock distinctly forced back twice. I observed when I got to the door that I had left a light burning. I sent Mr. Pratt to put it out. Before Mr. Pratt could get to the light, I saw the door open. I saw a person enter the warehouse about three feet. There were some packages all round the door, so that it did not open immediately. I saw a person enter about three feet in the warehouse. He stood and looked round him. to see if all was safe, as I supposed. I could see that he had a dark coat on. I attempted to lay hold of his collar, and at the same time to close the door, but I could not succeed in either. I found the door was held fast It was held tight by somebody, that any person that I attempted to seize might run out. He ran out. I followed him close across the street. He turned the corner of Mitre-street. I recovered sight of him immediately round the corner.</p>

               <p>Q. The same person that you followed was the same person that came out of the warehouse - A. I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same body that was moving before you, that you caught sight of immediately you turned the corner - A. It was. He ran down Mitre-street, (it is very short) through a gateway, into Little Duke's-place, down a narrow passage into Great Duke's-place. He turned the corner into King-street. I there caught him just recovering from a fall, as I supposed. The moment that I laid hold of his collar, he said, I am not the man; he has run that way; pointing down the street, in a different direction from the person I pursued. I kept fast hold of his collar. I brought him back the same way that we run. He said nothing. There was a person came up in a light drab coat. He said, all is right. After the prisoner was taken he gave his name

Upon the alarm, I ran out immediately. I was twenty yards behind. I saw the person before he turned into Mitre-street, and I saw him before he entered the passage that leads into Duke's-place. Mr. Hayden had hold of his collar. We brought him back to the warehouse, I saw only one person before, until Hayden fastened upon him.</p>

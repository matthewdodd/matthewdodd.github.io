               <p>The prisoner at the bar came to the shop of Robert Macglew, on the 28th of August, and purchased some goods. I am a shopman. She bought some printed cottons. After she was gone that evening, we missed eight yards of printed cotton, which is now in custody. We never heard no more of the circumstance till the prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was not sold to her? - Positive of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How much did she lay out in the shop? - About 2l. 15s. within a few shillings.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280046"></xptr>Q. A much greater value than the value of these eight yards? - The eight yards is about the value of 15s.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find it? - In the shop, with some other goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Atkinson. Your shop is a very well accustomed shop? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. She paid you honestly to the amount of 2l. 15s.? - she did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before she entered the house had you seen this cotton - I cannot be positive; to the best of my recollection, it was in the house, and shewn to her, and on the counter at the time, but I cannot be on my oath to that, we had only just had the print in a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. Wherever that was found, the shop mark was permitted to be on it from the 28th of August to the 14th of October.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Hanson. You went to the shop of the prisoner's husband, he <rs id="t17951028-29-deflabel167" type="occupation">keeps a linen-draper's shop</rs>

               <p>Q. But he was in custody with her? -He was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found that publickly in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 61, Swinton-street, Gray's—inn—road, and am a carpenter. I was engaged as general foreman, at the new works Billingsgate-market—the prisoner was employed under me—he had been employed there before I went there, as day-watchman and time—keeper—he left several weeks since, on a plea of illness—I saw him at the works about a week after<lb></lb>wards, and said he had been to the yard and seen Mr. Strongfellow, the walk<lb></lb>ing foreman, who desired that he should return to his work—I said, "I thought if Mr. Strongfellow knew what I had ascertained during his absence, he would not have sent him back again; that I had ascertained he had been frequently absent on Sundays, and consequently strangers had been con<lb></lb>tinually about the works, and I should not give him charge of the works until I had seen Mr. Strongfellow, and he might remain until Mr. Strongfellow came if he liked"—he denied having been absent except on one occasion—Mr. Strongfellow came, and I reported to him what had happened—the pri<lb></lb>soner was on the works, but he did not hear—I afterwards went to him, and asked him if he wished to take his box and things—he said, "Yes;" and just previous to leaving, he said, "I did not think it would end thus"—I then dismissed him—I believe something had passed between him and Mr. Strongfellow which I did not hear—on 25th June I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I have seen the prisoner write, and believe this letter and the signature to be his writing—(<hi rend="italic">read—</hi> "June 25, 1851, Sir, I do not know what I have done to you, for you and Maxwell to give me the character you have done; but you had better give your fancy man Mustaff that character, for I know Mr. Jay does not know that you encourage a thief on the works; you were the first one to take his part when he was stopped, and that is the reason you and, Maxwell got me discharged; but never mind, you forget the way you were in before you came there. I have heard your character more than you are aware of; you have made me out dishonest to Mr. Jay, therefore you must be a d—d vagabond for so saying; now for this, the first time I get a good chance I will put you out of the world, and Maxwell as well. I will be hung for you, you d—d infernal rogue; I will waylay you the first oppor<lb></lb>tunity.—I remain, your most inveterate friend, W. Lacey. "</p>

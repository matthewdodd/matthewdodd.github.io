            . On the 6th of September, I was on duty at the fair with Buxton, who pointed the prisoner out to me - I saw her go to Stokes's show; she gave a sixpence, and took change - I ran up and asked Mrs. Stokes to let me see the sixpence. I took her into the show, and found nine shillings, two half crowns, and two-pence halfpenny in halfpence, on her, all good. She refused to say where she lived. We took her to the Compter, and then went with

            . I am a constable. I was on duty with Carlile at the fair when the prisoner was taken. I had followed her from Cloth-fair to the show. I knew her before, and knew she had a stall at the fair, as I saw her bringing fruit where, which she dealt in. She refused to tell us where she lived - she was searched, and the money stated found on her. I went with Harrison to a stall, and found a little boy there. We found two sixpences and a shilling wrapped in cotton, under some nuts. I produce the sixpence I received from Carlile, and the money I received from Harrison.</p>

I went to the stall where I had once seen her about a week before, and found her son there, who is about twelve years old. I found under the nuts wrapped in cotton two bad sixpences and a bad shilling. I am certain it is her stall - I did not see her at it that day. I know she was there two days before.</p>

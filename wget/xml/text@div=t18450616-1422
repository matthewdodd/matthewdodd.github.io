                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Richard James, who did keep the Alfred's Head in the London-road. On the morning of the 30th of April, between seven and eight o'clock, I was sweeping inside the bar—I heard a noise, and on looking round I saw Scollard lying across the coun<lb></lb>ter in the bar, reaching towards a sideboard, on which was some silver—(I had seen him before)—he had got his hand on the money on the side board—there were three or four piles of silver to give change of a sovereiga, in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences—Jones, who was a stranger to me, was holding Scollard by the leg—Scollard let his cap fall off while he was reaching—I saw him take the money—I called out, "Stop thief"—I caught Scollard by the leg and Jones by the collar—Scollard gave a kick with his leg and got away—I still held Jones—Scollard was brought back by the barman in about three minutes—I then left Jones with the barman, and I went up stairs to cull Mr. James—I did not count the mo<lb></lb>ney that was on the sideboard, but I missed three half-crowns, and a good many shillings and sixpences—the barman gave me the money, and I put it on the sideboard.</p>

On the 21st or 22d of June, the prisoner took my two pair back room, at 5 s. 6 d. per week, furnished - I let these things with it; she called herself a married woman, and in the afternoon her husband came - they continued with me till the 20th of August, and paid the rent fairly. About three days after she and her husband had been fighting, about three o'clock he came down, and said I had better go up stairs, and look after my things, or they would all be gone - he went away, and about five or six o'clock she went; about seven o'clock, he came home and could not get in; he broke open the door - in consequence of what he said, we went up and missed fourteen or sixteen pounds of feathers out of the bed - I had examined the bed before they took the room; I also missed the other things, the prisoner was then in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Collyers'-rents, Southwark. I knew the de ceased, William Thomas Wright—he lived with hit parents in White-street, and was ten years old the day this happened—on Friday afternoon, the 3rd of March, I saw him playing at shuttlecock in Collyer's-rents, with my little boy and another, near the residence of the prisoner, who has the care of a chapel and burial-ground in Collyer's-rents—while they were playing, the prisoner came out of his door, and ordered them to go away from the door—they did not do so—he turned round, went in doors, got a small stick, and beat the deceased from his own door till he got to the end of the rents—the blows did not hurt him, they were not heavy, from the stick—when he got to the end of the rents the boy fell down—he got up again, and then struck the prisoner with a small stick he had, which he was play<lb></lb>ing at shuttlecock with; a sort of battledoor—the boy then got up and ran away across the road—the prisoner ran after him and knocked him down with his open hand—he struck him over his head, and the boy fell, and while he was on the ground the prisoner kicked him—I am sure I saw him kick him, and to the best of my recollection it was in the right side—it appeared to be a very violent kick, from the manner of his, foot—when</p>

               <p>the boy got up he could hardly walk, and doubled himself up—he got up as well at he could, and took a handful of dirt or mud in his hand oat of the road and threw at the prisoner—the boy came back to my door—I said, "William, don't throw the dirt at the man, let him go"—he stood at my door crying for some time, with the pain in his side—he appeared hurt, and cried terribly—he went home some time afterwards—I had known him for some time—he appeared invariably in good health, and was a fine boy—when the prisoner gave him the kick, I said he was a good-for-nothing scoundrel for using the boy in the manner he had done—I did not complain of his beating him with the stick; that would have done no harm, it was the kick—I did not see the boy again till the Thursday after, when I saw his mother bringing him from the doctor's, and she was obliged to have a friend to help her—he was then complaining of his side, and was quite stooping—he could not get along—he died on the 28th of March—I saw him after he was dead—it was the same boy I had seen kicked by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. The deceased was my son; his name was william Thomas Wright—he was Leo years old on the 3rd of March—he came home about dusk that evening and complained of being poorly, he sat about a good deal, and went to bed earner than usual—up to that time hit health was particularly good—he was a fresh-coloured, healthy child—he never complained of any injury to his side before—the following morning, at nine o'clock, he refused to go to school, saying he had great pain when be moved his right leg; but I said it was growing pain, and insisted on hit going, and he did go, he returned about twelve o'clock, and still com<lb></lb>plained of pain up his side when he moved his right leg—he did not get any better, but gradually worse—about three o'clock on Sunday morning I was awoke by his retching violently, and I went to him—he still com<lb></lb>plained of pain in hit side—finding he got no better, on the following Thursday I took him to the Surrey Dispeasary—he was there treated by Dr. Hughes—in consequence of what my little boy said, I went to the prisoner's house the same Thursday, and he was whitewashing the front of his house—I asked him if I could speak to the landlord, a person of the name of Stammers—I did not know him at the time—he said his name was Summers—I then said, "Sir, how came you to ill-treat and kick my child in the manner you have done?"—he said he had beat him, but not kicked him, and if I did not go from hit door he would charge the police with me—I said that he might do, and welcome—I did not at first think the boy was so dangerously hurt, but he complained so of his side—he was under Dr. Hughes's care till the 28th of March, and them he died—he complained of pain all over his belly at last—I am not aware of the least injury he had received, or any derangement of his general health, until Friday, the 3rd of March.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am attached to the Surrey Dis<lb></lb>pcuary. I knew nothing of the boy until the 9th of March, when his mother brought him to me at the Surrey Dispensary—he complained of a severe pain in the right side—it affected his gait considerably—he leaned forwards on his right side, with his hand pressed towards his side, as if suffering from pain—I sent him home and examined him in bed—I found no bruise or external mark of violence—oa applying my hand to the part where he complained of pain, it yielded lest than the ether parts—it was swollen, hard, and tender—he could not bear the pressure of my hand on it without suffering—I heard that he complained of pain in moving his right leg—pain would certainly follow on moving the right leg—there was at that time no appearance of general inflammation about the belly, merely local inflammation on the part where the swelling was—he did not appear to be going on well at first—I applied such remedies as I thought proper, and he appeared improving—the local affection extended and became general, and he became much worse alter I first saw him, but after several days he im<lb></lb>proved, and after that he again became worse—the inflammation, when I first saw him, was defined and local, but on the second day it had extended over the whole belly and abdomen, and became a constitutional one—it yielded to remedies after seven days, but he afterwards became Worse, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030236"></xptr>
               <p>an opposite state of things was induced, and had violent purgings of a peculiar character, denoting a very severe affection of the bowels; not necessarily inflammation of the lining of the bowels—this continued unchecked by medicine, and after several days the boy sank, exhausted from the con<lb></lb>tiderable discharges he had suffered—when I first saw him on the 9th of March, I did not discover any constitutional derangement about him—all I found was the local affection—he died on the 28th of March, exhausted from the discharges—I made a post mortem examination of the body twenty eight hours after the time I heard he had died—on opening the belly I found on the right side a large well defined cavity, containing a few ounces of fluid—at the bottom of this cavity were three ulcerated openings into the interior of the bowels—the bowels in the centre, and on the left side, had traces of inflammation of a more recent character than that producing the cavity before mentioned—the liver participated in the inflammation affecting the bowels—the midriff or diaphragm was likewise inflamed and ulcerated, as was the lung in immediate contact with it—I noticed several other circumstances, but I am not aware that they bear on the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the boy had received a severe kick on the 3rd of March, to what cause should you attribute his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To inflamma tion, produced by the kick—if I had evideuce that he had a kick, undoubtedly 1 should ascribe it to that—a kick given as described by the witness would clearly account for the original appearances, and those which followed until he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might all you observed be accounted for by natu<lb></lb>ral causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might—it is quite possible—it would not necessarily fol<lb></lb>low that if he had received a violent kick six days before I saw him, that there would be an external mark or bruise—the probability is, that there would be some external sign—there was no appearance of discolouration or braise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had received a kick in that place three weeks before, would not the discolouration be less apparent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; the appearances might possibly be produced by a blow which was not violent, as serious conse<lb></lb>quences sometimes follow slight injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you had never heard the boy had re<lb></lb>ceived a kick, you would probably have attributed his death to natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have inquired if he had not received external vio<lb></lb>lence, from my suspicions being excited that external violence had been in flicted—in my opinion, external violence was the cause of the injury he re<lb></lb>ceived, which ended in death—it is not at all probable the injury could have been inflicted three weeks previous, without the boy's making a complaint—in all human probability he would have complained—it is highly probable that external violence would be followed by violent pain almost immediately—I attribute his death to violence, certainly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the effects were produced by natural causes, would the patient have suffered the same degree of pain as if occasioned by external violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If the affection had arisen from common causes, the feeling would be the same—I say it is possible it might arise from common causes—the whole of the symptoms, the degree of pain, and every circum<lb></lb>stance connected with it, might have arisen from common causes—but the high probability is, that it was from external violence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant R</hi>). On the 15th June I apprehended the prisoner at Aberfeldy Road—Sergeant Howard and Mr. Warland were with me—I said "I am a police officer, and shall take you into custody for stealing oats, the property of Messrs. Aste and Sons"—he made no answer—I went into the house and found this tarpaulin produced—I asked the prisoner what he had done with the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me to mind my own business—I took him to the station—he said he had the oats from a man named Jeffrys—I asked him who Jeffrys was—he said he had seen him once or twice in the market—I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on him, and several documents—I said "The name of the barge was the <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> that the oats were taken in" he said "Quite right, it was."</p>

I accompanied Briers and Mr. Warland to 49, Abergeldy Road—after the prisoner was told the charge I said "Where is the tarpaulin?"—he said "It is here"—I found it in the kitchen—I conveyed it to the police-station—before I did so I examined it in the presence of the prisoner—I said "This is not the cloth I want"—Warland said "No, I can account for that; my cousin hired two tarpaulins, and his man has sent the wrong one back"—upon that I went to the cousin, and he said "I have sent the wrong one back"—I went to his wharf and found the tarpaulin marked "Aste and Son" covered over with a quantity of salt—the one in Court has a number on it.</p>

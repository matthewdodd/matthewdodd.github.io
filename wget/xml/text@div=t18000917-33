             sworn. - On the 9th of August, I was in the meadows, near the river Lea, measuring Edmonton-marsh to and fro all day; when the coals were taken away, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was about sixty yards from the river, I saw the barge marked Edward Ellis, and also marked upon the barge, Page, steersman; I saw Page on board, I never saw him before in my life; I saw the prisoner, Mann's cart coming down, and backed to where the barge was, in a creek before you come to the river Lea; I saw him in the barge with four or five other men, Corby and Mann were among them; I knew Mann very well; two of them were shovelling coals into the sacks, and two holding them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Chapman? - A.Yes; he was assisting them in filling the sacks; they shot the coals out of the sacks loose into the cart, there were about six or seven sacks, Mann and Corby went away with her cart; Chapman and Page then went and borrowed a cart of one Carpenter, in the Marsh, and in about ten minutes after they loaded that likewise; they had no horses, they drew the cart themselves, and placed it to the barge as the others had done, and loaded the cart with coals; I cannot say what the quantity was, I was not so near them then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they about it? - A.About twenty-five minutes; Chapman drove the cart away, and Page remained in the barge; as Mann passed me, I said, Mann, I think you buy coals at a cheap rate, don't you; he made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the three prisoners? - A. I have no doubt at all about it; Chapman I never saw before, but I have no doubt he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. You say there was another name upon the barge besides the prosecutor's? - A. Yes,

               <p>SMITHSON DAWSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a land-surveyor: The last witness was with me, on the 9th of August, measuring the Marsh; I saw some persons in a barge, but I cannot swear to any of them; there were two carts, and five persons engaged in loading them out of the barge; they shot them into the carts loose, when one cart was full the other was fetched; two of them went away with the first cart, and then two of the other five went for the other cart, and loaded that from the said barge; there was the name of Ellis on the barge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were at work on the same spot with Osborn? - A. Yes; at the same distance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Ellis.) Q. How many barges have you? - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there more than one barge upon the river that day? - A. I believe the other was in the Thames, but I am not sure, I think it was, loaded with timber, going to Blackwall; I am sure she was not loaded with coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Page authority from you, or your mother, to sell coals for you? - A. Never; nor or did I ever sell a coal in my life to any body at Edmonton, or between London and Heriford.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Q. Page might have given directions to persons to unload a quantity of coals from that barge? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. He was in the barge himself, loading these coals; that is more than giving directions.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner, Mann? - A. Yes; I am a wheelwright, within a few doors of him, in Upper Edmonton; he came to me on the 9th of August, about five o'clock in the afternoon; he came and asked me if I wanted to buy a small quantity of coals; he said he had got a few that he had bought, that he wanted to part with; I did not answer him the first time; and as he was going out at the door, he says, will you have them or not; I said, Will, you know it is Saturday, and I run short of money; he made answer, if you cannot pay me to-day you can to-morrow; he then said, if you like to have them, say so; he owed me a little bill; I said, if he would give me half money and half coals I would have them; he then went to his own yard, where the coals were; he was to bring me six sacks, but I did not see them measured; he brought them in the cart, and my smith helped to unload the cart; to the best of my knowledge they were in sacks; I paid him a guinea and a seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you outset the debt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What is Mann? - A. He keeps a horse and cart to carry any thing on the road.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Ellis.) Did you examine your barge when it came home? - A. I could hardly miss a chaldron of coals out of a barge of coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your steersman's name upon your barge? - A. Yes;

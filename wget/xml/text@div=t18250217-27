               <p>JOHN BAYNON. I am <rs id="t18250217-27-viclabel166" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

On the Sunday before Christmas day, about twelve o'clock in the morning, I was going to the West India Docks, and as I went down <placeName id="t18250217-27-crimeloc167">Rosemary-lane</placeName>

One of them said, "Here shipmate, I want to speak to you." I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170021"></xptr>turned back, and when I got near the door they went back into the house; I went inside, and they immediately shut the door - the shop was then all dark. They said, "Go in there." I was all in the dark, and asked what for: they said nothing, but the prisoner shoved me into a back room at the further end of the shop, and while he was doing that I heard the other baring the street door. They both came into the room, and told me to strip - I asked what for; the answer was, I must strip: I said I would not; they said they would make me. Both laid hold of me, and pulled my jacket and waistcoat off; I did all I could to get from them, and called out, "They are robbing me." They hove me down on my back, and took off my trowsers. The prisoner then went into the shop, and brought in a frock, waistcoat, and trowsers, and told me to put them on, which I did. The frock and trowsers were new, and the waistcoat old, but mine were a complete new suit of sailor's clothes. When they had dressed me, they pointed to some steps, and told me to go down there, which I did, because I was afraid of my life. The street door was shut all the time. I went down the steps into the cellar, which was quite dark; they shut the flap door upon me. I remained there from about twelve o'clock till dark - the same men then came and opened the flap: they had no candle, but I could see them by a light from the back parlour fire. They said, "Come up," which I did - they told me to go out - I was going, but turned back, and asked if they would be kind enough to give me my clothes; they said they would not. I go out into the street - I do not know the time - I was afraid to go back to my vessel, as the captain would hide me for losing my clothes. I walked about the streets all night, and went on board a West Indiaman next morning. I saw the master of the Aurora three weeks after - I had told the mate of the West Indiaman of it. I had paid 2 l. 3 s. 11 d. for my clothes, and only wore them five times - those the prisoner gave me were worth about 7 s. altogether. On the 14th of January I went with Blythe to Rosemary-lane, and saw the prisoner standing at the door of a clothes shop - I do not know whether it was the same shop - it was on the same side of the way; I pointed him out, and knew him to be the man. I told the officer he was the very man who took my clothes off - he asked him if he belonged to the shop - he said he did. The officer took him in, and told him I charged him with robbing me of my clothes, and he must go with him; he said he would come at any time he appointed. He was taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you been at sea? A. Two years and nine months, under the same captain. I was never flogged for making away with my clothes. I should know the other man if I saw him. I do not know at what time they let me out - I saw the watchman, but did not tell him. I told nobody of it but the mate. I went down to Northfleet in the Indiaman, and told some persons of it there; they said I should write to my uncle, which I did, and told him I had lost my clothes; he came down with my indentures next day, and took me to the ship, and then took me to Blythe, the officer. I swear he is the man. I had no money about me. I had leave to go and see an old school-fellow. I was afraid to return to my ship.</p>

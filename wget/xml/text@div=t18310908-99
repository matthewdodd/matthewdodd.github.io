I said, "Nearly twelve;" he said, "Let us look," and immediately took it from me - the prisoner immediately seized me by my right arm, and said, "Come along, I want to get home, it is wet;" I said, "Where are your friends? they have got my watch;" he said, "They will be here in a minute;" he immediately put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took the remaining money which I had - it was four half-crowns, and 1s, or 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.We had been drinking all day - can you swear I took your money out of your pocket? A.

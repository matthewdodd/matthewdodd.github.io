                  </hi>. I live at 44, Bread-street, St. James's, and am secretary to the West-end Bootmakers Society—we give relief to necessitous persons—on Saturday night, 31st of last month, about half-past 9, the prisoner called upon me, in Portland-street, and presented me this card, upon which I should have given him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had travelled up and he was sore footed—I looked at the card and saw the signature was not good, and I then asked him to come home with me—he went home with me, and I asked him to come down to the club-house—I there compared the signatures, and then said I should give him in charge for attempting to receive money from me under false pretences—he said it was a genuine thing, it was right, and called me several names for trying to stop him—if that signature had been in my judgment genuine, I should have parted with 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the faith of it.</p>

I live at No. 3, William-street, Reading, and am a shoemaker—I am also secretary to the boot maker's society in that place—the signature on this card of Palmer is not mine, or did I give any person authority to make that signature—I relieved this same man, in the name of Foster, on 28th August—the name of Banman on the card is not written by me or by my authority—there is none of my writing here—I wrote on another card for the prisoner in the name of Foster.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, C</hi> 214).

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> As regards the forged name, the president himself acknowledges that the name has no weight on the card; it is the clear card that entitles you to relief; the president from the town that you leave signs his name; then why should I commit a forgery without a motive. I only got 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the distance I tramped was 400 miles; when I got to Hammersmith I had not a halfpenny in the world; I there met with a man named Banman and he gave me the card, and I did not know I was wrong in presenting it. I defy all the societies in the world to bring anything against my character.</p>

            . I came there about nine o'clock in the morning of the 1st of December. About a quarter before ten I was in the counting-house - the porters were out and the warehouseman backwards. I heard Brand, the Marshalsman, calling out for some person to come forward - I found he had a person in custody, he asked me if I knew him? I said No. He then produced a piece of goods which had arrived that morning, and which, having examined before, I could swear to. He said Matthews, the officer, was in pursuit of another person, who had a similar piece in his possession, which piece and the person I found at the Mansion House.</p>

            . On Friday morning I was going to the Mansion House; as I turned out of Coleman-street I saw the two prisoners close against the prosecutor's house; I suspected and stopped at the back of the Bank. I saw Fulham look over the glass door into the warehouse - he stopped about two minutes; I then saw him turn the latch of the door, having his right knee close to the door - he opened it and went in, the other stood close to the door. Fulham handed out the piece of goods, which Farquhar took, and then went towards the Old Jewry. Fulham went in again, and as I was going after Farquer I met Brand, and told him he would see a man come out in a minute - I went away, and took Farquer with the goods on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you lose sight of him - A. Yes, but I am certain he is the man.</p>

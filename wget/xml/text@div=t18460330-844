                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, and live at No. 4, Lower John-street, St. George's—I carry on my business at No. 18, Cross-street—I never sleep there myself. The prisoner was my apprentice, and used to sleep there, in a small back parlour adjoining the shop—Matthews, my errand-boy, also slept there occasionally—on Sunday, the 1st of March, I was at my shop, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning—all appeared safe then, and I left about half-past eleven, leaving the prisoner on the premises—about half-past eleven, the same night, I was sent for by some of my neigh<lb></lb>bours, and found my house on fire—smoke was coming from all parts of the front of the house—I saw the prisoner among the people—I said, "How has this happened?"—he made no reply—I did not observe any blaze—the smoke was coming from all parts, between all the cracks in the shutters—on en<lb></lb>tering the house the fire seemed to proceed from underneath the counter on the grocery side—the front of the counter, and several parts about it, were on fire—the storey posts were burnt—they are the posts that hold up the front of the house—the goods were burnt—they were more damaged by water than by fire—some of them were on fire—after the fire was got out I said to the prisoner, "How has this happened?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I afterwards called him before the firemen to know how it happened—he said he had set the boy Matthews to sweep the shop; that the boy had a lighted candle, and lighted the gas; that he then swept the shop, and made the bed; and that he (the prisoner) then put out the gas, and went to bed likewise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years of age, and live with my father and mother, in Back-road, St. George's. On Sunday night, the 1st of March, I slept with the prisoner, at Mr. Bell's, No. 18, Cross-street—I was in the habit of sleeping with him—I went to the house about half-past ten o'clock—we both came in together—I lighted a lucifer, and he lighted a candle—he told me to go into the shop, and he came in along with me to light the gas—he told me to dust down the counters, which I did, and he told me to go and make the bed—I made the bed—he told me to get into bed, and he would come directly—I left him in the shop reading a book—I put out the candle, got into bed, and went to sleep—I was awoke by his <hi rend="italic">nudging</hi> me, and heard a knocking at the street door—he was in bed then—he said, "I suppose it is some of the customers knocking at the door"—he did not get up then—I heard the policeman's rattle spring, and some one said, "Open the shop door"—he then got up, and went out at the side door—he hallooed out that there was a fire, and told me to get up—the policeman then came and took me out of my bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman of the London Fire Establishment. On the 1st of March I was called to a fire at Mr. Bell's—when I arrived, there had been an engine at work, but it had stopped—I examined the premises, and found the fire had burnt all round the shop, and under the counter near the window—the fire nearest the window was the greatest—it had scorched the shop, and burnt the counter and the posts that support the bressimer, the shop window, and also the shutter—I afterwards went into the cellar, but found no fire there—it was confined to the shop, the contents of which were more or less damaged by fire.</p>

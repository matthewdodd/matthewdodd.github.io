               <p>I lost my cloak, it hung across a horse, the prisoner came up stairs while I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070078"></xptr> down with a pail of dirty water, seeing she was a stranger, I hurried up, and saw her make into my room, I called out to know where she was going, she said she wanted the gentlewoman in the one pair of stairs, she asked me if I took in washing, I said yes, she asked me if it would be agreeable to me to take in the washing of a family in St. Martin's-lane, and she would give me a direction if I would get a pen and ink, I went to borrow one, and while I was gone she robbed me of my cloak, and concealed it under her petticoat; after she had wrote me a direction she went away, and I missed my cloak about twenty minutes after she was gone, and I went to see after her, I saw her coming out of a pawnbroker's in Long-acre, I caught hold of her arm, and said she had robbed me, she said of what, I said of a black mode cloak, it is new, it is not finished making, she immediately pulled out the cloak and gave it me, and said, now you may be damned, you have got your property, you cannot hurt me, I will prosecute you; says I, perhaps you may be prosecuted first, I will take you before a magistrate, she said she would be damned if she went, she clawed me all over my hands, and I took her to Litchfield-street, she there owned that she took the cloak, but she left another in the stead of it, and she begged when I came to prosecute her I would be favourable, she said she had children; she said she had been a notorious thief, but if I would let her have her liberty, she would not wrong any body again, but would go to the workhouse.</p>

               <p>I was distressed with two children, and I went to a relation to borrow five shillings, and she lent me a cloak to pawn for the five shillings; I went to the pawnbroker's, she saw me, and she struck me and fetched blood of me, and took my bonnet off my head in the street, she said she would value her cloak at as much as it was when it was new; I took it up by mistake for the cloak which my relation lent me to pawn for five shillings.</p>

On the 26th of March he came to work at a quarter-past eight o'clock at night, his usual time; he went down into the cellar, which is kept for the purpose of cutting - we have two counters there, one for cutting leather, and one for cutting slops; it was the prisoner's duty to go to the slop counter; but I went down in two or three minutes, and he had not his coat off, as he should have had - he was at the leather counter, and seemed much agitated; I staid two or three minutes, and the went up into my warehouse - something struck me that all was not right; I looked through a window, and saw him putting something brown into his pocket; I went and told my wife what I had seen; I then went, looked again, and saw him go to a rack, where I keep four or five hundred, or one thousand pairs of soles, and saw him take two or three pairs of soles from there to his own counter; he tried them, and put them into his pocket - I went and told the watchman to be at the door five minutes before ten o'clock, which was the time the prisoner would leave; the prisoner came up at that time, and took his umbrella, (which he always brought and took away with him,) and was going out; I called him back - he did not come the first time; I called him again; he then returned - I shut the parlour door, and told him to produce what he had of mine; he said if I would step out, he would settle it with me - I said I should not give up possession of the door till he gave up what he had; he then took out two pairs of soles, and said that was all he had; the watchman, who was close at the door, came in, and found two more pairs of soles on him; we then desired him to pull off his hat - he said there was nothing in that, but the watchman pulled it off, and it was full of pieces of leather - the watchman then took charge of him, and said, "If you will behave like a man, I will behave so to you" - we all went out; in going along the prisoner made his escape, and ran about one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards; he then fell down, and was taken to the watch-house - I took a cab, and went to Marylebone;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070057"></xptr>this is the property found on him, and I never permitted him to take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Was he your regular servant? A. He sometimes came occasionally, and sometimes more regularly - he sometimes came for a day or two, sometimes for a few hours; and when he was out of a situation. I have employed him for a fornight - these pieces of leather are worth about 6d. each; he did not say any thing to me about mending his shoes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you pay him? A. If he worked a day I paid him 5s., and for an hour I paid him 6d.; he was at that time working for another person, and had for a fortnight, but used to work over hours at night for me.</p>

The prisoner came into the shop on the last day in January, between eight and nine o'clock; I shewed her some black lace veils; I saw her take one, and put it under her gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her - A. Not at the time, I did not; I kept shewing her some.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed nothing to her, but kept shewing her more - A. I did. There was no person in the shop; I expected the street-keeper to come to shut up my shop in a minute; I thought I would speak to him when he came, and when he came, I said to the prisoner, I was afraid there was none that would suit her; she said, she did not think that I had, she would call to-morrow along with her landlady. Then I told the street-keeper to take hold of her; I went round the counter, thinking she might drop it at the door; he laid hold of her; she came into the shop again; she asked me what I wanted; I told her she knew what I wanted, she had taken a lace shawl; I saw the lace shawl laying on the floor. A shawl and a veil is the same thing. When I said she had taken the lace shawl, I observed one laying on the floor; I said there was the shawl. She said she had knocked it off the counter with her elbow; then the street-keeper picked it up, he said he would go and get a regular constable, and deliver her and the shawl to him. My shop is part of the house; the shawl is worth above thirty shillings; the selling price is three pounds ten shillings,</p>

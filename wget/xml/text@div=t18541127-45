                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at No. 16, King's Head-court, Norton Folgate. I was at work at No. 12, Bread-street, Cheapside—I took the prisoner as a labourer on Tuesday, 7th Nov.—he worked there that day, and returned on Wednesday—we finished the job about 11 or 12 o'clock, and I discharged him about that time, but, not having change, sent a party to the Bank while I went and had a pint or two of beer with the prisoner—he left, my company between half past 3 and half past 4 o'clock—he was then perfectly sober—I had left at the premises in Bread-street a</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Jamieson, of No. 12, Bread-street, Cheapside, and was so on 8th Nov. Some repairs were being done there that day, and about 4 o'clock I was in my master's warehouse, and saw the prisoner going through the warehouse with a basket of tools in his hand—I took no notice of that, not knowing that he was discharged—he went away with the tools.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows:</hi> "This man hired me at half past 9 o'clock on Tuesday morning; I worked till about 7 o'clock at night, and then till half past 11 o'clock the next day; he had no more to do, and told me to come to the public house and he would pay me, and he paid me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the time; we had three or four pints of beer, and some dinner, and a couple of pints more, or a pot, I do not know which, on that account, and he told me to go and look after his tools, and as he packed them I saw there was a lead trap in his basket; he put that in the scales and weighed it, put it under the rubbish, and afterwards put it in his basket; and he <hi rend="italic">says</hi>, 'Look after the basket,' and I went and looked after the basket, and I got drunk and took the tools to my own house; a strange man picked up with me and took me home to my place; I sold the tools and got drunk with the money as well as my own, and so I did not come back, that's all; and this morning he met me and asked me about them, and I told him I knew nothing about them,")</p>

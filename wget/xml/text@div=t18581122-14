                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Bellamy, who keeps a coffee-house in Barbican. On 26th October last, I met the prisoner at the bottom of the staircase—I had not seen him the night before—he slept in my house; my husband had let him in, and he paid my husband over night for the room—after he left, I went into the room that he had slept in, on the second floor front, and missed two sheets and a pillow-case, that were safe when I made the bed the night before—I informed my husband at once—he ran after him and brought him back in about five minutes—I am quite sure he is the person that bade me good morning at the bottom of the stairs—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two sheets and the pillow-case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you know, and can you swear, that these two sheets and pillow-case belong to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know them by my own sewing—they are not marked, because they are new—I examined them the night before—I had taken them from the washing the night before, and put them on the bed—I swear that you are the person that took them—you owned yourself guilty at the bar, and asked me to forgive you.</p>

                  </hi> I lived at Bayswater—on the 3rd of July I let some premises at No. 33, John-street, Surrey, to the prisoner—there was two ranges of building, one a workshop, the other a stable—the prisoner repre<lb></lb>sented himself as a master cowkeeper, and took the place to make a dairy—he said he should bring in fifty cows—there was some lead in the gutters on the roof, and some round the skylights, some lead cisterns, and a lead force-pump—there was from three to four tons of lead—the prisoner was to have the place till the 10th of Aug. on sufferance before he commanded rent, and then to have it for three years—this was all put in writing—I went to the premises about ten days afterwards, and found the lead had been stripped away from the gutters and the cistern, and the lead pipe taken away off the pump—I did not find any cows there—the prisoner never brought a shilling's worth of property onto the place—there were no signs of preparation for a dairy—the almost that was brought in was about four penny worth of lime—I went to inquire where he had lived before, and I went to the premises a second time—I then found that even the paving-stones were being pulled up—I should say there were from two to three tons of lead gone—it was worth from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say the stones were worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I un<lb></lb>derstand he sold them for 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was a man employed to put zinc on the gutters.</p>

                  </hi> I was employed about the 10th of July by the prisoner on the premises in John-street, whitewashing—he afterwards em<lb></lb>ployed me and Grander, a carpenter, to get the lead off the guttering and roof—I lent a hand to do so. I took the lead with a truck to Wright, a marino<lb></lb>store dealer, at 73, Redcross-street—we took four truck full of lead, and some in a sack—I only went once by myself with the truck—I received 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I gave to Mr. Hatton on the premises—the other times the lead went I was outside—I went twice with Hatton, and twice with Grander—I took altogether about 9 cwt.</p>

               <p>Holborn—he has two partners—they are stationers. On the 1st of June, the prisoner came to the shop, in company with another, about a quarter of an hour before five o'clock—they bought a ream and seven quires of bag-paper, which they paid for, and then left—in about five minutes, Mr. Glindon came in, and said something—Mr. Matthews said there was a ream of single crown gone, and told me to run after them—I ran up a court near to our house—I saw the prisoner and the other there—the paper they had bought was on the ground, and a ream of single crown on it, which they had not bought—at that moment Mr. Davis came, and sent me for a policeman—I had asked them whose paper that was—they both said, "It is not mine"—I believe this is the paper—there is no mark on it—the prisoners had been in the habit of coming to the shop.</p>

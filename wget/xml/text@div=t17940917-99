A young woman in our house met her the next day, and she told her she wanted to speak to her, and she brought her back to our house on the Friday following. I see her, and this apron was on; the other things, she told me, that she had sold them herself to an old clothes woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you ever find the other things? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she said that she had sold them, did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - No, not I myself; I believe the officer asked her what she had done with them, and said, perhaps I should favour her if she told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess before or after the constable said that? - Upon my word I don't know, because I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the linen apron that was on her? - I took it from her, and the officer has kept it; his name is Mackenzie. I can very well say it is my own, because I had lent it to one of my servants before, and they tore the corner of it, and I put a piece on. When she came first in, she said you accuse me of a thing that I am not guilty of. I am very well assured it is my apron.</p>

               <p>I am a lodger. This woman was a servant in the house. After the things were missing I met her, and brought her home, and found the apron on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when she said any thing about the rest? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the apron? - I cannot; I met her in St. Paul's Churchyard, and she went with me to Mrs. Bazeley's house. I told her that Mrs. Bazeley had lost some things, and they were laid on her, and she had better go down with me, to see whether she was guilty or not. She said she was not guilty, and she would go with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That morning that I went away, I had locked my own clothes up, and these clothes were laid among my things, and I took them up for my own, and I did not know of it till I was a quarter of a mile from the house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner had nothing there to my knowledge to take away.</p>

SERJEANT BYLES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do the liabilities include such advances and acceptances as Ogilvie's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the dealings of the bankrupts were very large, many hundred thousand pounds in the course of a year—I should think not so much as a million and a half; judging by the cash book, I should say about a million—Mr. Davidson did not take an active part in the conduct of the business—I generally drew the cheques—I did not take my directions for drawing those cheques from Mr. Davidson—he would ask me if they were correct before he signed them, and then sign them, without inquiring, and so far as I was aware, without knowing the purpose for which those cheques were drawn—he would also sign warrants in the same way—he has been away from business for months together—he was not frequently away for long periods, but he was for short ones—I recol<lb></lb>lect his going to Spain in Nov., 1853; he returned in April, 1854, I think—he went to the East some years ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you instructions to enter all these matters in the books, and were they all properly entered accordingly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no particular instructions respecting these—I had no instructions not to enter them—I believe the transactions are all regularly entered in the books in the ordinary course of business—I have heard of the transaction as to these bareges, skeletons, and novelty cheques which went to India—that transaction was in the ordinary course of business—Davidson and Gordon were in the habit, in the ordinary course of business, of sending to India in that way—we have consigned goods to Messrs. Kelsale, Hoare, and Co., of Calcutta, through the London house, and to Gisborne and Co., also through the London house—I was acquainted with such matters—Gisborne's would not appear in the books—I have seen letters from them—I have not corresponded with them directly, but the house has—we have done business with Stewardt, Capron, and Co., and with Henderson, Wallis, and Co., of Calcutta—the transaction Mr. Ewart has spoken of was the first with Ogilvie, Golander, and Co.—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber the name of Burkett and Young—we had dealings with Arbuthnot and Co., of Bombay, Johnson and Co., of Singapore, Kirchoer and Co., of Syd<lb></lb>ney, Kirchner and Co., of Melbourne, and Bligh, Arbuthnot, and Co., of Melbourne—there may be some others—I do not recollect our having any joint accounts with other houses in Manchester goods—I know the house of Sissell and Co., of Manchester—we have joined them in shipments to Mel<lb></lb>bourne, I think—I really do not know whether the distillery was a profit<lb></lb>able business or not.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170078"></xptr>
               <p>general creditors; the total amount of liabilities, taking in secured and un<lb></lb>secured creditors, is about 500,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here are some pencil figures which state the amount of the creditors unsecured to be 13,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say that was about the sum—Mr. Henry Hoffman, a creditor, holding security, is put down here at 41,849<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know that he has been paid; I should say that there was not anything due to Mr. Hoffman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see he is put down as holding acceptances, shipments to Calcutta, Sydney, Melbourne, and there are blanks as to those; the liability to him is put down at 41,849<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and no credit is given for the shipments? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the credit was not calculated at the time—I have not heard that he has made any claim against the estate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is another; Corrie and Co., of Mincing-lane; they are put down at 15,330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then credit is given for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., holding acceptances; then there is a quantity of Java sugar and other things; is no credit given for that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the balance sheet has not been made out at all—this contains simply the total liabilities of the firm, without deducting the goods or other things they have given as security—it does not show what was their liability when they were bankrupts—the 500,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is merely the figure of the total liabi<lb></lb>lity—they were great holders or dealers in sugar, in a very extensive way indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing, instead of parting with the sugars, and realizing upon them immediately, they had been kept, would they not have covered, or more than covered every liability of the bankrupts, owing to the rise in sugar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think they would—I do not know whether it would have given them a handsome surplus—I think it would have paid all their liabilities—I do not think anything connected with the distillery is intro<lb></lb>duced into the 500,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing about the profits that were being realized by the distillery at the time of the bankruptcy—Mr. Eves used to attend to the distillery—I do not know the quantity of sugar they held—I could not refer to the books to ascertain the quantity—the official assignee and the accountants have had a full opportunity of looking at the books, so as to ascertain the quantity of sugar on hand at the time of the bankruptcy—I should be able to see all that from an examination of the bankrupts' books—their transactions required them, as a matter of necessity, to obtain advances upon goods; and when they got advances by bills of exchange, they got those bills discounted, to put them in funds immediately—that was in their ordinary course of business—Mr. Gordon was an active and atten<lb></lb>tive man of business, as industrious and active as man could be—he has been in the firm for some years altogether—the bill book would show the amount of advances made on discounts in the course of the year.</p>

I think—there had been transactions with the East some few months before this of M'Millan's, nearly the whole of the year, I should think we were shipping to India and Melbourne—I cannot say exactly how recently before this transaction of M'Millan's there had been transactions with the East, but I should think in March and April, and upon which advances had been received—I am rather certain about that—Overend and Gurney are entered here for 110,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., holding securities—I think the warrants in the hands of Overend and Gurney are stated there as securities—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Davidson and Gordon's pass book—this com<lb></lb>mences</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I recollect something about this trans<lb></lb>action of Pickford, Johnson, and Co.—I think they were included in Mr. Ewart's bill—since I was examined I have been looking over the accounts—I have not ascertained the actual amount of advances upon the sugars at any one time—to the best of my knowledge this account was made out at the time: I made out this particular portion of it about the sugars, and general securities held by the creditors—there appears to be about 44,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to creditors holding sugars only—I should think the advance to have been to within 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That would be about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton, would it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what the sugars may have cost at the time, if they were low sugars perhaps they cost only 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—the duty would have to be deducted from the amount, which I think was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at that time; that would leave 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I estimate the amount down in this paper at about 3,066 tons.</p>

               <p>much beyond those upon which advances had been made,-and which are introduced into that account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The books would not show that—I understood your question about the sugar if retained making the bankrupts solvent, as a general one—it would not have made them solvent if sold at that time—if it had been kept till the present time it would have paid off the deficit—their sugar dealings extended over a long period—Mr. Hoff<lb></lb>man is alive and Mr. Corrie also, and could come and tell their own story—we had sugar transactions with Rucker and Co. to a very large amount—they are still in existence and could tell what balance was due, what they advanced and upon what footing—orders have gone out to the Havanna through Ruckers, to purchase sugars.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the result what you have stated, that there were fifty-three of those warrants that had been deposited by Gordon, that turned out to be of this character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they were, but I know nothing about the detail of it—I ascertained that fact in company with Gordon, certainly; it was an admitted thing in our conversation—we never received any deeds of the distillery from Gordon—on the following day Cole sent us the lease, or some paper of that sort, of the distillery for our perusal, to satisfy us of a fact, namely, that the money he had abstracted from us he had lent to Gordon for the purposes of the distillery; and to satisfy us of that fact he sent us this lease, or something purporting to be a lease, wherein this sum of money was referred to—that was handed over to our solicitors, to report what sort of an instrument it was, and when Cole became a bankrupt it was returned to Cole's assignees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The promissory note for 120,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was also deposited with you, as a further security against the deficiency, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what you mean by "also"—I know your point—"also" had nothing to do with it—the lease was not deposited with us as a security, it was only sent for, our perusal—it was not delivered to us—we still hold the promissory note for 120,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also a great quantity of other warrants of this same description delivered to us by Cole.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And upon that statement and representation with reference to the distillery business, were you satisfied not then to press for the payment of the debt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We took no steps whatever—we remained perfectly passive—the fact is, that our involvement in this affair was so great that we had to consider the subject in all its bearings, and we determined to remain per<lb></lb>fectly passive, without coming to any understanding of any sort, kind, or description, with either Cole or Gordon—we did remain perfectly passive until the bankruptcy—we had dealings with Cole of a similar character that we had with Gordon—he deposited warrants with us, and got advances upon them—we began by discounting bills of Mr. Ewart's and others, of a very first rate mercantile character—that was in the ordinary course of our business—Cole told me that it was ha who had withdrawn the spelter.</p>

I believe the personal trans<lb></lb>actions were with your father, and not with you, were they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, with my uncle—I was present—the first time was on 30th July—all these transactions appear in our books, in the ordinary and regular course of our trade—the warrants are in the possession of Mr. Linklater.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted, that none of the cases charged against the defendants came within the words of the Act of Parliament; the statute required that there should be a false colour and pretence of carrying on busi<lb></lb>ness and dealing in the ordinary course of trade; it was not sufficient unless some active false pretence was made, as in Reg</hi>. v. <hi rend="italic">Boyd, 6 Cocks' Criminal Cases, p</hi>. 502; <hi rend="italic">in each of the present cases, the goods appeared to have been ordered and disposed of, in the ordinary course of business, it would not do to wove that the defendants were insolvent, or knew themselves to be so; for if that was held to be sufficient, any trader, who gave an order after he was in a state of insolvency, would be brought within this Act of Parliament, which was not intended to meet a case like the present</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">urged the same objection; the offence, if any, committed by the defendants, was met by the</hi> 256<hi rend="italic">the section of the Act, which enabled the Commissioner to grant a certificate of a second class or withhold one; he, however, contended, that the evidence disclosed no offence at all, and that the allegation of the defendants being in a state of hopeless insolvency had entirely failed</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Jury, according to his notion of the Act of Parliament, it was not enough to take a person out of it, that he should be apparently to the world carrying on business and dealing in the ordinary course of trade in the particular transaction in question, because the statute supposed that to be an ingredient in every one of the cases that were to come under it; but then it also supposed, that that apparent carrying on business, and in the particular transaction dealing in the ordinary course of trade, was merely a false colour and pre<lb></lb>tence; it would be, therefore, for the Jury to consider whether transactions, however apparently regular, were really so or not; and if not, whether by the false colour and pretence of their being regular they obtained the goods on credit, and with intent to defraud the owners; it was, in fact, for the Jury to determine upon the real character of the transaction</hi>)</p>

On 19th July I was on duty in Friar-street, Southwark, about 7 o'clock in the evening—Woods was on duty with me—I saw from eighteen to twenty persons assembled outside the Bell public-house—they were on the footway, and were obstructing it—we said to them, "Move on"—the prisoner, who was one of them, said, "Who the b—y hell are you?" we were in plain clothes—we said we were police-constables—the other persons moved on after we said that, but the prisoner said he did not care a b—r for any b—y police-constables, and he should not move—he began to use very foul language—he crossed off the foot-pavement—he crossed on to North-street—he stood there and got a great mob of persons round him—we told him if he did not go we should be obliged to take him into custody—he said, "No b—y policeman shall take me into custody without I knife him"—he had a knife in his hand, and in going to take him into custody he struck at me several times with the knife—it went through my jacket and waistcoat—the two first blows only cut my clothes—he struck at me again, and wounded me in the belly—he struck at me about three times with the knife before he stabbed me—an officer named Vaughan, who was in his police-clothes, came to my assistance—I heard the prisoner say when Vaughan came up, "Let go me you b—y b—r, or I will gouge your b—y eye out"—Vaughan was going to take hold of him at that time and the prisoner stabbed him in the face with the knife—we got him after<lb></lb>wards to the station; we had great difficulty in getting him there—he was very violent.</p>

I was on duty on that evening in Friar-street, in plain clothes—I saw about eighteen persons standing outside the Bell—we spoke to them and told them to go away from there, and not obstruct the footpath—they were obstructing it—they all went away with the exception of Smith (the prisoner)—he stood there, and said he would not go away, and if anybody came near him he would gouge their eye out—when Hircock ordered him away, he said, "Who are you?"—he said he was a police-constable—he said, "I shan't go for you"—it was after that that he said if anybody interfered with him he would gouge their eye out—I then spoke to him—I said, "Smith, you know me, will you go for me?"—he said, "Yes, I know you, I will go for you, I won't go for him"—he walked a little way—I followed some of the other party a little distance, and when I came back I saw the prisoner in custody with Vaughan and Hircock, that was about two minutes after—I heard Vaughan say, "Look out for a knife, I am stabbed"—I saw Vaughan's face was bleeding—I did not see the prisoner do anything, or throw anything away, but I picked up this knife on the footpath about five yards from where the prisoner was—I knew him before that night, and I knew some of the other persons.</p>

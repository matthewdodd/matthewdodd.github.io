I keep a general dealer's, at Oak Cottages, Walcott Square—on 1st August, the prisoner came to my shop for a reel of cotton, and she gave me a sixpence—I gave her the change, and she left—I put the sixpence in the till; there was no other sixpence there—I found it was bad, shortly after—on 8th August she came again for half an ounce of tea and an ounce of tobacco—she gave me a shilling, and I gave her change—after she had left I found it was bad—that shilling has been lost—I am sure it was bad—I saw the prisoner afterwards in custody.</p>

I live in the prosecutor's house—on Saturday, 15th August, I saw the prisoner there, and Smoothy showed me a bad sixpence—he charged her with uttering bad coin before, and told the boy to fetch a policeman—she tried to detain the boy, and asked Mr. Smoothy to hear reason—as she was speaking, she made a bolt into the street, and ran as fast as she could, calling "George—I followed her for about 150 yards, and then she went up a dark cab yard—I went in after her, and she darted past me into a crowd, and there I caught her, and gave her into custody.</p>

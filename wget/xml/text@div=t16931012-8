The Prisoners alledged that they charged the said Atkinson with Treason, for Clipping money; but then comes Mrs. Arnold, and declares, That they used her in a very uncivil manner, and gave abundance of ill names, and searcht her House, but found nothing; and being with her in the Street, pretending to go before a Justice, the Prisoners and one Ireland gave them the slip; and afterwards they had a Treat, and drank the two Fish-womens health, saying they had had a good Booty on the over-night; afterwards Mr. Cook was found out in Fetter-Lane, and part of the money was about him, which he did not deny to be Arnold's money; Mr. Cook called several Witnesses who were with him when he searcht the House, who declared that he fairly searcht her House, but found nothing suspicious there; he pleaded his Deputation, (and what he did was by virtue of the power derived from it) which he had from the Warden of the Mint; that was true, but then he must take heed how he executes that power, it must be upon persons of those suspected, and not upon their Goods; for this was of such bad Example, that all honest persons might be seized in the Street. Mr. Cook had persons of good quality as to his Birth and Reputation, and that he was a Gentlemen of a Good Family and had been entrusted by several worthy persons of great note, of things of value; so had Mr. Wallis.

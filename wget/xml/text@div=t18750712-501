                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant at 413, Wands-worth Road—about 3 o'clock on Sunday morning, 7th July, I was awakened by a noise—I got out of bed, went to the window, and pulled up the blind—I saw the prisoner in Mr. Neal's, the watchmaker, lobby, oppo<lb></lb>site—I saw her cross the road, towards the house, and smash the windows—she smashed the last window, very high; therefore it was maliciously done, and not for the purpose of taking anything—I saw three bottles at the station, which were my property—they had been filled with water for three years and were in the window—a green blind was drawn down in front of the window, so the prisoner could not have seen those bottles when she broke the window—all three windows were smashed; the whole front was smashed—every pane was broken—the first was smashed low, so that she could put her hand through; the second was higher, and the third very high indeed—I saw the prisoner at the station; I also saw there a dummy bottle of still hock—the prisoner said "Master, you sell very bad stuff"—she was not drunk at the time—I rather felt for the woman, and suggested to Mr. Bridge that she should be examined by a medical man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer in the employ of the Home Office—on Friday evening, 6th April, I went with some other constables to the Penton Arms, Pentonville-road, and found the prisoner Mason with three or four others—I said to him, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, I have received instructions from the authorities of the Mint, to look after you, as being dealing largely in counterfeit coin"—he made no reply, and I put my hand in his right breast coat pocket and took out this black bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in which was another small bag, in which were five packets, sealed up as they now appear, containing thirty-one florins and twenty-three shillings wrapped in separate papers—I took a tobacco box from him, which contained one florin and three shillings, they are all here—when I pulled them out I showed them to him and said, "What do you call these?"—he said, "I have not had them long, Mr. Brannan—on that he was taken in custody by Inspector Briant and other officers—we took him outside and asked him where he lived—he said he had no fixed residence—I told him I would find one—I had had him some time under observation both there and elsewhere—he said, "I have not been selling at Dimeter's"—that is a beer shop just by—a crowd collected aud one officer was knocked down—we were very glad to put the prisoner into a cab—I was not in the cab with him, I was outside—there were hundreds of persons collected—the cab proceeded to No. 2, Pembroke-street, Caledo<lb></lb>nian-road—I found Sawyer there in the back-room on the second floor—I said to her, "Does not Harry Mason live here?"—she made no reply—I said, "I mean Long Harry"—Bhe said he was out, and had been out ever since 5 o'clock—it was then about half-past 9 o'clock—I told her I knew he was not at home for I had had him in custody for passing counterfeit coin, and I came there to see for the moulds—she said she knew nothing about them—I called to one of the officers to bring Mason up stairs, and when he got in the room he said, "We have not been here long"—I desired one of the officers to take Sawyer in custody, and I proceeded to search the room, and on the top of the cupboard I found this plaster of Paris mould having the impression of a florin; and in the cupboard I found two galvanic</p>

               <p>batteries with wire—this jar containing acid, two battery jars, two bottles with acid, a file, with some white metal in the teeth, two pieces of glass, one bearing the impression of a shilling, two tooth brushes, a pair of scissors and a tin box with black composition; these are all articles used for the manufacture of coin—these things were produced from the cupboard in the presence of the two persons, and while taking them out, Mason said, "You have found enough on me and here, Mr. Brannan, and I hope you will not take the old woman"—Sawyer said the things that I placed on the table had not been there above two or three days-the prisoners were taken away in custody, and I took possession of these articles—the next morning, Mason said to me, "Mr. Brannan, if I take all upon myself here, do you think that they will let my mistress go or will they send her down below?"—he said, "I know I have been selling a long time, but I have not had the boys selling for me"—I had alluded to the boys the night before—I said, "I shall give neither advice nor opinion, do as you please; I have done my part in putting a stop to your mischievous practices"—he said the woman was innocent of having anything to do in the matter.</p>

The landlady says she never saw me but twice, and if I had been living there I must have been there more than twice in a week; the coin was in my possession, but the moulds were not.</p>

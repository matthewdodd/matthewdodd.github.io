                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Jabez Greenfield, and live at Vagers, Southwater, near Horsham—we took a house there in September last, and also a quantity of hay—not wanting the hay, we advertised it in the "West Sussex Gazette" on 29th October, and reference was made to "Delta, Post Office, Horsham"—we received some applications, and amongst them was this one, enclosing a card, "George Foreman, 47, Grove Street, Regent's Park, Milk Contractor and Provision Merchant."

I replied to that, and received another letter dated 10th November and sent some hay off—on 20th November I received another letter ordering two tons of the same sort, and stating that he would forward a draft for the two lots—I sent the hay to the Willow Walk Station, consigned to George Foreman, believing the description in the paper that he was refreshment contractor to the visitors to the Zoological and Botanical Gardens—the value of it was 9 guineas—I have not been paid for it or seen it since.</p>

On the following day I went out at three o'clock in the afternoon; I have no family - nobody lives in my house - it is a small house; my rabbits and poultry are kept in the room I live in; I have one window and two or three doors to my house, I made them all safe before I went out; I returned at near six o'clock; I found my front door locked, but on going in I found the wall pulled down near the back door - it is a mud and timber wall - it was pulled down sufficient for a person to get in, and on looking about, I missed two doe rabbits; I went with a Policeman to Shillitoe, who we found lived at Dalston; we got there at nearly six o'clock, and saw Shillitoe in his shed, where there were some rabbits; among them was a white doe, which was mine - I had had her about six months; she had kindled four days before, and her young ones were in my hutch - we took it to the station-house; the Inspector put a mark on her ear, and allowed me to take her home to the young ones; I have it here - this is it; on taking her back, she went into the inner hutch to the young ones, and suckled them; Mason, a Policeman, brought me a smut rabbit, a black and white one, the same evening - it was one of the two I had lost - she was with young; Mason took it away for some time, and gave it up to me, when it was about kindling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How large was the hole in the wall? A. Large enough for a man to get through easily; there are small air-holes in my walls - a fowl could not get out of them; the prisoner told me Shillitoe lived at Dalston; he said nothing about taking them to show him, but said he would call again about some ducks' eggs, at nine o'clock in the morning; I have forty or fifty hutches; my cottage is at the corner of a field; I never knew my rabbits to stray into the field.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are there small openings to give air? A. Yes; they are in the upper part of the wall.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the prisoner? A. I knew him as waiter and pot-boy at a respectable public-house in Kingland, and considered him honest; he knew I kept rabbits; there was no concealment about it.</p>

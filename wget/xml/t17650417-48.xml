            . I lodge in Mr. Scott's house: I had put my hat upon a nail where the prisoner and I sat; after he eat his supper he had this hat on his head (producing an old hat), I went up stairs, and when I came down again my hat and the prisoner were gone: mine was quite a new one; I never wore it above five or six times; the prisoner used to come to our house very often before, but never came afterwards.</p>
               <p>Scott. The prisoner used to <rs id="t17650417-48-deflabel272" type="occupation">sell muffins</rs>

               <p>I was a little in liquor, and by mistake I changed the hat, and after that I had some words with a person at the Black Horse, and lost the hat: the prosecutor offered to make it up for half a crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner since June or July, 1858—he was introduced to me by two of my cousins, who told me that he was following the profession of an artist—during the whole time I have known him he has been following that profession—in consequence of that introduction my sisters and myself invited him to our house—we were not residing at Twickenham, then but in London—he did not ask me for any money shortly after I became acquainted with him; I may strictly say it was alter his return from Italy; but previous to that, I think in the very commencement of February, 1859, I found him melancholy one day and asked the cause of it—he said that he had heard very bad accounts of his mother, to whom he was devotedly attached; that she was very aged and that he longed to see her, but was not able to do so—I asked him why he did not go immediately?—he did not answer at first, but afterwards said he could not afford it—I said could I be of any use to him; and he said it would be a great blessing to him if I could—I then asked him what would be required—I said that I had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by me, but ho did not seem to think that would be sufficient and he then showed me some bill of Nosotti's, which I did not look at particularly, and he read at the bottom some threat, that if it was not paid immediately they would proceed against him, and he said, "This is the shameful way that a man treats me, of whom I have had everything since I have been in England, and he is a countryman of mine"—and I then said, "If you like to have that, you can do so;" or something of that kind—I believe he told me the amount, but I cannot positively remember it; it was something like 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and then as regards the sum total he wanted, I think it was either 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but certainly not more than 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of what he stated about his mother and Nosotti, I advanced him somewhere about that sum—I said at first, "I will give you a cheque"—he seemed not to know what a cheque was—I described to him what it was, and he seemed as if he would rather have the money, and I gave him the money—I believe I had given him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first, and then I added the other—he had before that offered to paint my picture—he commenced a sort of sketch of it in 1859; that was after his return from Italy, but it had been all planned to a certain extent in 1858—I think it was about the middle of 1859 that he com<lb></lb>menced the sketch—I became intimate with him, and there was at one time a contemplation of marriage between us—we from time to time wrote letters to each other—as regards his letters I have destroyed them—I destroyed</p>

               <p>them at various times; the last that I destroyed were on the 2d of August this year—that was a certain number that I had by me from the time we came to town—in the spring of 1859, I was seized with illness; that was while I supposed him to be in Italy—I did not see him for a long time after that; I was too ill—I next saw him when he announced his return from Italy—that was about the 10th or 12th of May, 1859, and I think it was in the month of June that I communicated to him as to our marriage being broken off—he said he never thought it would have come to pass; but he expressed very great sorrow, and said that he was so ill that he had not the courage to tell me what he was contemplating, but he thought he was in consumption, and he thought he should end his days in a little village perhaps, in his own country.</p>

I understand the Italian language—I have trans<lb></lb>lated this letter before (<hi rend="italic">Reads.</hi> "Monday, 3d June, 1861.—Frederica, my life has become infernal, a moral martyrdom, a vengeance of God, it was so before, but now it has become more than ever insupportable. Alas! how tired I am of it. Yes; I am tired of it beyond measure; every day as it passes I feel more and more the weight of this existence, of my unhappy position, from the enormous accumulation of difficulties which surround me. I am by G—the most unhappy man on earth, and so much the more so am I, because by others I am supposed to be happy, envied—envied, wherefore, wherefore? for being on the brink of a precipice; being to-morrow, to-morrow, the laughing stock of society; with my pride, with my hanghti<lb></lb>ness. I am in a chaos, my mind is in a deplorable state. I can work no more, nor act, nor think, nor do anything; in short, in this state I must be ruined; yes, ruined, and for ever. However, the one who is the cause of my sorrow, that one who despises my heart, shall not trample under foot my self esteem. I swear this before God, for the love of my mother Came and see me Frederica, if you can, on Wednesday next."</p>

(<hi rend="italic">continued.</hi>) I do not distinctly remember whether I called upon him or not, after receiving that letter, or whether I received another letter before I called on him—I certainly did call after this—I think it is very possible that I went upon the Wednesday mentioned in the letter—when I saw him after that letter, he was most violent in conversation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186110210027"></xptr>
               <p>—I received this letter from him also (<hi rend="italic">read.</hi>—"10th June. No, no, no; not a moment more of such a life, not a week; it is a hell to me; A vengeance of God; yes, you have ruined me physically and morally, Miss; you have destroyed everything in me, industry, peace, the heart; come, Miss Frederica, there are but three resolutions to take; choose—you will either marry me, or ensure me enough to live upon, or I shall leave England—you have three days for reflection")—I think I may put the two interviews I had with him into one—I think I had two, hut the subjects were almost identical—I have some difficulty in describing the conversation—I told him as regards the first proposition, it remained the same as it had done, and that as regarded the other two, I could not take upon myself the respon<lb></lb>sibility of advising—I am not giving the language I used—we spoke in French, therefore the words are not the same; what I said was that I could not take upon myself the responsibility of advising; upon which he imme<lb></lb>diately burst out, "Responsibility! responsibility!" and dared me to use such a word—I said, "I can say nothing more"—he proceeded with a great deal more, which made me give an answer something to this effect—"What do you mean by my having injured you?" what he did say was so detached, and so furious, and so broken, I really cannot state it—he was very violent—he said I had injured him, and that he would fight any one to the last who dared attack his honour—he pointed to some foils which were fastened against the wall, and said he would not be conquered, he would fight any one who dared attack his honour, and subjects of that kind; in short, the end of it was that he frightened me dreadfully, and I said to him, "If there is anything in which I have injured you, tell me what it is?" but he never came to the point of telling me, but kept on saying, "Very well, very well"—I said, "Is there anything I can do for you?" and he said something about money, but the subjects were all so broken up that it was really not like a regular conversation; I forget how it came to pass, but I said, "If there is anything I can do I will endeavour to do it, but I can decide upon nothing without thinking it over"—I also said that as regarded leaving England, it would be a pity; what should he leave England for?—he said it would be better, because there would be so much scandal, talking; and then he said if I could give him money, and would keep it secret, (for if once it transpired to a third person it would remain no longer a secret,) then he might perhaps be able to work, or something of that kind—that was the substance of what passed at the two interviews—after that I again saw him, and I then alluded to the letters—I said, "I must have my letters"—I said that to him more than once—I repeated it every time I saw him—he said, "You shall have your letters"—I afterwards had an interview with him at the Baker-street Bazaar—I appointed it—I said that I would see him in Pellatt's depart<lb></lb>ment, where we were in the habit of buying our china—we were beginning the conversation there, and he said that there were so many persons about it would be better to go to the carriage department, which we did—almost the first thing he said to me, when be saw me, was, "Don't be afraid," when we went to the carriage department, for he had seen fear on my countenance; I was very much agitated; I had a horror of seeing him, because I knew he was then beut upon something—he asked what I had decided, what I could give him—I said, "I hare decided nothing in one sense; but if after all my kindness to you, and all that I have done for you, after the kind interest I have shown in you, you still say I have injured you, though I cannot see it myself, and though I never meant it, and though I do not think anybody would admit it, still, if you promise me my letters</p>

               <p>faithfully, I will endeavour, if I can, to let you have 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." but this was all under the greatest agitation, whether I said 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or what I cannot say, it might have been anything—I was barely aware, but my bent was to have my letters, whatever I gave him—he said, "You shall have your letters"—I told him that I did not know that I could accomplish it but that I could not do anything till after the 11th or 12th of July—he said, "That will do for the moment;" but I said, "No; do not say tint do not deceive yourself; do not flatter yourself; I can do no more and I will do no more, if I can even do that, it will be as much as I can afford," and he admitted that he quite understood me—on leaving the Baker-street Bazaar just near the portico, he turned suddenly round, as if nothing had occurred at all between us, and said, "What day shall we go to Marochtti's studio and Phillip's?"—I was so astounded at such a question that I did not know what to do, but still under the same impression of fear, I said, "I will let you know what day"—I scarcely know what I said—I did call on him after that, I think about 27th or 28th of July, at his house in Ovingonsquare—when I went in he said, "Well, what have you decided?—he said "I thought you would have had it in your hand"—I said, "No"—he said, speaking in French all the time, "Why this is a moment when a lady, I should rather say a woman, ought to sell to the very last of anything that she possesses"—I said, "I do not understand you"—I was quite petrified, for I bad not the slightest notion that any one could have spoken to me in such a way—he was very violent during this interview, in words, gestures, and everything—he said, "It is money, money, money, that I must have;" and he took hold of his coat and dragged it in this way, and said, "It is in that way that you shall be drawn along by me"—I was perfectly petrified, and said, "I do not understand what you mean"—he said, "Oh! it is rather figurative, but that is the way you shall be drawn along by me"—and he spoke about a spy, and a society of Italians of 1,000 or 2,000, and how easily they could bear from Naples in a few days, and so on—it was in detached, violent, and incoherent sentences—he said he must have a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a day or two of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Well, I will see what day I. can do that"—and the termination of that interview was, that I was to have my letters when I gave him the remainder—I afterwards met him at the Baker-street bazaar, and gave him the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; nothing particular passed between us then; I was very much disgusted, and frightened, and flurried, and glad to get away, and to say little or nothing—I did not make any arrangement then about the remaining portion of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote to him after that, I cannot call it a letter, I wrote on a small sheet of note paper on Friday, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. August (<hi rend="italic">Notice to produce this letter having been proved it was not produced.</hi>—I remember the terms of the letter, it commenced "Friday," and the words were these, "To-morrow, at half-past 10, or towards 11, at the Pantheon Bazaar, in Oxford-street, where the paintings are Bold, and bring with you my letters," with a hue under the words. On the following morning towards 11 o'clock, I went lo the Pantheon—I had previously obtained nineteen 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at the bankers on the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of August, and put them up in a parcel of writing paper—I found the prisoner at the Pantheon when I went in, in the large room upstairs, where the paintings are—he addressed me first—he said, "How do you do?"—I did not give any answer, but I said we were immediately leaving town, and then he said, "Give it to me give it to me "—I said, "Where are my letters?"—he said, "I have them"—I said, "Where are they?"—his hands were down, he was looking at a</p>

               <p>did not do so—there is a hole in the parcel, and on looking through that hole, if I had done so, I should have seen my own handwriting on this letter—when I got home I communicated with my brother, Mr. Campbell John-stone, when he came home; he was not at home on my arrival—I com<lb></lb>municated the circumstances to him, and placed the whole matter in his hands—he is my guardian and trustee—these two letters, dated 16th and 17th August, are the prisoner's writing—I have seen and read them—my brother opened them in the first instance—(<hi rend="italic">Translations of that letters was here read at follows.</hi> "16th August My dearest,—I receive this very moment a letter which makes me laugh, and I believe you will laugh, also when you read it. By G—, I think you have chosen the worst path, and I warn you, that if you take another step not friendly, I shall give your letters into the hands of a Magistrate in order to claim my rights. Miss Frederica, with your hands you have ruined me, and with your hands you shall save me from the precipice into which you have thrown me. Yes have destroyed my future, and shall restore it to me, I swear it by my mother. The idea of taking steps against me makes me laugh very much Against me? Do you mean to say that you intend to make my conduct public? But that is what I want, in order to justify myself in the society which I live. Remember, however, that you have not a single reason in your favour. The star in the ceiling of my studio; the star you have reproduced in the picture; the star on the small bottle received from you as tokens of love, and the star in your hair, would be sufficient proof, without the letters, to condemn you. And what of the letters? Think that if any one dares to use violence with me, it will cost him his life. The letters are mine, and no one has a right to claim them, and I will not give them up except when you, yes, you shall wish it. Adieu, Frederica; remember that you will gain more by remaining my friend than by making war against me, and that I love you, and you as a reward have raised me. P.S.—Come and see me as soon as possible, and, if you like, in company with the gentleman that wrote the letter, as I shall be very happy to make his acquaist<lb></lb>ance. 17th August. Frederica,—It is now three years and more that you have known me, so that by this time you have already considered that the path you have chosen is the worst. I am in my rights with the laws of this country; there is no mortal being who can touch that which belongs me without scandal, therefore away with useless stratagems and foolish bravadoes; come and see me in good friendship as you have always done for the past, that which you and me can arrange cannot be done by any one else. Remember, that to get out of the ruin into which you have throw me I am ready for everything. Do you understand?!!! Ah, Frederica? I beg of you not to drive me to extremities, which may be terrible to and me. You have placed me in a position from which there is but one way to get out; that way is in your hands. Do not let your guardian write to me any more, for it is lost time; I have already said that I shall not open his letters any more"—I at one time gave the prisoner a seal—the impression of that seal is on the wax of this parcel—I saw it the moment I opened it—this is the seal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,—it bears the impression of a dove carrying a letter—the two envelopes of the letters which have just been read bear the same impression—the addresses are in the prisoner's handwriting—after the interview at the Pantheon, I never saw the prisoner again until he was is custody before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>that I have always been equally certain about it as I am now, for it was always on my mind—in the accounts I have given of the interview on 10th June, I believe I have always stated that the return of my letters by him was then mentioned—I cannot be sure, I believe so—I answered any questions that were asked me—I cannot remember whether I stated it, but I know what I did—the first proposition of the three is that I should marry him—all notions of our marrying had been quite given up between us at that time; certainly as far as I was concerned, and he knew it perfectly well—there was no person who had my confidence—I do not know that anybody on his part knew that the engagement, or the notion of engage<lb></lb>ment, had existed between us before he went to Italy—no one knew on my part—there would be nobody to whom I should have to explain it if nobody knew of it—the correspondence between us went on as before, at his par<lb></lb>ticular request—it was always kind and friendly, and affectionate—it was not of the most affectionate character, not in my meaning—I addressed him in Italian, we spoke in Italian also—at the Pantheon we spoke in French, and in Baker-street—we generally spoke in French, unless I liked to speak in Italian for exercise—in business matters we spoke in French—I believe he speaks French well, better than he writes it—it is very variable, many persons make a mistake without intending to do so, and yet they may be very correct at other times.

               <p>he could not follow his profession, and had not followed it; he was following it immensely, I thought; I saw plenty of painting going on—he never said that his countrymen shunned him because be went so much with me—he did not tell me what the life was that he could no longer endure, the life that was mentioned in the letter of 10th June, nor did I ask him, because I heard him make use of that expression when I was first acquainted with him; he was always alluding to some mysterious thing which I did not know—the responsibility which I said I could not take upon myself, was the responsibility of advising, of telling him what to do—I believe it was the third or fourth day after receiving the letter of 10th June that I went to him—I went alone—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) is in my writing—it is in Italian—it begins "My dear friend,", "dear," or "dearest,"—it does mean u My dearest friend"—this letter was written after the rejection of the picture from the Royal Academy—it is simply dated "Wednesday"—I did not know that his picture was rejected by the Royal Academy until he particularly requested me to ascertain whether it was received or not—the letter was written by me in May—there is the post-mark on the envelope, May 9th—I suppose that is the correct post-mark—it was not my opinion that he was at that time a person who was worthy of my love, not under the sense of "love"—I wrote this letter with a great deal of feeling, in tower to one of his about his unworthiness, Asking me to go to Mr. El more about his picture, and saying that he was worthy of nothing, not even of the Royal Academy—you may put any construction upon it you please—my feeling at the time of writing it was that of the warmest and kinds t friendship, feeling for a person who bad been disappointed—I should feel for lay one disappointed, and would give them a helping hand, man or woman, as I have done—this letter, with the postmark of 20th September, 1860, is mine—I was not engaged to him at the date of that letter—lie never made n a condition of his giving hack the letters, that I should give him some written paper stating why they were given back; nothing of the kind at any time—he never told me that be could not give me back my letters until he had some paper from me that would justify him before society—there was never a promise by me to give him such a paper, nor did he tell me that he would not give me the letters until I did; nothing of the kind.</p>

               <p>care of them?" and he said, "Yes;" and he gave me two small parcels, which I never opened until the time had so long passed when he was to have returned, and I was exceedingly ill with neuralgia, and I never expected to recover; I remember burning what he had given to me without looking at them—I put together what I had of his, and burnt them, because he had stayed away so long—I opened the parcel, but did not look at them—I do not know whether he gave me at that time all the letters I had previously written—I never thought of that at all—he gave me what I supposed was all my letters, but it is so long ago—afterwards, when we broke off, he wished me to write to him and deal with him with kindness and affection—I accordingly patronised and received him, and continued on the same friendly feeling—the painting was to be a secret surprise to my family, only he lengthened it out so very long, it seemed almost ridiculous at last—it was to have been finished in 1860—it was a portrait of myself and sister, and my little dog—my sister sometimes accompanied me, and sometimes he said he did not require her, and it was annoying and tedious to her, she did not enter into painting with the ardour that I did—I sent him a portrait of my little dog to paint from, as it died after the picture was commenced—we generally drove down to Twickenham; we might have gone by railway; but we don't like railways, and it is a pleasanter drive—I did not put the rail<lb></lb>way paper into the parcel—I did not make up the parcel myself—I should never have dreamt of it—I had no motive for doing such a thing.</p>

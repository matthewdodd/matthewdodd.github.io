On the 5th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the shop door, and saw the prisoner standing opposite a pair of trousers which hung outside the window, and looking at them; he walked a little way down the street when he saw me looking at him, and shortly after I saw him again in the same place - I turned away, looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090093"></xptr>again, and saw him going down the street; I missed the trousers, and followed him - he walked down the street, and when he turned he ran as hard as he could; I ran after him, calling Stop thief! - he endeavoured to throw the trousers over a wall; they fell on the pavement - I picked them up, and gave them to the officer; I saw him throw them down - I followed and took him in Anchor-street. Spitalfields, and collared him; I told him I wanted him to go with me - he said, "What have I done?" I said, "You have stolen a pair of trousers;" he said, "I have stolen no trousers" - he began wrestling with me, and threw me down in the mud; I kept hold of him - we were both down; I saw a Policeman and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask him where they hung. Witness. On an iron rail over the shop window - my head was turned when they were taken; I saw a young woman pass while he stood there, and he spoke to her -I lost sight of him twice; some boys told me which way you were gone - I went, and saw you walking as if nothing had happened; when I took you over two boys said you were not the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the trousers go out of his hand? A. I did - I am confident he is the man; he had a stick in his hand, and wore a jacket - I am confident of his features; I did not take him a quarter of a mile off - he could walk there in three minutes.</p>

               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says he apprehended me near four o'clock - I came out of the Jolly Weavers, in Weaver-street, at five minutes to five. Witness. It might be a quarter past four o'clock, when I first saw him: I took him about half-past - (looking at his deposition) it says five o'clock here, but I do not think they have taken me down right; I said the same as I say now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming out of Wheeler-street - it wanted five minutes to five o'clock when I went to have a glass of beer; when I came out he took hold of me, and said I stole a pair of trousers - I was not within a quarter of a mile of the pawnborker's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Byas, pawnbroker, of 147, St. George Street—I produce the declaration whioh I gave to the prisoner on 14th July—I saw her put her mark to it and she took it away, and afterwards brought it back with the signature attested by the Magistrate—on receiving principal and interest, I delivered up to her her watch—I was afterwards applied to by the son of Mr. Jessop, Who produced the ticket to deliver up the article—I detained the ticket, and found an affidavit had been made, and the watch had been claimed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> I have been some time in the pawnbroking business—it is the custom when a person cannot read or write, to make their mark—I read over to her the portion of the declaration I have to fill up, and she made her mark at the end—she has been in the habit of pawning things with me, I have known her a long time—she has undoubtedly pawned a watch there before, and other articles—I have never known anything against her.</p>

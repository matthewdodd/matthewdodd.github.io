            . I am a Policeman. I went into the prisoner's room, and asked if he knew any thing of the crown-piece and handkerchief - he denied it, and so did his wife, but on searching him, his wife said, "Don't search him, he has spent 1s. 6d. out of it and given me the 3s. 6d.;" he then said he had taken it - I asked for the handkerchief; he said he knew nothing of that, but at last told his son to go for it - I said he should go himself; he went into the back yard, and said he had thrown it over the wall, and a little boy handed it over to him - he laid hold of the bannister; I had great difficulty to get him out of the house - he said."I spent but sixpence of it, here is a shilling."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had given her a lodging for the night, and in the morning three or four pots of beer were fetched - I was looking for my children's shoes, and found a coloured piece of rag with the 5s. piece in it.</p>

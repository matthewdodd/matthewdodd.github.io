I do; I delivered the half-crown to him, for the purpose of trying the honesty of the prisoner; I afterwards found that half-crown in the prisoner's possession; I got Mr. Underwood to get his man to fetch some candles, in order to detect this system of plunder - the prisoner produced the half-crown fromhis coat pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your buying six shillings worth of goods required change? A. Yes, I had a sixpence - I did not observe where the prisoner took it from - I will not swear he did not take it out of his pocket; he gave me sixpence only.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Hale; on the 15th of June, I remember Wreedon coming to master's shop, and buying candles; I saw him pay the prisoner the money, and saw the prisoner put the money into the till, and his hand came from the till as open as mine is - and it is very seldom that it used to come away open; he had nothing in his hand when he put the money into the till; a customer afterward came in with a shilling for candles; I saw him put the shilling into the till, and take something out between his two fingers, and saw him put it into his left hand coat pocket; I was present when he was searched, and he gave the half-crown out of that same pocket; he had no other money in that pocket; he gave master the half crown, and three other shillings, and said, these belong to you Sir, and I hope you will forgive me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say one word of that at the Mansion-house? A. I was told it was not wanted I was not asked the question; I was checked by that person on your left (the prisoner's solicitor) - when he put the money into the till, his hand was quite empty.</p>
               <p>Q. You add to that "which it seldom was?" A. No, I can say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any change out of the till? A. I did not see him give Mr. Underwood's servant any change I saw that money put in, and did not see him give change; I swear his hand was empty when it came out of the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if he gave change, the change was not taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040052"></xptr>from the till? A. I don't know, the till was open before he put the money in.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you name the customer do you mean Mr. Underwood's servant? A. Yes; I did not see sixpence in change given to anybody; I was present when he came for the dozen candles; I saw the prisoner put the money into the till, and his hand came out empty; the other customer had some halfpence change to receive, and at that time he took something out with his two fingers, and put it into his left hand coat pocket; I answered at the Mansion-house to what was asked of me - I was going to state more, but was stopped.</p>

            . I am a city policeman; I was sent for, Mr. Hale delivered a half-crown to me which I produce; I have had it in my possession ever since; I did not hear the prisoner say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were present when he gave it to Mr. Hale? A. I was not; Mr. Hale gave me the money in his presence.</p>
               <p>MR. HALE. The money I gave the policemen is the same as I had from the prisoner; this is the half-crown- the shillings were marked also, but the three shillings he gave me, and said, were mine, were not marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you examined at the Mansion-house? A. I was, I think what I said was taken down and read over to me; I signed my name; I was asked whether that was what I had to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word about the prisoner's asking you to forgive him at the Mansion-house? A. I don't think I did, but I will swear he did say so; the fact is the Lord Mayor was in a great hurry that day; he saw enough to send the case before a Jury; I don't come here having vindictive feelings; I cannot say that any of my witnesses stated before the Lord Mayor that he asked my forgiveness, but he did ask forgiveness; I cannot tell you why I did not tell the Lord Mayor that he asked my forgiveness- I swear he did ask forgiveness.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you tell the Lord Mayor, he produced the half-crown and silver, and said it was yours? A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you added to it that he begged your forgiveness, you will not say? A. No, the Lord Mayor committed the prisoner on the depositions; I have not come here with any design to hold back any truth or word in the case; I never had any quarrel with the prisoner; I never had the least reason to suspect him till within twelve months.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JAMES HOWARD. Q. Did you say one word to the Lord Mayor about the prisoner asking forgiveness? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was your examination very short, and the Lord Mayor merely took your name as a witness? A. That was all.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say you saw the prisoner put the money into the till, and take his hand out open; might he before he put the money into the till have taken the sixpence out, and placed it on the counter? A. The till was open before he put the money in, but I did not see him give the sixpence out; he was talking to the person who came for the candles; I saw his hand come out open when he put the money in; he did not take the sixpence out, at the time he put the money in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you consider he had an opportunity of taking change from the till? A. The till was open before he put the money into it; he had time enough to take change from the till during the transaction; I only looked when the money chinked, he had time to take it from the till before he put the money in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg to state I am a married man and have one child; I have been in the prosecutor's employ twelve years, seven as an apprentice. I worked with him day and night to the great injury of my health and constitution. The character Mr. Hale gave me at the Tallow Chandler's Hall at the time I was admitted, was most capital, and I have endeavoured to preserve that character up to the present time; I was never in any company, either vicious or base. I beg to state with respect to the half-crown, that it was my own property: I served Wreedon with the candles to the amount of six shillings; I put the money into the till, six shillings and sixpence; there was twenty or twenty-five shillings in the till, but neither half-crown nor sixpence; there was about fourpence in copper, but not sufficient; I had money in my pocket which I always have, having never been without it since I have been in his employ. I gave the witness sixpence out of my own pocket, I put two shillings into the till with the same hand, having hold of the handle of the till; I took the half-crown out and put it into my waistcoat pocket; I wrote the bill and receipt. I deny serving a customer at all from whom I received one shilling; I bought some fat of a woman and gave one shilling and a penny for it. As to what Howard states, I would not take his oath, he is a man who don't revere an oath. I went then about my ordinary employment, and in twenty minutes or half-an-hour Mr. Hale called me into the parlour, and asked if I had a half-crown; I produced my money, and half-a-crown among it; he said none of that was his own: I left my silver on his desk. I was astonished at his behaviour, for I believed he would trust me with hundreds. He said "Have you not another half-crown?" I said "Yes, I have one in my waistcoat pocket," and produced it from there: he said it was his; he looked at it and sent for an officer. I said "Consider what you are about, Sir." As to saying forgive me, it was the last thing in my thoughts. I was taken to the watch-house, and asked to see Mr. Hale, but was not allowed. It is not likely I should rob a master who I looked up to as a parent; I served him as if I was his son. I had received £6 from my friends the previous week, and never was without £5 or £10 while in his employ. I certainly had 28s. a week, but for nights and days together, never had my clothes off, attending to his business. I made his interest my own, and took his advice in every step in my life. I trust the character you will receive of me from respectable witnesses, will convince you I am not in a condition to do such an act. In consequence of having been so long in his service, I trust you will give me the benefit if any doubt arise. Gentlemen, I feel more acutely the situation I am placed in, in consequence of an aged parent.</p>

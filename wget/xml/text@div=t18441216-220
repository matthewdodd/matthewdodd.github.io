I reside in the General Post-office, and am a clerk there—in April last I was living with my father, in Chatham-place, Black<lb></lb>friars—my father's name was Frederick—he died in April, and the family left the house. There were a few odd bottles of different sorts of wine and spirits deposited in the cellar—they were left under the care of Mr. George Trist, the auctioneer—he was agent for the house—it belonged to my elder brother, as administrator to my father's effects—my brother's name is Augustus William.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Old Broad-street. I was employed by Mr. Bode as agent for that house in Chatham-place—about two months ago, I believe, there was about two dozen of wine in the cellar, and a variety of odds and ends—I cannot say what they were—I went to the premises on the 2nd of Dec., from information—I found the cellar door nailed up—I had left it locked, and I kept the key—the wine and other things were all gone, except about half a bottle which was left in the cellar.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No</hi>. 617.) I was employed by Mr. Trist to take care of these premises—the prisoners were employed there in Nov., nearly a fortnight previous to the missing of the wine—I had been in the cellar with Mr. Trist on the last occasion, and I saw him lock the door, and take the key—no person went in after that occasion—that was about two months previous—I was in the habit of going through the house every night and morning, and particularly at night, to see if any persons were on the premises—I was in the habit of passing the cellar, because that is at the entrance from the street to the kitchen—nothing at the cellar door had attracted my attention till the officer inquired about this—if anything had happened to the door I think I should have noticed it—the prisoners and another man had been employed about a fortnight, plastering the wall—I saw the prisoners at the premises on Saturday morning, the 30th of Nov.—I let Saul in at past seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>a tub, and Saul was close behind him—I followed them up Drury-lane, and down Long-acre—Reading then put the tub on the railing, and Saul stood by him—I went a short distance up St. Martin's-lane, and got an officer—I then returned to Reading—Saul was gone—I asked Reading what he had got in the tub—he said, "Cement"—I looked into it—it appeared to me to he coal ashes, and, in moving them, I found some bottles and a jacket—I told Reading he had got bottles, and I should take him to Bow-street—he said he knew nothing about it, that he was employed to carry the tub by a man who had just left him, who was a plasterer—he said he had been working at the foot of Blackfriars-bridge, and I should find the man on the scaffold—I found the bottles were all full—there were two of brandy, five of wine, three of cordial, and five of stout—I went to Chatham-place, and saw Saul on the scaffold—I asked him his name and address—he said No. 39, Greek-street, Soho—I told him the man he was following in Drury-lane and Long-acre with a tub was locked up at Bow-street, and he charged him with being concerned with him in stealing the bottles—he asked me if they had anything in them—I said they were full—he said he supposed he must go, but there were others concerned in it as well as himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Merton, and occupy a house. On Saturday, 6th April, between one and two o'clock I fastened all the doors and windows, and went into the garden, leaving no one in the house—I returned in twenty minutes, and found the door still locked—I unlocked it, went into the kitchen, and there saw the poker across a chair—it was in its proper place when I</p>

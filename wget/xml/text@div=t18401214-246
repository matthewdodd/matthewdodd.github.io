                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker in partnership with my father, in Crawford-street, Marylebone; the prisoner was our foreman. In con<lb></lb>sequence of suspicion, on Wednesday morning, the 2nd of December, I re<lb></lb>quired to have his boxes searched—he opened them with his keys, and turned the things out himself—I found all account-book among them, and asked if it was the property of Mr. Marchant, who he formerly lived with—he said it was—I asked if it was a book that was of service to Mr. Marchant in his business—he said it was—I asked if Mr. Marchant had given it to him—he said, "No"—I asked if he had taken it from his house—he said, "Yes"—I sent for Mr. Marchant, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in High-street, Bo<lb></lb>rough. The prisoner formerly lived with me for nine months as shopman, and kept my books—he left six months ago—this is my book, and a great portion of it is in the prisoner's hand-writing—when I lost it, it was in a perfect state, and there was room for further entries—it had not been gone through—I first missed it on Saturday, the 18th of January last, and considered it was stolen by parties coming to the shop—it contained en<lb></lb>tries which were very important in my business—we have no duplicate of the book—it is the only check we might have on servants as defaulters—we lose the check on things going out, and entries that may be made in the book which were not really bona fide pledges—pledges might be en<lb></lb>tered in the book by persons in the prisoner's situation when no money</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do you say about things being crossed out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If an article is redeemed, it should be crossed out—you will see in the margin of the book the dates—it was principally the prisoner's duty to cross them out, but the book being lost, nothing redeemed afterwards could be crossed out—it is not crossed, but a date put before it, meaning the day they are redeemed—I had a very good character with the prisoner—the book was found before I arrived at Mr. Greygoose's—my shop is full of valuable articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The loss of this book would prevent your having any check for the money the prisoner received or paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would—when it was lost he appeared to be as concerned as the rest in the shop, and hunted for it—he is the last person I should have suspected—I have no check on the money paid out or brought in but this.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you keep only one book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One for this description of pledges—it is the real entry made at the time—the prisoner was ordered to take up every pledge, and enter it—there is no book in which pledges are entered as they come in but this; but when pledges are taken in, a number is put on the duplicate, and in order to avoid a little time we write down, "Coat such a number," and when the party is gone we collect the articles and enter them in the book—he took it to avoid my detecting his plundering me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has he plundered you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot enter into that—I gave him an excellent character when he left—I have four others in my shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What would the book cost? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is much more valuable to me after the entries are made.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Buckingham-street, Pimlico. The prisoner was my errand-boy between three and four months—in consequence of losing money, I marked six shillings, and put them into the oash-box, and put it under the window in the shop—the first I marked was on Thursday evening—I went to the box again on Friday morning, and missed three shillings—I marked money again on Saturday morning, and put it into the cash-box, and left it in the same place—the prisoner had access to the shop, and could get at it, but he bad no right to go there—I went again, and missed some money—I afterwards said, if he would confess what he had taken from me, I would endeavour to give him as good a character as I pos<lb></lb>sibly could; but he had robbed me so much, I was afraid I could give him but a very poor one—I asked if he had taken the money—he said a boy had been there, and left six shillings with him, and that he had to return it to him when he returned in the evening—I asked him if he would allow me to search his pockets—he pulled out every thing he had in his pocket, apparently, and laid it on the counter—he pulled out a knife, several little articles, and nine pence, but no shillings—I was not satisfied, and I was about to search his pockets—he then took out five shillings—I found they were marked in the same way that I had marked the others—these are them—he took a key out of his pocket, which I applied to the cash-box, and it fitted it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, in the outer court at Queen-square, that if Mrs. Turn<lb></lb>boll's offer had been repeated, you would have jumped through the ceiling at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I said nothing about wishing the offer had been repeated—I said if the offered the money I should be very glad to accept it—I did not say I would not have prosecuted, nor if she would give me the money I would: drop the prosecution—I never told Mr. or Mrs. Turnbull that if I were paid, proceedings should be stopped, nothing to that effect, that I know of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the father say that there might be some flaw detected, and he should employ a counsel; and did not you say, "It is no use, he will only make a long speech and a muddle of it?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I went to his father's, because I was sent from the police-office to fetch his mother down—some one told me to go, I do not know who—I cannot say that either of the policemen did, but I went and drank some beer there, and I certainly said I should be very glad to get my money back—I did not tell his father if he did not pay me the money he would be committed—I said I was totally ignorant of the proceedings, I could not give advice.</p>

Q.</hi> Did any police-officer, in your hearing, tell the pro<lb></lb>secutor to go to the prisoner's father's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The inspector of the B division ordered me to go, because the prisoner said that he had a purse that he had stolen from the prosecutor, and put it down a rat's hole—the prosecutor went with me—the prisoner's mother wished the boards to be taken up, and they were, but no purse was found.</p>

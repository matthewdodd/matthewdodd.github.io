            . I lost the goods mention'd in the indictment, and suspecting the prisoner, found the handkerchief and stockings upon her. I took her up, and charged her with taking the goods mention'd, and she confessed she sold the gown and petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise you would not prosecute her if she'd confess?</p>
               <p>Kirby. I did; but she would not confess then. She did afterwards.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. The prisoner confessed she took the goods and threw them out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>D. Kirby. At Hendon. She had some of them on her back, and she said she carried the gown and petticoat to London, and sold them; the gown for 8 s. and the petticoat for 6 s. and 6 d.</p>

               <p>D. Kirby. She said she got in at the window. The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.</p>
               <p>To her character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nichols. I have known the prisoner from her birth. She had a good character before this, and as for this I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brooks. I have known her two or three years, and never knew any ill of her; how this affair happened I cannot tell.</p>

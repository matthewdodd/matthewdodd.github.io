On the 28th of May, I was with the Overseers gathering the population bills, and in Gower's-row I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running, others were pursuing him; I saw him cross the road, and drop something into the area; I stopped him about thirty yards from there; Bowman came up in about two minutes, and said, he had lost his watch, he was rather the worse for liquor; I took him and the prosecutor to the area, and there lay the watch, it corresponded with his description of it.</p>

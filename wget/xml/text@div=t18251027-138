            . I am twenty two-years old. I was clerk to Messrs. Sansom &amp; Co. banker's - I left them about July. I know one Peckham; he had lived in Upper King-street, Bloomsbury. I knew him for two months before June; the first place I recollect seeing him at was at Mrs. H'.s, oyster-rooms, Drury-lane. I was introduced to one Jones, by Peckham, at a public-house in the City-road, and very frequently saw him and Peckham afterwards. Jones (I believe) asked me for some cancelled cheques. I was to get them from my employers' counting-house, for them to copy to make forgeries. I gave them several signed by Green, of Thames-street, and Wilkinson. They were both present when I gave them the cheques. I used to get them in the evening, they were returned to me the same night once; and at another time they kept them all night; I replaced them where I took them from. On the 28th of June, a letter which I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270057"></xptr>destroyed, came to me at the banking-house, and I was sent for to Grace-church-street; a porter from the Spread Eagle, brought it. I went to the Spread Eagle. I had not then ever seen the prisoner. I met Jones and Peckham at the Spread Eagle, in the house down stairs - they took me up into a kind of lobby, and shewed me this cheque; I believe it to be the same - it was near three o'clock. I returned to the counting-house, after conversing with them - and in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came and presented this cheque at the counter to Mr. Bennett-he was dressed in a blue frock-coat, black waistcoat, with blue glass buttons, and had a gold or gilt chain round his neck; it appeared a watch chain. Mr. Bennett paid the cheque, and he went away - in a few minutes I went back to the Spread Eagle. I found Jones and Peckham there, I do not remember seeing the prisoner there, Jones, Peckham and I, had a coach, and went down to London-bridge, got out there opposite the church, and I went into the Shades wine-house, and had a glass of wine. Peckham and Jones went on a little way on the wharf, I came out and saw the prisoner with them. Peckham came up to me and told me, not to let the prisoner see me. I went aside, they all went into a public-house, opposite Old Swan-stairs, and I went back to the counting-house. I had made an appointment with Peckham, and after leaving business, about a quarter to six, I went to the public-house. I saw the mistress and servant, and asked if two gentlemen had been there, and left any message for me - I was told they were gone. I saw Peckham and Jones the same evening, at Peckham's lodging. I received at another place about 20 l. as my share.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner after this? A. Several times - I once dined with him at Peckham's lodging; I asked him if he had received 20 l. for presenting the cheque, telling him I had heard he had received it - he said he received but 15 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long was this after the cheque was presented? A. It might be two or three days. I never saw him before he presented it, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not seen him again could you have sworn he was the man who presented it? A. Yes. I knew his dress; it was very remarkable, and he had been described to me. I did not see his dress on any other day. There was an inquiry made in our house about it about a week after. I saw him six times or more after he presented it - I did not see him at the Spread Eagle. I only knew what he was to do from what Jones and Peckham said. I had been nearly three years in Messrs. Sansom's service.</p>
               <p>Q. You entered into a conspiracy to rob your masters? A. That is what we did. I had been acquainted with them two months before I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned Mrs. H's and a public-house in the City-road - at what other houses used you to meet them? A. I have been at gambling houses with them, and public-houses, and at a coffee-house in the Hay-market, under the Colonade. I was not there with Peckham, but with Jones. I made no mark on the cheque, but believe it to be the same as I saw given into Mr. Bennett's hand - I have seen it before.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Were you standing at the counter? A. No, but my attention was called to the transaction - the person who was to come having been described. I sat at my seat, and looked over. The person presenting it answered the description.</p>
               <p>JOHN BENNETT re-examined. I paid no other cheque of this amount drawn by Green.</p>

             - I knew him from November last; I had met him at Mr. Ross', Arundel-place, Pentonville; I have met him at Canterbury, and at different taverns in London. I lived at Mr. Parteridge's, No. 19, Upper King-street, Bloomsbury, and he lodged in the same street - I have met him at his lodgings and my own. I have known Johnson two years, as a banker's clerk, but not personally, to be on intimate terms with him - he lived with Messrs. Sansom and Co. - I have met him at the Saloon, in Piccadilly, at my lodging, and his own; I first spoke to him about March last. I first saw the prisoner in February or March, at a gambling house, in King-street, St. James - I have frequently seen him there; the first time I ever went to that house was with two persons, and I was introduced to him there, and then frequently saw him there, and at other houses of the same description. I have seen Jones at several of these houses. About March I and Jones proposed to Johnson to procure cancelled cheques, drawn by any respectable house, who had any amount at his employer's - he was then to get blank cheques - Jones said he could get them imitated - Johnson furnished us with both cancelled and blank cheques - I applied to the prisoner, in the presence of Jones, at my lodgings, about them - I had seen him the previous evening at a gambling-house, and asked him to breakfast, but did not explain any thing to him then - he came - I and Jones were present - I think it was on a Wednesday in June, but am not confident - he had formerly made a proposal to me, (when I met him at a gaming-house, when I belonged to the firm of H. C. Peckham and Co., paper-makers, at Dover and Cheriton, in partnership with my father-in-law - he knew I had quarrelled with my father-in-law, and that bills on the firm were then negociating; he proposed to me to put into his hands some bills on the firm, to be dated prior to a commission of bankruptcy issued against me, and he could negociate them; I did not consent to it, for my father-in-law was very hostile to me, and was sole assignee;) after breakfast on this morning, I referred to the former conversation about the bills, and told him as he was willing before to enter into the case of the bills, now he could do it more safe, by receiving these drafts, which had been forged, and would be paid by the clerk at the banking-house, who was connected in it; several forged cheques were then shewn to him, and this among others; I told him they were forged, and that immediately they were paid they would be destroyed by the clerk who paid them, who was intended to be Johnson, as they were to be presented when the cashier was at dinner; he said he would receive them, but he should like to know the clerk first; I Jones, and Berger, then proceeded to the Spread Eagle; a note was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270058"></xptr>written to Johnson, in the coffee-room there, either by me or Jones, and was sent to the banking-house by the porter, requesting him to come to us at the Spread Eagle; we had wine and prawns there for lunch, and remained together for some time, but when Johnson came I was gone up stairs, and as I was coming down I saw him; he was not introduced to the prisoner; the prisoner was in the coffee-room, I think; Johnson saw him, but was not introduced to him; the cheque was given to Berger, by Jones or me, in the coffee-room; he was dressed in a blue frock coat, dark trousers, and, I believe, a dark waistcoat; he had a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a chain round his neck; the watch and chain belonged to Mrs. Grant; she had intrusted me with it to get it repaired; she lodged at the same house as me; I had broken it the previous night; it was on the breakfast table at my lodgings; I said I should take it into the City to be repaired, and as we went along Berger said he should prefer wearing it when he received the cheque at Sansom's, as it would give less suspicion of his knowing it to be forged, if it should be detected, by his not being supposed to be in want of money; I lent it to him; the cheque was given to him in the coffee-room; I thought he was gone, when he came back into the coffee-room with the cheque in his hand, and said aloud that he had found it in the watercloset; nobody else was in the room; it had been in his possession about five minutes; he then went away with it; Johnson came back to us; we three went down to the Shades in a coach, got out at the foot of London-bridge, and went in there, where we had appointed to meet Berger; he had not arrived; Johnson and Jones remained outside, while I went in to the Shades to see if he was there; I could not find him, and came out; Johnson left us, and went back to the counting-house, but I think, previous to that, we went to the Swan public-house, it being more retired; I and Johnson went to the Swan; Johnson had left us, (I think) but we told him to call at the Swan; Berger came to us outside of the Shades shortly after Johnson had left (I think he had left us); he said he had been there twice, but could not find us; I, Berger, and Jones, then went to the Swan; I cannot say whether Johnson was with us; I think not; we then went into the back parlour; we asked him previously if it was all right; he said he had received the cheque; when we got into the back parlour we had some gin and water and biscuits; I think he took the notes out of his coat pocket; they were all fives, and pinched up together; they were unfolded and counted; two fives were missing; he said he was so flurried after receiving the cheque, that he supposed he must have dropped them when he put them into his pocket, but if we doubted it, we might deduct it from what he had received; we asked why he had not gone to the Bank and changed them for sovereigns; he said they were equally the same, as they could be changed at any of the gambling-houses, without any fear of tracing them to him; we asked what he expected for receiving them; he said he thought we could afford to give him 40 l. out of it; Jones said it was a great deal too much; that it was to be divided into five shares - he would give him what he had proposed, and asked if the 17 l. would be sufficient, besides the 10 l. he had lost; Jones said he must make that do, for he would have to receive some heavier ones; I think he had 17 l., leaving 90 l. in our hands; it was paid him in three fives and two sovereigns, which he had received at the bankers; I think I saw him again the next day; I never knew where he lived, but have seen him at gambling-houses in King-street, and two or three others; one in Jermyn-street, two in Bury-street, at the Colonade Hotel, and at Russell's Hotel, Piazza, Covent-garden, where we occasionally slept; the door of the Colonade Hotel comes into Charles-street; I have seen Johnson at gambling-houses in Pall-mall; we occasionally meet there; we were taken there by Jones; I have also seen Johnson at the Colonade Hotel, I think; I have seen him at the Saloon, Piccadilly, and many other places; at my lodgings, and at Jones's, No. 37, Upper King-street; I have not met him there, but have been with him to the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When were you charged with forgery by Messrs. Smith and Payne? A. On the 5th of August - I have been in custody ever since - a commission of bankruptcy was issued against me in October or November last year - I never applied for my certificate - I was never charged with perjury or conspiracy - Mr. Harmer was employed against me, but I took it to be for an assault - I was in Dover gaol three or four days, for an alleged assault on William Wright - I have been at Bow-street several times, and was brought, into the prisoner's presence to be identified, but not examined - I saw Johnson there several times, as he passed by to be taken away, but was never with him - he was not examined in my presence - I was not examined at all - this was the first cheque I ever saw to my knowledge - it was proposed a fortnight or more before it was forged - it was proposed by Jones about May or June, or hardly so long ago - Jones and I shewed the prisoner four cheques - I never saw any before that - I had seen those the previous day - the cancelled cheques were given to Jones by Johnson sometime previous, but could not be executed, and were returned - any cheques would do if the name was not too much obliterated, if the person had cash in the house - Jones was to take three shares; two for the parties who executed the cheque, Johnson one, and I the other, after having paid the party for receiving - I was connected with them - I have known Johnson some time, but not intimately - I never passed a forged cheque.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. We understand you to say you first spoke to Johnson about March, but did not then talk about forged cheques? A. No, I knew him as I did other banker's clerks.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You had not known him to speak to him before? A. Merely to say, "How do you do?" I recollected him when he was a banker's clerk, but do not recollected whether he was in London when I left Smith and Co. in 1821 or 1822 - I do not know which; I think it was 1822 - I said 1821 at first, because I was flurried - I thought it was 1821, but now think it is 1822.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with the prisoner and Jones to the Spread Eagle? A. Yes, I was coming down stairs into the inn yard when I first saw Johnson - I called him up to me, and took him into a parlour up stairs before he went into the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shut the room door? A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you took him into a room? A. I think it was in a small room, in the parlour, as we went up stairs, on the landing-place; I do not recollect whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270059"></xptr>Jones came up; we then went down into the coffee-room; I did not introduce him to Berger, but I think he saw him; I do not say I took him up to the box where he was, but I think he saw him to be able to know him; when he came to the banking-house, the prisoner was told that the clerk who would pay him was connected; I have never heard Johnson examined, nor he me.</p>

            . I am porter at the Spread Eagle, Grace-church-street. In June last a letter was given to me up stairs, addressed to Mr. Johnson, at Messrs. Sanson and Co., Lombard-street; I went there and gave Johnsom the note; I brought back a verbal answer, that he would attend to it.</p>

            . I am servant at the Old Swan, public-house, near London-bridge. In June last I saw Peckham there with the prisoner and another person; Peckham gave me a 5 l. note to take the reckoning out of, in the prisoner's presence; there were other papers laying on the table; they had some gin and water; they were all three together; one of them said, if a young man, named Johnson, should come, to say they should call in the afternoon; about an hour after they were gone, a person called, and delivered that message.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know on what day of the week this was? A. Monday was the first day, and then the note was changed - I am sure of that; I said at Bow-street I could not exactly swear to the prisoner, but I can swear to him now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What makes you sure now? A. When he came to our place he had mustachios on, and at Bow-street he had none.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You mention the first day - did they come more than once? A. They came four times - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday; the prisoner was always with them; I am certain of his person.</p>

            . We live at No. 12, Upper King-street, Bloomsbury; Peckham lodged with us for about three months; I have seen the prisoner at our house four or five times - he went by the name of Major de Clifford, and was with Peckham; Johnson also used to visit Peckham; I do not remember the prisoner and Johnson dining there.</p>
               <p>MRS. PARTERIDGE. I am the wife of Francis Parteridge. Peckham lodged in our house in May, June, and July; a person, named Jones, visited him; I have seen Johnson and the prisoner there; Peckham slept in the attic, and had a small parlour; Mrs. Grant lodged on my second floor - she had a gold watch and chain; I remember the watch being broken - I do not know how it was done - I saw Peckham with it, and in a day or two Mrs. Grant had it again - she is now in Africa.</p>

            . I am head waiter at the Colonade hotel. I have seen the prisoner there in April, May, and June - he went by the name of De Clifford. I have seen Peckham there, but do not know whether he was in the prisoners' company. I believe Johnson is the man who met a short man, named Jones, there twice: Johnson, Jones, and the prisoner had tea together there once or twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You are sure Johnson drank tea with the prisoner and Jones? A. Yes, in April or May.</p>
               <p>JOHN BENNETT. The cheque was paid on Tuesday, the 28th of June.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in a long address to the Court stated, that his taking the name of Berger, arose from his having met with a reverse of fortune - that he had met Peckham at public places, and from his address and appearance, supposed him to be a respectable gentleman, as he represented himself to have had 25,000 with wife - but denied all knowledge of the transaction in question, or any dishonest act. He received an excellent character from several respectable individuals.</p>

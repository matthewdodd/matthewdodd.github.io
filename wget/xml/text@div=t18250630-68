            . I am a watchman of Paddington - I went on duty to Westbourne-green, Harrow-road, on Monday, the 6th of June, and next morning, between three and four o'clock, I met the prisoner coming towards Paddington, driving this mare - it was quite lame; I asked if he was going to pound it - he said No, that he was going to the White Lion public-house (which is in the Edgware-road,) where he was to receive 2 s. 6 d. for bringing the mare. I asked where he came from - he said from Uxbridge; I said that was not the Uxbridge road: we went on to the turnpike - I then said he must go with me to the watch-house; he then got on the mare - I said,</p>
               <p>"You are not going to trot me;" he got off, and walked about forty yards, and then got into a field, to ease himself, as he said; I gave him leave, but he ran away, leaving the mare in the road, with me; I followed him, springing my rattle, and calling Stop him! he ran towards the canal, and then came back towards Harrow-road again; I at last caught him, with assistance - I found him laying in the grass; he said, "Don't pull me, I will go quietly:" we took him to the watch-house; he said nothing more about the mare - I delivered it to Bradberry. The mare was put into the watch-house.</p>

            . I am watch-house-keeper of Paddington. On the 7th of January, about four o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was brought in by Brown; I took him before a Magistrate, and had the mare in my possession till she was delivered to the prosecutor, at Mary-le-bone office. I found quite a new nail in its off fore foot - it seemed to have been fresh put in on purpose; it was driven close in up to the head - we were obliged to cut it out with a knife. She recovered before she was delivered to the prosecutor, but at first was so lame we could hardly get her along; the prosecutor knew her directly.</p>

               <p>"Very well;" he brought it to me in about an hour: he said he was a boatman, named Simmons;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300025"></xptr>I told the watchmen so - they said they knew him.</p>

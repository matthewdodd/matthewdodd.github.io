                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the East India Company, in Leadenhall Street. I remember Captain Robert Trotter Knox being in their service, and I remember his widow, Charlotte Knox Knox, receiving the pension money—in 1842, she was admitted on the fund called the Lord Clive Fund, a fund for the widows of officers—she received the pension quarterly; these are the documents handed in to my depart<lb></lb>ment—here is a receipt for her pension on 5th Jan., 1857—on receiving it it was necessary to produce a declaration signed by her before a Magistrate or a minister, saying that she still continued to be the widow of the officer—that was the condition on which she received her pension—it would cease on her ceasing to be a widow—she came to me on 5th Jan., and handed me this declaration—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I hereby certify that I have seen and examined Charlotte Knox Knox, and to the best of my knowledge and belief she is the person, C. R Ganny"—"I solemnly declare that I was the lawful wife of Robert Trotter Knox, late captain in the East India Company's service, and that I have not contracted marriage with any other person; I make this solemn declaration, Charlotte Knox Knox.")—I gave her an order on the cashier for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should not have issued the order if she had not given this declaration, stating that she was still a widow.</p>

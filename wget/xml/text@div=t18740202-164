                  </hi>. I am a wine and spirit merchant, at 1, Union Terrace, Notting Hill—on 22nd September last my clerk called me into the shop; I found the prisoner there, he showed me this cheque, and asked if I would oblige Mr. Horner with change—I said I would by his getting Mr. Horner's endorsement; he took the cheque away and brought it back with this endorsement upon it, "Mr. Horner"—Mr. Horner lives next door, his name is William—I then cashed the cheque, gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he then left—I paid it in to my account at my bankers', the National Bank, Notting Hill; it was returned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. William Horner, who lives next door to Mr. Otter—on 22nd September the prisoner came into our office and asked for Mr. Parnell, our head clerk; I said he was out—he put his hand in his pocket and asked me if I could cash him a cheque—I said "No"—he went out and in a few minutes he came back and asked me to lend him a pen, I lent him one and he wrote something on a piece of paper, which was folded up in four, and then went out again—it was a piece of paper like this cheque—I did not see him any more; I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant at the Birkbeck Bank—we had a customer, G. Wheatley &amp; Co.—this cheque was presented on 24th September, it was dishonoured on account of want of assets—the letters "N. S.," not sufficient, are on it in the writing of the ledger clerk—the account was opened in April, 1870—there had been no business transacted since October, 1871—this is one of our cheque-books which we supply to customers—400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in to the account of Wheatley &amp; Co.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The signature to the cheque is genuine—the reason it was not honoured was that there was not sufficient.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Half-moon public-house, in Buckle Street, Whitechapel—on the night of 26th November I saw my house safely locked up at 12 o'clock—I came down about 7.30 next morning and found the front door open, and the shutter broken about seven inches hi width, large enough for a man to put his hand in and reach the lock of the door—a padlock was torn off the bar shutter, and was lying on the floor—I found this chisel standing outside, close to the door; it is not mine—I missed from the bar a musical box and some cigars—I had seen the prisoner at my house the week before, and also at the Prussian Eagle, close to the Highway; and on one occasion I saw him with a chisel in his hand, just like this—there is nothing peculiar about it, and I did not take any particular notice of it.</p>

I live at 10, Buckle Street—at 5.45, on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 27th November, I was going to Spitalfields Market, and on passing the Half Moon public-house I saw the prisoner at the door, with his hand against a part of the wood where it was broken—I was on the other side of the street—I did not see him doing anything—I only saw his hand against the wood as I passed, as if he was putting the wood in again—I am quite sure he is the man—I had never seen him before—I saw him again on the next Tuesday, at the station-house, with five others, and I pointed him out.</p>

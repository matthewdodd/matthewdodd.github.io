I saw the prisoner, on the 4th of May, early in the morning, in Long-lane, Smithfield—she stopped me and asked me to give her something to drink—I said it was too late to give her anything to drink—she asked me to go home along with her—I consented to do so—we went to No. 5, West-street, West Smithfield—we went to bed together—before we went to bed I distinctly counted my money over in my pocket and I had two sovereigns, one half-sovereign, nine half-crowns, ten shil<lb></lb>lings, and five sixpences—I fell asleep—I awoke about a quarter-past six o'clock, and the prisoner was gone—I got out of bed to get my watch, and found it was gone and my clothes and money also—I gave information to the policeman on duty—this is my watch—<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had seen the prisoner before, in passing, as I am in the habit of going that way four or</p>

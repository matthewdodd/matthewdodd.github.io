And that Moment he fired his Pistol and shot me. I then gave him about 4 or 5 s. and he demanded my Watch, but I said to him, You Rascal, I never carry any.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he first came up to you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. I have the Misfortune to be thick of hearing, but I believe he said, D - n you stand! I had no Mind to be robbed, and when we came up together we almost shouldered one another, and on my saying, You Villain, you will not shoot me! He shot my Eye out. I did not see for 3 Days afterwards, and have lost one Eye intirely.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On your Oath am I the Man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. I am positive he is the very Person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In what Part of Finchley-Common was this done?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. Between the five Mile Tree, and a Load of Ballast, which lies just by a Path that goes to the Hog-Market.</p>
               <p>- Bigg. On the 4th of March I was coming along the Road; and saw the Prisoner turn from Mr. Ingram. Mr. Ingram's Face was very bloody, and I asked the Prisoner what made him shoot the Gentleman? His Reply was, for his Money, if you had been here, I would have served you the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>- Bigg. It was just about Sun-set.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram . It was on the 4th of March, and the Sun was not quite set.</p>

            . All that I can say is, that the Prisoner was delivered to me, and I carried him before the Justice.</p>
               <p>- Williams. I was coming from Work, and saw the Prisoner drinking Part of a Pint of Wine with another Man at the 3 Horseshoes on Finchley-Common . He told that Man in my hearing, that he was a Highwayman, his Name was Car, and he had just shot a Gentleman on the Top of the Hill. He then went off bidding the Man good Night, and said he would never hurt a Brother Trade. Upon this I pursued him down a Bottom, and his Horse running against a Post at Brown's-Well he dropped off, and took to his Heels, and left his Horse and his Hat and Wig behind him.</p>
               <p>- Lewsome . I know nothing of the Prisoner, only hearing a Hue and Cry of a Highwayman I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174104050004"></xptr> went after him when he had quitted his Horse, and assisted in taking him .</p>

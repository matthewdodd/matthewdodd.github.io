                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 203). I was on duty on 8th of July, about 2.10 a.m., in Gray's Inn Road, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Sidmouth Street—he went to the Mechanics' Larder public-house and tried the cellar-flap, then went into the middle of Gray's Inn Road, looked round, and went back to Sidmouth Street—the lamplighter came and put out the lamps—it was a dark night—the prisoner crossed over to the public-house again—I followed and found the cellar-flap unfastened; it is bolted inside—I had seen the prisoner stooping towards the flap—I waited for another constable and then called the landlord—the barman came and let me in at the door—I went down into the cellar and found the prisoner lying just below the flap at the bottom, four steps down, on his back—the flap was shut—he appeared to be asleep—I asked him what he was doing there—about 20 minutes had elapsed since I first saw him—he was quite sober—he Said he came after some beer—the cellar contained beer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The beer was untouched to my knowledge—I said before the Magistrate "The prisoner is a pavior, he has been at work till lately, I have seen him."</p>

               <p>HENRY COLLEN JOHNSON. I live in Sun Tavern Fields, St. George's in the East - these articles were stolen from a gig in <placeName id="t18241202-181-crimeloc1011">Galway-street</placeName>

I heard the cry of Stop thief! I came out, and saw the prisoner as I ran up the street - he was not running then - he had dropped the coats on the ground, about twenty yards behind him - Ferris had stopped him before I got up to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were they your coats? - A. No; one was my father's.</p>

            . I live in Colebrook-place. I was in Galway-street, and saw the gig at the door of No. 1. I saw the prisoner cross the road, go to the gig, and take the coats - he ran towards me. I was on the same side as the gig was, about fifty yards from it. I stopped him, and he dropped them - there had been no cry of Stop thief! then - he did not say any thing about them - the prosecutor came up, and took him - the coats were picked up by a boy, who ran out with Johnson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he had intended to steal them, would he have thrown them away before any alarm was made? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the street, on an errand. I saw a youth run along, and drop the coats. I picked them up - this young man stopped me, and cried Stop thief! - the prosecutor came up and took me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FERRIS re-examined. Q. What time was this? A. Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. I saw two young men together - one went away; the prisoner took the coats out - it was very dark.</p>

            . I am Mr. Stephens' apprentice. On the 26th of December, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some twist; I was alone in the shop; when he asked for twist I put the twist drawer on the counter; he wanted three yards' to match three pieces of cloth. I saw him take a ball of twist, and put it up his sleeve, and while I was measuring him a yard, I saw him take another ball, and put it up his sleeve also. I made an excuse to go up stairs for some more twist, and told Mr. Beioly. He came down, and caught hold of the prisoner's right arm, and I took hold of his left, where he had put the twist; he pulled it away, and shook one ball out, Beioly held the other in. The The prisoner looked into the shop before he came in, and could see that I was alone. Beioly took the ball of twist out of his sleeve, and found three more in his pocket. I cannot swear to those which were found in his pocket.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Stephens' service; the last witness called me down, and accused the prisoner of stealing two balls of twist; he said he had not got them, and shook one ball out, I held his arm till the officer came and took the other ball out. The prisoner said, that he was a tailor, and carried twist about him. The two balls are my master's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer, attached to the Post-office. The prisoner was a clerk in the Inland department—it was part of his duty to sort letters—I received instructions on the morning of 14th Nov., and stationed myself, at a quarter-past seven o'clock, in a place where I had a full view of him—I saw him sorting letters at the Great Western division—he took up a handful of letters, put them into his left hand, and sorted them according to their destinations—he continued doing so till a quarter-past eight, when he shuffled some letters, put his left elbow on the table, and I saw him working some paper, which appeared like a letter, between his three fingers, into the palm of his hand, holding some letters between his fore-finger and thumb—he then got up, and went out of my sight with some letters in his left hand, and one swinging in his right hand—the three fingers of his left hand were closed—I communicated to Forbes—I was soon after called into Mr. Bokenham the president's office, and found the prisoner there—Mr. Bourne, a president, was also there—it was from twenty minutes to half-past eight, directly after this transaction—Mr. Bourne said to the prisoner, "I suspect you have got a letter about you, Mr. Cunnington, and the officer must search you"—he said he was willing to be searched, he had nothing about him—I searched him, but found nothing referring to this charge—I saw some letters lying</p>

               <p>on a desk opposite, and told Mr. Bourne there was a cash letter among them—the prisoner could hear what I said—Mr. Bourne then examined the letters, and under the last letter was this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the state it is in now, open, but apparently crumpled up—the seal was not broken—I then took the prisoner into custody—the letter was opened before the Magistrate by his direction, and was found to contain one shilling, a six-pence, and a pawnbroker's duplicate—a person handling the letter could feel that there was money in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the managers of the General Post-office. On 14th Nov., in the morning, Peak said something to me, and I saw the prisoner passing from the front Inland-office into the tick-room with a few letters between the thumb and finger of his left hand, and some paper in his hand with three fingers closed upon it, and one letter in his right hand—he passed me in the middle of the front office—I went round one of the large tables there, and met him at the tick-room door, to make more sure whether he had anything in his hand—I again saw the letters and paper in his left hand—he went into the tick-room—I made a com<lb></lb>munication to Mr. Bourne, the president.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am one of the presidents of the General Post-office. The prisoner has been a clerk in my department about eighteen months—on 14th Nov. I received instructions from Forbes, and went to the tick-room door, and saw the prisoner there talking to Lugsden the tick-clerk—I then returned to the Inland-office, and remained there till the prisoner came out of the tick-room half a minute afterwards with a letter in his right hand, and others in his left, held in the ordinary way of sorting between the finger and thumb—he said he had been to the tick-clerk, or to the tick-room, to ascertain if the letter in his right hand was registered, the word "registered" being written on the top of it; I saw that—I said, "I wish to speak to you, come with me"—he went with me into Mr. Bokenham's office—I took the letter, and was speaking to him about it, till</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250045"></xptr>
               <p>Peak entered the room—he retained the letters in hit left hand—I took them from him, or he gave them to me, I cannot say which—I placed them on the table, about the time Peak came in—I said "I have reason to believe you have a letter secreted about you;" he denied it, and said Peak might search him; he was searched and there was nothing—Peak said, "I am certain he had a letter, and it must be amongst these," pointing to the letters on the table—there were fourteen; I turned them over one by one, this one was the last; the seal was not broken, only this small fold was on it then; the envelope is too big, and is folded over the letter—Peak said, "That is the letter he had in his hand"—it bears the General Post mark of 14th Nov., and the Portsmouth stamp of Nov. 18th —it would be in the Great Western collection, being directed "Mr. Whit<lb></lb>taker, 28, Charlotte-terrace, Morristown, Devonport, Devon," and would have come into the prisoner's possession that morning, in his lawful employment—it would be his duty to sort it to the Devonport division—if he found a letter with the word "registered" on it, it would be his duty to show it to the officer of our division, who is generally walking about superintending the sorting; and in the event of not finding him, to bring it to me—I should take it to the tick-clerk, to ascertain if it was registered—the prisoner had no right to do that; I was on duty, and he had to pass my desk to go to the tick-room—it was not really a registered letter, or the word "registered" would have been written on it in red ink; inde<lb></lb>pendent of which it should have had six extra stamps on it—a person conversant with the Post-office would know that it was not a registered letter—it is wrong for a clerk to carry letters from the sorting-place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should yon have gone to Lugsden with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might, but I should have seen that there had been no fee paid on it, and that the postmaster's writing was absent—sometimes they omit the word "registered" and put the stamps, and then the president writes it himself, having ascertained that it is registered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who would put the six stamps on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Probably the postmaster; there has been a change recently in the registration fee—if the prisoner had brought it to me, or to the senior of the division, they could not have told him positively that it was not registered—we are very particular, and we might have referred to the bill—I should have said, "Go on with your duty"—I should have gone with it to Mr. Lugsden, and brought it back to him if it was not registered, to sort in the ordinary manner—it was quite necessary to make the inquiry, in case the servant of the Post-office bad kept the fee—the prisoner was in the Secretary's-office first—I do not know for how long; clerks are not usually promoted from one department to another—it is most likely I took the letters from the prisoner's hand before they were put on the table—Peak took this letter from me, he did not lay hold of it first—it had the appearance of being doubled in three before Peak touched it, and I told him not to make it worse—the letters were unsorted, and all of the Great Western division.</p>

               <p>ANTHONY ROBINSON. I have been employed by different gentlemen for the last sixteen years, to stow ships - the prisoner worked with me on the 10th of December, for about four hours; he came to me on the 13th, and asked if I had any thing for him to do - I said not at present, but perhaps in a little time he might go to work: he said,"D-n you, it is a pity such a fellow as you should be allowed to come into the docks to work, much more to employ others - I will take your life - I will disable you from taking work, or giving orders;" I looked round, not thinking he was going to strike me; a mate spoke to me - I turned, and saw the prisoner had got a shovel; he struck me on the head with it, and then on the shoulder: he struck me different blows, till Phillips took the shovel from him - he struck me in different places, two or three times - I believe one blow was on the head, but I was rather out of my senses. Phillips took the shovel from him; he then started and ran - I was taken to a doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this happened, did he ask you for any tobacco? A. Yes, and I gave him some: he asked me for 1s. 4d. which I owed him; I told him I could not pay him till Saturday, when I should draw money from the ship; I pay all the men on Saturday - this was Thursday, and he had done the work on Monday; I cannot say whether he struck me more than once on the head, as the first or second blow took away my senses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate, I struck you first on the shoulder? A. No - I am certain the first blow was on the head, for it stunned me a good deal, and I think the second was on the head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your deposition states the first blow to have been on the shoulder? A. I said on the head.</p>

            . I live in Albion-place, St. George's in the East, and am a labourer. On the 10th of December I was at work on board the vessel - and on the Thursday I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner coming along the docks; the prisoner was wrangling about 1s. 4d., which he owed him; they came on board the ship together - the prisoner asked if he was going to pay him; the prosecutor left the ship, and went on board the Juno; he returned in about five minutes - the prisoner was standing on the main hatchway of the Bencooley, swearing; and a man whom the prosecutor asked to go to work, said Knight might go in his stead; Knight said he would not go till he got what was owing to him, and immediately said to the prosecutor,"Do you mean to pay what you owe me? if you don't, I will have your life; I will disable you from work, or giving orders;" Robinson said he had no money, but would pay him on the Saturday; he then asked for a bit of to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100030"></xptr>bacco - Robinson said he had none but what he had paid for, but gave him a piece to put into his mouth; the prisoner said, "If you would pay me, I should have no occasion to ask for tobacco - if you do not pay me now, d-n vou, I will have your life;" he flew forward, and looking round, took up this shovel in his hand, and made two blows at Robinson; they fell on the left arm, and knocked his cap off; he made two more blows at the head, one of which struck his head, and the other failed; Phillips wrenched the shovel out of his hand - I collared him, and we had a struggle on the deck; I threw him down; he got from me, and ran ashore; the mate, seeing the blood, told me to run after him, which I did, and took him in Lower Hermitage-street, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . I was present. I first heard the prisoner ask Robinson for a chew of tobacco - he then said if he would pay him he need not ask for any; he then said,"I will be d-d if you don't pay me, I will either break your arm or else your head, so that you can neither work nor give orders;" he went forward towards the cook's house, picked up the shovel, and struck him over the shoulder, and then on the forehead; he struck him with the edge of the shovel; I saw Sidney run after him, and he was secured; I ran to take the shovel from him, but he dropped it before I could well get hold of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see the prosecutor launch me from him, with his two hands? A. No - I did not see him shove him at all; I was not there at the time, if it happened - I just came up when the blow was struck.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Wapping. I examined the prosecutor's head on Thursday, the 13th of December - there was a division of the scalp at the top of the head; it was about a quarter of an inch deep, and one inch and a half long; such a blow might have fractured the scull - it was an incised wound, and appeared to be made with the handle of the shovel; there was also a contusion on the shoulder. I attended him three weeks before he got well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was he hindered from his employment during the three weeks? A. No, only for the last two or three days, in consequence of indisposition; he went regularly to business at first.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. I received the prisoner in charge - he said he was very sorry he had injured the man, but he did it in the best of passion; I got this shovel from the Bencooley.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his Defence, stated that he had been three days without food, and, being much distressed, he had urged the prosecutor to pay him; the prosecutor was coming to press upon him - that he had kept him off with the shovel, - and was exceedingly sorry for what had happened.</p>

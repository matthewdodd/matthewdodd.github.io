                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at 58, Redcliffe Square, South Kensington—on Monday, February 24th, about 3 o'clock, I was on the Tidal Basin platform of the Great Eastern Railway station—there was a crowd—I was putting my son and my two daughters into the train, when Tompkins spoke to me, and on looking down I found my Albert chain hanging, and missed my watch—a constable caught bold of the prisoner, and I saw a watch just for a moment in his hand—on the way to the station the con<lb></lb>stable showed me my watch; the glass was then broken—it was not broken before—I charged him with stealing the watch—I did not see it fall from his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella maker, late of 43, Waverley Road, Harrow Road, Paddington—I was at the railway station when the prosecutor was endeavouring to put two ladies into a railway-carriage—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner go up behind him and place his hand on the prosecutor's right breast—I seized him immediately and said to the prosecutor, "You have lost your watch"—I called for assistance—a Great Eastern Railway constable came up and put his arm round the prisoner—he struggled, and I saw a watch on the ground near his feet, but I saw nothing fall—I made a mistake before the Magistrate—other railway officials came up, and the watch was picked up by the railway constable—I saw the prisoner shuffling his feet as if in<lb></lb>tending to kick it from the platfrom—the glass was broken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went there to see the soldiers off, and was waiting for the train back to London—there were 150 to 200 people—I believe I told the Magistrate it was crowded—I may have said 100 persons at most—I was standing a little behind Mr. Fenwick, and could see the movements of the prisoner's elbow, and caught hold of his right hand directly it was on the prosecutor's breast—I said to the Magistrate, "I allowed him, as I thought, time to take the watch, and then I grappled with his hand"—I simply gave him time to get his hand there—I was standing about two yards away, and directly his hand got there I flew at him like a wild man—it was near the prosecutor's breast, but whether outside or under his overcoat I cannot tell—Boltwood the porter did not take hold of his left hand at the same time that I seized his right—he came up directly the cry of "Pickpockets!" wag raised, and caught hold of him—I was a little excited—I continued to hold the prisoner's hand till the policeman and the porter came—the policeman held him while I went for other assistance—the prisoner hugged the prosecutor before I caught hold of him, as though he was pushing to get into the train—there was quite a scramble to get into the carriage—a good many people went away in the train—about 12 people came up when I shouted—I heard Mr. Fenwick charge the prisoner, and he said at once, "You have made a mistake, I have not taken it"—I did not notice a watch in his hand when I seized him—I did not see or hear a solitaire fall, or see it picked up—the place was pretty clear, and the people were standing back about half a yard from the prisoner, and the first time I saw the watch it was at Black's feet.</p>

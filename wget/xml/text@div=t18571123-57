I saw the prosecutor just by North<lb></lb>umberland Mews, bleeding very much—he said, "I shall want you; my wife has been stabbing me"—his clothes were all bloody—I went into the house—the prisoner was sitting in a chair by the side of the bed—this knife was lying on the bed, near her left hand, and a small streak of blood was on it—I told her I should take her, for stabbing her husband—she said, "I did not do it; he did it himself, against the panel of the door"—there were two stabs on the prosecutor's coat, and he had one—this is the shirt he had on—the prisoner was drunk.</p>

               <p>Marylebone on the night this happened—I found the prosecutor in a very low state—he had a wound about an inch above the collar bone, on the left hand side—it could not have been formed by anything but a stab—it was such a wound as this knife would have made—the bleeding had just stopped, in consequence of a swelling which took place—there was only one wound.</p>

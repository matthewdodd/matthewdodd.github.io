               <p>I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing happening on the 30th of May last, the night the man was killed in Rolls Buildings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you see? - I had just began to cry the hour ten; I was in Fetter lane; I met the deceased sitting upon his horse; I held up my lanthorn, I said what is the matter; he said, he was shot; I asked who shot him; he said, the man that was gone down Rolls Buildings; I said stop, I will see for the man; I met another man who had got him by the collar; he said Turner, this is the man that shot the man; I said bring him along; I took hold of one arm, he took hold of the other, I brought him up to the deceased; the deceased said that is the man that shot me; the prisoner said, yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner; is that the man?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. There is no doubt of that; that is not disputed.</p>
               <p>Witness. We carried the prisoner to a watch-house, till the surgeon came and dressed him. The prisoner was very badly cut, you could not see a bit of his face for blood; he had a great many cuts, one on each side of his eye, and the back part of the right ear; I did not see any others; he stayed at the watch-house about an hour and half before they could stop the blood to get him dressed.</p>
               <p>Did you see the horses come up Fetter-lane? - Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Who was the first? - The prisoner, and he led a horse.</p>
               <p>Did you see them go into Rolls Buildings? - They did not all three horses go into the buildings, the two horses did; the other Forrester's horse did not enter the buildings; the man with the led horse, the prisoner, turned into Rolls Buildings.</p>
               <p>How long after turning into Rolls Buildings was it that the pistol was fired? - They were not above a couple of minutes after leaving me before the pistol was fired.</p>
               <p>Where was Forrester at the time he was shot? - At the front of the horse's heads when he was shot.</p>
               <p>Was he going on or standing still, or what was he doing? - They went a great pace indeed, as hard as horses could lay their legs to the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner first went into Rolls Buildings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Forrester follow him? - The horse over shot the building; Forrester rather turned in the length of the horse on more.</p>
               <p>The deceased had a whip in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he hold that up to the prisoner? - He held it up towards him when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Did he hold it up before the pistol was fired? - I did not see that.</p>
               <p>When he turned in before the pistol was fired, did you see whether he held it up then? - I was not near enough to see that.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you in Fetter-lane on Saturday night the 30th of May when the man was shot in Rolls buildings? - I was; as I was coming up Fetter-lane about five or six minutes after ten; I heard some horses come galloping up the lane; I was at Mr. Read's, the pawnbroker's door opposite Rolls Buildings; I saw one man turn in first with two horses into the Building's; they made a stop first; the deceased was almost thrown off his horse by a jirk in stopping; about ten yards down the building I saw one man turn his horses about; I saw him draw a pistol from his side and shoot the other in the breast.</p>
               <p>In what position was he when he was shot? - On horseback.</p>
               <p>Doing or attempting to do any thing? - No; he turned his horses head round directly after he was shot.</p>
               <p>What did he do before, did he past the end of the lane with him? - No; he turned in after the man with the two horses.</p>
               <p>What was that owing to his giving a sudden jirk? - His stopping the horse short.</p>
               <p>Was the horse going right up the lane, free of every thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the man that was shot stopped the horse himself? - They were so close together.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the prisoner's horses stopped Forrester's horses? - Yes, by stopping in a jirk they were so close together.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150033"></xptr>Was it the nearness of the prisoner's horses that was the cause of his stopping with a jirk? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Was the man that was shot going up Fetter-lane, or going down Rolls Buildings? - Down Rolls Buildings.</p>
               <p>That is your opinion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near was you to him? - Six or seven yards at the farthest; the deceased was brushing something off his stomach when he turned his horse round; I said what is the matter, he could not speak to me the first time; I asked him again what is the matter; he said; I am a dead man; I am shot; directly as he said that I pursued the prisoner and catched him down in Bond's Stables.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the place? - About two or three hundred yards; no it is not so much, I believe it is about two hundred yards, the length of the place, the prisoner was standing by the horse pond upon his horse.</p>
               <p>Did you search him? - Yes, I found two pistols upon him; one was loaded, the other was discharged; I went with the prisoner to the watch-house and delivered him to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You live in that neighbourhood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know that there is no thorough-fare there for any horse? - One horse might go.</p>
               <p>There is no thoroughfare, horsemen do not ride through Rolls Buildings to go any where, except they go to the stables? - No.</p>
               <p>These horse were galloping as hard as they could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was going first, he turned sharp up the corner into Rolls Buildings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you pretend to say that the deceased's horse did not over shoot Rolls Buildings some way? - No; it did not.</p>
               <p>How far did he go down the Buildings? - Eight or ten yards.</p>

               <p>Court. The prisoner was not at the end of the Buildings when he shot? - No; after he had shot him he rode away and called out for his master; when he shot he was about eight or ten yards down.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the deceased close enough to him to have struck him with his whip if he had chose it? - Yes; but there was no blows struck that I saw.</p>

               <p>What did you see? - I heard the noise of horses coming from Fleet-street, in Fetter-lane; I stepped down the steps and I saw the horses came running against the end of the Buildings; they rode against the wall by turning so quick; one of the horse men says, d - n you, now I have you; and immediately the pistol was fired; I saw the flash of the powder and heard the report of the pistol.</p>
               <p>Court. Which of the horsemen said that? - I don't know which.</p>

               <p>Who went first into Rolls Buildings? - I don't know; I believe the man with the led horse was on the side next the Buildings, and the other on the other side towards Fetter-lane; they were both nearly abreast, but he with the led horse was next the Buildings; then I stepped down between the horsemen and asked what was the matter, one was holding his hand at his right breast; he said; I am shot, I am dying; I stept up to the other man and asked him if he fired a pistol at the man; he said he did; I was rather amazed, I stood a little while to look at that man; he got off his horse holding his hand to his breast, and said he was dying; I went to Mr. Read's the pawnbroker's shop; I opened his clothes and his shirt and saw the blood running out of his breast, he said he was dying; and desired to be taken to the Blue Boar in Holborn; then I went to see after the other man; the watchman had him in the Buildings.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>In the deposition that you made before the coroner relating to what your brother told you, he talked of it as if he hoped he should survive? - When I first when to him it was on Sunday morning; I was called up at three o'clock, I went down there, I asked him how it was; and how it happened; he told me how it began:</p>
               <p>What I ask you is this; whether in the course of that Sunday morning he did not say that he had some hopes of recovering or surviving? - No; nothing of that kind was mentioned on Sunday morning that I recollect.</p>
               <p>What time in the week was it that he entertained some hopes of recovering? - I was with him every day, I cannot say what day it was.</p>
               <p>But there was a period of the illness in the course of that week when he himself entertained hopes of surviving it? - Yes; he did say he hoped he might get over it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>I called you to give an account of some declarations of your brother, made by him of this unhappy accident; at the time the declaration was made was he of opinion that he should die or live? - At the time I spoke to him on Sunday morning he thought he could not live, and every body about him thought so.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this evidence ought to be received; I shall tell the jury that if afterwards the deceased thought himself better; and there was a difference in the story he told; I shall lay the whole declaration out of the case.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>So that the evidence of the declaration is received with that caution, I can have no objection to it.</p>
               <p>Forrester. I asked him how it happened; he said, he was coming just by Black Friars Bridge when Brice and his man over took him, they crossed him, two or three different times.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Brice? -

               <p>Court. Did your brother know Brice? - I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Because you said he told you Brice was there by name? - Yes; he said Brice and his man; he said, they crossed him two or three times coming up the Bridge; that at the end of Fleet-market. they attempted to lay hold of his horse, and he struck at them, and blows ensued; and that he called out to the people that were standing round, as there was a mob got round; that these two people either intended to rob or murder him, and begged their assistance; upon which Brice rode off; that he rode down Fleet-street, and Brice's man followed him and got before him; that at the corner of Rolls Buildings he turned round upon him and said d - n your eyes I have got you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150035"></xptr> now, I will do for you, and fired a pistol immediately; I asked him if he was willing to make oath to what he told me, and mentioned the dangerous situation he was in; that there was not a probability of his living; he said he was; I then went to Justice Girdler, and got a gentleman in the neighbourhood to go with me; I saw Mr. Minors the surgeon, he advised me not to get a magistrate, for he was in a very dangerous situation.</p>
               <p>Had your brother a whip? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you know that was his own opinion then, whether he would live or die? - He did not tell me, I did not put that to him; he was, at that time very ill in a very languishing condition.</p>
               <p>Court. And he was sensible of it himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What declarations did he make to you? - He sent his man in the afternoon, and desired I would come and speak to him; I had seen him before several times, but never had spoke to him, for fear it should hurt him, or set him a bleeding; I sat down by him and asked what he want ed; he said, he wondered that Brice was not taken into custody; I said how did this happen, tell me as gently as you can, and the heads of it; because I told him it was proper a justice should be brought to take his information; he said, he was coming very gently, for he had given his horse a quantity of water, and so was riding very gently between the Magdalen and Black Friars Bridge, when he was overtaken by Brice and his man; that they crossed him two or three times and looked very hard at him; upon which he asked them what they wanted; and they said d - n your eyes we know what you are; he said, that they passed on till they came on this side the Bridge near the turnpike; there he said they stopped him; one laid hold of his horse's bridle, and they insisted upon his going with them; he said he would go with them to the Bell Savage, and no where else; upon that Brice ordered his man to draw his pistol or pistols; that the deceased up with his whip and struck the man; and believed he brought him along side his horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you whether the pistol was drawn before he struck him? - He did not; he said, upon the strength of that, bearing a pistol was ordered to be drawn, he up with his whip and struck the man that had hold of his bridle; that he got loose and turned his way up Fleet-street; I heard no more of him; I asked him no more questions, fearing it would hurt him; and I made that reserve till I could get Mr. Girdler.</p>

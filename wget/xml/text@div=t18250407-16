We had a copper stolen from our house on the 17th of March; it had been fixed in the wash-house, which is attached to the dwelling-house - I had seen it safe about a quarter after seven o'clock - it had been used that day; a person might get to the wash-house by the street door being left open. I heard a knock at the street door about a quarter before eight; I went to open it; it was a man who came to deliver a message. One of the witnesses came down stairs, and told me there was a noise in the wash-house; I went towards the wash-house, and found the prisoner in the passage; there was no other person about. I went to the wash-house, and found the copper was gone from its usual place, and left in the yard. Nothing was found on him but a pen-knife and a few halfpence.</p>

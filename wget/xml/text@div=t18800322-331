                  </hi>. I am a messenger, and live with my wife at 5 Avenue Road, Stoke Newington—the prisoner has lodged with me since the beginning of October; he occupied a parlour on the ground floor and a bedroom on the first floor back; my bedroom was the first floor front—on 10th March the prisoner came home about 12.30, I heard him go up to his bedroom—he had been very excited two or three days before, talking very much to himself, as though some imaginary wrong had been done him; I did not hear what he said, he was very violent in his talking to himself—I cannot say off-hand whether he was a temperate man—we had not had any quarrel or disagreement with him—the night previous to the fire he was very noisy, throwing things about, talking and singing up. stairs, and my wife went up and expostulated with him, and asked him what was the matter—he said, "There is nothing the matter with me"—she said, "You are making such a noise"—he said, "That is my business"—that was all—about 2 o'clock in the morning I heard him go down<lb></lb>stairs, and almost immediately after I smelt fire—I got up and saw that there was a fire in his bedroom—I at once took the jug of water that was in the room for the purpose of putting it out—the mattress and palliasse were burning, the vallence underneath appeared to have been burnt; one sheet was burnt, and two blankets—the window curtain was entirely burnt, there was not a vestige of it left—that was not more than 6in. or 7in. from the bed, close to it—there was a candlestick on the mantel-shelf with a candle in it, very tapering at the top, not alight, and a lot of ashes of paper or calico hanging round the candle—the candle was not within reach of the bed, it was about 6ft. from it—I don't think the prisoner was in the habit of reading in bed—there was a gas light oyer the mantel-shelf—I don't think it was alight when I went into the room, I won't be sure—there was a bed cupboard close to the bed, between the bed and the window, upon which he could place a candle if he wanted to read in bed—I did not notice whether he had been in bed—no water had been thrown about till I threw it—his water-jug was left full in the room—another person, Charles Hopkins, assisted me in putting the fire out—after the lapse of a few minutes my wife and I went down stairs—the prisoner was in the parlour with nothing on but his shirt; my wife locked him in, and I went for a policeman—I should think it was not more than five minutes from the time I went into his bedroom till I found him in the parlour—the fire was then so far under that it was quite safe; I left Hopkins in charge of the room—I came back with a policeman, and went into the parlour where the prisoner was, he was lying on the sofa—I told him I should charge him with setting fire to his bedroom—he muttered something which I could not hear—he told me I was a liar, or something of that sort, for saying such a thing—I don't believe he was in his right mind at the time, he was very excited—he had always paid for his lodging regularly—I never saw him drink anything, he never drank anything in our house, but my impression was that he had been drinking—he said nothing about having been reading the newspaper, or about its being an accident—I don't think he knew what he was about, I believe he was suffering from aberration of mind—he said at the station that he had not done it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman NR</hi> 38). On the morning of the 10th March, about a quarter past 2, Mr. Constable fetched me to his house—we went into the front parlour, and there saw the prisoner on the couch in a sitting position—Mr. Constable told him he should charge him with wil<lb></lb>fully setting fire to his bedroom—I told the prisoner that Mr. Constable charged him with wilfully setting fire to his bedroom—he made no answer; he made a mumbling noise—I could not understand anything he said; he appeared very agitated, more as if he had been drinking—he might have said "You are a liar "without my hearing it, I was only half in the room and half out—I took him to the station—he made no statement there; the inspector spoke to him; he was very quiet there; he kept muttering to himself—I formed the opinion that he had been drinking considerably.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "I was reading the paper with the bedroom candle near the bed, and fell asleep, leaving the candle burning. When I woke up I found the window-curtains and part of the bed furniture on fire. I took what water there was in the room to ex<lb></lb>tinguish the fire; it was not sufficient, and I went down to my sitting<lb></lb>room to procure more water. Whilst in the sitting-room searching for a light I was locked in by Mrs. Constable. The police came and arrested me. I have offered to pay for the damage done by the accidental fire."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Baptist minister, and live at 7, Vicarage Road, West Ham Park—I have known the prisoner intimately for nearly the whole of the last fifteen years—of my own knowledge I could not say that he has been in a lunatic asylum, but I have had it from his own lips that he was there for a short time, owing to some domestic trouble about two years and a half ago—I had not seen him for some little time, when he called at my house one Sunday—he told me his wife had deserted him, and his health had failed—I have seen him almost every week, and sometimes twice a week, for the last two years and a half—I saw him whilst he was lodging at Mr. Constable's—I have taken tea with him there several times—he got excited occa<lb></lb>sionally when thinking about his domestic troubles, and during that time he would mutter to himself; but, as a rule, he was as sane as any man living—I can't say that he never took more drink than was good for him; as a rule, he was a temperate man—I have known him to be a total abstainer for months together—he is a very great student—he spends most of his time at the British Museum as a reader—when he and I were neighbouring ministers in Wales, he was one of the most popular men in the place—he stood well before the denomination, and before the world, up to the time he resigned his charge at Notting Hill—for the last few years he has not had charge of a church—I know his disposition well—he is a most kind-hearted, harmless man—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003220018"></xptr>
               <p>I am sure he would not do wrong to anybody in his sane state—He would know it was a wrong act to set fire to his bed, but I don't think him capable of doing it wilfully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I wish to state most emphatically that the fire was the result of pure accident. I lived principally in my bedroom, where I kept nearly all my books and papers and manuscripts, and all I regarded as valuable, and such being the case, I should never have thought of wilfully setting fire to the room. I frequently read in bed; I know it it is a bad habit, but it is one that students at college do indulge in. I was reading some old manuscripts, and as the gas was too far off for me to see by it, I had a candle on the pillar by the bedside, close to the window curtains. I dropped to sleep, and when I awoke the curtains were on fire and nearly burnt; the flames communicated to the vallence. I put out the candle and placed it on the mantelshelf, and tried to extinguish the fire, but as it was increasing, I went down in my nightshirt to get a can of water, and while feeling about for the matches to get a light, I was suddenly locked in. Had there been danger to life, I was thus in the most dangerous position. I can simply repeat that the fire was a pure accident. I am still under the impression that there was very little, if any, water in my jug, and that was the reason of my going down to procure some.</p>

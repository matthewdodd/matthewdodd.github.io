I was at the Salutation hotel, Newgate-street—these papers now produced were in my private sitting-room—they are marked in the usual way of law papers, "Cowley, Buckingham"—I put them into my carpet bag on Thursday, and on the Friday night I put other things in the bag—they were there then—I left them there—next morning' when I came down, the bag and its contents were gone—I gave notice to the police, and adver<lb></lb>tised them.</p>

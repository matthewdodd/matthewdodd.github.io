                  </hi> I live at 74 cheapaide, City, and am buyer to Edward George Wood, of the same place an option—I has not seen the prisioner to my knowledge until he was arresed—on 14th August, I received this letter by post. (This inquired the price of magic lanterns, and the terms for hiring slides, and was signed William Clarke master of the British School at ware and honorary secretary to the managers) I replied to that letter and on 16th september I received this letter from the prisioner (This oredered a pair of lanterns and other articles and two coureses of slides for hire) I replied, and I then received a further letter from the prisioner dated 19th september, and also a further one dated 25th September—the first parcel of goods was sent off to the prisoner on 22nd September, a second lot on the best of my recollection the lanterns and screen form<lb></lb>ing part of the present charge, and the third lot a screw frame and slides, not included in the indictment—the goods were sent under the belief that they were ordered with thier uasual business transactions—the value of the goods in the indictment is about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the value of the whole about 35l—an invoice was sent with the goods presumed to be sold, and a loan ticket with those hired—the illustrations which we expected to receive back have been recovered—those sent as sold are in the hands of the police—on the Monday subsequently shut up and the porisoner nowhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-exmained.</hi> Some of the goods are now in our possession, and the others are in the hands of the police; none are missing—when I went down to ware, I did not ascertained where the prisioner had gone, or the reason he had left—a portion of the goods we has sent were found at the railway station "To be left till called for"—I came up to town and obtained the assistance of an officer, and I ultimately ascertained that the prisoner had gone to Bury.</p>

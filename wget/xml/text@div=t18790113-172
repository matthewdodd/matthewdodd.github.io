                  </hi>. I am eight years old—I have been living with my father and mother, at 2, Russell Court, Old Kent Road—the prisoner is my mother, my father is a basket maker—there are four children besides me, I am the eldest—we only had one room—the baby was the one that died—her name was Ellen, she was 11 weeks old—it died on a Saturday; I don't know how long it was before the Saturday that this matter occurred—mother was in the room and had the baby, father came home in the evening and they were quarrelling, I don't know what about; she went outside the door, father shut her out, she came in again, and sat down and gave the baby some tittie, father told her to be quiet, after that mother went to the door and set the baby down, she threw it down on the floor, it cried—it began to cry before, and when it was thrown down it began to cry again—father picked it up, and then it left off crying—he knocked mother down and went upstairs and asked the lady upstairs to take the baby, mother was then in the passage—father came down without the baby—mother told him to bring it down, he did not, and she went up and brought it down and gave it a drop of tittie, and father knocked mother down, and the baby fell out of her arms—father hit mother in the jaw, and she got up and said, "All right, you have broken my jaw-bone"—the baby fell on the floor, mother sat down—father picked the baby up, gave it to me, and told me to take it upstairs to the lady, I did, and the lady said mother had taken it away from her, and I took it down again—I did not hear it cry when it fell on that occasion—father made the bed, and I went to bed, I don't know when they went to bed—this was about half-past 11—mother had had a little drop, and I think father had, too—mother fetched the doctor, and he told her to keep the baby quiet; I don't know when the doctor was fetched—I never saw mother do anything to hurt the baby, except on this occasion.</p>

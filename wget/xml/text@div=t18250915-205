            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 1st of July he bought this cheese - it came home about eight o'clock, was in the shop at ten, and a few minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner Robinson turn out of the shop door; I first looked for my weights, but they were all right. I then missed the cheese - it weighed 15 lbs, at first, but I had cut a quarter of a pound off it; I looked about, but could not see any one; I saw it at Lambeth-street the next day - I knew it by a particular mark which I had cut.</p>

            . On Friday, the 1st of July, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I saw Harris with the cheese under his arm, and the other prisoner with him; they were about three hundred yards from Davis' house - after they had passed me a few yards they began to run - I pursued Harris, and took him with the cheese. I said to him, "Is that your brother?" he said it was; I told him to call him - he did, and he came back; I took them into custody, and went round the next morning. I found Davis had lost the cheese.</p>

               <p>HARRIS' Defence. I was going along Whitechapel - a countryman came to me, and asked me to buy it for 8 s.; he said there were 14 lbs. of it - I pulled all my money out of my pocket, which was 6 s. 8 d., which he took. This young man was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>ROBINSON's Defence. I saw the witness with this young man. I came to see what was the matter, and was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 7, Lower Park Road, Peckham about 4.15, on the morning of the 14th June, I heard the breaking of glass—I got out of bed and looked out of the window—I saw Lanagan come from the front path into the road—I threw up the window and saw the two prisoners together—when I lifted the window they ran away in opposite directions—I dressed, came down stairs, and went out, to see if I could see a constable—I went to the corner and saw the two prisoners coming through Park Street together—that is at the back of the house—they could get round at the back of the house and meet each other again—there was no one else in the street—I gave a description of them to the police—I have no doubt at all that these are the two men—I have known Lanagan for sixteen years, and I knew Poulton by sight, in the neighbourhood—I saw them again together about a quarter of an hour after I lifted the window and saw them first—I saw two constables just after they passed through Park Street—I beckoned them up and told them what I had seen—the police-men went after them and brought Poulton back about twenty minutes after—I went with them to the station, and while I was there Lanagan was brought in.</p>

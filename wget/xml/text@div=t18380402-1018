                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Ward, tobacconist, in Oxford-street. About twenty minutes past ten o'clock at night, on the 14th of March, the prisoner came into the shop, went to the glass where we keep cigars, and selected one—he put down a good half-crown, and as I was going to give him change, he said he thought he had halfpence enough—I heard some halfpence rattle in his coat pocket—he said he had but three halfpence, and he then put down a bad half-crown—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I bent the half-crown, and took hold of him—two persons came out of the parlour—I went and got a constable.</p>

               <p>He pretended to be very tipsy—if he had gone out immediately after I should have supposed that he was tipsy—I heard a lot of halfpence rattle in his pocket when he put his hand in.</p>

I went to the prose<lb></lb>cutor's shop, and saw a half-crown on the counter—the prisoner snatched from the counter—I got it again after some difficulty—it was picked up and given to me—I produce it—I took the prisoner into the parlour—he appeared excited on my first appearance, but when I had been there two or three minutes he appeared quite sober—I found on him a purse con<lb></lb>taining twenty-nine sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and some silver; mak<lb></lb>ing altogether in silver in his purse and pockets, 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were three half-crowns, nineteen shillings, three sixpences, three fourpences, all good; and in his coat pocket, twelvepence-halfpenny, a gold watch, a silver chain, split ring and key—on the way to the station he said, "It is but one piece, to-morrow is Thursday, Mr. Powell knows me."</p>

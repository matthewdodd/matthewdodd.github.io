            . Q. You are a patrol. - A. Yes; I apprehended the prisoner on the 25th of January, when I was on Bethnal Green-road; I asked him what he was carrying off; he said, lead and threw it down; he said he worked for Mr. Hergest at Bow, he had found the lead in a field in the basket; I took him to the office on Thursday morning; I took it down to Mr. Hergest; we found that piece, and there were some cuttings on the place, it seemed fresh cut, I fitted it on the gutter of the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lead remaining on the stable. - A. Yes, three time this length, but this was at the other end; there was only one nail hole in the board, and there is only one nail hole in the lead when it was fitted on; it fitted exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. How long after that was it that the patrol came down. - A. It was on the Thursday Valentine came down; he asked me if I had lost any lead; I said not as I knew of; he went in search and found this place; it was taken off the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen this lead on the gutter. - A. Not for a great while; I should not have found it out I dare say if the officer had not come down. I am pretty positive that is the lead that was taken from the gutter; it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is very easy to put down a piece of lead like that to fit any gutter; there were bricklayers at work there at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. The question for you to consider, is, whether the prisoner did or did not steal this lead. You must be satisfied whether the evidence of Valentine, Ray, and Hergest, who applied the lead to the gutter and were satisfied in their minds, that that lead belonged to that gutter - you must try how far they are correct. - Your next enquiry will be about the guilt of the prisoner; you find the prisoner was a man working there; on Monday evening he left off work there, on the same day he was stopped by the patrol carrying a basket; in that basket is found the lead which was carried down and applied to the gutter; he was asked by the patrol what it was, he told him it was lead; that so far goes in favour of the prisoner, and then he told him he found it in a field hard by; if you believe that account, if you are satisfied that he found it, to be sure he is not the person that stole it; if you are not satisfied then as they say this lead was found upon him about eight o'clock; his behaviour at the time he is stopped, has nothing improper in it; he told them he worked at Bow; these are the circumstances of the case. If from the evidence you are satisfied that the man took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170026"></xptr>lead from the stable, he is guilty of the charge; if you do not think so you will acquit him.</p>

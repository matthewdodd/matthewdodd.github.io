               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many servants have you - A. A great many. We have bought upwards of 300 new casks within the last year. I have ten draymen.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the practice, when they are overloaded, to leave casks at any place, and call for them in the morning - A. I never knew ale casks deposited in that way; I have known small casks pitched. If the dray is full, they should leave them in the publican's cellar.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever know men go out of their way to leave casks - A. Never. A dray will carry twenty-four full barrels, and perhaps thirty empty. I never knew casks pitched in the City.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was employed to watch the prisoners. On Saturday, the 28th of September, about seven or eight o'clock in the morning, the first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230031"></xptr>thing I observed was the dray coming from the brow-house in Redcross-street - Lacey and Walters attended it. They first stopped at the Bull's Head, public-house, Jewin-crescent, and delivered two casks, and received two empty ones in return, and put them in the dray. They then went and delivered two casks at the Nagg's Head, Aldersgate-street, and received one empty one. They then went to the corner of Butcherhall-lane, and delivered four full casks, and received five empty; then to Bowman's, in St. Paul's church-yard, left two casks, and received four empty ones; then to the Weaver's Arms, London Wall, and left five full, and received five empty ones; then to the Flying Horse in Grub-street, and livered one, and received one. This house is about two hundred yards from the brew-house; and if they wanted to dispose of the empty casks, they could go and deliver them; but they turned back, and went down to the bottom of Fore-street, towards Moorfields - and there Walters left his companion, and went across Moorfields, and Lacey went towards London Wall, into Bishopsgate-street, and stood opposite Bishopsgate Church. In about five minutes Walters returned, and came up to the dray, and they went with the dray to the London workhouse - they stopped there and took out four large empty casks, and rolled them on the heads, (each having two), into the yard of the London workhouse. Turner was the porter at the gate - he received the casks from them, and put them up by the side of the wall, inside the gates - and as he received them one at the time, he took hold of some hamper leads and baskets, and covered them over one at a time, so as to conceal them; and the moment the fourth was delivered, Lacey turned his horses' heads round, and drove off at a very fair pace. Walters and Turner stopped a minute or two, and tossed up a halfpenny, and as soon as he picked up his halfpenny, both came out of the workhouse gate. I went in, and went to the casks, lifted up the covering, and saw</p>

               <p>"Hale, Redcross-street," very deeply burnt on the cask; and instead of finding four casks, I found five; only four were delivered at that time. They were all five marked the same. I then took the opportunity of taking a knife out, and marking them. I continued to watch them day and night, till Monday night, to see how they were disposed of. I left on Wednesday - they were on the premises then; I went again on Friday, in the afternoon, and missed them; but before that, between the Saturday and Friday, I had seen the prisoners there in conversation with Turner twice; they both went together both times. I apprehended Turner at the workhouse gate, on the Friday; the casks were then gone. Turner came in at the gate about two o'clock. I asked him what had become of the casks left by Hale's draymen, the other day; he said,</p>
               <p>"Go and ask those who took them away." I said I was an officer, and would not be trifled with - I repeated my question, to which he returned the same answer. He was very resolute; I handcuffed him, and brought him to the Compter. I had taken the other prisoners at the brewhouse before. They laughed at it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. It was done in open day light - A. Yes; the dray left as soon as they were delivered. I made a memorandum of the circumstance - they received eighteen empty casks in all, and delivered sixteen full ones.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Would the dray have held more casks - A. Yes, it was a large four-wheeled dray, with three horses.</p>

            . I am an officer - and accompanied Clinton. Every word of his evidence is true. I was not with him when the prisoners were apprehended. I saw the casks in the workhouse yard, covered with hampers; Turner covered them over. I watched them from Saturday till Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many days did you see the casks in the yard - A. From Saturday till Monday. The names could not be seen, without the hamper covers being taken off.</p>
               <p>MR. LYNN. Our brewery has nothing to do with the London workhouse. The casks cost us 23 s. each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your storehouse clerk here - A. No, he only orders what beer to take out.</p>
               <p>WALTERS' Defence. A great deal he has sworn is false.</p>
               <p>TURNER'S Defence. These men have frequently come and said they were heavily loaded, and left casks, and fetched them sometimes the same day, and sometimes in a day or two. They left five on Saturday; I moved some baskets for them to go against the wall, and then threw them up, to make way for the trucks to come in. The master of the workhouse once gave them leave to put casks there.</p>

            . I have been master of the workhouse nineteen months - Turner was porter there. One day, about twelve months ago, the prisoners came to me when I was in the yard, and asked permission to leave some casks - I gave them leave. I have observed none there since.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had not been there long, when the request was made - A. No, they did not ask my leave, till they saw me coming. The workhouse cellars are hired by a wine merchant - and casks are being brought there all day. There are baskets and hampers about.</p>

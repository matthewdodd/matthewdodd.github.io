            . About seven o'clock in the evening of Easter Tuesday I was in Golden-lane, and saw the prisoner offering these articles for sale at a broker's shop; I asked whose they were - she said her husband's; I asked if there were any marks on them - she said No, but I found some and took her into custody.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a woman in Gray's-inn-lane, she was bleeding, and said she had parted from her husband - she took me to this house - I engaged to sleep there that night - and in the morning, as I came down stairs, my foot struck against these things - I offered them for sale in Golden lane.</p>

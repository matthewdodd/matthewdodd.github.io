            . On the 20th of July, about one o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoners in Park-lane; I had this money in my pocket; it was safe at seven o'clock; I was quite sober. I went to a place in the <placeName id="t18220911-161-crimeloc843">New Road</placeName>

I heard something rattle in her hand; she gave it to Brown, who immediately crossed the road; I said,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me," and said to Sandiford,</p>
               <p>"If you do not give me the money, I will give you in charge;" I felt my pocket, and missed my money; she was taken to the watch-house, and some silver found on her; Brown stood in Chapel-street; Calder knew her and took her; I had four half-crowns in my breeches pocket; I did not feel it taken.</p>

            . I was with Davenport, and am his brother-in-law; he retired with one of the prisoners for about half an hour. I was not out of his sight all the time; they were coming back, and Sandiford called Brown, who went to her. I saw her put something into Brown's hand, who took to her heels and ran off. Davenport took Sandiford by the arm, and said he would take her to the watch-house, for she had robbed him; that he had 45 s. when he came out, and had lost thirty - he found only eleven left. They were together, when we first met them.</p>

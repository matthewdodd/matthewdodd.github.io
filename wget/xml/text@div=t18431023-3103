                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Thornton-street, Dockhead, in the parish of St. John, Horsley down. On Saturday night, the 10th of April, I went to bed at ten o'clock, leaving the shop quite safe—I awoke just before twelve, looked out of window, and saw the door, as I thought, safe—I saw two women standing on the side facing my shop—I heard a noise, but saw nothing, and went to bed again—I got up at seven, found the fan<lb></lb>light broken, and missed twenty-four shirts, and seven pairs of trowsers—I know these eleven shirts to be mine, and part of what I missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brewer Vcourt, Horsleydown, and sell ginger-beer. I came out about four o'clock in the morning of the 10th of April, and observed the prisoner and four others come by my stand from towards the prosecutrix's shop—I am certain the prisoner was one—I asked if they wanted any coffee—they went on about twenty yards, stopped, and talked together—they then came towards my stand again, and one of them, who has since been convicted, took a cane off my stand—I told him to put it down—he would not—the prisoner came back and told him to put it down, or they should get <hi rend="italic">blown</hi>, or some such word—they then went on to the bottom of the street into New-street—I saw them again at the end of a court facing the prosecutrix's shop—they staid there some time, as if talking to somebody, then went down the court again, and three of them came up the street—the prisoner was one—two females stopped down the street under the lamp—the men stopped by the prosecutrix's shop—two of them went down the court, and came back, then the prisoner went down and came back—the two men crossed the road, and went down the other side of the way, the prisoner kept on this side, and I lost sight of him.</p>

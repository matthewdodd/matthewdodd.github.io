I live at 97, Waterloo-road, and carry on business at 63, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—before 1st March last year I resided with my wife at the Dining-rooms in Lower Marsh, and let out the house in the Waterloo-road in apartments—the prisoner was one of the persons who lodged in that house—on 1st March I went there myself to live—the pri-soner assisted in removing my furniture—a day or two afterwards I was in-formed of something by my little daughter Eliza, in consequence of which I spoke to my wife about the 8th or 9th—the prisoner was not present—when I left the dining-rooms on 1st March I let them to a man named Crockford—he remained there ten weeks, and then I resumed possession—on 16th May I took the prisoner into my service as a waiter—on 5th June I had a conversation with him, in consequence of having heard some reports—I said I heard he had been robbing me, and likewise carrying on an improper inter-course with my wife—I asked him to have his box searched, and it was</p>

               <p>searched accordingly—it was just looked into—I looked into it—the prisoner was there, and another young man named Osborn, with an officer, I do not know his name—in the box was found a box, an apron, a shirt, and two collars belonging to me, and the duplicate of a ring; nothing else—soon after that the prisoner left the house and never returned—my wife left the private house the same day—on the afternoon of that same day, the 5th, I found another box on the second-floor, under the bed—that was not the pri<lb></lb>soner's room; it was occupied by lodgers—in that box I found about fifty different articles, brooches, rings, gowns, aprons, towels, a blanket, a chemise, a good many articles of female apparel, ornaments, necklaces, watch keys, and so on—there was a scarf, a neck tie, and a handkerchief belonging to the prisoner, and about eight duplicates relating to five rings, a blanket, two shawls, and one shawl—I have seen the property they refer to, at the pawn<lb></lb>broker's—some letters were also found in the box—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them—three are in my wife's writing, and some in the prisoner's; but that I cannot swear to—on 8th June the prisoner's box was opened in the pre<lb></lb>sence of a constable—that was the box which the prisoner had shown me on 5th June—we found in it an apron, a shirt, and other things—the constable opened the box with a key that he had, and found all these articles in my presence, and two duplicates, besides the two I had found before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bank-note printer, and live at 1, Meredith Street, Clerkenwell—on 12th June, about 2.15 a.m., I was returning home, and when in Farringdon Street, I became aware that there was someone behind me—just at that time a young man came along the middle of the road, walking at a sharp pace, some remarks were made by those behind me as to where he was going—he took no notice, but walked on to the corner of Charles Street, where he turned and stood under the light of a gas lamp—by that time those behind me, who were the prisoner and two others, had got to the front of me, they surrounded me, and I felt a tug at my watch chain; I distinctly saw the prisoner do that—I caught hold of the chain, which, being slight, broke, leaving a small portion of it in my hand, and the prisoner took the other portion, and my watch, and ran off with them up Charles Street—I tried to follow him, and was struck by one of the others—the blow was intended for my face, but I received it on my arm—it staggered me very much, and they all four ran away—I described them to the police, and on 13th July, a month afterwards, I went to the station, and picked the prisoner out from six or seven other young men about the same size, build, and age—I had no difficulty in identifying him as I had such facilities of observing him.</p>

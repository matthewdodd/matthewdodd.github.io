I went in search of the prisoner, and found her concealed in a cellar hole, underneath the house, No. 7, Oxford-buildings - she was given into my charge - I said nothing to induce her to make a confession - she said, "What am I taken into custody for?"- I said, "For taking ten sovereigns, I believe, from the gentleman's house you work at" - she said, "It is a falsity" - I said, "The gentleman informs me nobody but you have been in the apartment, and you are accused of it" - she seemed much confused, and said, "I have taken only four" - we went on to the office - I said, "You have acknowledged to four, and you will be condemned of the other six" - she said, "I only took these four" - I said,"It appears very black against you" - she said, "Very well, I did take three more, which makes seven; and, so help me God, that is all I did take."</p>

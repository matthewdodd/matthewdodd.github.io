               <p>PERUE (being a Mahometan was sworn on the Alcoran.) I was with the prosecutor when the prisoners were there; we stopped at a beer-shop in the Commercial-road; the prosecutor paid for what we drank, and went on first, leaving me and the prisoners behind - the prisoners followed him, leaving me behind to finish the beer, and on turning round, I saw Waters snatch the handkerchief, and ran away with it - I did not notice Williams do any thing.</p>

             (the interpreter). I saw Waters the morning after this took place - the prosecutor was talking to me, and Waters was coming down the barrack-yard, and seeing me talking to the prosecutor he came up to me, and begged pardon for robbing the prosecutor; he said he did not know there was any money in the handkerchief, but when he found money in it he spent it, but was very willing to make it up in any way he could.</p>
               <p>The evidence was communciated to the prisoners by the interpreter.</p>
               <p>Waters. I am a stranger in this country; this is the first offence - I have done wrong, but am willing to make it up in any way; I hope you will be as lenient as possible.</p>

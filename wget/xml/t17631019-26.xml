             rated an able seaman, the first payment was 2 l. I asked him how long he had belonged to that ship? he said, a year and a half. I asked him the name of his captain; he said, captain Harvey, I asked him if any of the lieutenants were stain at the Havanna, and their names; he did not know either of their names; he could not answer any other question that was asked him. I told him he was come to receive money falsly, and that I would send for the constable, and take him up he did not receive the money, but confessed he was put on to do it by one that belonged to the ship, name

            . I looked in the prize-list and found that name; he said he brought him to the tavern, and bid him ask for the prize-money in such a name, and if he should be asked any questions, what was his captain's name, to say, captain Harvey, and that Rearden was waiting at the tavern door till he went out again; I asked him his dress, he told me; I went out but could not see any such person, there were two or three hu ndred seamen at the door, it was impossible to find him out. Mr. Dixon came in the mean time, and after I had told him the affair he sent for a constable and he was taken to the Mansion-house, there he confessed that his name was Darby Quin, and that he was a waiter at a public-house in Berry-street, St. James's, and that this Rearden had used his master's house, and had borrowed money of him to the amount of 11 s. and when he asked him for it he told him if he would put on his cloaths, and go to the King's head, and demand the money in the name of Campbell that he would pay him half, and the rest of the money this Rearden was to have. I do believe the boy was imposed upon by Reanden, and was a real stranger to what he was about.</p>

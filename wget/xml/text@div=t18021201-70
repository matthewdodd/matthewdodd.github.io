            .</p>
               <p>Q. When did you count them? - A. I did not count them on the Friday at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of missing them? - A. I took my horse in pursuit of them; I came along the road form Hendon to Kilburn. and upon enquiry I traced the sheep along the road, and followed them as far as Paddington, but could not hear any thing farther of them; I heard nothing of them till Saturday morning last, when, in consequence of information, I went to a field in the parish of Battersea; I there found ten of the sheep; it was nearly dark, and I could not ascertain whether they were my father's sheep or not by that light: On Sunday morning I called upon Crocker, one of the Bow-street officers, and took him with me; Adams also went with me; we went to the field, and knew the sheep; I saw a man in the field, and enquired of him who was the owner; Crocker went with the man to the house of the person that owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know these ten sheep? - A. I knew them by the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the marks? - A. They had been marked with a G on the near side, with a pitch mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any pains been taken to obliterate that mark? - A. Yes, a great deal of pains I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any part of the letter G remaining? - A. On some of the sheep there was, and one in particular the greatest part of the mark remained; the others were visible, although pluoked out.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that one in particular, what marks were there? - A. The greatest part of the G was left; it was only defaced with red ochre; it had been marked with a B on the near hip as well.</p>

               <p>Q. On the same spot where the G was? - A. No; the G was on the side, and the B on the hip.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a pitch mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other mark by which you knew those sheep to be your father's? - A. Yes, I know them by their appearance and the breed.</p>
               <p>Q. You are yourself a farmer and grazier, are you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where are the sheep now? - A. At home, Hendon.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you get home? - A.Twelve; I knew them myself before the mark of the G was put upon them, I had drawn them from a lot of one hundred and fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have known them without the letter G then? - A. Yes, I think I should.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other mark besitles the G when your father lost them? - A. Yes, the mark of the B was upon them when they were bought, and the G was put on afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Has your father any partner? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no property in these sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual when sheep change their masters to put a fresh mark upon them instead of the old one? - A. No; we put our own brand on them, but never take any others out.</p>
               <p>Q. What breed are they? - A. They are what we call between a Dorset and a Somersetshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father had more of the same breed? - A. NO, he had not.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you know them by? - A. By the pitch brand mark on the side.</p>

Do you remember on the 19th of November last salling in with a drove of sheep any where? - A.es, I got up to come to Smithfield, on Friday moning, from Hendon, about three o'clock, and saw a drove of sheep coming from towards Mr. Geeves's field, at Hendon, towards London; as they came near me, I went up to the man that was with them, and said, Charles.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose neme was Charles? - A. A man whom I knew, and who lived it the parish of Wrilsden; the man made answer and said, it is not Charles; I said, what is it o'clock? he said a quarter to four? I went about my business, and he went about his.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of man was it you spoke to? - A. He stood about five feet ten inches high, and had on a brown coat, and a round hat; when I spoke to him, he hung down his head.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away then? - A. Yes; I was with a horse and cart then, and had no sheep at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; was the person you called Charles like the prisoner? - A. If he had a brown coat on now I could be more sure; he was very like the prisoner in size and height.</p>

               <p>Q. How many might there be? - A. There might be a score; I could not exactly say at that time in the morning; I said, hulloa, mate, I am coming with such a little lot; he said, come along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it in the sort of low way you now say it? - A. Yes; then I stepped forward to him, and asked him who sold his sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go close up to him? - A. I went abroad-side of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He made a bit of a halt, and said, Welch, he believed; who was the salesman was my meaning.</p>

               <p>Q.What did he say to that? - A. He made a bit of a halt, and said, Welch, he believed; he then went on, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you no other answer? - A. No, he did not stop to speak; he kept on, while he said come along.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he driving the sheep pretty fast? - A. He was in a good sharp walk; the sheep were running.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got you own sheep, did you try to overtake him? - A. Yes; I drove pretty fast, but I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. It was a man about his size, that is all that I know, in a brown coat, and a round hat, as near as I can tell at the moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it about his height? - A. Yes, as near as I can recollect, he was a stont man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be broad over the shoulders? - A. I cannot exactly say; he had a brown great coat on, which might make him appear something larger.</p>

Yes; I asked him if he had seen his sheep; he said, yes; I asked him if he had seen my mare; he said, yes; I then asked him how many sheep he had bought; he told me a score; we walked on together, and he went to his home, and I to mine; this was on Sunday.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010046"></xptr>Q. Were his sleep in the close then? - A. I cannot pretend to say; I did not go into the close myself; he was coming out of the field, and as he had seen my mare, I did not go any further; he lives almost by me.</p>
               <p>Q. He lives at Battersea-field, does he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. A labouring man; he used to go harvesting in the harvest time, and threshing in the winter; on Monday evening he came to me, and asked me if I would take some carecases to Leadenhall-market for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his expression? - A. He did not say how many, but asked if I would take him some carcases to market.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say? - A. The butcher disappointed him, and he did not come to kill them that day; he killed them upon the Tuesday evening, and the prisoner asked me if I would take some carcases to the market on Wednesday morning.</p>

               <p>Q. He asked you to carry them on Tuesday morning first? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. He told you the butcher had killed them for him the day before? - A. No, he did not say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You took them to Leadenhall-market? - A. I did, and he came along with me; I drove to the back of the market, where the carts go to be unloaded, and stood by them while the porter and the prisoner took the five carcases out of the cart into the market; I waited there about half an hour, when he came to me, and said, I have done, and will go home with you; we then went home together: On the Thursday evening, pretty late, to the best of my knowledge, I asked the prisoner if he had seen the sheep that day; he said, no; I said I was going down to see my mare, and would see if they were safe in the pasture; I looked, and they were not there.</p>
               <p>Q. In the pasture, or in his pasture, do you mean? - A. In his pasture.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A.Very well; I did not see the sheep, it being rather dark; I said you had better go to-morrow morning early, for teat the sheep should get any damage; I was at work that day on the road, which was Friday; the prisoner came by, and I said, have you seen your sheep this morning? yes, says he, they are all very safe; says I, did you see my mare? yes, says he, they are all safe.</p>
               <p>What time on Friday was this? - A. In the forenoon, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He said all was well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner has any closes about that part? - A. Yes, he rents them of

             sworn. - Q.When were you applied to about the sheep? - A.Last Saturday morning was a week; last Sunday morning, Mr. Geeves came to me, and said, he had got some information where his sheep were; I went with him to a close in Battersea-fields, with a person of the name of Partridge, who lives at Hendon, and Mr. Geeves's man, Adams, went into the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Which you took to be the prisoner's? - A. Yes, he looked at the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there? - A. Ten; he came back to Mr. Geeves,and told him they were his property; I observed the last witness at one end of the field, and Partridge and I went up to him, and asked him, if he knew whole sheep they were; he said, yes, they belonged to Mr. cordell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the close-belonged to Mr. Cornell? - A. I cannot say, whether he did or not, or other I asked that question; we went to cordells house, and Bengo knocked at the door, and a child opened it; he asked, if Mr. Cordell was at home; at that time, Cordell came up from out of the kitchen, and Bengo then said, here were two gentlemen, who wanted to buy that little stock of sheep; he looked at Bengo, and said, I have no sheep to sell, I did not buy them to sell; he said it very low, and seemed very much consused; I called him to the door, and told him, I was an officer, and should take him into custody, on suspicion of stealing those sheep that were in the field, then I took him in doors again with Bengo.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he make? - A. He did not make any; I asked him if he had any more in his yard, he said, no, he had no more than what were in the field; I left him in the room, and went into the yard to look for sheep; I could see nothing there, but went down stairs into the kitchen, where I saw two sheep alive; when I came up stairs again, I asked him where he got them, he wife made answer, he bought them last Friday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. He answered nothing? - A. He answered nothing at that time; afterwards he said it was on Saturday week last, he bought them at Kilburn, and gave forty-eight shillings a piece for them; I asked him who he bought them of, he said, a drover; I asked him if he knew him, he said, no; I asked him whether it was at a public-house, he said, he paid the money at a public-house; we told him we would go to that house with him; he made an excuse, and said, he did not know that he should know the house again; Mr. Geeves owned the property, and I took the prisoner into custody; this is the coat I took off his back last Monday morning. (Producing a great-coat.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the sheep that were in the kitchen, to MR. Geeves? - A. Yes; on one of the sheep in the kitchen, there had been the mark of a B, Which apparently had been a pitch mark, but pulled out.</p>
               <p>Q. This was last Monday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Geeves.) Do you remember being at the prisoner's house last Sunday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Crocker shewing you two sheep in Cordell's kitchen? - A. Yes, he brought them up stairs out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine those sheep? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, upon your oath now, that those sheep were your father's property? - A. Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Q. By what marks? - A. By the pitch mark that had been taken out, the same that I have already described; there are the traces of the same marks left in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those sheep of the Dorsetshire breed? - A.They were of the same breed with the other at home, and accompanied them the moment they came together.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that great-coat? - A. This was on the prisoner's back; I believe it to be the same I saw him with on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that on his back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Can there be a more-common great-coat on any body's back? - A. Not that I know of, it is a very common great-coat, but I saw on his back; I know nothing more of the coat, out I know the sheep.</p>
               <p>Crocker. Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You said, you asked the prisoner, whether he had any more sheep in the yard? - A. He said he had no more than what were in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did You perceive whether his hearing was very quick or not? - A. I thought so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Last Friday week, about a quarter after five in the morning, I set out to go into the country, to buy some sheep worth my money, or a cow or a horse, or any thing else, to put into my pasture, which I hired to Mr. Jewer, of Battersea, to turn a shilling by; as I was going along Paddington, I met a drover with a lot of sheep; he said, farmer, will you buy a lot of sheep; I said, if you can sell them worth the money, I will buy them, if I can; he said, I have a little of I can sell, worth your money; I said, how many have you; he said, twenty-three; I said, at how much a piece; he laid, fifty shillings a piece; I said, they would not do, for that was too much, but I would give him, forty-six shillings; he said, no; I said, they were not worth the money; he said, they were worth all he asked; I said, I would give him forty-seven shillings; he would not take it, but said, he would abate a shilling a head; I would not give it him, but said, I would give him forty-eight, if that would do; he said, no; I said I would not have them at all, and went on; he said, come back, and you shall have them; then we went into a public-house, and had a pot of beer,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010048"></xptr>and I paid him forty-eight shillings a piece for them.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 10th of April, about half-past seven o'clock, I was on duty in Hounds-ditch, about five minutes' walk from the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner carrying a firkin of butter on his shoulder—I followed him into St. Mary Axe, stopped him, and asked where he got it from—he said a man had given it to him to carry—he had no sooner said the words than he threw it down, and attempted to run away—I tried to lay hold of him, and knocked his cap off, but he got away—I called, "Stop thief," and followed him, but lost sight of him—he was afterwards brought to the station.</p>

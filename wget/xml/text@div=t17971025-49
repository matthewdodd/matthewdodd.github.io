            4. I saw it in the waggon myself, and I am sure the waggon had not been disturbed till it had got to Hatfield Wood-side, and there it was robbed; the ropes were cut, the canvas unskewered, and the box taken out; the box was in the very front of the waggon, of the outside; we always lay a night at Hatfield Wood-side; the guard's name is Banks that was with me; we discovered it coming down Barnet-hill, seven miles on this side of Hatfield; we missed it just as it was getting light, about three in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you had no particular view of this box after you left fairburn? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What first happened, or when it happened to the waggon, you do not know? - A. I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Q.When you first made the discovery, did you see any body near it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, whatever happened was long before you got to Barnet-hill? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Then there was something in the sack? - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court. This ought to shew you the carelessness to say nothing more of the manner in which you give your evidence; you swore, till the moment the gentleman told you the peril in which you stood, you swore most positively you did not see her go away; now you swear that you saw her go away, and saw the sack go away, neither full nor half full; I must beg of you to recollect, you know what I said to you at Hertford, and I did hope to have found you a very different sort of man now; it is really shocking? - A. I say nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is impossible; you were either perjured at Hertford, or you are perjured now; you know all that passed between you and me, when I tried that cause? - A. I cannot recollect; I have never been well since.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon your oath, do you not know what was in the sack? - A.Upon my oath, I never saw any thing put into it.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw the pieces of muslin that were in your house, and the size of them - I ask you, would those boxes that were sent to Gipsey Tom hold half of the muslins in your house? - A. I do not think they would, they might hold half.</p>

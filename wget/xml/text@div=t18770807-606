On 20th July I received information and a description and subsequently saw Ward alone on Ludgate Hill, and followed him into the Old Crown public-house—I then went to the back of the house and sent in a message—in the meantime I saw Llewellyn, and, being a respectable fellow, I asked him if he would go in and tell the land<lb></lb>lord there was a man there going to pass counterfeit coin and that he had a white <hi rend="italic">slop</hi> on and a pea jacket—he said "I will do so," and went into the house—he and the other two prisoners came out and I went round to the front of the house and saw the three prisoners in the road together-Llewellyn turned back and said "Am I going to the Palace?"—I said "No, you must go up here and turn down the lane"—I then went home, changed my uniform, came out, spoke to the barmaid, and found the other two pri<lb></lb>soners at the Red Lion 500 or 600 yards from where I had seen them before; that is the reverse direction to the Palace—they came out and I followed them to the Holloway Road, where I spoke to another officer—they separated opposite the Red Cap, and Ward went on 50 yards, and they all three joined again at St. John's Church, Holloway—Llewellyn then went into the Marl-borough Hotel and I went in and spoke to the barmaid, who showed me this coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then went round and took Llewellyn, handed him over to the publican, and went and arrested the other two prisoners—Mason gave his address, 5, James Street, Holloway Road—I went there with Ser<lb></lb>geant Burnham and found this battery, mould, ladle, and metal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

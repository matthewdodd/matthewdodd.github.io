               <p>Q. What were her words?</p>
               <p>Jones. She said Dolly had taken a piece of gold out of this man's hand, and would not give it him again. Then said I, Poh, Poh, she is only playing the rogue, I dare say she will give it him: come, Dolly, give the man his money. She said she would not give it him 'till such time he had given her a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she pretend that shilling was for? did he owe her a shilling?</p>
               <p>Jones. She said it was for oysters and beer some time ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them both before?</p>
               <p>Jones. I had seen the woman before, but did not know the man; I knew both the women.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jones. I have known her about eleven years, ever since I have been in that neighbourhood, but were no ways acquainted.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her business?</p>
               <p>Jones. She sold fruit and oysters, and things of that sort about the street. The man said, he never owed her a farthing in his life. After some-time we perswaded him to give her a shilling. She was going to take it. Stop, said he, perhaps you will take the shilling as you did the gold; then he gave the shilling into my hand to hold 'till he had his piece of money. Then she said, he should not have the money at all; and I had no business with it. I endeavoured to perswade her very much to let him have it; but she said, it was no business of mine. I told her, it was my business, because it was done in my house. She bid me to mind my house, and not busy myself with that. Then I told her, that she must abide by the consequence of it. Then he went for a constable and she was taken up.</p>

            . One of them call'd Will, will you give us a pint of beer, I answer'd I would. We went in at Mrs Jones's, which was not above twenty yards from where they were standing. I never stopp'd in the street with them a moment; nor was I with them in any other house. I call'd for a pint of beer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240014"></xptr> and we drank once a-piece. I pull'd out some half-pence to pay, and by chance pull'd out a 3 l. 12 s. piece. The prisoner snatch'd it out of my hand, and said she would look at it. She said she had not seen such a piece of money a good while. I did not pretend to catch hold of it at that time, thinking her honest. She went out at the door; I expected she would return and bring it me. She came in again; I asked her for it; she denied having it, and said she knew nothing of it. I thought she was joking, asked for it again, and said, Do not play about with the money and lose it; it was a great deal of money to me. At last she began to swear that she knew nothing of it, and did not know who had got it; she got up, I catch'd hold of her, and stopp'd her from going out. The people of the house wanted me to search her. She swore vengeance bitterly against any person that should offer to touch a rag of her cloaths; and said, she had a sore breast, and let any body put their hand in her bosom if they dare. I did not search her, but got a constable: when he came he said he had no business to search her, but took her in charge. She was carried that night to Clerkenwell-Bridewell, and from thence to Justice Welch. I heard her examined. She denied having it. The Justice ask'd her, how she came to offer to produce it, in case I would give her a shilling? but I do not remember her answer. I never saw my money since.</p>

I said, Do you think I never was mistress of a crown in my life? I went out to buy a pennyworth of oysters, the woman opened me five; I ask'd her to change me that piece of money, she offered to throw it in the kennel; then she took it up again, and a man took it out of my hand and look'd at it.

            . I live in Black-friers; but I did live in Field-lane; and have known the prisoner nine years; I never knew her to wrong any body in my life; I have shared fish with her at the Gate.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by sharing of fish?</p>
               <p>Barley. That is, putting our money together to buy fish. I always took her to be an industrious body.</p>

             Neither. I sell fruit in the New-Market; I have known her fifteen or sixteen years; I have sold her many bushels of fruit; I never knew her to wrong any body in my life; she always paid me justly.</p>

            . I have known her about seven years; I deal in fruit; I never knew her to wrong man, woman, or child, but to labour daily and hourly, as other poor women do.</p>

            , the servant, up. I left about 2 l. 10 s. in halfpence and pence in my desk, tied up in an apron; there was at least 15 s. in silver in the till, consisting of sixpences, shillings, and a crown piece - a bag, containing 7 s. or 8 s. worth of farthings was in or on the desk. I got up about ten minutes past six o'clock on the 1st of March, and received information, went down into the parlour behind the shop, and found that door locked, but a door which opens into the shop from the cellar had the staple wrenched off. I went into the cellar, and found the flap outside, under the window in the yard, had been lifted up, they could get down there, and then into the shop; the flap was down the night before, but I cannot say whether it was fastened; there had been some things on the flap overnight, which were removed in the morning, and there appeared footmarks on the wall. About eleven o'clock that morning I went with Attfield and Garton to Providence-place, Novascotia-gardens, Bethnal-green, and found the prisoners sitting together in the same room; it is a mile and a quarter from my house. The officers said they had come about a robbery, and asked if there was any money in the house which they owned - Evans said there was; they asked if there was any copper; he said Yes, there were ten papers of copper. Garton handed my apron to me. The officers asked if there were any farthings; Evans said Yes, there was, and pointed to a hat-box on the mantle piece in the next room. When we had found all the property, Taylor said,</p>
               <p>"You need not go any further, Mr. Knights must know what he has lost." Evans's wife was in the room. My shop door was found open in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Evans said the papers of copper were there - A. Yes. I am not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070007"></xptr>sure that Taylor said anything about the money - he said I must know what I had lost.</p>

I got up about half-past six o'clock; my master was up first.

            . I am a constable. I examined the prosecutor's premises, and saw chips on the wall, as if it had been done by the toes of a person getting over. I went with Mr. Knights to No. 5, Providence-place - the prisoners and Evans's wife were sitting by the fire-side, drinking rum; Mr. Knights gave them in charge on suspicion of robbing his house. I searched Taylor, and found a crown piece, 11 s. 6 d. in silver, and 1 s. 5 d. in copper; the prosecutor produced a bottle of blacking from the mantle piece or the table. Garton and the prosecutor looked round, and handed me two more bottles of blacking. I went into the adjoining room, and behind a door-way found ten 5 s. papers of copper on the window-ledge, and under the bed I found 6 s. 9 1/2 d. in copper, in a basket. I found a crow-bar in the room. The prisoners were tied together - Garton asked them if there were any farthings, and I think Evans pointed to a band-box over the mantle piece; I went there, and found 6 s. 9 d. in farthings. Garton asked if there was anything else in the house which they owned; Taylor said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Knights ought to know best what he has lost;" Evans said to him,</p>
               <p>"Hold your tongue, for it is all my property." I compared the crowbar with some dents in the door post of the cellar; it tallied with them, and with some dents on the desk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know that Evans lives there, and Taylor quite in a different place - A. Taylor lives near our office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call that a crow-bar - A. It is called a jemmy, and is used for breaking open small drawers or boxes.</p>

Evans had the apron on his person. I found two bottles of blacking on the mantle piece, and in the front room I found 4 s. 7 d. in a tea-caddy.

            . I am a constable. I received information, and went on the 14th of October, and found two asses in a shed in Gibraltar-walk, Bethnal-green; I waited there till the evening, when the two prisoners, and another person came to the shed, and began to feed the asses: I went in and asked who they belonged to, and each of the prisoners owned one - I asked who the third boy was, and he said he merely came to see them; I then asked where they got them, and they said they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230056"></xptr>bought them in Smithfield on Friday last - I asked what they gave for them, and Belnap said he gave 7s. for his, and Bracken said he gave 10s. for his - I told them I suspected they were stolen, and took them to the office.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I have known the prisoner these two or three months; I was at Smithfield with Bracken on the 10th of October - I did not see the other prisoner there; I saw Mr. Sturgeon there, whom I had seen before - I saw him buy three asses that day; I do not know whether Bracken saw him buy them - a drover, who lives near Mr. Sturgeon's, took the drove of asses out of the market; Mr. Sturgeon told me to mind them - I went with them down to the Globe; Bracken was there, but the other was not - we staid there till about half-past eight o'clock, when we went to the field, and he took out one donkey, and I took another; we took them to the top of Hoxton and put them into a field - the next morning we went to Belnap's in Old-street-road, and told him we had been and taken two donkeys, which Mr. Sturgeon had been buying, and we had stolen two out of his drove: Belnap had the smallest and paid me 7s. for it - they told me they took the other round Hackney and Hotherton; Belnap offered 13s. for the other, but Bracken would not take it, and he kept it - I believe it was found in the stable; I told the same story to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you always told the same story? A. Yes; I have been in the House of Correction - they put me there for fear I should not come here; I was never there, nor in a Court of Justice before - my mother was at the Police-office; she did not tell me what to say - she did not say "I say Sam, mind what I told you, when you went down yonder, mind you say 'Mind E. B. B.'" nor any thing to that effect, either there or at any other place.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. STURGEON. Q. What did you give for the asses? A. 18s. for one, and 20s. for the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman—on the evening of 7th October, I took a lodging at the Neptune coffee-house—I had been there many times before—between 9 and 10 o'clock that night, I was in a public-house; I can't say the name of the place; it was near Wellclose-square—the prisoner</p>

               <p>was there—I had been drinking a little, but I was not drunk; I had my senses about me—the prisoner kept looking at me, and I kept looking at him—I went out, and lost my way—I got into a back street, and did not know where I was—the prisoner came up close behind me—I recognised him as the man I had seen in the public-house just before—I asked him if he would show me where the Neptune coffee-house was—he said he would provided I would stand a pot of beer—I said I would—he said, "You had best look and see that your money is all right"—I said, "My money is all right"—he said, "I will go no further with you till you see that your money is all right, or you may think that I have robbed you"—I then took my money out, and was just going to count it, when he took the lot—I had a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and some silver; I reckon about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner ran away with the money—he dropped a coin, and I stopped to pick it up—I was close behind him then—I then ran after him, but he got away—as I was standing, and the people were asking me what was the matter, the prisoner came up and asked me what was the matter—as soon as I saw him I said, "You know very well what is the matter; you are the man that has got my money"—he said, "Me; why I never saw you before"—I took hold of him by his guernsey—he had on a white duck <hi rend="italic">jumper</hi> before that, but he had thrown it off—he said, "Leave go of me, and I will go with you"—I said, "You have tricked me once, and I don't want you to trick me again"—he then flung me down, but I hung on to him till the police came—he was kicking me in all parts when the policeman came up—I have no doubt whatever about the prisoner being the man that robbed me.</p>

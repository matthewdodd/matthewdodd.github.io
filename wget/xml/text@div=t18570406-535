                  </hi>. I am captain of the sloop <hi rend="italic">Cunliff</hi>, of Hull, and reside at Hull. On Thursday, 12th March, I was in Greenwich, and met a woman, I went with her to a room, and gave her some money to fetch some drink—before she went out I put my watch under the pillow, and while she was out the prisoners came in and said that it was their room, and demanded half a crown for it—I said that they would get it—I missed my watch, and saw Davis go to the bed and take it from under the pillow; he gave it to me, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. extra for giving me the watch—he wanted some drink, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more for some—the drink did not come, and I said, "Never mind, show me the road to Greenwich Hospital, and I will go;" for I found myself in bad quarters, and wanted to get out; the prisoners went out with me, and they picked up another party, whom I cannot identify—it was then past 12 o'clock; it was half past 11 when I went to the house—they seemed to be acquainted with the third man—they pointed the road out to me, and I had just left them a step or two when I felt a blow on my head, and I felt a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my watch at the same instant—I did not see who struck me, but Davis came, and said, "What is the matter? what is the matter?"—I said, "You know what is the matter," and they all ran away—nobody else was near to me at the time to hit me but one of the three men—I screamed out "Police!" and afterwards saw them in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Davis.</hi> You came to the house I was lodging in with a female. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, I do not know whether you were lodging there—I did not tell you that I was robbed when I saw you—I missed my watch, but they came upon me on a sudden—you did not search for it, you went straight to the pillow and took it—I had no beer or rum—when I had given you the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for drink, and you had gone out for it, the woman came back with the beer—you were not in the room two or three minutes with me and the woman—I did not say that if I had not found my watch I would have had all that were in the house taken, nor that the woman had done it too cleverly to take my guard from round my neck—I had some drink with her when she came in—you did not come into the house again; but when I went down to the door you were there, it was five or ten minutes after I parted with you in the room—there was no other female in the room, but I saw another—I did not give her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took no rum—the woman came in just after you went out, and afterwards the other came—I did not see her bring any rum—you</p>

               <p>asked me to have some rum—there was nobody but me in the room when I came in—there was not a little short girl who I gave 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to, for some drink; I gave it to you—I had some half and half out of a can—I do not remember seeing any glass—I said that if the woman had taken my watch and chain she had done it very cleverly, but I believe I put them under the pillow myself—I was perfectly sober—I did not accuse the woman—I did not ask you to direct me to the hospital ship, but to Greenwich Hospital—you took me to the bottom of a dark court and directed me to Green<lb></lb>wich Hospital, wished me good night, and left me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which road did he direct you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am a stranger and do not know; but the police said that it was the contrary road—I only know the main streets—I have not got the hat which I had on—it was a sharp blow; my head bled a good deal, here is the cut to be seen yet—there was a hole made in my hat—I saw nothing in the hands of any of them—it was not a blow with a fist; it was something which came very sharp—it did not take away my senses or knock me down—Davis caught me by the hand and asked me what was the matter—they were then close to me, and then they all ran away together—I met the police about twenty yards off, in the same street, and walked with them to the spot—while I was talking to them, Davis walked by and I gave him in custody—that was not a quarter of an hour afterwards—the police went to the house with me and found M'Carthy there—I waited outside the door—the third man might be a little taller than M'Carthy, but not a great deal—I did not show my head to the doctor, but I showed it to the police—here is the cut (<hi rend="italic">showing it</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">M'Carthy.

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 373). I was on duty in Lamb Lane, Greenwich, and heard cries of "Police!" and "Murder!"—I went to the spot and saw the prosecutor there—he asked me to feel his head—I looked at it by my lamp, and saw blood running very freely on to his coat—the cut was about an inch and a half long—he said that he had received it of a man, but he could not tell who, as he had been with three, and did not know which gave him the blow—he took me to the place—I went up to the corner of Skelton Street, and while talking to another constable, Davis came up, and Birch said, "That is one; I insist on your taking him into custody"—I took him, and left him with two other constables while Birch and I went to the house in Tranter's Buildings, Roan Street, Greenwich—I went up stairs and M'Carthy was in bed—I told him to get up and dress—he asked what I wanted; I told him to come down and I would tell him—he came down, and as soon as Birch saw him he said, "That is the other, take him into custody"—I knew the third man very well; but Birch could not swear positively to him; and he was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>

I told her, and she called him <hi rend="italic">abuseful</hi> names and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him out; he asked me to direct him to the hos<lb></lb>pital ship, and I directed him to the <hi rend="italic">Dreadnought</hi>; I know nothing more about it.</p>

Davis said, "Be sure, search yourself;" he said, "I have;" Davis said, "Have you been to bed;" he said, "I have been lying down there in the bed;" Davis looked under the pillow and found it and gave it to him, and he gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they fetched some half and half and rum, and the woman came with some more rum in a bottle; Davis told her that he had accused her, and she would have nothing more to do with him; he asked Davis to show him the way to the hospital ship, and I saw no more of him till a policeman came into the room where I was, and told me to get up and dress myself.</p>

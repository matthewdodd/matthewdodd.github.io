I was alarmed by a neighbour telling me that I had been robbed. I immediately went to the door. I went into the street, and saw a quantity of people. Looking on the ground as I went along with them, I saw two parcels, one of knives and the other of forks. I knew they were mine by my mark that was on them. I took them from the ground, and gave them to a neighbour, and I went in pursuit of the thief. When I got to the top of the street, a witness that is here had him in his possession. We immediately took took him before the magistrate, and he sent him before your Lordship.</p>

            . On Saturday morning, about nine o'clock, I saw two lads by the prosecutor's. I live opposite to the prosecutor's. The other told the prisoner to go in. The other boy went in first and this boy went in afterwards. The prisoner came out, and seeing me cross the way, he dropped a paper parcel he had brought out and ran. I ran after him, and called stop thief, and a young man a sailor stopped him, and I gave him in charge of the officer who is here.</p>

I am a coal merchant, of 1, Seymour Place, Lewisham—on Monday, 19th November, I locked up the house at 11 o'clock and retired at 12 o'clock—I locked the doors myself and left the key of the bedroom door inside, and the key of the office on the mantelpiece—I bad the key of the office drawer in my pocket; there was a canvas bag in that drawer containing about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—I had about 5/. in a purse in my pocket—I saw them all safe before I went to bed—when I awoke in the morning I found the door ajar, I got up and found my trousers, which I had placed loosely on a chair, rolled up and the pockets empty—I went to open the front door and my lodger brought me the keys that had been in my pocket the night before, and also the key of my bedroom door, which she said she had found on the mat—the key that I had left on my mantelpiece was standing in the office door and the door unlocked; the drawer in the office was unlocked, but shut, and I missed the canvas bag with the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—the prisoner was employed by me about three times a week for an hour of a morning—he came to me on the Friday previous to the robbery and asked me to recom<lb></lb>mend him to another coal merchant where he was applying for work, and I gave him a note, as I knew a little of him; he had only been three weeks in Lewisham—about 9 o'clock on the night of the 19th, I went out to post some letters, and I saw a boy who I thought was him standing by some palings at the corner—when he was in custody he said in the presence of the police officers at the station that he had got into the house at night and secreted himself under the bed or sofa, and had committed the robbery, and that he was <hi rend="italic">very</hi> sorry and would not do it</p>

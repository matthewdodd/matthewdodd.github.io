                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer W</hi>). On Saturday morning, 6th January, I was on Brixton Hill, going towards London—I met Christian and Webb at the top of Brixton Hill, close to the milestone, between the Crown and Scepter and the Telegraph—it was about 5.50—Christian asked me the way to London Bridge, and the way to Croydon, and how far it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201290051"></xptr>
               <p>—Webb asked me which was the nearest railway station, and I told him Brixton—I told them it was about four miles to London Bridge and about seven to Croydon—I went across the road after they left me, and took off my great coat and cape—I then followed them—I met two constables, Trigg and Godden, and I spoke to them—I saw a carriage going towards Croydon, and I jumped up behind, and just before Streatham Railway Station I met the three prisoners—I had passed them before I got off the carriage, and then I came back and met them—they were all three walking together—Anderson left the other two just before they came to me—he had no hat on—Anderson went across the road, and Christian and Webb walked up to me—I collared Christian by the neck, and Webb ran away—I sung out "Stop thief!" as loud as I could, and the two constables came up—I said "Spring the rattles," and they did so—I said "They have gone down the railway cutting"—they went down the cutting, and I held Christian until the other constable brought back Anderson—I said to Christian "What have you got in your pocket?" he said "Nothing"—I put my hand in his left-hand trousers pocket and took out a knife, and these sugar tongs and spoon out of the other pocket—I said "What have you got in this, pocket?"—he said "You are not going to search me here"—we had a severe struggle—I called out, and the railway-man came to my assistance, and I took this toast-rack out of his pocket—Anderson was brought back, and I identified him as the man who had just left—they were taken to the Brixton Police Station—I after<lb></lb>wards went down the railway-cutting, but I did not find anything there then—I did not know the men before—from enquiries and information I received, I went to Webb's house, 70 1/2, Goulston Street, Whitechapel, on Thursday night last—I saw him and said "I am going to take you for being concerned with two others, committed for trial, in breaking into the dwelling-house of Mr. Cosins, at Clapham Park—he said "That is a bit more you have got up for me"—I took him to Brixton Station and found a piece of paper with the name of Solomons on it, which is Anderson's proper name—I knew him by the name of Solomons, from this photograph—he was convicted in that name—I have no doubt Webb is the man—I gave a description of him.</p>

I have been a detective about two years—I should not have said anything about the previous conviction if I had not been asked about this paper—I got to the Streatham Station about a minute or two before the men came up—it was dark and rather windy—when they came up I was about fifty or sixty yards from the station, and I saw the three prisoners coming up—Anderson crossed the road, but the other two came close to me—I am sure Anderson was the third man—he was about a dozen yards from me, and he had no hat on—I had never seen him before in my life—he did not come nearer to me than a ten or twelve yards—it was Webb and Christian who came close to me, and I took hold of Christian and called "Stop thief"—that was directly after Anderson crossed the road—I can swear that he was the man that crossed the road—I saw his face—he was taken into the custody down the railway cutting—Anderson and Webb ran down there, one just ahead</p>

I was—twenty or thirty yards away then—he collared Christian, and the other two ran away down the railway cutting—I ran down after them, and I saw Anderson about 150 yards down the cutting—he was walking, and he turned and came back to meet me—he had no hat—he said "One has run by and knocked my hat off"—I turned my light on his face, and said I should take him—I took him back to Parslow, and he said he was one of them—I afterwards received a sugar basin from a railway porter, and he showed me where it was found—it was about twenty yards from where I took Anderson—I don't know what became of the other man—Godden was with me at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Webb's landlord, at the house where he lodged, 95, Bethnal Green Road—I knew he had a shop somewhere in Petticoat Lane—I only know he has been lodging with me, and that he always comes home of a night—I am the last up at night and the first in the morning—he usually went out between 9 and 10 o'clock—he never went out before 6 o'clock in the morning in the month of January—he did not sleep there the Saturday before he was taken, but he was not absent any other night, to my knowledge—I served him with his breakfast—with the exception of that Saturday I have not missed serving him that I am aware of—I can't say whether he had his breakfast there on 6th January or not, because I have so many lodgers.</p>

                  </hi>. The barber's shop that has been spoken of belongs to me—the prisoner Webb rented it from me—I always knew him as Joe Solomons—I was surprised when I heard his name was Webb.</p>

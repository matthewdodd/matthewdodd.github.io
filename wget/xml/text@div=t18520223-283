                  </hi>. I am ostler, at the Two Brewers, at Ponder's End. On 11th Feb. I had in my charge three horses, one belonging to John Wren, one to Joseph Wren, and one to Mr. Benham—I had racked up these horses about 8 o'clock, and about 9 I was sent on an errand about 100 yards off, and as I was coming back I saw John Wren's mare outside the trough, about 22 yards from the stable door—it had a halter, and the prisoner had hold of the mare—I went to the mare, put my hand on it, and said, "Halloo, old girl, what are you doing here?"—the prisoner pushed me away, and said, "What have you to do with her"—he said Joseph Wren wanted her—I said, "You have made a mistake; you have not got Joseph Wren's mare"—I collared him with one hand, and took the mare with the other—the prisoner got away and ran; I called "Stop him!"—a man took him, and I went and held him till the policeman came—the prisoner wanted me to let him go, and he said</p>

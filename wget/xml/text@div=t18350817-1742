Clark told me that the prisoner had secreted some lace under her shawl—I saw her confused, and the prisoner asked her to go into a private room with her, which she did—I waited outside on the stairs and Clark gave me the lace—here are seventy-seven yards and half—it is worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). A little before 7, on 24th March, I was in the lobby of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> office when the prisoner came in—Inspector Harrison was there—the prisoner said to me, "This is a bad job"—I said, "What?"—he said, "This fire"—I said, "I believe you dis<lb></lb>covered the fire"—he said, "Yes, I wish I had gone away at my proper time, and I should have been out of thismess"—I said, "Were you here after your time"—he said, "No, I mean I ought to have gone to post some letters; I had the letters in my hand, when I saw a female go up the court; I went to see who she was, when I heard a pane of glass break; I looked up and saw smoke coming out of thewindow; I called the fireman, and we nearly put the fire out, and now they blame me for it"—I said, "Who blames you"—he said, "They suspect me for it"—about quarter of an hour afterwards, Kemp and Latham were brought in, and hearing what they had to say, I said to the prisoner, "You hear what Kemp and the other man say, that they saw you coming down from the paper room at a quarter past 4"—he said, "I was not there after 2 o'clock"—I then took him to the station.</p>

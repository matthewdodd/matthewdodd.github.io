I described her person to the officer; he took her by any description. I have never seen my watch again.</p>

            . I am a watchman in St. Martin's-le-grand I know the prisoner by sight; I used to see the prisoner in St. Martin's-le-grand; she has passed me twenty or thirty times of a night, frequently. On the 3rd of June, I was calling past twelve, I met the prisoner and the prosecutor, they were going up New-rents; I was coming down; I put my lauthorn up, and looked at her; nobody else was near but the prisoner and the prosecutor. Seeing him a country looking man, I thought if he had any property he would lose it. I am sure the prisoner is the woman he was with. After calling the hour, I went to my box; I met the prosecutor; he said he had been robbed of his watch; I said, was it the woman I saw you walking with; he said, yes. The next night the prisoner was taken by the constable.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BLANCH. I am a constable. In consequence of the description the prosecutor gave me of the person that robbed him. On the next night I apprehended the prisoner. I told her the charge; she said she knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please you, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the door of a house in Newgate-street to shelter myself from the rain. Mr. Blanch said he wanted me. I immediately went to the watchhouse with him, where I remained two hours. Mr. Blanch came into the watchhouse, with a young man; he pointed me out to him; he said, that is the woman that robbed you; he then said to the watchman, did not you see this woman and man together just before the time he said he was robbed. The watchman said I was the woman that he had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060052"></xptr>with the prosecutor. The prosecutor solemnly declared he never saw me before. The prosecutor then came to me and asked me for the watch, or one pound five shillings. As I had never seen the watch, I thought it very hard I should pay for a thing I never had seen. I knew nothing of the watch, nor ever did I see the prosecutor before.</p>

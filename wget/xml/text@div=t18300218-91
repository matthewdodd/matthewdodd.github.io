On the 27th of January, a little after six o'clock in the evening, I came down stairs from having my tea, and as I passed the counter I saw his hand in the till - he looked frightened, and I did not take my eyes from him for a minute or two - I then went up before the counter, and he laid down four shillings and three sixpences on the counter; I caught hold of him, and sent him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How many shopmen have you? A. Two; they put money into the till, and take change out - I am not in a large way of business; he had served the last customer, and given change for sixpence - there was about 2l. in the till.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA CLEMENTS. I am an inspector of the Police. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, and said he was very sorry for what he had done - this money was delivered to me by his master; I went and searched the prisoner's box - I found some other things, and some money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say he said he was sorry for what he had done? A. Yes; his master did not say if he would tell he would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am very sorry for it - if my master will forgive me this time I will not do it again.</p>

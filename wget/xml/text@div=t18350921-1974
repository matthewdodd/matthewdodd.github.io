                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, and live in Great Marylebone-street. The prisoner has been in my employment, and left on the 11th of August—he had been with me from the 13th of April—I have a shop which is under the same roof as the dwelling-house—on the 11th of August he did not return to his work—I was not aware of his going—I expected him as usual—I saw him last about five o'clock on the Tuesday evening—I did not miss any thing that evening, but on the following morning when I took out my watches, I missed a gold watch-case, and pillar plate—I saw it again at the Marylebone Police-office, on Wednesday, the 24th or 25th—I had not given him permission to take any thing form my shop at that time—I said a week before to him and the other men, that I would not allow any one to take any porperty out of my shop hereafter—I found the watch-case in the possession of the pawnbroker, and the pillar plate was attached to it—the watch is my own manufacture—It was a second-hand case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went in pursuit of the prisoner on the 22nd of August, as Mr. Palmer applied to me—I found him at No, 13. Fisher street, Red-lion-square, at half-past cleven o'clock at night—he was at a person's named Boume, on the second floor—I asked him if he knew Mr. Palmer—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he knew any thing about a gold watch-case of Plamer's—he said Mr. Palmer would be here directly—I then told him he must consider himself my prisoner, and must go with me—I took him to the station-house in Marylebone-lane; but, previous to that, I searched him in the room—I was searching his waistcoat pocket, when he put his hand in his trowsers pocket, and drew out this ticker and this pillar-plate—I have had them both in my posscssion ever since—as I took him to the station-house, he told me he had taken it, and that some body had swindled him out of some money, and he had taken it to make up some money.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employment of Mr. Palmer in August last. The prisoner left his service on the 11th of August—I did not know he was going to quit—before he went away I observed him roll up a gold watch-case in a piece of paper, and put it into his pocket—there was a watch-frams inside it—these are the two articles—I said nothing to him—I had never heard Mr. Palmer say any thing to him about the case—I had heard him say that it was to go to Mr. Pool's father to be done—he was the man that was to do part of the work: but he did not say that the prisoner was to take it—Mr. Palmer had said there were things irregular, and not in their proper places; and he desired that none of the men should take things out of the shop—he said so in the prisoner's presence,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do not you know there were very confidential pro<lb></lb>ceedings between the prisoner and Mr. Palmer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he trusted him a great deal more than an ordinary workman—he used to buy some few things if Mr. Palmer and pay by instalments—the prisoner lived in Lan<lb></lb>caster-street—I have been there more than once—I cannot say the number—h always went by the name of Pool at our house—he never mentioned to me that he was under a temporary inconvenience by not being paid his wages.</p>

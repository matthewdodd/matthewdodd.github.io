I said, I knew him very well; he said he was his son, and asked me to clean and repair a quadrant which he had on board; I said, I would: he said he was going to Fish-street-hill, to see a captain, and he asked me to let him have a quadrant with him, and a weather glass; I asked him which? he said a thermometer; he wished to have two sent with him, for the captain to chuse: my wife came into the shop; he asked her in a very hearty way, how she did, and was glad to see her; and asked her if she liked ship beef? she said, she could not say but she did, if it was good; and he desired the boy might be sent with him, with the instruments for the captain to look at, and he would send her some ship beef; I saw him go backwards to the kitchen, to my wife; my wife came and told me he wanted the boy to have a great coat on, and an handkerchief; the boy had no great coat; I said put him on a close coat of mine; which he had put on, with a handkerchief of mine.

               <p>I am going in sixteen. I live with Mr. Barnett: I remember the prisoner being at our house on the 14th of November; that was on a Saturday. The prisoner desired my master to go with him; I do not know for what purpose; my master said he was busy, and could not; and he told him I should go with him: I did not know where I was to go; the prisoner took me to the water side, and hired a boat; and when we got some distance from the stairs, the prisoner asked me if I had some halfpence in my pocket; I said, I had not; then he asked the waterman to trust him till he came again; he said, he could not; then he said he must have something in hand: then he said he would be down in a few minutes: the waterman said, cannot I go to your father's with you? he said, no, his father would be angry at so many coming: the waterman told him, he must have something in hand first; and the prisoner asked him if he would have his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240012"></xptr>watch? the waterman said, yes, he did not care what it was, so as it was worth the ferry over; so he stood up in the boat and took hold of the chain of his watch, and did not offer to pull it out, and he sat down again; and when we came on the other side of the water, he bid me get out, and go on, and he would follow me; I got out: and the waterman got out of the boat immediately and would not let him go unless he had something in hand; but the prisoner got out and told the waterman he had a chest to be carried over to Iron-gate, and he should return in a few minutes; the waterman still said he must have something in hand till he returned again; then the prisoner called to me, and told me to stop; and he took one of the small weather glasses, the thermometer, from under my arm, to give to the waterman; and he told me he took the number of the boat, and knew the waterman very well.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he take the thermometer by your consent? - Yes; he told me to follow him; and he took me into a publick-house, in <placeName id="t17900224-5-crimeloc35">Tooley-street</placeName>

He took the thermometer and coat from under my arm, and he told me to wait a few minutes, and he should return: he took the things and went out of the publick-house; when he got past the window I went out to see which way he went, and lost sight of him, and did not see him till the 15th of January following, about four in the afternoon, in East Smithfield: I met him, and followed him; and he went into the Cock alehouse, Cock-alley, East Smithfield; I waited two minutes, and he did not come out; and I went home to my master's, and got our young man to go with me: he was coming out as we got there; we followed him; he saw us, and ran into a stable, in White's-yard, Rosemary-lane; the young man took him there; he got away several times; he was very obstropulous: nobody came to assist: he got away from the young man; I followed him, and laid hold of him several times; and he got away; at last we got a constable, and took him; just opposite Well-street, a constable lived: I do not recollect what I said to him: the young man,

            . I live at No. 13, Hoxton Old-town, about sixty paces from Miss Tooth's house - I belong to the Ordinance. On Friday morning, the 8th of August, between six and seven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners and another near Miss Tooth's house; they were in a suspicious manner consulting together, and in a short time I saw Kingston entering Miss Tooth's garden-gate - the other two were watching, one looking up one street, and another up another, and when a person came up one of the streets they gave an alarm to Kingston, who came out again - I saw Kingston enter into the gate repeatedly in that manner, and at length, when it was getting near seven o'clock, the three had some consultation together, and then they all entered the gate - I then had no doubt that they were had characters, and I went to a neighbour or two to assist me to apprehend them, but I could get no person; I took a stick with me and went to take them myself - I went down High-street and into Old-street-road, but before that I saw them all three coming out of the gate, and the prisoner Styring had the desk - I ran down the street towards the square, and met them coming out of the square; Styring was behind the other two, and he was carrying the desk - I said to him "Where are you going with that;" he made no reply, but turned round and threw it at my person - I turned my hand and left it in the road, and pursued him; I cried Stop thief! and several other persons ran in pursuit with me - I did not loose sight of them till they got to Shoreditch, and before they had been out of my sight a minute, I saw Kingston in custody; a gentleman took up the desk and carried it to his own house- I went to Miss Tooth's house, and so did the gentleman who had the desk; when they went in at the garden-gate it appeared to be on a latch, and Kingston lifted up the latch - I did not see them go into the house, but when I got into the house I saw the window up, and the mark of a man's shoes inside and outside of the parlour window; I had never seen either of the prisoners before to my knowledge - I saw Styring in custody near the Police-office; he was taken to a different watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner STYRING. Q. If he saw the mud on the window, why did he not state it at the office? A. It escaped my memory - I should not have thought of it now if his Lordship had not asked the question.</p>

            . I was servant to Miss Tooth. On Friday morning, the 8th of August, I got up at half-past five o'clock - she has five persons in the house, and twentysix or twenty-seven pupils; I went into the front parlour and opened the shutters - the windows were closed when I left them and went into the kitchen, which lics backwards, and is down one stair from the parlour; I heard a noise, but did not know what it was - I then heard the front door bell ring; in consequence of that, I went to the parlour - a young woman informed me there had been thieves in the house: I missed one of the desks, and saw the windows thrown wide open - I am not certain whether they had been fastened, or merely shut down; as I had not fastened the shutters at night, I am sure they were shut down that morning - I did not observe the seat of the window at that time, but did afterwards; the blinds were closed when I left them, but they were then thrown back - the desk was brought in by some one, and it was in the hall when I came down: it belonged to a young lady named Strong.</p>

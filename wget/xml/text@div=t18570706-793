                  </hi>. I was in the service of the male prisoner, at No. 27, Cable Street, Minories. I only went there for one day's work—he occupied the shop, parlour, and kitchen—the shop was used for ginger beer and penny ices, and the back parlour for shaving, as a barber's shop—I was only engaged for one day, it was Monday, 18th May—I should think the stock in trade was not worth altogether 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the whole property there—the female prisoner was also living there—I think she is his wife—I saw them that day speaking together in their own language, which I do not under<lb></lb>stand, and he was writing a few lines—I believe they are Germans—she had a bottle in her hand, with which she went out, between 12 and 1 o'clock—it appeared to me as if it was a pint bottle, with a label on it—it was a glass bottle—I saw her come back again—I was in the shop at the time, and she said to him, "I could not get it"—he then went down into the kitchen, brought up his coat and hat, and said to John King, "You take charge of this place till I come back, I will not be very long"—King is a seafaring man—the prisoners both went out together, taking the bottle with them—the female prisoner had it—it was the same bottle I have been speaking of—they returned in about half an hour, and I saw the bottle with him when he came back—it was not the same bottle that I saw them go out with, it was a smaller sized one—I could not see the size—it was a glass bottle—they came in both together—he said, "I wish you would go and bring me a jug of water down to the kitchen"—I did so—I brought the jug of water into the kitchen, and in the kitchen I saw a lot of cross lines and clothes hanging on them—I saw him shaking the same bottle about the</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer attached to the Well close Fire Brigade station. I went on the 18th to Cable Street where the fire was—I had some difficulty in getting into the kitchen in consequence of the dense smoke arising from it—when I did get in I found the greater part of the dresser was consumed—the rest of the things right round the kitchen were burning at the same time—the dresser was fixed to the wall in the usual way—I cannot say exactly how it was fixed, but it was a fixture in the house—I could not move it—I tried—there were lines lying in various parts of the kitchen as they had fallen, and parts were hanging to nails in the wall—there was linen partly on the lines, and partly off, also burnt—there was no fire in the grate—there was a very strong smell of a spirit of some description, and gas escaping with it—I should say from the smell that the spirit was most probably naphtha, but the mixture of gas made it doubtful—it was very strong indeed—nothing but spirit would cause such a dense smoke to arise—the gas was turned on at the meter—the pipe was melted—the pipe comes down through the flooring, and along the ceiling—that pipe had been pulled down—the staples which held it were pulled out—they must have been pulled out by some one—I found no other aper<lb></lb>ture through which the gas could come, but that which was burnt—the pipe had melted and fallen—about a foot or a little more of the lead remained at the meter, and there the gas was coming through—the effect of pulling down the pipe would be to bring it into immediate contact with the burning materials—the window was closed—there was no entrance to the kitchen but by the door—after the fire was extinguished I noticed the quantity of goods on the premises—I should say the value of the things when in a good state was not more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and somewhere thereabouts.</p>

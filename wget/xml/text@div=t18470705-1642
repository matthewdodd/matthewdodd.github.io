               <p>26th of June, about two o'clock in the day. I was in the kitchen—the prisoner was there eating his dinner when I went into the room, he was giving some of the peas away—I asked him to give me some—he called me a b—Irish cow, and said he could not give me any; and if I did not go away, he would knock my b—* * *—I said I would talk to him some time before I would express myself in that manner—he said, "You b—w—, if you don't go out of here, I will knock your b—guts out;" and with that he struck me two or three blows in the face with his fist—I had not done anything to him before that, except asking him for some peas—I saw him get up again to hit me, and I screamed, "Murder"—my nose bled—I then made towards the door—there were three women in the room, two of them went away, they were afraid of the prisoner and his companions—they assisted me when I screamed out, "Murder," by collecting about him, and pushing him from me—when he found I had got towards the door, he turned round to the table, and took up the knife which he had been eating his dinner with—he had left the table to hit me, and left the knife—he went back for it—he did not have it when he struck me first—he could reach it by just making one stride—when I made towards the door he gave me a gash with the knife in my fore head—I did not go against the knife—I was going away from him—I fell, and the blood fell in torrents—he then wanted to go away as well as I could understand—I said I would follow him till I gave him in charge—he said if I would follow him he would rip my b—guts out—I was taken to Mr. Odling, a surgeon—he dressed the wound—I am quite sure I did nothing to the prisoner, except asking him for peas—I had seen him before, but never spoke to him in my life.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, in the Borough. On the 26th of June, Johnson was brought to me with a wound on the left side of the face, near the eye—it seemed an incised wound by its bleeding so freely—the edges were very clean cut—it was quite on the ridge of the bone—it might possibly be done from some other cause—it was a kind of cut—it healed kindly, and a wound from a bruise does not heal so kindly, it gener<lb></lb>rally separates—the skin was separated about an inch—it appeared to be rather deep—it bled very freely all over her clothes—they were saturated with blood from the top to the bottom—a bruise would not have that effect—there was a bruise independent of that, and a black eye.</p>

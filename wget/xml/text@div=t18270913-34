I put the money in then, and locked the portmantean I am certain; my room door was not locked. I went out of the house about eight o'clock that evening, and returned about ten, but did not go to my portmanteau. Next day, about a quarter-past seven in the evening, I went to my portmanteau, and found it locked as I had left it - my clothes were not taken, but the money was gone - a false key must have been used. I missed the money and notes - the sovereigns were wrapped up in the notes. I had no acquaintance with the prisoner, and never told him the money was there. I did not know the numbers of the notes, nor had I any writing on them; since the prisoner has been taken I have seen three notes in the hands of the Bank clerk, which I have been told are the same; I had received them from Messrs. Jones, Lloyd and Co. I had an order on them for 22l. odd - Mr. Gallatly paid me the money. I am certain I had these notes from them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you certain you did not make any payment from the time you received the notes till you went to the Bank of England? A. I made payments, but did not pay away any of the notes I am certain. I had seven sovereigns and 8s. 1d.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How many persons call on you in the course of the day to receive gold for notes? A. I dare say full fifty. I should not know every person. I frequently notice one more than another - I should know many. I am not mistaken in his case for several reasons, the notes were presented to me, I told him he must get them exchanged, and referred him to the office, and saw him several times. I told him to put his name on them, and he put it on all three. I told him it was not necessary to put it on more than one - he wrote "

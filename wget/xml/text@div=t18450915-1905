                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. John Daniel Delaney, a pawnbroker, at Woolwich. During the week preceding the 5th of Sept., I was in the shop—I saw the prisoner come there several times—on Tues<lb></lb>day, the 2nd of Sept., she came to the shop as usual, to inquire about two cloaks which she said had been pawned there—I said we had searched the premises and the books, and we had not got them, and I did not believe she came for anything but to steal, as she had attempted to steal a gown on the Saturday previous—I left the prisoner in the shop, and went into the warehouse—when I came back she had just gone out—I went after her, and overtook her—I found on her this shawl, which is the pro<lb></lb>perty of my master—when the prisoner came it was lying on the sale<lb></lb>board in the shop, which is for the purpose of exposing the goods to view—the prisoner had been standing at the end of the board, having a child in her arms, she sometimes asked to be allowed to sit on the end of this board where the goods were kept—I took the shawl from her, and brought it back—I said, "You have stolen this shawl"—she said, "No, I have not"—she cried—I took the shawl, and did not intend to give her into custody—she was afterwards brought to the shop, and this other shawl and gown were found upon her—they are Mr. Delaney's property—they were in the shop when the prisoner came, and were missed directly she was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I bought the shawl and the gown of this young man, and the other shawl was pinned to it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She did not buy them of me; she said before the Magistrate that she bought them of the other young man—she did not buy anything.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 49.) I went after the prisoner on the 2nd of Sept.—I found her in St. Mary's-street, Woolwich. I told her what she was charged with—she said she had got nothing but what she had bought—I took her to the shop, and between herself and the baby we found this gown and shawl—the prisoner had no money on her.</p>

I said I had just that minute noticed it, if it was his he might have it; he took it, and left me; I walked on slowly, and in a few minutes the police<lb></lb>man came up and used me and my baby shamefully; several gentle<lb></lb>men and ladies cried shame on him, and said he ought to be punished; my child was only three weeks old at the time; if I had intended to steal it, would I have sat down so near; he says he does not recollect selling</p>

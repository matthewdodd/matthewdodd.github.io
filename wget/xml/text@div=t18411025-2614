I hired a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> which the prisoner drove to Gofton's, a pawnbroker's shop in Gilbert-street, on the 1st of October—I had a female friend with me—I redeemed a quantity of articles, and among the rest, ten curtains—I desired the prisoner to drive me to No. 3, Charles-street—we got out there, paid him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on examining the articles taken out of the cab in about half-an-hour I missed the curtains—my servants had taken the articles out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the curtains had been left under the prisoner's seat, which I did not know of.</p>

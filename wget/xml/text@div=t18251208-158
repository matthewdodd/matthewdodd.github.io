            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 24th of November I was in Castle-street, Oxford-market, about five minutes past nine o'clock, and saw the two prisoners, whom I had known before, going before me at a pretty brisk pace, towards Newman-street - Williams had a bundle under his arm; I followed and got before them in Newman-street; I looked them both in the face- Williams then crossed the way; they turned down Oxford-street, towards Rathbone-place. I followed at a small distance, and at the end of Rathbone-place they divided. Williams went round the hackney-coaches, and turned back up Oxford-street again on the other side of the way. Dunn went towards St. Giles's - Williams them turned into Dean-street, and looked occasionally over his shoulder to see if I was watching. I followed him down Dean-street - he ran very fast down Carlisle-street into Soho-square, and into Bateman's-buildings. I gained upon him very fast, and he threw down the bundle. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080062"></xptr>took it up, and cried Stop thief! he was stopped by a young man in my presence. I took him to the watch-house; the bundle was loose in a silk handkerchief. I found it contained a top coat, and a livery coat, and two cards with "Mrs. William Beckford, No. 12, Manchester-square," on them; in the prisoner's coat pocket, there were five bundles of matches, and in his hat twelve more. I found on him a duplicate in the name of John Dunn; upon Dunn's being taken the next day, another duplicate, in the name of John Dunn, was found on him. Williams said the man I had seen him with had given him the coats to carry. I gave information to Bertraun and others, and Burtraun brought Dunn the next night into Wardour-street, and I saw him there. I knew them both before.</p>

            . I was in Mr. William Beckford's service on the 24th of November - his house is in St. Mary-le-bone parish. I had fastened up the house on the 23d of November, at eleven o'clock at night; my master's driving coat, and my coat, were on the clothes' horse in the servant's hall, opposite the door; the next morning, a little after nine o'clock, I went to brush them, and missed them both; I informed my master, and he sent me out to enquire. I saw Gook at Marlborough-street, about eleven o'clock - here are the coats - mine is worth 1l. and my master's worth 3l.</p>

            . On the morning of the 24th of November, about eight o'clock, I was under the Portico of the Pantheon, and I saw the two prisoners going towards Manchester-square. I went to Marlborough-street Office, about half-past eleven o'clock, and saw Williams at the bar. I was told by Gook, that it was for stealing two coats, and that he could swear to the other man if he saw him, and having seen them both together in the morning, I went after Dunn, and found him the next day. I told him I wanted him concerning some coats - he said he knew nothing about them. I took him down to Gook, who identified him. I found a duplicate on him for a coat pawned in the name of John Dunn. I took him to the watch-house - Roberts was with me at the time.</p>

               <p>WILLIAMS'S Defence. I have been ill for twelve months and unable to get a living. I have been trying to get a little pittance for myself, and an aged mother, by selling a few matches. On the morning I was taken, I had been hired to carry the bundle, not knowing it contained stolen articles, and was told I should have 1s. I carried it to Oxford-street, and when I found I was watched by an officer, I ran to get away lest it should affect my liberty.</p>

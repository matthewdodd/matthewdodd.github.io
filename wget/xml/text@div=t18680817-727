                  </hi>. I live at 18, Beer Lane, Southwark, and am a carman in the employment of Moses Bernard—on 20th July I was in the Bayswater Road with a load of straw—I left the load in the road to fetch another van—the straw was on a van, and it had got so much on one side that we could go no further—I left it about 9.30 or 9.45—1 returned with the other van about 1.30 in the morning—I then endeavoured to shift the load from one van to the other—while I was doing that I heard something on the other side of the van, and went round—I saw prisoner on the other side, and two men leaning against the-Park railings—they halloaed out, "Look up, Jack"—I looked at the prisoner, and saw a box of matches in one hand, and he was in the act of striking a match against the box—the van was close against the kerb, and he was standing close to the van with a lot of straw in his hand trying to set fire to it—if the match had ignited it must have set fire to the straw in his hand—I did not see the match light—when the men called out the prisoner made a jump into the road, threw the box of matches away, and ran off—I ran after him and caught him, and gave him into custody—I said, "What did you do that for?"—he said, "You never see a light"—I found that some of the straw had been burnt on the top of the van—the constable showed me where the fire had been, and I got up and looked at it—the value of the straw was about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were 138 trusses on the van.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman D</hi> 56). I was on duty in the Bayswater Road, about 2.30 on the morning of the 21st July—I saw the last witness there—he gave the prisoner into my custody for attempting to set fire to a load of straw—the prisoner said, "You never see me light it"—I asked him what made him get behind the van, and he said, "Fun"—he was searched, and the witness Cox handed a piece of touchwood to me—I found a hole burnt in his shirt—he was quite sober.</p>

On the night of the 20th July I was in the Bayswater Road, about 11 o'clock—I saw a load of straw standing in the road, and I went across to look at it—I saw fire on the top of it—it was flaring up—I put it out—I found a large piece of touchwood on the top of the straw—I saw the prisoner and another man about an hour after pass the load, one on one side and one on the other—they passed by when they saw me—I saw him again in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I am innocent. I had nothing on me, and there was nobody with me. I saw the straw in the road. The man came up to me, and I said, "What do you want?" He said, "I will let you know what I want," and gave me into custody. There were two cabs standing by.</p>

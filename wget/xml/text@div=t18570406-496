On 14th March and previously I carried on the business of a waterproof manufacturer at No. 47, Wellclose Square—the prisoner was in my service—I recollect, one Sunday evening, coming home, and finding that my house had been burnt—I cannot read and write, and do not know the day of the month—I was insured in the West of England Fire Office—I rendered every assistance at the fire that I could—I made a claim on the office through Mr. Hunter—three or four days after the fire, the prisoner came to me; I was then lodging in Church Street, Minories; he said, "I want some money"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "I am <hi rend="italic">hard up</hi>; I must have money, I must have money"—I said, "Well, if you are <hi rend="italic">hard up</hi>, I cannot give you any money;" and he said, "If you don't give me</p>

"—I told him to go with me to Gattie's, a confectioner's, in Aldgate, and I would give him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and an I O U—when we got to Gattie's, I had a few friends there, and I told them to hear what he said—I had previously told Mr. Morris and Mr. Goldberg to meet me there, and the policeman Shepherd was there too, in plain clothes—I sat down at a table, and said to Mr. Morris, in the prisoner's presence, "Look at this man, what he is going to do, he wants to go and swear against me that I set the house on fire, and I shall give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; what a rogue he must be to try to get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of me, and he knows nothing at all about the fire"—the prisoner said, "I am <hi rend="italic">hard up</hi>, you must give me the money"—I said, "You must give me a receipt for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the I O U"—Mr. Morris made out the receipt, and he said, "It must be stamped"—I gave the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he went</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the superintending presi<lb></lb>dents of the London district General Post-office. On 12th Feb. I made up a letter, and folded a half-sovereign and a florin in the corner of it—I ad<lb></lb>dressed it "Mr. Samuel Fisher, Mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Swiftsure,</hi> Outward-bound Docks, Liverpool," and gave it to Peek at six o'clock on the morning of the 13th—if he posted it at the receiving-office, Abbey-road, St. John's Wood, it would reach the General Post-office at eleven, in the regular course in the Paddington bag—I was at the General Office that morning—on the arrival of the Paddington bag, I opened and examined it—my letter was not in it, and I went with Peek and Mr. Cole to the post-office in the Abbey-road, kept by Mr. Daws—we found the prisoner there—he was Mr. Daws' assistant—I took the letter-bill with me, which had come with the bag, and asked the prisoner whose figures they were—he said they were his—I asked him if he made up the collection—he said he did—I said there was a money-letter posted there that morning, addressed to Liverpool, which had not been forwarded to the Post-office—he said he had not seen such a letter—I desired Peek to search him—he took some money from him—this half-sovereign was among it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the one I enclosed in the letter—Peek took a pocket-book from his pocket—Mr. Cole was about to open it—the prisoner said, "Oh, there is nothing in that"—it was opened, and the letter was found in it—it was not open, I opened it before the Magistrate, it con<lb></lb>tained this letter and the florin—the end of the envelope had been taken out and gummed in again—it was not so when I gave it to Peek—there was no appearance of the seal having been broken—if this part of the envelope had been folded back, a party could draw out the money without breaking the seal—I told the prisoner it was my half-sovereign and my letter—he made no answer—I gave him in charge.</p>

I was coming home from the pay-table on Saturday-night, March 14, the prisoner picked me up near Westminster-bridge, she asked me, if I would treat her with a pint of beer: I said I would; I was a little in liquor and had a hock of bacon under my arm; she after that, asked me to go to her lodgings, at her sisters, saying, she had a very good feather-bed. I went to this sister's as she called her; she told me I was to give her six-pence and she a shilling to lie with me all night. I gave her sister three-pence to fetch a pot of beer: and while I was busy playing with the prisoner she picked my pocket of five shillings, and said, now we will go to bed presently and jostled me on the bed: I saw her go to the window with money in her hand, to see what it was: I sat a little while to consider with myself: I put my thumb and finger into my fob; there was but 1 s. 6 d. left, she was upon me in a manner when she jostled me on the bed: she came again a second time after she had been at the window and put her hand in my pocket; then I felt her hand plain; I lost 5 s. and upwards; then she went away; I said, I was robbed and wanted to call the watch; then they throw'd my hock of bacon down stairs, and shov'd me down stairs; then as she was gone I charged the sister.</p>

I am a watchman, the prosecutor came to me and said, he was robbed, and that they had conveyed the woman away, put the candle out, and push'd him down stairs, and flung a hock of bacon down before him, which he had bought, he charged me with a woman that was there; took him and her, and confined them both in the watch-house; I went and told the people if they did not find the woman, I would search the house through, then they brought the prisoner to me, and I discharged the other woman that the prisoner called sister.</p>

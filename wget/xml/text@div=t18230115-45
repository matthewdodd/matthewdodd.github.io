I missed a blue coat early in December, while she was in the house; and after she left the lodging, I missed a jacket from a chest of drawers in the room she occupied. I also missed two petticoats, and some beads; she kept the key. I had spoken to her about the coat, she said she knew nothing of it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 6th of January, I had a warrant to search the prisoner's room, she was married then. I found a string of garnet beads on the sidebord, but nothing else; she said she had had them sevaral years, that they were given to her by a sea captain. I had searched the room before and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she present at the first search. - A. Yes, and knew what I searched for. I asked her for the beads then; she said she had none.</p>

            , the prisoner met me at the corner, ran against me, and struck me - He came out of a public-house-three or four others came to his assistance. I was knocked down two or three times. I missed my watch, and found nothing but the empty case left-the men were also gone. I gave information at Bow-street, and the next day I saw the prisoner there, and knew him to be the man. I had been drinking, but knew what I was about.</p>

            . I was with Young. I had been drinking with him at the corner of Belton-street; the prisoner came out of the public-house, attacked him, and struck him several times. Young struck him again three or four times, when some others came up and overpowered him - He was knocked down repeatedly-the people called to him to see if his watch was safe-the gang ran away-Young found he had lost his watch, the case was left. I am sure the prisoner is one of them. I had been drinking, but was quite sensible.</p>

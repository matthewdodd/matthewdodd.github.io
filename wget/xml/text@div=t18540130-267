                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 580). On 13th Jan. I saw the prisoner in Mark-lane—he was going towards Tower-street, with a chest of tea on his back—I stopped him against the corn-market, and asked him where he was going with the chest—he said he was going to take it to Mr. Henry's, in Mark-lane—I went there with him, and asked Mr. Henry if he knew any<lb></lb>thing about him—he said, "No"—I left the chest of tea there, and took the prisoner to the station-house—this is the chest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at No. 7, Hart-street, Mark-lane. About a quarter past 4 o'clock that afternoon I was coming up Seething-lane, and saw the prisoner and two men standing just at the top of Seething-lane—there was a wagon standing at Mr. Cross's warehouse, which had chests of tea in it—I watched those persons for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I moved round the corner in such a position that they could not see me, but I could see them—I saw one man get in the wagon, lift a chest of tea out, and put it on the prisoner's back—the prisoner came down Seething-lane to Mark-lane—I gave information to the officer, who took him—I never lost sight of him all the time.</p>

I was at Mr. Cross's warehouse with my wagon—I had a half chest of tea in it, and a bag of sugar—I went into Mr. Cross's warehouse, leaving my wagon in the street—when I came out I missed the half chest of tea—the number of it was 4664—this is it.</p>

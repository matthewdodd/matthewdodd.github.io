                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and live in Fore Street, Lime-house. On the night of 28th Aug. I went to bed about a quarter before 11 o'clock—I had made the house safe—about half past 2 o'clock I was disturbed by the rattling of the door, as if some one was trying to get in—I lay for a minute, and heard it again—I then went to the window, and asked who was there—I saw a young man stand back—I said, "Who is there?"—he said, "It is all right"—I said, "It is not all right, take yourself away"—he again said, "It is all right," and I thought he had got the door open—(that was not the prisoner)—I got my trowsers on, and came and found my street door open—the cellar flap had been forced open—I saw my timepiece, my boots, a pair of trowsers, and a table cloth lying loose at the door—I had left the trowsers at night in a drawer in the bed room, and the table cloth on the drawers in the room where I slept with my two boys—I went to look round the corner, and a constable came to me, and I spoke to him—I then missed from my house a suit of clothes and some money—I had before seen the prisoner in the neighbourhood more than once.</p>

At half past 2 o'clock that morn<lb></lb>ing I saw Johnson against the cellar flap of the last witness's house—she walked towards me when she saw me coming, and I said to her, "Halloo! what do you do here?"—she said, "I am servant at the Cape of Good Hope public house, and I am locked out"—at that moment I heard a noise at the side of Mr. Matthews's house—it is a wooden house—I heard Mr. Matthews speak to some one outside, and the person who was outside said, "It is all right"—Mr. Matthews said, "It is not all right," and the prisoner immediately came out of Mr. Matthews's door, and he and the man who was outside, who is not in custody; both went away together—I went into Mr. Matthews's house, and saw the articles in the passage—Mr. Matthews shut the door—I said, "Don't shut the door"—I went and opened it, and</p>

               <p>I saw that Johnson had gone in the direction that the two men had gone—I went in a different direction, and I saw them again, about 300 yards off, at the back of the prosecutor's house—there were the two prisoners, and the man who ran away—when I got seven or eight yards from them I heard M'Carthy say, "I shall wish you good night," and he went down a court, went into a house, and I heard him fasten the door—I spoke to Johnson, and said, "Do you know that person who was with you?"—she said, "Yes, it is my brother"—I said, "How long have you been with him!"—she said, "Three hours"—I said, "Are you sure?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you left him for any time during that time?"—she said, "No"—I said, "You are servant at the Cape of Good Hope, are you not?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "You won't go back there to-night, I shall take you into custody on suspicion of committing a robbery in Fore Street"—I took her, and sent her by another officer to the station—I got assistance, and went back to the house where I saw M'Carthy go in—I found the door fastened, but the door of the next house was open—I went in there, got over the wall, and got into the house where M'Carthy was—he was in the back room; he had his shoes off—I told him I wanted him for committing a robbery in Fore Street—he said, "I have been here since 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or half past 11 o'clock"—I left him in charge of another constable, and searched the house—I found in front of the prosecutor's house part of a box of lucifer matches—I did not search Johnson—I took hold of her pocket, and she took this money out, and said, "That is ail that I have"—the greater portion of these are old—there are five new coppers amongst them, very bright.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Morgan; we are corn<lb></lb>dealers in White Lion-street, Pentonville—a man named Perkins was in our service—I knew the prisoner; he had been a customer of ours previous to 8th April—my partner and he had had a discussion about an amount that was owing to us—in consequence of what had passed, I had given directions to Perkins with reference to Lovejoy—my partner received information from a neighbour—he told me, and in consequence of that I went to a place to watch on 8th April—at half-past seven o'clock, I saw a cart driven by Lovejoy come up to my place of business—it stopped opposite the shop—Lovejoy got out of the cart, and went into the shop, and I saw him talking to Perkins—after he had talked to</p>

               <p>Perkins, he came out—he had nothing with him, but Perkins went up in the loft, and threw down a truss of hay, and a truss of clover, which Lovejoy placed in the cart—Lovejoy then went into the shop, and brought out a sack on his back—Perkins came down from the loft, went into the cellar, and brought up a truss of straw, which he placed in Lovejoy's cart—if Perkins had sold these things to Lovejoy in the ordinary way, it would have been his duty to have put them on the slate which we have for that purpose—he had no authority to sell goods to Lovejoy on credit—it would have been his duty to have had the money, or not to have parted with the goods—there was no money passed between them that I could see—after Lovejoy had got these things in his cart, I went down to the person who had communicated to us, and I saw Lovejoy come past, and drive down a mews—I did not follow him, but I went to our shop and took the slate, and seeing there was no entry on it, I spoke to Perkins—he did not give me any account of any transaction with Lovejoy—he did not pay me any money—there was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the till—the amount of the things Lovejoy had, was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave Perkins into custody, and he was taken before the Magistrate—Lovejoy was in court on the first occasion—he was bound over, and directed to attend on the next occasion—I think his solicitor was to be answerable for bit attend<lb></lb>ance—I was before the Magistrate on the second examination; I did not see Lovejoy then—Perkins was committed, and has been convicted—I never saw Lovejoy again till he was taken into custody by the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Whiteconduit-terrace, Islington, near to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Smith. The last transaction on which Lovejoy had anything on credit, was in March, 1849, when he had to the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never had anything to a great amount, either on credit or paid for—I had given direction to Perkins with reference to Lovejoy—I am a salesman, and am compelled to be at Smith field Market on Mondays and Fridays—that took me away from five o'clock in the morning till four in the afternoon—Perkins was given into custody on Monday, 8th April, and on the Tuesday I went with an officer to a stable of Lovejoy's, in Barnsbury-mews—I found one of my sacks there, with barley in it of the same description as we sell—I knew the sack; it was one of mine—Lovejoy had never purchased that barley of me—I found there a truss of meadow<lb></lb>again</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190018"></xptr>
               <p>a truss of clover, and a truss of straw—they were similar to what we sell—I had not sold any such to Lovejoy—these things were worth about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I go to market, my partner attends at the shop—he generally comes at eight o'clock in the morning, seldom or ever before.</p>
               <p>

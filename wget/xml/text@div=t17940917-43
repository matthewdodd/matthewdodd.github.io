               <p>Q. What situation was this house in at the time you lost your property? - The prisoner was employed by my father to pull down this house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he and others procceded in pulling down this house? - Very near to the basement story. The bar was situated in the basement story, to support one jam of the chimney, to support the brick work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where in consequence of any information, to any house, and did you find any bar? - I went to a house in Duck-lane, Westminster, on Sunday evening the 20th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did that house belong? - I understood to a Mr. Roach; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there, did you find any bar of your's? - I found a bar similar to the one that had supported our stack of chimnies; but I could not positively swear to it till afterwards. I took it with the constable, to the watch-house of St. Margaret's, and the prisoner he was in bed. I don't recollect the said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner in bed, at Mr. Roach's? - Yes; I understood he lodged there. It was found in a out house, after we had been at the watch-house; the prisoner was locked up till the next morning, I left the bar there, and the bar was taken the next morning, with the prisoner, to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave the bar with there? - With the people of the watch-house; I left the constable there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the custody of the bar? - I cannot say that; the bar was taken to Queen's-square the next morning, and I met them there the next morning, Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the magistrate's was the bar produced then? - Yes, I believe by the constable,</p>
               <p>Q. To all appearance, was it the same bar that you had seen in the out house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same bar that you said before was similar to the one that had been in your building? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. After it had been produced by the constable before the magistrate, what next did you do with the prisoner at the bar? - By desire of the magistrate, I took it with the constable or people that belong<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170106"></xptr>to the office, to the building, and there I sitted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to tally exactly, and to fit the place that you tried it at? - Exactly; certain parts of the morter adhered to the iron and corroded iron to the morter.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, from the method that you took to discover whether it was your property or not, are you able to state from the best of your knowledge, that it is your property? - I think I can safely say it is my father's property.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been in the house, and sitted the bar, and found it exactly tally with the premises, what did you do with the bar then? - I think it was taken back to the office, and I went with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was brought back to the office, the prisoner was had up again before the magistrate, was not he? - He was, and committed, and the bar was taken to our house, and locked up in a wareroom.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the key of the wareroom? - It was kept under my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the key? - Not the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else access to the key, besides yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these persons here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - Five shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make observation enough, to say that the bar, that is now about to be produced, was the bar that was taken from the prisoner? - I think without doubt it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have sworn with very great solemnity, that when you found this bar you was present; you found this bar in the outhouse, who put it there you don't know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. This bar had been put into the outhouse before you came? - I don't know anything to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. It was taken to the, watch-house by the constable, did you accompany the constable all the way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In whole care did you leave it? - The constable's that I took with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought it the next morning to the office? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. It was taken from the office to your premises, by whom you don't know? - I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. It was put into a cellar, the key of which was kept by a publican yesterday? - Yes, it was, in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what particular mark is there on this bar, by which you will venture to swear to it? - I don't know whether there is a mark that I put on it when I examined it at the time that it was taken from the office to the building.</p>
               <p>Q. Then between the time of having found the bar in the outhouse; and to this time that you took it to your father's house, it had been out of your sight, without a mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My learned friend has just now asked you who took this bar to your house from the magistrate? Did you go along with them? - I cannot swear that I was the whole time with them, I might be part of the time out of their sight, however they went to the building, and there I found them with the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. With respect to this bar, I have not asked you who took it from the office to your ware room, where you kept it after it was examined? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany them? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Though my learned friend has been endeavouring to persuade the jury that you shall not be able to ascertain your property; after having made the trial to the best of your observation is this your father's property? - It is my father's property, to the best of my observation.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he bring it in? - He brought it on his shoulder, and I asked him what he had got? I said, what have you brought a log in? ay, says he, and you may burn it; I did not know then it was iron, or anything about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be a light burden or a heavy one? - Heavy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it covered at all? - No, it was not.</p>

               <p>Q. When you saw it again the next day, did you find it to be wood? - No, I did not know what it was, till I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew perhaps it was not wood? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when Mr. Glanvill and the constable came to your house? - Yes, that was on the Sunday following; he brought this home Thursday or Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they find any thing there? - Yes, a piece of iron, and carried it away.</p>
               <p>Q. The same piece that he brought in? - Yes, I am sure it was the same piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they find it? - In the wash-house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether it be iron or not, the same thing that was brought into your house, was the same thing that was taken out? - It was.</p>

               <p>Q. After you made an enquiry about this iron, did any body come on Sunday? - On Sunday evening Mr. Glanvill came; I went down first and foremast, and he followed after, and he saw the very bar, and he sent the bar away with his man.</p>

               <p>Q. When you saw the bar again before the magistrate, did you know the bar again? - I declare I would not positively say it was the same bar, but it was very much like it, it had been cleaned in the time.</p>

What was afterwards done with the bar? - Mr. Glanvill went down with the bar to fit it, I went with him, it was brought back to the office again, and the man was committed, and the bar was carried to Mr. Glanvill's house, and I have not seen the bar since, till yesterday I saw it in the cart, in the Old Bailey, and there was some mortar about it then, but it rubbed off in pulling it out of the cart, because it is a very heavy bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You took the prisoner to the watch-house, and somebody else took the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you found a bar like that at the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the justice's you saw a bar like it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw a bar like it at Mr. Glanvill's? - Yes.</p>

            Did you see the prisoner there? - No, I heard he was in bed; I saw nothing at all till the bar was brought into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170109"></xptr>the passage, I was ordered to carry it to the watch-house, and I did.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a bar was it? - I am no judge of bars, it is a very heavy bar to my certain knowledge; it had a parcel of mortar about it, it had a flat piece at top, and the same piece at bottom; I took it to the watch house, and I set it up against the wall at the left hand side, going in at the watch house door, till such time as my master came in, and the constable and prisoner; it was left there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the bar again? - I went out of town; it is not above a week ago, I saw the bar in my master's yard, it is the bar by the weight of it, and the look of it, I brought it in the cart yesterday with the horses, into the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it any mortar on then? - Yes, there was a little, and in getting it out of the cart, I knocked some off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it the same appearance about the ends of it as the other bar had? - Yes, it had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. This bar had some mortar on; why if any bar had came out of a chimney piece, it would have had the same? - It would.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it a very heavy bar, it made your shoulders ake? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. You see it in your master's yard, how came it there? - It was locked up in master's coach-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had it the appearance as if it had been taken from a building? - It had.</p>
               <p>Court. You see it at the watch-house where it was left; did you see it when it was carried to the justice? - I did not.(The bar produced)</p>
               <p>Glanvill. To the best of my recollection it is the same bar, there is a spindle at the bottom that fits into a back, and there was a mark on the stone where this flat piece of iron had been, the top part is a piece of wood, which is entirely taken away, therefore I cannot speak to that so well.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same bar that was put into your coach-house, and brought here? - To the best of my knowledge it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same bar that you found in the wash-house? - I really believe it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I suppose that bar is like any other that is used for the same purpose? - I never see such a one used for such a purpose before.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this man a labourer of your's at the time? - He was a bricklayer's labourer on Thursday the 17th.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it be in the line of his business to remove such a bar as that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says the bar fitted the place, when the piece is entirely pulled down the Saturday night, I worked fifteen years in the same parish, I worked nine years for squire-, and I worked three years two or three doors from Mr. Glanvill's, I sent master a letter and desired him to look into my character, if he thought that I took the bar.</p>

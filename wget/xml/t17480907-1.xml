             . I live at the globe at Mile-end; the Prisoner brought a mare to my house , (but I was not at home) and after he was taken up, when he was in the cage, he said he knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. How, then, do you know that?</p>
               <p>Smith. He own'd it himself, when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a mare was it?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was a brown mare, about fourteen hands high; and he said I might work him, if I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come afterwards, and claim this mare?</p>
               <p>Smith . Yes; Mr. Coxhead's servant, Mr. Potter.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner bring it to you?</p>
               <p>Smith . On the 2d of July; and on the 3d of July Mr. Coxhead's servant came, and claim'd it. The prisoner brought a man to buy it, and then I charg'd a constable with him, and sent word to Mr. Potter: then the prisoner own'd he had the mare out of a park in Norfolk .</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had the mare upon an exchange at Stebbing , about 8 miles from Chelmsford , and I exchanged a grey poney, and gave a guinea and an half for the mare .</p>

               <p>Prisoner . No; I was all alone, and was quite a stranger in the country. I had this poney but two days; I bought him at Rumford-fair .</p>

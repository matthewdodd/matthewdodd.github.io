On the evening of the 11th of December, I wanted to go to that part of the distill house, where my partner was; on returning back to the accompting house I saw some person endeavouring to conceal themselves; I asked who was there, I received no answer; I took a candle to see who was there, and found it to be the prisoner; I asked him what he was about, he replied nothing; I requested to see what that nothing was that he was about; I found that he had filled a two gallon cask of gin; he was in the act of putting it behind an empty pipe; when I took up the cask and took him to the accompting house, I searched him; I found this tin case of foreign brandy, about a pint, I found this key of the vat; we have two keys which open almost all the vats in the house. There was no cork in this cask, it was just filled; he told me he had drawn it out of the foreign cellar.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

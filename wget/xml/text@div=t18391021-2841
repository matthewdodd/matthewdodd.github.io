                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Norley, who keeps a green-grocer's shop in Castle-street, Finsbury. The prisoner came to the shop on the 10th of October, about five o'clock in the evening, for a pennyworth of apples—he gave me a half-crown, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the half-crown in my pocket, where I had about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In small silver, but no other half-crown—the same evening, about eight o'clock, he came again for 3 lbs. of potatoes, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me another half-crown, and I gave him change—I put that in my pocket, where I had put the other—I had no other half-crowns but the two I took of him—I put the two that night into a tea-caddy—there was no other there—I saw him again the next evening, about five o'clock, just before I lighted my gas—he asked for one pennyworth of pears—I served him, and he gave me half-a-crown—I told him I thought it felt light—he said, "it is a good one"—I gave him the change, and he went away—I put that half-crown in my pocket, where I had no other—he came again the same evening, about eight o'clock, for 2 1/2 lbs. of potatoes, they came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown, I gave him change, and put the half-crown in my pocket, where I had no other but the one I had</p>

               <p>taken of him for the pears—I afterwards wanted some bread, I sent a boy to the baker's for it with a shilling, he came back and said it was a bad one—that induced me to look at my money, and I found the two half-crowns were bad—I went to the tea-caddy and found the other two were bad—I had not been in the habit of taking money, we, had only commenced business on the Saturday before—on Saturday, the 12th of October, the prisoner came again, about a quarter before ten o'clock at night, for three pounds of potatoes, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me half-a-crown—I told him to wait a minute and I would give him the change—I went in the adjoining room, and my husband came out—we sent for the policeman and gave him in charge—he said he had got a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and offered to pay for the potatoes with that.</p>

In all—on the Friday, I only took one shilling and two sixpences-the most of the change I gave the prisoner was copper—I never said to him, "You shall pay for all"—I am quite sure he is the person, I saw him come to my house five times—I have never entertained a doubt about his being the man—the woman who saw him come in, went with me to the station-house, she said she was not certain, but she thought he was the man.</p>

I examined the half-crowns which my wife took from her pocket, and from the tea-caddy on Friday night, the 11th of October—there were four half-crowns, I knew they were bad—I laid them on the mantel-shelf, wrapped in paper—on Saturday evening, the 12th, my wife brought me another half-crown, and asked if it was a good one—I went into the shop, and detained the prisoner while a policeman was sent for—he said he had not been there before—I pushed him back into the little room—he pressed me very hard to let him go, and offered me a good sixpence, to pay for what he had purchased—I gave the half crown that he brought that evening to the policeman, and the other four also.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the employ of Mr. Cox, a solicitor, of Pinner's-hall, Broad-street, about six months. I know the pri<lb></lb>soner; he was in Mr. Cox's employ before I was—on 4th Feb., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I received from Mr. Lines an account of Mr. Cox's five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and five sovereigns—the prisoner saw me receive it—I said, "It is too late to pay the money into the bankers (the Union Bank), we had better lock it up in the cupboard"—I did not lock it up then—it was after five when I put it on a shelf in the cupboard in Mr. Cox's inner room, locked it up, and put the key in my desk—I put some papers over it—1 and the prisoner remained in the office till twenty minutes to six—a client came in, who remained three or four minutes, and went away—about twenty minutes before six the prisoner saw me go to the cupboard, and I told him I had locked the money up—we both left the office at the same time—he was aware that the cupboard was considered a place of security—it was the usual way to put the key in my desk—I came out of the office first—he followed close after me—he appeared to me to shut the door, and lock it—I presume he had the key of the door; I cannot say—it was our habit to take the key</p>

               <p>to the porter's lodge, and hang it on a nail—I did not do that that night—the prisoner came down the stairs—he went inside the porter's lodge, and returned in about half a minute—I waited for him, and we went together a little way up Broad-street—we parted in about two minutes after we left the office—I went at ten o'clock the next morning, I went up-stairs first, expecting the office would be open—our usual time for business is half-past nine—I tried the handle, and found the door was not open—I came down, went to the lodge, and found the key hanging up—I took it, and opened the office—the pri<lb></lb>soner's pad was out, and so was mine—I saw this note on the desk; it is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Dear Ford, I am too ill to stop at the office. Thomas Almond. 5th Feb., 1850." He had made no complaint to me of being ill the evening before—I lifted up my desk, and the key of the cup<lb></lb>board appeared to be in the situation I had left it on the Monday evening not at all disturbed—I took it, went in Mr. Cox's room to the closet, and was about to introduce the key into the lock, and found the door was broken open, and stood rather ajar, and the money I had deposited there was gone—Mr. Cox had not arrived—it was between five and ten minutes after ten—I went after the prisoner, and overtook him near the Elephant and Castle—he lives within five minutes walk of the Elephant and Castle—I think it was about a quarter before eleven o'clock when I came up to him—he was walk<lb></lb>ing very leisurely—I said, "This is a most unfortunate job, the cupboard is broken open, and the money is gone, come back to the office"—he made answer, "I can't help it, I am very unwell, I must go home"—I turned to him, and said, "What am I to do?"—he said, "Go to Mr. Cox's house"—with that I left him, and hastened back to the office—when I arrived, Mr. Cox was there—I saw in Mr. Cox's room the ironwork of a chisel or screw-driver lying on a chair, within two feet of the cupboard—I believe this is the instrument, but I made no mark on it—I did not touch it; I let it remain there.</p>

I know the prisoner as Mr. Cox's clerk—I cleaned out his office on 4th Feb., after the clerks had left—I was in Mr. Jackson's room when the clock struck eight, and was in Mr. Cox's room shortly afterwards—I found the outside door of Mr. Cox's room open—I went in, and found wood on the floor near the cupboard-door—the door comes down to the floor—I removed the chips and put them in the fire-place; the cupboard-door was too or three inches open—I could not shut it till I had picked up the wood inside the door—I saw this chisel on the floor—I picked it up and put it on a chair—I saw the prisoner that evening, about half-past seven—he rang the bell—I answered the door, and let him in—he went up the stairs that he was in the habit of going up—I should think it was about half-past seven—I did not see him go away—the lodge is by the door that I open to let persons in—the prisoner did not go to the lodge at that time; he went directly up-stairs—no one else came in between half-past five and the time I let him in—the two doors are closed at five—it was</p>

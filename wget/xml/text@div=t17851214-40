               <p>On Saturday morning last, the 10th of December, I was coming from my house at Kilburn to Paddington, I saw a man on the foot path before me, I saw him stooping down by the side of the ditch, and there was a basket; when I came to him, he was buttoning his breeches, I asked him if that basket belonged to him, he said it did, I asked him what was in it, he said, he dealt in oranges and lemons, and travelled in the country with them, and on his return home he gathered old flints and phials; I said, I will help you up with your load, I found it was very heavy, says I, when you are tired of it, I will ease you with it: I asked a man that I met, to assist me in looking at this; says he, who are you? says I, I live at Kilburn Wells; I and the prisoner lifted down the basket, and then he said he had got lead, and he hoped I would not hurt him; he said, he never stole any in his life, I asked him how he came by it, he said he had bought it of two bricklayers in the Edgware-road, I asked him what he gave for it, he said six shillings and a pot of beer; I took the prisoner into custody; the lead is here.</p>

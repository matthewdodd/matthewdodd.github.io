               <p>Prisoner Jones. I was on the craft, and he was on the shore; I ask him if he saw any coals filled in my bag? - I did see him, he began first.</p>

               <p>I am an officer, Mr. Rodbard gave me charge of them as I was coming along, they had two bags of coals; I am sure they had each coals; they were no sweepings at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. Do you know whose craft it was? - It was Mr. Stone's craft, there were many craft lying together; some were Mr. Rodbard's, and some were Mr. Stone's. (The coals shewn to the jury.)</p>
               <p>Jury. How do you know my man that these were Mr. Stone's? - I know the barges, and I shewed Mr. Stone the barge from whence it was taken, and he said it was his; and I knew it was Mr. Stone's by the number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawrence. We sent a barge with coals to Trigg-stairs, and that barge and coals was our property. I was not on the stairs at the time; I saw them the next morning after they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Marshall ever point out to you the barge, from whence they were taken? - He did, and that was our barge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hatred. I heaved out the coals, from a West-country-barge; and they gave me 1 s. and the sweepings out; I don't rightly know whose barge it was; I heaved five chaldrons out, Jones was heaving the head room out, and I was heaving at the stern room; accordingly I came ashore with my coals; and Mr. Rodbard stopped me, and I was taken before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150092"></xptr>the Alderman; I told them that they were sweepings; when I got up I lifted them on the full piles, and then I suppose the boy saw me take them down: I begged very hard of Mr. Rodbard, that he would not send me to the Compter; I never was in the Compter before, nor in any place of confinement; it was a strange place to me, and I was afraid of going to such a place; I have got a poor old mother at home, who entirely depends on my maintaining her. Mr. Tucker came to me and said, this boy was to have 10 l. from the Coal exchange.</p>
               <p>Tucker. There is not a word of that true.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. The constable came up to the Compter, and said, that he dare say I should be transported; for the boy would have 10 l. and he dare say the boy would say any thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Tucker. Do you know there is any reward in this case? - Yes, I knew nothing about it, till three days afterwards, I heard that there was a reward of 5 l. from the Coal-exchange.</p>

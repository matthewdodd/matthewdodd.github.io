            . I am a tailor, and live at No. 2, Curriers-hall-court. On the 19th of May, between eight and nine o'clock, I was near <placeName id="t18330704-89-crimeloc447">Holborn-bridge</placeName>

            . I never saw the prosecutor before he gave charge of the prisoner - he gave no name in the prisoner's presence; I have heard it is Savage - I did not hear him give that name in the prisoner's presence - I don't know that that is his name.</p>

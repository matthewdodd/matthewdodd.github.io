               <p>morning of 3rd June, when I was aroused by the breaking of glass—I got out of bed and lighted a candle and went into the back kitchen to look—I saw something there and I left the caudle lighted on the bedroom table—I heard some one moving about in the commercial room, which is over my bed room—I did not get up then, because I thought it was my master—about a quarter of an hour after that I heard some one come downstairs, and the prisoner came and opened my bedroom door—I said "Who is there?"—he did not answer at first, and I asked again, and he said "All right," and closed the door and went upstairs—I got out of bed and put on my dress and followed him upstairs with the candle in my hand—when I got towards the top of the stairs he tried to frighten me back again—he had a lot of coats on his arm, and he shook them at me to frighten me back, but I did not go—he then threw the coats at me and put out the candle—I called for Mr. Thompson and the prisoner made his escape through the landing window—some trees had been moved from the landing window and the glass was broken; I had seen the prisoner at the house three weeks before, doing some whitewashing—he was there seven or eight hours, and he had his tea with me in the kitchen—I have no doubt that he is the man that entered my door—I was sent for to the Snow Hill police-station on 4th of June and picked the prisoner out from a number of men there—the light that I had was sufficient to enable me to see a person distinctly, and I recognised his voice too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of this hotel—on Wednesday night, 2nd June, when I went up to bed, I noticed that the landing window was closed, and there were some trees in pots both inside and outside the window in the usual order; that was about 12 o'clock—I heard a noise of glass breaking about 2 o'clock, and after that I seem to have dozed—I thought it was the cat had knocked the flower pots through the window—afterwards I heard some one calling "Master, master," repeatedly—I came out of my room and went downstairs and saw that the flower pots had been removed from the window on to a ledge outside—I saw some coats and cloaks and shawls on the stairs and landing leading from the ground floor to the basement—some were my own, and some belonged to gentlemen in the house—I missed a pair of sugar tongs and a spoon which I had used the evening before, and which had been left on the table in the commercial room—I had seen the prisoner at work at my house three weeks before; I did not see him that morning.</p>

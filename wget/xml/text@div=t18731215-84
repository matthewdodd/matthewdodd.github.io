I live at Underhill Villas, Woodford—I have the right from my landlord for my fowls to run over a piece of waste ground outside my premises—I missed a duok early in October, and on 9th November, I found a fowl in a wire snare, close to a pit where some men were at work—I afterwards found more snares set—on 22nd November I saw a fowl produced at the Police Court—it was my property, and I had seen it safe on the Tuesday previous—it was worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I would not have taken 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, it had just commenced laying—I afterwards searched, and found this rat<lb></lb>trap.</p>

I am a bricklayer, of Cowley Road, Wanstead, and am Mr. Clark's landlord—I own a piece of ground at the back of his house—on 1st October, I gave Perry a contract, and he employed the prisoner to raise some gravel—on 21st November, I had some conversation with the prisoner, he said that he was getting on all right, I went on to No. 182, and heard the cackling of fowls—I saw the prisoner leave Perry at work and go to where the fowls were—he picked up a brown one, which was fluttering, and my little boy said "Father, Abbey has a fowl"—I made a communication to Mrs. Clark directly—I was shown some wire snares made with the same kind of wire which is used for the gravel sieves, but I don't say that it is the same.</p>

I am a son of the last witness, and was waiting for him on 21st November; he had gone to speak to the prisoner—I saw the prisoner go to the fowls, which all went away except one, a rather brown one, which he picked np—I saw it flutter in his hand—my father told me to keep a strict watch, and if they had taken anything else I should have seen.</p>

I live at Maybank Road, Woodford—on 21st November, I heard something about a fowl being lost—I went to the pit where the prisoner was at work; I had a dog with me—I saw this piece of hop sacking lying next to the prisoner's basket—I was present on 22nd November, when the pit was searched, and saw a fowl found in a piece of sacking like this—I was out with the prisoner one day, and I saw some wire snares carefully set in the bushes, as poachers would set them; I also saw a rat-trap found partly buried in the mould.</p>

On 22nd November, I received information—I had been watching for an hour, and when the men left I borrowed a fork, and in striking the mould I found this chicken concealed under the turf in this bit of sacking—I took the prisoner and told him it was on suspicion of stealing a fowl; he said "All right, I suppose I must go with you."</p>

I am a labourer, of Woodford Cottage, Wanstead—I was employed with the prisoner on 21st November in this gravel pit, from 4 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.—the prisoner was at work with us all day; I did not see him bring a fowl in his hand; if he had I must have seen it; I was digging the turf off the top, where I could see him<lb></lb>well—I never took a fowl of Mrs. Clarke's, and never knew him do so—I got my meals in the pit—I never left it all day, and never saw a fowl the whole time.</p>

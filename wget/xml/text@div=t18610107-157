I live at Notting-hill, and am a sawyer, on 12th December I was betwixt Lea and Eltham between 11 and 12 o'clock, out for a walk—before I got to the fields I saw some smoke arising—I went to see, and I saw it was a haystack on fire—I got a pail of water out of the ditch and threw it over the stack; and the sluicing of the water brought down a piece of paper out of the stack, I picked it up and threw it down again—it was partly burned—a few minutes afterwards a person named Colvill came, he picked up the paper again, opened it, read it, and found it was a soldier's pass—the value of the stack was 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see the prisoner there then, but I was on the top of the stack, about a quarter of an hour afterwards, when he was given in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Church-street, Lea, and am a lawyer—I was taking a walk on this Sunday morning, in a field called the Harrow Meadow with a few more companions—we saw some smoke arising among three or four haystacks—we directly ran down towards them—there were three or four men there with a pail trying to put the fire out—the fire was just com<lb></lb>mencing, if we had had two or three more pails we could have put it out—one of my companions was poking a piece of paper with his stick—I picked it up and found it was a soldier's pass—I kept it and afterwards gave it to the constable—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was folded in this way—we looked about for a soldier, but did not see one till twenty minutes afterwards, when I saw the prisoner looking through a hedge—I went up to where he was, looked at him, he looked at me, and we went to the gate, but never passed a word, and then he turned to go back again—I went to one of my companions—a policeman came and my mate told him to go and ask him his name; he asked him if he had a pass, and the prisoner said, "No."</p>

I am a labourer, of 3, Church-street, Lea—I was with Colvill on Sunday morning, 16th December, and saw smoke arising from some haystacks—I went to the corner where it seemed to have begun, and a piece of paper was pointed out by a young man standing there—I raked it from the corner with a stick and Colvill picked it up and opened it—this is it—about twenty minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner coming up the road—I said nothing to him—I spoke to a constable and he was taken in custody.</p>

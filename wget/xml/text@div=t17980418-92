On Monday I went on board, and found the cabin door broke open, and the property gone; I found the property again, about two o'clock on Monday, at a woman's house that it was sold to.</p>

             sworn. - I keep a chothes shop, in Little Peter-street, Wastminster: On the 18th of March, as nigh as I can remember, between six and seven at night, the prisoner at the bar came to my house, and said he had to ask a favour of me; I asked him what it was, he said, he had got a feather and flock bed and two blankets, if I would be so good as lend him six shillings upon them, he would be very much obliged to me; he pressed me very much to let him have it till he got his wages, and I lent him six shillings upon it, and the next day the constable came and took it away.</p>

             sworn. - The young man told me he had had his barge robbed; and on the Monday he gave me charge of the prisoner; the prisoner told me, he and two more had broke open the cabin door, and if I would settle it for a guinea and a half, he thought it would be better than taking him before a Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise at all, or any threat? - A. Not the least in the world. He told me the things he had stole he had taken to an old iron shop on the Sunday evening, and the person where he had taken them had bought the things; he pointed out the door, and I left him with another officer, and went in, with young Phelps, and told the woman I was coming to search for a bed that was stolen that she had got, and she immediately ran up stairs, I followed her, and she was bringing it out from under the bed; I took her before the Magistrate; I found the blankets, but not the sack.

            , jun. sworn. - About twelve o'clock on Monday I went on board, and I saw that the cabin door was broke open; I can speak to the property; I know it to be my father's; I found the sack hanging over the settle at a public-house, where I heard they had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it ever been seen in the hands of the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I moored the barge safe, and never saw her again; two young fellows that I know asked me to leave this bed for six shillings, at this woman's till Monday morning; I did not know it was my master's bed, or that the cabin was broke open.</p>

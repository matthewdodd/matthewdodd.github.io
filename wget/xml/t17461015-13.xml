            .) Do you know the Child at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Sumers. I am Coachman to Mr. Porter, and I have lost a great many Clothes out of Mr. Porter's Stable; I lost a Great Coat and a Suit of Livery , a Coat and Waistcoat besides.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you them?</p>
               <p>Sumers. I had them four Months.</p>
               <p>Court. You don't lay them as yours?</p>
               <p>Sumers . No, they were my Master's, my Lord, Mr. Porter's. The Livery Clothes were taken out of the Stable the 7th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. What Reason have you to say that the Prisoner at the Bar had any thing to do with taking them ?</p>
               <p>Sumers. On the 28th of September I caught that Boy rising a Ladder against the Lost Door.</p>
               <p>Court. That Boy rise a Ladder!</p>
               <p>Sumers. A small Ladder that we used to clean the Coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose a Cloth Coat of your own , besides your Master's?</p>
               <p>Sumers . Yes, my Lord, it was a Cloth Coat. I lost them the 7th of September, and the 28th I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174610150015"></xptr> catch'd the Prisoner rising the Ladder against the Lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Sumers. I ask'd him what Business he had there? He told me he had lost his Top in the Horse-Pond .</p>
               <p>Q. But what had that to do with the Lost?</p>
               <p>Sumers. It was just by the Lost, where he rose the Ladder; I examin'd, but I could see no such Thing as a Top. About a Fortnight before that, he push'd open the Stable Door; he ask'd me whether it was not a Thorough-fare ; I told him, no. He told me that one of the Bricklayers had sent him up, and told him it was a Thorough-fare . I sent him out . When I took him at the Ladder, he declared to me, he never was in the Yard before .</p>

I had delivered my husband's breeches to her to pawn, to buy fish and a basket with the money, to send her out to sell the fish; she came home and said she had lost the basket; then I was informed she had whored the basket away with a chimney sweeper. I told her of it, and then she said she would go to the Long Fields and drown herself. She went off with my cloak and basket, and two shillings, and another two shillings that I had trusted her with, which she took out of my drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she took it out of your drawer?</p>
               <p>A. Malone. There was nobody to take it but she or I. She took the key of my room away with her, and I was forced to get a man to break my room door. She fold the cloak for seven pence, and the basket for four-pence</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>A. Malone. I was going to Newport-Market, and there I saw my basket standing, with my own name upon it, at a door. I went and got a warrant of justice Welch, and when I came there again my basket was gone. Then I and another that was with me called for a pennyworth of sprats at that house, but the sprats were emptied out of my basket into another, and the prisoner came up out of the cellar in my cloak. I said, how came you by this cloak? She said, you old bitch, what is that to you. I said to the constable that was with me, if that cloak is mine, it is moth eaten at the bottom of it. Then we searched, and found my basket under the stairs in the cellar, so we took her before the justice, where she owned she had sold the cloak for sevenpence, and the basket for four pence. She and her friends quarrelled before the justice, and after that one got a warrant for one, and another for another; but however they all got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own the taking of the money out of the drawer?</p>
               <p>A. Malone. She said she did not see the money. I told her to give me the key, but I could not get it. She said she took the key, and went in and got her dinner, and lock'd the door after her, and left the key under the mat, but I know she took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>A. Malone. Because it was seen in her pocket a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend her the cloak and basket?</p>
               <p>A. Malone. I did. She put my cloak on, and took the basket with her to go to Bilingsgate to buy fish.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

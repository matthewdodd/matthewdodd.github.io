On Tuesday night, 16th Oct., I and the prisoner had been drinking together—we had some brandy and water; as far as my recol<lb></lb>lection goes, three or four sixpenny worths—we also had about two or three pints of porter—the last place we called at was the Sun public-house—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and lodge in the same house with the prisoner and prosecutor, at 2, Newnham-place, Bishopsgate-street Without. On Wednesday morning, Oct. 17th, I heard the prisoner and prosecutor come up to the door—Sault refused coming in—the prisoner said, "Come on, old fellow, let us go in doors"—he said, "I shan't"—a policeman came up, and asked what they were doing there—the prisoner said, "We live here"—the policeman said, "Get in doors both of you"—with that they got in and closed the door—Sault refused going up-stairs—the prisoner said, "Oh, non-sense, old fellow, come along up-stairs, and let us go to bed"—he said, "I won't, I shan't, I shall be <hi rend="italic">done brown</hi> if I do"—with a great deal of per<lb></lb>suasion he went up-stairs—I heard them walk up the first flight of stairs and along the first landing—I heard them go up the second flight, and then heard a great lumbering—I considered they had fallen down—Sault cried out, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>, you have done it, you have murdered me"—with that he ran down—I heard him come about half-way down the last flight of stairs, crying out, "Murder!" and he <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> against the partition of my room—I got out of bed, and putting on my trowsers, I heard the prisoner halloo out, "Mrs. Jones, do pray get up, for Sault is murdered"—I then opened my bed-room door, and saw Mrs. Jones, the landlady, standing on the top of the stairs with a light, and Sault standing with his face and head covered with blood—I asked what he had been doing—he said, "Baker, it is <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> that has done it; <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> has been trying to murder me"—the prisoner came down stairs—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>, what have you been doing to the man?"—he said, "Baker, I have been doing nothing; here has been some strange man come into the house, trying to rob us"—I said, "If you did not do it, go and call a policeman in, and he will see who did do it"—he went, and three policemen came—the prisoner produced a pint pot, bent and bloody, and his hands were bloody, and he said that was the thing that did it—one of the policemen said, "Then you struck the man on the head with that pint pot?"—he said, "No, it was some strange man that came in to rob us; he likewise struck at me; I caught it with my two hands and wrenched it out of his hand, and I struck him on the head five or six times as hard as I could strike him, and he has not got</p>

               <p>much the best of it"—Sault clasped him by the coat, and said, "This is the villain that did it," and gave him in charge to the police—I saw the blood on his head and face, and two or three wounds on the front part of his head—I did not hear anybody go out of the house, or anybody come in but the pri<lb></lb>soner and prosecutor after they came in and closed the door—it was not opened again till I opened it.</p>

On Wednesday morning, 17th Oct., about two o'clock, I was at this house in Newnham-place—I spoke to the prisoner and prosecutor at the door, and induced them to go in—they went in together—after that an outcry was made, and I was called in—I saw Sault's head and clothes covered with blood—he seized hold of the prisoner, and said, "This is the man that has done it"—the prisoner said he did not do it—I said, "Who has done it?"—he said, "Some strange man"—he then produced a pint pot, which I have here, and said, "This is the thing that has done it"—he said, "Some one attempted to hit me with it, and I took it out of his hand, and hammered away as hard as I could; whoever it was did not get much the best of it"—I then said, "Then you have been hitting Mr. Sault"—I afterwards searched the house, and found no strange person in it—the door was bolted—there was nothing to be found on the staircase or landing calculated to inflict any injury, except the pot produced by the prisoner—there were some old hats there; I have one here which I found on the landing, crushed, as if it had been fallen upon—the prisoner said, "That is a strange hat, it does not belong to any one here; that is the hat of the man that did it"—the prisoner had been drinking, but not so much so as not to know what he was about; he was not so bad as Sault—Sault's trowsers were torn from the fob down to the bottom of the leg.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers at the General Post-office. The prisoner was a letter carrier there, and had been so for about fourteen months—his general employment was that of a letter carrier, and in the evening he was engaged in the general business of the office at St. Martin's-le-Grand—on the evening of 18th Dec. he was employed in the office, stamping with the obliterating stamp, till 7 o'clock, in the newspaper office; after that, finishing at the Norwich-road at the Newspaper-office; and then going to the Inland-office, and carrying out the bags to the mails in the yard—about 20 minutes to 8 o'clock he went to the Inland-office, and finished there, ultimately carrying out the bags—some short time before 8 o'clock that evening, I sent for the prisoner into an inner office—Mr. Delany, another inspector, accompanied the prisoner into my office—I said to the prisoner, "A packet is missing from the facing table; do you know anything of it?"—after a little time, he said, "Yes, I do"—I then said, "Where is it?"—he put his hand into his left hand trowsers pocket, took out a packet, and gave it me—the facing table is a large table, upon which newspapers are put previous to their being put before the sorters—the prisoner was occasionally engaged at that table on that evening—it some<lb></lb>times happens, in the course of the business, that packets come to the office among the newspapers—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the packet the prisoner gave me—it is directed to Mr. Titchener, High-street, Chelmsford—I then said to him, "Have you got any more?"—he said, "No"—I then sent for Bingham, the officer, and desired him to search the prisoner—he proceeded to do so, and the prisoner produced another packet from his right hand pocket—this is it—it is directed to Mr. Wilcoxson, druggist, Nottingham—I saw Bingham then take a packet from his coat tail pocket, addressed to Mr. Birch, superintendent of police, Lodden, near Norwich—if packages of that kind had been posted at Upper Berkeley-street or Bishopsgate-street at half past 5 o'clock in the evening, they would arrive at the General Post-office in time to be dispatched by that night's mail into the country—the prisoner was given into custody—his wages were 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he had been absent on leave for two weeks, and had returned on the Monday previous—if any wages were due to him, he would have received them upon going to the proper officer.</p>

               <p>down to the Inland-office, and put with the others—when they come mixed with newspapers, they are put on a large table, and the facer (the person who is put there to take papers round to the sorters) would put them in a basket to be taken to the Inland-office—the prisoner was occasionally on duty as a facer; that night he was stamping—the stampers are in the same room with the sorters and facers, but at a different table.</p>

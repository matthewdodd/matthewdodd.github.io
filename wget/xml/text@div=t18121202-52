Then a person of the name of Sheppard, a constable, came; he asked me to let him look at the sixpence. I shewed it him; he told me to take care of it until he saw me again. I did so; I marked it. The second time I saw him was when he brought Armstrong in with him. I am confident it is the same sixpence. Shepherd the officer has it.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to distinguish this - A. Because I took particular notice of it. It was a plain shilling, and much larger then the other two shillings. I am confident to the shilling.</p>

I said, have not you got halfpence enough; she said, no. I changed the shilling, and gave her change all in halfpence, and soon after she went away Mr. Sheppard came in. I shewed him the shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the shilling apart before you shewed it him - A. No, I put it into the till with two others.</p>
               <p>Q. What enables you to say that the shilling that you gave to Sheppard was the shilling that you took of her - A. I noticed it particular. I had some doubts about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make such observation of it that made you easily to know it - A. Yes, it shone particularly. I can swear positively that I gave Mr. Sheppard the same shilling. I marked it when I gave it to Mr. Sheppard.</p>

            . I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive from Mr. Lucking any shilling - A. I did; that is it.</p>
               <p>Lucking. I am certain that is the shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sheppard. Did you receive one from Mrs. White - A. Yes, this is it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. White. That is the one I gave to Mr. Sheppard; it is the one I received from Armstrong. I noticed the stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sheppard. In consequence of information that you received, have you got a sixpence too - A. This is the sixpence I received of Mrs. Barton.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barton. That is the sixpence Mr. Sheppard had of me.</p>
               <p>Sheppard. On Friday the 13th of November, I saw Armstrong and Butler together. I saw them in Bishopsgate-street first. I followed them into Church-street, Bethnal Green, to a Mrs. Barton's, the person that I have heard examined. I did not observe Armstrong go in. I saw her coming out of Mrs. Barton's. I had watched them all the way down the street, from the time that Armstrong came out of the shop. She had gone about twenty yards forward. I went into Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020038"></xptr>Barton's, and got some information relative to a sixpence. This is the sixpence I produce now. I desired her to mark it, and to lay it by. This was on the 13th. I received the sixpence of Mrs. Barton on the Saturday the 28th. I did not see the prisoners any more on that day, it rained very hard. On Saturday following, on the 28th, in the afternoon, between one and two o'clock, I was in company with Sapwell. We went down Bethnal Green Road. I saw the prisoner Armstrong go into the house of Mrs. Saunders by herself. When she came out I went in and made some enquiries.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any directions to Mrs. Saunders - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any directions to Lucking - A. None at that time. I saw her come out. I followed her further down Bethnal Green Road, then I saw her go into the house of Mrs. White. I saw nothing of Butler then. When she came out, I went in and asked to look at the silver she had taken. I saw a shilling, and told her to mark it, she did so; that is the shilling I now produce to-day. Sapwell and me immediately took her into custody. We took her to Mrs. White's. Sapwell searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your taking her did you make it known for what you took her - A. As soon as we got her into the shop we did; we told her, we apprehended her for passing bad money. She said, for God's sake forgive me, she was a ruined woman. Then Sapwell searched her. I saw her searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, what was found - A. She had some bad silver in her hand, I think two shillings; her hand was closed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any difficulty in getting the shillings from her hand - A. Yes. In her pocket we found some more, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. More what - A. Bad silver, and a quantity of halfpence was in her pocket. We then proceeded to her lodgings; she told us where she lived. She went with us, and we proceeded to search her lodgings. No 6, Skinner-street, Bishopsgate-street. She took us up stairs, it was a one pair back-room, in her lodgings in that room we found a quantity of bad silver.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you are speaking of was Butler there - A. No, she was not at that time. In that room Sapwell found a quantity of bad silver, to what amount I do not know rightly the number, and fifteen shillings worth, I think, in copper money, in halfpence and penny pieces; in a table drawer a quantity of cream of tartar, a bag of copper dust, and a black ball; it is a composition. In a corner cupboard we found a bottle containing aqua fortis; in another cupboard was found a quantity of scouring paper. After finding these, Sapwell put them in the drawer again.

               <p>Q. You were with the last witness, were you not, on Tuesday the 28th - A. I was. I went to Armstrong. I took Armstrong in custody in Bethnal Green-road. After she came out of Mrs. White's, I seized her by both her hands. I never loosed them until I brought her back into the shop. In her left hand I found two base shillings wrapped up in this paper, just as they are now; both her hands were closed. The shillings are in paper now, in the state I found them. I searched her and found an eighteen-penny piece in her pocket, good. I then found a base shilling and a base sixpence in her pocket, loose, and one shilling and seven pence in halfpence in her pocket, loose. I then proceeded with her to her room. Upon searching the room, in this bag, it is a kind of a sleeve of a coat, I found thirteen base shillings and fifteen base sixpences. In this pocket-book I found thirteen sixpences, twelve bad and one good sixpence, one base shilling, and one bad half-crown, and sixteen shillings in copper penny pieces and halfpence in different things about the room, some in one thing and some in another, almost all in a box, and nine shillings and six pence in good money belonging to Armstrong, that I gave to her, I returned the amount to her. I have got the money here. When Mrs. Butler was brought in, I searched her; she had nine shillings, good money, in her pocket, and one base sixpence in her pocket. I then proceeded to search the room in the presence of Sheppard. In a cupboard on the left side of the room I found a bottle with a small quantity of aqua fortis in it, and in the table drawer there was cream of tartar and copper dust, it appeared to me to be filings. I then put them all into the drawer, and sent for Mr. Armstrong, sen.

             came. I delivered all to him, and on further searching the room I found a piece of sand paper and a flannel rag. When I found the aqua fortis bottle in the cupboard, the prisoner Armstrong begged and prayed very hard of me not to produce that bottle, and she cursed the day that she was let into it, or she cursed the man, which I cannot say.

I did, I directed him to be there on Monday morning. Miller apprehended Isaacs. I came up on the 30th, and found Isaacs in the custody of Miller. I searched the prisoner, Isaacs, and found this handkerchief, and these three bad shillings were tied up in the corner of this handkerchief, and a small bit of chalk; he said I was welcome to go and search his lodgings.</p>

               <p>Joshua Armstrong. I believe he is dead. I asked Armstrong whose goods they were, she said the furniture was hers. I then proceeded to Worship-street Office. In going towards the Office, she said she had not been at this business long, but she had been at it ever since her baby was four months old, the child that is in her arms now. She said that she had left it off once, and had taken it up again, on account of her being in a most distressed state that a woman could be in. I then took her to the office.</p>

I stopped there in the bottom room below until two o'clock, and then I went out in order to get some dinner, and returned about three o'clock. At three o'clock the prisoner Isaacs had not come. Then I went to the next door to Mr. Sheppards', and in the mean time I was there Isaacs came to the house, and was apprehended by some women in the house. They had closed the door upon him. They sent to the next door for me. Mr. Sheppard and I came. The prisoner was in the street in the custody of two men. I laid hold of him, and told him that I was an officer, and me and the other two men got him into the house. He struggled a good bit. I got him in and told him that I wanted to search him; upon him I found three three-shilling Bank tokens, good, and a good shilling, and twopence halfpenny, and I found one three-shilling token, five shillings, and five sixpences base. I have got them now. Sapwell came to my assistance. I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>COURT. You did not see the money, you saw him take something out of his pocket - A. Yes, out of his breeches pocket, and out of his coat pocket. I heard the jingling when he came down stairs, and he was counting the money after he came out of the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. On the day of his apprehension do you remember his coming to the house - A. Yes, I was at home, it was between three and four. When he came he went up stairs in a great hurry to the prisoners room. He tried the door; it was locked; he came down again directly. I said, you shall not go out here. Mrs. Nicolls was with me, and then he hollowed out murder. He said he was going to be robbed and murdered, and fell backwards; then he soon recovered himself, and ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020040"></xptr>to the back door; he jumped over the palings; then two men came and caught hold of him, and Mr. Miller and another person brought him into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him searched - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember our husband living at No. 60, Skinner-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you transfer your lease to Mrs. Nicolls - A. Yes. I had them as lodgers of the people I took the house on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Isaacs the prisoner - A. I have been in the habit of seeing him coming backwards and forwards to Mrs. Blay and her daughter. I always understood her name was Blay.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean Butler? - A. Yes. I always understood his name was Blay.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Isaacs used to come frequently - A. For the last three months previous to my going away I have seen him frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. How often in the course of a week used he to be coming - A. I cannot say, as I have been sitting in my room I have seen him go up stairs, perhaps once a week, but he never stopped long. I asked the old lady what he used to come for. She said he brought her some old clothes to sell in the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what was going on in the room - A. No. I smelled very often a disagreeable smell; one morning in particular when I went for a light, about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they generally use to rise - A. About six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a smell was this - A. It smelled like campher. I smelled afterwards the bottle of aqua fortis at Worship-street office, it smelled the same. It is the same kind of smell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoners carried on any business in your house - A. I do not know what the young woman did. I do know that the old woman used to make soldiers breeches at twopence farthing a pair, either twopence halfpenny or twopence farthing, I do not know which.</p>

               <p>Q. I put into your hand the sixpence uttered to Mrs. Barton - A. It is a counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the one uttered to Mrs. Saunders produced by Lucking - A. That is a counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the one uttered to Mrs. White - A. A counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Q. I am going to put in your hands what was found in the prisoners lodgings on the 28th, thirteen shillings and fifteen sixpences - A. They are all counterfeit, they are not so highly coloured as the two shillings and sixpence; they are changed from being kept long, or from not being completely finished.</p>

               <p>Q. These are what was found in her hand - A. They are both counterfeits, they are in a state for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them found in the prisoners pockets - A. They are both counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them found in that pocket-book Sapwell found in the prisoners room - A. There are thirteen shillings and sixpence there, they are all bad, except one sixpence, and the half crown is bad too.</p>
               <p>Miller. I produce those I found, some out of Isaacs' breeches pockets and some out of his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. They are all very bad, not fit for circulation, five shillings, four sixpences, and a three shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Sapwell. These three shillings was found in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. They are very bad.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been a great many years - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are well acquainted with the usual materials that are produced in trials of this sort, and what their operations are - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Is paper a useful material - A. It is for preparing the blanks for colouring, and cream of tartar is also necessary for colouring. This sand paper is of a particular sort, which is used in the manufacturing of counterfeit money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is aqua fortis likewise of use in the process - A. Yes, it is. Aqua fortis is a particular ingredient, destroying the copper, and leaving the particles of silver which is mixed in the body of the metal, and bringing the particles of silver which are in the copper to the surface, and giving it that white colour; and after the colour of silver is given to the piece, it being too bright for circulation, the blacking ball, being a particular composition, is used to rub over it, to take off that brightness, which makes it appear as if it had been in circulation, and a flannel like this is often found in cases of this sort, to wipe off this blacking when it is used. The several things that have been described and produced are used in colouring metal, and they are sufficient to produce the colouring.</p>

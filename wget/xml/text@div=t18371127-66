                  </hi>. I live at Dagenham, in Essex, and am a farmer On the 23rd of September the prisoner was employed by me as a porter and salesman—Richard Lee was then my servant—he is not so now—the I prisoner used to sell for me till I came to the market—I sent the prisoner that morning 20 1/2 cwt. of potatoes, and after we had done selling, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Bill,"</hi> says I," you had 20 1/2 cwt. this morning"—"No, master," says he, "I only received 14 1/2 cwt. "—I said, "This is strange, when I sent 20 1/2 cwt." the other 6cwt. would weigh about 670lbs.—he did not pay for that—he I accounted for the rest—I went home and spoke to Lee—I gave Lee 20 1/2cwt. I to give him, and he accounted for the rest.</p>

I should think were sold—I settled with him about eleven o'clock—I lost my weights the same week—I think it was before the po<lb></lb>tatoes were sent—my son is very busy, and we did not know he was wanted—he is well acquainted with the prisoner—the prisoner was not a servant of mine—he had the entire control of this property in his care to dispose of—I never could find any difference between the weight of a bushel of large and small potatoes.</p>

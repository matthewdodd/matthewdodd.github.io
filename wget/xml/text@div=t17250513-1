               <p>William Brown thus depos'd: I having two Guineas to pay for Excise, I ty'd it up in a Silk Handkerchief, and sent it by my Daughter Ann Brown, a Child about 10 Years old.

I was told by others, that a Man in a Sailor's Jacket was seen to have such a Handkerchief, and ran down Hounsditch. A Fellow being afterward, seen in such a Jacket, (which was distinguishable by three odd Buttons) he was apprehended, and upon Examination it appear'd that he was the Prisoner's Brother, and that not himself but the Prisoner had that Jacket on when the Girl lost the Money. By his Directions we found the Prisoner at the House of

            , the Cherry-Tree in Golden-Lane. This is the Handkerchief that I ty'd the Money in when I gave it to the Girl, and this same Handkerchief I found about the Prisoner's Neck when he was taken. He confess'd that he met with it near Bishopsgate, and from thence immediately ran through Devonshire-Square into Still-Alley, and there untying it, he found two Guineas in it. He is a Fellow of an ill Character, and has not been long out of New-Prison.</p>

             thus depos'd: As I was cleaning Shoos in the Street near Bishopsgate, about Nine in the Morning, I saw the Prisoner pass by me, turn the Lappet of his Jacket aside, thrust a colour'd Handkerchief into his Breeches Pocket, and run down Hounsditch; and presently after I heard the Child Ann Brown crying for the Loss of her Money. Ann Brown deposed, that she lost the Money under Bishopsgate.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence: As I was going along Bishopsgate-street, over against the Church, I happen'd to see this Handkerchief lying upon the Ground; so I took it up, and holding it in my Hand, Who has lost a Handkerchief? says I. Whereupon a Gentlewoman that sells Apples cry'd Halves. But when I open'd it, and found two Guineas in it, 'Tis all your own, young Man, says he, and much good may't do you. If the Gentlewoman was here, she'd say the same thing herself. As for my being in New-Prison, it was for no Harm, for I never did an ill thing in my Life: 'Twas only for Face-making, (that is) getting of Bastard Children. <rs id="t17250513-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

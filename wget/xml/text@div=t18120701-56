He said, he wanted to buy a horse. He said, he lived at Lamb-farm, Kingsland-road. He said, he had been selling a poney to a man of the name of Hurst, upon Tower-hill. He said, that he wanted a cart-horse for himself. I shewed him different horses. He fixed on one; the price was thirteen guineas. In payment he offered this check, which he said he look of Mr. Hurst for the poney that he had been selling. He requested me to give him the difference. I took the check in my hand, and looked at it: he asked me if I could not get the difference at the public-house I used. I told him, I would not try. I told him, if he would give me any sum of money in part of payment, I would send the horse to him at any given time, to any place he chosed, or keep it to any time. He gave me a one-pound note, and agreed for me to send the horse, the following morning, to the Fox, in Kingsland-road, where my man went to receive twelve pound thirteen shillings. After this, I have only by hearsay. The man's name is Towerson, that took the check for me. The officer has got the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the same check - A. It is the same name. My man took it on the 27th of June. The man is dead that took it.</p>

               <p>Bishop. I went with Mr. Kew to apprehend him. I could not find him. I went to Lamb-farm, and Smithfield-market, and could not apprehend him. I never could meet with him. I have been after him several times.</p>

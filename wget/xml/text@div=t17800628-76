On the 7th of June, a very numerous mob came to my house between six and seven in the evening; they called for my books and looked over them. I showed them a Bible and other books; they seemed very well satisfied; they had what liquor they liked. When they went out at the door some of them shook hands with me and wished me well, and cried three times, No Popery. They went down the street about twenty or thirty yards. The prisoner was standing at her own door; she lives about fifteen or twenty yards from my house. She halloo'd to the ring-leaders of the mob as they were going off, and called them back.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the expressions she made use of? - She said I was a rank Papist.</p>
               <p>Was her husband with her? - He was at the door at the time.</p>
               <p>Court to the Counsel. When you have proved the presence of her husband you cannot charge her with a felony.</p>
               <p>Counsel. We have to produce abundance of evidence of this woman's conduct when her husband was not present; though I conceive the evidence should be given when her husband was present, because if it was done by the order of the husband it will be liable to that observation, and it will be for the jury to determine whether what she did was by the direction of her husband.</p>
               <p>Court. Having proved the presence of her husband at the commencement of the felony, if she does an act consistent with and of the same nature of that felony when she was not with her husband it is the same species of felony.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. I beg the court will permit me to go through the evidence and then I think there will not be the smallest doubt of this being the voluntary act of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What passed after the prisoner halloo'd them back? - They came directly to my house; they said they were going to pull it down.</p>
               <p>You were going to mention the expressions she used? - They had been talking to her, and she sent them to my house. She said I was a rank Papist and my house must come down. The mob came and said, that both Mr. and Mrs. Clark told them I was a Papist and my house must come down.</p>
               <p>You did not hear the husband say any thing? - The mob said, We will let you know the informers, and they went over to Clark's door while they were both there.</p>
               <p>Court. You heard neither of them? - I heard the wife say, I was a rank Papist.</p>
               <p>Court. How far were they from you? - Ten or fifteen yards. I went over with the mob to Clark's door; the mob said he and his wife were the persons, putting their hands on their shoulders.</p>
               <p>Did you see the husband beckon them back? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. He said on a former trial, that there was the husband and wife at the door, and that they beckoned them back. He says now, after going some way down the street, Clark and his wife halloo'd them back, and said I was a rank Papist.</p>
               <p>How long after that was it before your house was destroyed? - In three or four minutes time they took all the front down, and all the furniture out.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When you say you heard these words the mob were in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not the mob hinder you from hearing any thing at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was it swore against this woman before the justice, I see the commitment says you and others? - There were Bevan and Chambers, and Lyon I believe was one.</p>
               <p>Was not a relation of yours first of all charged by the husband of this woman for being in the riots at the same place? - There was a person charged.</p>
               <p>A relation of yours? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was not a cousin of your's taken into custody? - Not that I know of; I know nothing about him.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of Crockall? - No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280177"></xptr>Do you know one Wrinkle? - I know one Wrinkle, who uses my house.</p>
               <p>Is not he a relation of yours? - I do not know that he is.</p>
               <p>Was he taken up? - I was told so, I do not know it of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>I understand he was taken up for threatening to pull down the house of the prisoner's husband, and that he lodged in his house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he lodge in your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Did you say you would make good your loss by occasions of this sort? - I never did.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner taken up? - On the Monday of the riots I believe.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was not taken up till the 12th - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>On the 12th she was examined, you was then before the justice? - Yes, I was told she was taken up on the Monday after.</p>
               <p>Do not you know when she was taken up? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was she taken up upon your information? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As she was your neighbour, and you had heard her say these words, how came you not to complain of it till six days after? - I went and informed the colonel of the light-horse in the Artillery-ground, that they were the occasion of destroying my-house.</p>
               <p>How soon after? - A day or two after; he said they were persons of property, and would not run away.</p>
               <p>Did you make any complaint against the woman or the husband? - Against both.</p>
               <p>Did not the officer go to take the husband only and not the wife in consequence of your information? - I gave the information alike against them both. The City Martial came on the Sunday night and brought the guards to this man's house; they broke the door open, and while they were breaking the door open, he got out backwards and went away.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner taken at that time? - No, not till Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you claim the reward? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a peruke maker. I live next door to Mrs. Clark, at No. 9, in Golden-lane. I was in the lane during the whole time Mr. Murphy's house was pulled down; I saw the prisoner there during the whole time; the first I saw of it was the rioters went into Mr. Murphy's house; they came out; they seemed satisfied and went away. Mrs. Clark beckoned and called them back again; then they returned and the house was entirely destroyed.</p>
               <p>She beckoned and called them back? - Yes; what she said I cannot tell; after that she was in the street in the midst of them; there was some drawers of a double chest thrown out empty; she clapped her bands together and seemed glad of it.</p>

               <p>What were the mob doing at that time? - Destroying Mr. Murphy's house.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner's husband there? - No, not during all the time.</p>
               <p>How long was the house demolishing? - They began between six and seven o'clock, and I believe by eight o'clock it was demolished.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You was there the whole time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say you did not hear what the prisoner said to the mob? - No, I did not hear what she said.</p>
               <p>Perhaps she said nothing at all? - Perhaps she might; I only saw her clap her hands, and she seemed to rejoice.</p>
               <p>You did not see the husband there the whole time? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Where did you stand at the time you saw her beckon the mob? - My shop was shut up; I was in my one-pair-of-stairs room to care of my house.</p>
               <p>How far was you from the prisoner? - As far as to that candlestick.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the evening when Mr. Murphy's house was attacked? - Yes, it was the 7th of June.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing Mrs. Clark that evening in Golden-lane? - I saw her at her own door at the time that the mob went into Mr. Murphy's house, and likewise when they came out of the house; before they began to destroy it I observed her speaking; I was not nigh enough to understand what she said. I heard her say at my door to one Waters, who is very much deformed, If they were not Roman Catholicks why did they keep Irish wakes? Then he said, Blast his eyes and limbs! the house should come down; and he was the first who went in. I heard her say to the mob they were Irish

               <p>What was said or done upon that? - They went in and did all the mischief they could.</p>

               <p>Being flurried could not cause you to say you did not hear what was said? - I am very much flurried.</p>

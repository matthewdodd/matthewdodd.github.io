            . My brother left me at home - I was sitting in the parlour, and heard the shop window crack about ten o'clock - I went out instantly at the private door and secured the prisoner, whom I found at the window, and saw the ear-rings found down at his feet - the window was unbroken before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you quite sure the window was not cracked before? A. There was a crack across the pane, but not in the part he broke - the glass was all in the window before I heard the crack - I had seen the crack that day, but I had not looked at it that evening - I cannot swear it was not more broken before ten o'clock - on coming out I saw the man at the window - my brother had goods in the window - people frequently stopped to look in - I saw the prisoner and another at the window - there were no things hanging in the window to prevent my seeing - there was plenty of space, and I could see his person through the shop, because there was plenty of light - the other man ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, were not the rings found on the spot where the other man stood? A. No, they might have been half-a-foot from where he stood.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The ear-rings were at the prisoner's feet?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200030"></xptr>A. Yes - I went out immediately I heard the crack - I have not a doubt the window was broken at that time.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's sister - on the 15th of January, about ten o'clock, I saw my brother go out at the private door - I went out at the shop door and saw my brother holding the prisoner, and the ear-rings lying about six inches from the window - I took them up and gave them to my brother.</p>

I was coming down the road, passing the shop - I saw a man at the window, and when I got six yards from the window the prosecutor ran out, and said to him, "What are you doing there?" I turned round to see what was the matter; the man ran away, and he laid hold of me.</p>

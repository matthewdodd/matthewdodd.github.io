                  </hi>. I am a draper of Whitechapel, and have a warehouse in Great-garden-street—the prisoner keeps a chandler's shop next door but one to me—some time ago he was summoned by the police for obstructing the pavement—there was no quarrel between us before that, but after he was fined by the Magistrate, he pulled me indoors and said, "Unless you pay me all I have been fined, and remove the police, I shall do something that you will not like"—up to that time I had not interfered in any way whatever, or given directions to the police—there was an obstruction on the pavement, but I did not care about it—it was the police who interfered—he was afterwards fined a second time at the instance of the police—he did not pay the fine, and went five days to prison—after that he had placards out one after the other—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HENRY MITCHELL</hi>, <hi rend="italic">solicitor, proved the service of a notice upon the prisoner, on</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th July, to produce the original placards, he being then out on bail</hi>)—The placards, of which these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are copies, were exhibited in front of the prisoner's house, and mobs of people assembled to read them—that continued for more than a month—after he was committed at the police-court he took them away, but they were ex<lb></lb>hibited on that very day—they have not been put up since he was</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, H</hi> 20). I known the defendant—on 9th June, I was sent by the inspector, and saw the prisoner standing on his door-step, declaiming to two hundred low people outside that he had been persecuted by the Jew draper and the police—the placards were all outside—I have read them so often that I could repeat them—I have often laughed at them—I told the prisoner I had been sent down by the inspector; that the police had been sent too, as the street was literally blocked up, which was very serious—I said, "I do not know you, neither do I know the Messrs. Nathan; I have come with the best feelings in the world to you"—I said that I did not know whether there was any quarrel between him and Nathan, but if there was I did not partake of it, and asked him to take down the placards—he said, "I will not"—I then said that I wished to speak to him inside—he allowed me to go in, and I said, "I do not want you to pull them down now; I do not want the people to see that there is any victory over you, but do not put them up to-morrow; it must be injuring your business"—he said, "There is the mistake; people come and read these placards, and come and deal with me through sympathy," and while I was speaking to him some people came in, one female, particularly, who bought some soap—she said that she did not want the soap, but wanted to know what I was saying to him—I said, "Excuse me; I suppose you think I am like the rest of the police, being bribed and purchased by Mr. Nathan, but I am not"—next morning I went again, but he was not there—I went again, and he was hanging them up—I said, "Do you remember my being here yesterday; I did not expect you would take them down yesterday, but I did not expect you would hang them up again; it is extremely obstinate of you; these crowds will be here again to-day"—he was then hanging up one about three feet square, stencilled out with large letters an inch deep—he said that he would not take them in—I persevered and went inside, and entreated him—he said that he supposed I felt sore about the allusion to the police—I said, "No"—he asked me if I had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket—I said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150058"></xptr>
               <p>" No"—he said, "If you are prepared to pay me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will take them in"—I said, "My good Sir, it is not worth so much to me"—he said, "Well, them that sent you"—he also said that there were no names on the placard—I said, "It does not matter; people know who you mean, and Mr. Nathan has his shop closed"—that was caused by the shouting of the crowd outside, to the best of my judgment, and after I left Mr. Nathan beckoned to me, called me in, and told me he was compelled to close—this was the 10th of June, and the placards continued up about a fortnight before this summons was issued, and also while the summons was being heard, even after a caution to take them down during the adjournment.</p>

Bank of England note, which I gave him: he went out with it, and I never saw him till I saw him with the Officer; I went to the Police-Office, and we traced him to a number of places, but he was not taken for three weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You knew him before? - A. No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been some conversation previous to the note business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking together? - A. Yes, but not much.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there? - A. Probably more than an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alone or with other people? - A. With other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he? - A. I cannot say; he appeared to me to be a sober consistent man, and therefore I trusted him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the note? - A.No, I had it about three days; we met at a public-house opposite, and I went to his house to get shaved; I was not there two minutes before he had the note.</p>
               <p>ROBERT GRIFFITHS sworn. - I apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of September, about six o'clock, sitting in a tap-room, in Mill-yard, Whitechapel; I told him I wanted him, and asked him what he did with the 40 l. note the gentleman gave him to get change for; he said he had spent it; I asked him to let me see what money he had about him; he said I should and welcome; I searched him, and found one half-crown piece, and I believe threepenny-worth of halfpence; I asked him where he had been, and what he had done with all the money in so short a time; he said, I went down to Norwich, and on my road I saw numbers of people begging, and I thought they should have a little of it, as well as me, and I threw some to them; that is the way I got rid of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He told you readily? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you were an Officer? - A. Yes; I told him I thought he was a great fool to spend the money in the manner he had; yes, says he, and the gentleman was as great a fool as me for trusting me with it; I said I thought so too.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, but I never knew any harm of him.</p>

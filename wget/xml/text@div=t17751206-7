            . I am a <rs id="t17751206-7-viclabel31" type="occupation">labourer</rs>. The 20th of last month I went into one Petro's, in <placeName id="t17751206-7-crimeloc32">Pye-street, Westminster</placeName>

I got more beer, and had my pocket picked of the money and my watch.</p>
               <p>How much had you to pay for the beer? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Did they sit by you? - I don't know: I fell asleep, and cannot well say when I awoke; but when I did, I missed my money and watch: I did not take notice of missing it when they first went out. Mr. Petro asked me, if I had not a watch? - I said, yes; but did not know what was become of it. He said the prisoner had taken it?</p>
               <p>What did you do when you awoke? - I was carried before a justice to prove the watch. I knew I had lost both money and watch before I went out. Jones and Wright took me before the justice, likewise the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was there any body but the prisoner with you in the house? - Yes; there were three women. Next morning, when I was more sober, I was carried before the justice again to give an account of what I had lost.</p>
               <p>What do you labour in? - I attend a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>How came you to have all this money? - I was earning it this year and half, and sweated much for it.</p>
               <p>You did not perceive that your money and watch was gone till you awoke? - No.</p>
               <p>Was this woman in your company? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>When you awoke was she there or not? - No; when Petro found I had lost my watch, he sent for them back again. (The watch was produced and sworn to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Is Petro here? - I don't know: I gave him notice to come.</p>
               <p>What day in the week did it happen? - On a Tuesday.</p>

            . I am assistant to justice Durden. Mr. Jones and I were informed that this man had lost his watch. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060041"></xptr> went to the sign of the Bell in Pye-street: there were three girls and the prosecutor, who was not able to hold his head up, being so much in liquor. I said to the prisoner, where is the watch? She said, Mr. Wright, I have the watch here, and pulled it out from the breast of her stays; he left it with me for five shillings. We took them all before the justice, who discharged all but this girl. The prosecutor came next day, and said he had lost some money; but when he was there before, he said he had no money.</p>

            . Mr. Wright and I went down to the public house in Pye-street, as he has told you. When on our way to the justice the prisoner took out three guineas, and gave to me to keep for her, in case she should be sent to Newgate. The prosecutor said, he had no money: as soon as Mr. Wright went in, he said, give me the watch. The prisoner gave it him, and said she had it of the prosecutor to keep for five shillings. Mr. Petro said the prosecutor had not money to pay for his beer, and a glass he had broke.</p>

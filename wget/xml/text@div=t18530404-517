                  </hi>. I am foreman of the carpenters employed by Messrs. Hill and Moore, contractors for the Stratford Extension Railway works, in the parish of West Ham. I know the prisoner; he was one of the carpenters under me—on Monday evening, 28th March, he was employed in one of the sheds of Messrs. Hill and Moore—about half past 6 o'clock, as I was walking down the shed, I saw the prisoner coming down the ladder leading from the shed to the ground with a basket in his hand, which looked heavy—he went towards the railway arch—he did not go out at the gate but got over the wall—I got over the wall twenty yards from him, called him back, and asked him what he had got in the basket; he said he had a few pieces of lead to run a <hi rend="italic">plumb bob</hi> with—that would take from a quarter of a pound up to a pound and a half, not more—I asked him who give Mm leave to take it; he said, "Young Farrow, the plumber's son"—I told him he had no business to take it, and said young Farrow had no business to give him anything—he said he was very sorry, he would take it back; I said I would take care of it myself—I looked inside the basket and found some lead, which turned out at the station to weigh 15 lbs.—I locked it up in the office, and sent the key to Mr. Dollamore, who is here—no one had the least authority to give the prisoner</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the works of Hill and Moore at the Eastern Counties Extension works. On Tuesday morning, 29th March, in consequence of information, I gave the prisoner into custody—no one but myself was allowed to take anything from the works, and no one was empowered to give leave without my sanction, neither Farrow nor anybody else.</p>

            . I was at the corner of Peter-street, the last witness was enquiring for an officer, saying two boys had robbed a gentleman. He described them, I took him down into Black Boy-alley, the prisoner stood there with two others, he turned down Field-lane - we ran down another way and took him; he said he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was playing at marbles - he came and took me. I asked what I had done; he said if I did not hold my tongue, he would knock my d - d young head off, and when he got me to the office, he accused of this, which I am innocent of.</p>

I had seen it all secure a quarter of an hour before. I was sober, but being tired I fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you quite in your sober senses? A. Yes; I had only drank a little beer; this man came and sat down by me: I had dropped asleep, and was awoke by his fumbling about; he was about five minutes in doing it - I did not seize him, because it did not directly strike me that there was any thing wrong- it was not possible for me to drop these things from my pocket; I was not off my legs five minutes; the clock had struck one before I sat down.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner tell you that what he had, he had picked up? A. Yes; the prisoner pulled the bag out of his pocket, and gave it me, and then the prosecutor gave charge of him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

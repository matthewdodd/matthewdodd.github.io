On the 29th of December, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I saw three men pass my shop, turn the corner, and make a stop; I told my boy to look out, and in about three minutes the boy said, "Halloo, master - what have you got at?" a piece of pork was then gone; I saw Mason running away: the boy pursued him, and cried Stop thief! I saw two men run from the place where they had all stopped; I did not see Atkinson when Mason ran away; but I had seen them together about three minutes before, and am quite certain of their persons; neither of them were taken that night.</p>

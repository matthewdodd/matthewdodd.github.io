They ran after me and knocked me down: There were two of them, one was a black complexioned man, and the other was carrotty, and I take the Prisoner Crossley to be him. The 2 other Prisoners were not there, but the Prisoner Crossley laid hold of me, and knocked me down. When I was upon the Ground, they ran away without taking any Thing from me, so I began to put up my Things in order to go away, but they returned in less than a quarter of an Hour and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174107010014"></xptr> knocked me down on my Face again. Then they took off my Pocket in which was a Loadstone, 3 Keys, a Seal, a brass Ring and a silver Penny, and 2 lb of Butter out of my Basket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this did you see the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Perry. He worked at Mr. Lewis's at Holloway, and I saw him there two or three days afterwards: I knew him by sight before he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any Body he was one of the persons that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Perry. No, I was afraid I should get a mischief; and I had not taken him up now, but I was summoned in about a fortnight or three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make no discovery that Crossley was one of the men before you was summoned in?</p>
               <p>Perry. Yes; I told Mrs. Row at the White-Swan, that the man who rode the Horses at the Horse and Groom was one of the persons. I am positive he is one of them, and none of the other Prisoners were present except him.</p>

             and I went out together with a design to rob on the 1st Wednesday in last November was twelvemonths. Crossley and I went up to this Woman in the Long Canseway in Holloway Road, and knocked her down. Hagan and Rawlins stood at a distance to watch while we robbed her, and as soon as we had done, they went to their lodging; and Crossley and I went to Mr. Lewis's Hay-Loft where we usually lay.</p>
               <p>Q. When you parted with the Prisoners did you meet again?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, we parted the Booty the very same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you divide it?</p>
               <p>White. We divided it in the Road before we parted, and then Crossley and I went to Lewis's Hay Lost, and the other 2 Prisoners went to Mr. Banister's where they lodged. We broke the Loadstone which we took out of this Woman's Pocket, and sold the Silver which belonged to it for 2 d. and shared it among us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that and the Penny divided among you?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, and there was about ten Pennyworth of Half-pence and we had all share and share alike. We likewise took a bunch of Keys, which we flung with the rest of the things into a pond.</p>
               <p>Perry. I don't know that I had any Half pence at all about me at this time.</p>
               <p>Jury to White. What could you divide a piece out of that money?</p>
               <p>White. We drank it out in liquor.</p>
               <p>Crossley. Where did you sell the silver which you took from the Loadstone?</p>
               <p>White. We sold it for 2 d, at a Silversmith's on London-Bridge.</p>
               <p>Crossley. Where did we drink the liquor?</p>
               <p>White. We had it the next day at Banister's at the Castle.</p>
               <p>Crossley. How much liquor had we?</p>
               <p>White. We had about 2 or 3 full pots as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. to Perry. Is that man (White) like the person that attacked you?</p>
               <p>Perry. No, he was a blackish complexioned man, and had a hollowness in his cheeks - I don't believe White was one of them.</p>

            . On the 14th of September last between 11 and 12 o'Clock, the prisoners and I met a man just by the Hole in the Wall near Canbury House at Islington. Crossley came up to him and stopped him, and he knocked Crossley down: I went up to Crossley's assistance and he knocked me down. Then Hagan came before him and knocked him down, and kept beating him with a broomstick 'till we recovered ourselves, to rifle his pockets: Hagan swore we should kill him and then he would have no suspicion of us, so we put him into the ditch, and left him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bigg, Surgeon. On the 15th of September the deceased was received into our Ward. He had a great number of contusions, and his head was beat almost to a Jelly. I ask'd him if he had any retchings upon him, he said he was only sick and saint, and during this time he was perfectly sensible, and continued so for above 10 days. I asked him how this accident happened, and he said he had been to carry money to pay for his Child's nursing, and was met by 4 or 5 men, 2 of whom he could have master'd, had not the others come up and flung him into the ditch, for he was a very sturdy man, almost 6 foot high. At first I had great hopes of his life, for I could find no fissure in his skull; but some time afterwards on enlarging the wound, found there was a necessity to trepan it. The membranes look'd of a very bad colour underneath, and on laying them open farther, I found a fissure which ran quite under the temporal bone, and entirely divided the orbit of his eye, and he absolutely died of the wound which he received at that time.</p>
               <p>Jury to White. Are you positive the Prisoners were present at the commission of this murder?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, we all went out with intent to rob. We have known one another 5 or 6 years, and followed labouring work; sometimes we went out on this Lay, and sometimes got drunk and spent our money.</p>

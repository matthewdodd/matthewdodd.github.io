                  </hi>. I am the wife of Matthew Aylett, and live in Marsh-street, Walthamstow. About four o'clock, on the 2nd of Oct. I was in the washhouse, at the back of my shop—the prisoner and another boy, named Laws, came in for some gingerbread—I served them—they went out again, and about half-past five they came in again for a brown cake—the box of scales and weights were in the till—I did not miss them till the policeman came to acquaint me of it—my husband saw the scales again at the station—I missed them—I am certain the prisoner was in the shop.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Daniels. The prisoner came out of the kitchen laughing. The spoons were missing on the 17th of June. I asked her what she had done with them; she said, she had pawned them at Mr. Burrow's, in Barbican, for a guinea; she had paid a little of the money to one and to another. I said, it was a wonder any pawnbroker would take in spoons of her; she said, she always pawned there; they knew her. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>SPIRE HOLLOWAY. I am a silk manufacturer. I live in Mile-end-road. I went with Mr. Daniels to Mr. Burrows; in consequence of what the girl said, I asked Mr. Burrows to let me see the spoons that had been pledged the day before; I described the spoons and the girl to him. Mr. Burrows denied having taken many such spoons of any such person, or any table-spoons of any description at that time. I returned with Mr. Daniels to his house. I addressed myself to the girl; I asked her how she could assert such a falsity, to say that she pledged the spoons at Mr. Burrows. I asked her for the truth, and insisted upon knowing where they were pledged; she said, she had told all the truth to Miss Daniels. I then said, what is the truth; she then said, that she had actually pledged them at Mr. Burrows, in Barbican, for a guinea. I told her that was a falsity, they were not there. She made a long pause, and then denied that ever she had been the thief. She had previously told me that she lost the duplicate out of her bosom. She said, all this was an invention; I examined Mr. Burrows's books; I did not find such an entry in it.</p>

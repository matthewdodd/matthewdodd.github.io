I first gave him some silver, but he said that would not do; in short, they rifled my pockets, and took the articles in the indictment. The spectacles I had on; I saw no arms that the men had. I am not sure of the prisoner, but I think I can be sure of the person of Lowe, who came up first, his face corresponds with the recollection I have; the face of the other I never saw. I imagine they were with me not beyond five minutes; after they left me, in a few yards they attempted to stop another gentleman, who called the centinel, and the men ran away. I never saw the men again till now; I have seen my property since. I have no recollection of their dress.</p>

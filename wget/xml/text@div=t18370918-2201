                  </hi>. I live in Praed-street, Paddington—I knew the prisoner and his wife, as neighbours—they lived next door to me—the prisoner is a gardener. On Monday the 11th of September as I was going to bed at half past 12 o'clock, I heard Mrs. Davis groaning next door—I went, and found her lying in the passage, bleeding from a wound in the right arm, very much—it was a deep wound—a surgeon was sent for immediately, and came, I should think rather better than an hour after I was there—it was Mr. Philpot's apprentice—the prisoner had locked him self up stairs in his bed-room when the surgeon came—I had put a towel round Mrs. Davis's arm, and held it tight till further assistance came—I prevailed on the prisoner to open his door, and asked him how he came to do such a dreadful thing—he said Mrs. Davis had been quarrelling with him, and struck him several times—that he took the knife out of his pocket to cut a candle in two, and in an unguarded moment he thrust it into her arm—he said she had struck him first three or four times with a stick—I saw the knife—it was in a case, and is a pruning-knife—it is here—he said he was very sorry for what he had done—I saw Mrs. Davis once or twice every day till she died, which was about half-past one o'clock on the Saturday—they were both sober—I never knew them to be otherwise—she did not tell me in his presence how it happened—it was about half past twelve o'clock when I went in—she told</p>

               <p>me of it next day—I do not think she had any apprehension that she should die then—the prisoner is a very old man, and is very bad at times in his head and his mind—his wife told me the day after, that she struck him three or four times with a stick before he did it, and she did not think he did it intentionally, and did not think he would have done it if she had not struck him—I know he is subject to fits—I have seen him lay for half an hour together in a fit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Upper Southgate street, Paddington. I saw the deceased on Tuesday morning, the 12th, between nine and ten o'clock—I found her in bed, on the floor, and complaining of severe pain in the right arm—I examined it, and found a wound in the inner side of the upper part of the arm—all the superficial veins were divided, but not the artery—she had lost a considerable deal of blood—it was a stab, I should call it—this knife would have done it—it appeared to have gone in about half an inch, and then cut its way out—I attended her until her death—the wound got on very well till the Wednesday afternoon—there was then some inflammation of the veins came on, which subsided by the Thursday afternoon, and when I saw her on Friday morning, erysipelas had taken place—it began from the wound, extended up to the shoulder, and the whole of the side, and terminated in gangrene and mortification—she died on the Saturday—I have not the least difficulty in saying she died from the erysipelas and gangrene produced by the wound—she was not at all apprehensive of dying when I first saw her——she was seventy-two years old—I saw the prisoner on the Saturday morning, the day of his wife's death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. My wife and I went to a dahlia show—when I went in I asked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as I wanted a pint of beer, and she began to grumble—my daughter gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I had a penny-worth of beer—I stopped a bit, and drank some gin and water, and walked about—when I got home I had a candle, and was reading—a knock came to the door several times—I was going down stairs, and a little black cat ran and knocked the candle down—I could not find the candle directly—I got it and went down stairs, and she began <hi rend="italic">blowing me up</hi> again, saying what was I so long about, and all that, and seeing there was no light, she got a stick, and kept <hi rend="italic">walloping</hi> me—I told her what was the cause of it—I had a knife cutting a candle—because I could not light it she kept hitting me again, and at last, somehow or other, she got cut—she began to halloo, and shout out "Murder! murder! blood! blood!"—I did not see what was the matter with her, and ran up stairs—I called to the people to know what was the matter with her, and a policeman and Mrs. Malcolm came—she begged of me to give up the knife, and I was taken to the station-house—I never struck at her, nor <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> at all; and I understand she said it was her own fault for <hi rend="italic">gagging</hi> at me.</p>

I have known the prisoner four years—I have heard a few words pass between him and his wife—he was never in toxicated, and I do not think he was a bad husband—I never saw any thing imporper in his conduct—I never knew her strike him before—he is a hard-working, industrious man, and I think he was a kind and affectionate husband, but his head has been very bad at times—he often expressed to me that his head was so bad he often did and said things he was very sorry for.</p>

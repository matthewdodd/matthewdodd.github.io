                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—we lived at Maria-terrace, North Woolwich-road, Plaistow Marsh—on 3d July we went to bed together about 10 o'clock, and I went to sleep—I was awakened once or twice by the prisoner getting out of bed—he said that he was going to get a drink of water—I afterwards received a blow on the side of my head—I do not know what with—the prisoner was then lying by my side—I said, "Oh, what have you done," and made my way out of the room to Mrs. Hayes' as quick as I could—a policeman came and I went to the next house, leaving the prisoner in the room—we had had no quarrel that day—we had a few words about the children a week before—I have seven children.</p>

I was called to 2, Maria-terrace, and found the prosecutrix bleeding in the passage—from something she said I went into the kitchen, and found the prisoner lying on the floor on his back in a pool of blood, and with cuts on his throat and arms—he said, "Is the—dead?"—I said, "No"—he said that he would do for her if he could get at her—I asked what cause he had for doing it—he said that she had been winking at a half-black b——all day—I asked him if that was all—he said, "Yes, and plenty too"—I sent for a surgeon, who dressed his wounds, and I took him and his wife to the London Hospital—I found this small knife by the bottom of the bed, not in the room in which they had slept, and this hammer by the bedside—the bed clothes were all covered with blood—he is a shoe-maker, and has a shop of his own—I found this other knife by a chair in the bed room, where it is supposed he cut his throat—I have been on that beat about three months, but know nothing of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—the prisoner was admitted on 4th July, with various wounds, which I should say were self inflicted—the prosecutrix was admitted about 4 o'clock in the morning—she had a large lacerated wound on the scalp, on the right side, and a smaller wound below it, also four wounds on her face, which had been done by a blunt instrument; two of them were on the forehead and one communicated with a fracture of the bone of the face, under the left eye—this hammer would produce such wounds—she was in the Hospital six weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of No. 7, Green Street, Stepney. On the night of 30th July I went home about half past 11 o'clock—I had left at 9 o'clock in the morning, leaving no one in the house—the doors and windows were all securely fastened then—as I returned I received information from a person standing outside my house, and saw two men come out—the prisoner is one of them—I ran after him, but was not able to lay hold of him—he was brought back again in about five minutes—on going into my premises, I found that a ladder had been placed against a back window, a square of glass in which had been broken, the catch put back, and the sash thrown up—the door leading into the yard was open—I had left it fast in the morning—it must have been opened by a key—it was the door out of which I saw the men rush—I missed from the shop four pairs of scales and one weight.</p>

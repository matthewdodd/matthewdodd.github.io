I sent for a constable, and found the things mention'd in the indictment in her pocket, except two towels.</p>

               <p>Vaughan. This was in my kitchen. I know the pocket handkerchief to be one of mine, having used it many times. I went and searched her lodgings, where I found one towel and a rubber. (Produced in court.) She beg'd for mercy, and own'd she had taken them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Vaughan. I counted the linen on Monday morning, and in washing they went through my hands twice, and they were right. In the evening I missed several things, so acquainted my master. She was searched, and all the things mentioned in the indictment, except two towels, were found in her pocket. Then she said she was a very wicked woman, and had taken them.</p>

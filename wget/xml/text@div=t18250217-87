On the 5th of February, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was brought in, charged with robbing us - it was stated in his presence that two of our men had heard a noise like copper being beaten where he worked - that they called out who was there - he answered, and went down stairs; that the men went to his bench, and found some old copper - that they went down stairs afterwards, and finding the copper gone they followed the prisoner to the public-house, and asked him for it - he denied having it, but on their saying they knew he had got it, he said, "Pray don't tell of me" - they said they must, and had brought him to me; but instead of searching him, they let him go up to the shop - they then followed him, and heard copper falling, and on getting a light found it by his bench. He begged my forgiveness, and said he would do so no more, and it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see the copper picked up? A. Certainly.</p>

            : I work for the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner heating up some old copper about five o'clock, and said, " What are you at?" he made no reply but dropped it. After that we followed him to the public-house, and took him to Mr. Pontifex - he begged for mercy, and said he would pay for it, and wished master to turn him away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear it was copper? A. Yes. When you went out you took it with you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not master promise you a sovereign? A. He said he would give us a sovereign, and would give every man one who detected a thief.</p>

I said I did not know what he meant, and went back with him - master came up, and said, "Where is the copper which you have stolen;" I said I had stolen none, but took it for clans.</p>

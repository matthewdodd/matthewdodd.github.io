                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Jones, and live at 3, York-place Pitt-street, Old Kent-road—the prisoner came and lodged with us last year, and his wife soon afterward came to him—in June last his son and daughter also lived with him—his son was three years old, and his daughter twelve—on this Saturday morning about a quarter-past 8, I remember the deceased asking for the street-door key—I gave it to her—she went out and re<lb></lb>turned in about two minutes, gave me back the key, and went upstairs—after she had been some little time there, I heard loud words, and then I heard a scream and a fall to the ground—in consequence of that I went upstairs, knocked at the door, and entered the room—their room is just over my back room—on entering the room I saw Mrs. Pinfold lying behind the door in a kind of squatting position, with her knees under her—the prisoner was standing at the fire-place, and the daughter at the foot of the bed against her mother—I asked the mother to get up; she said she could not—the daughter then screamed, and asked Mrs. Leith, another lodger, to come in and help her up—the came in and lifted her up—Mrs. Pinfold said to me that she would tell me how the words occurred—she said, "I went out and bought some bread and butter and two herrings for breakfast, gave three-farthings for one, and ahalfpenny (for the other, and because I did not account for the farthing, my husband served me so"—she said that her husband had out the children's bread and butter, put the breakfast things in the cupboard, and would not give her any—the prisoner said, "You pulled my hair," and she said, "You would not let me have any breakfast, and I went to the cup<lb></lb>board to get it"—he then went to strike her again, and I prevented him—she told me that he had struck her before that, and knocked her down; she did not say where—I assisted her into the other room, and at 3 o'clock she died—I saw her at that time—I believe the prisoner gave some one some money to get her some brandy—I do not know—I was not with her when she died.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 40, Salisbury-place, Looks-fields, and am a surgeon—I was called in on this Saturday afternoon to the prisoner's wife—she was dead at that time—I was afterwards called in by the Coroner to make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination at the workhouse—I found a discoloration on the left side, extending over the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs, and on the thigh; the spleen is on the right-side—on opening the body I removed the peritonaeum, and presented to my view was the coagulated blood—I found the splenic artery ruptured—I removed the spleen and found it ruptured—I examined the other principal organs of life, and they were all healthy except the uterus—there had been disease of the uterus—rupture of the splenic artery was the cause of death—a violent blow inflicted on the right-side, and the body falling on the opposite side on any hard substance, would be likely to produce a rupture of that character—I afterwards ex<lb></lb>amined the room—I did not observe anything there which would produce a rupture of this kind, except from a person falling with violence; no project<lb></lb>ing surface—a person being struck on the one side and falling on the other would produce this, or being struck on that side over the spleen.</p>

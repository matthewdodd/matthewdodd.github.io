               <p>Q. Who ran away with it. - A. I cannot swear to the man that ran away with it; they left me a hat with the crown hanging only by a little bit.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your hat worth. - A. Two shillings; when I attacked him with my hat the officers stepped up and took him.</p>

             sworn. On Sunday the 27th of April myself in company with Stanton and Wood, two brother officers were going down Saffron Hill, I saw a number of Irish people collected together, I then informed my brother officers there was a noise amongst the Irish people and that we would go down and quell them; when I got there I heard the last witness tell the prisoner that he had been knocked down and robbed of his hat, and that he had got his hat on his head, the prisoner tried to strike the prosecutor, and would if he could have got at him; I heard first of all the word, police officers, by some of the Irish people who were standing around; we were all three around him at that time, he attempted to run away, I ran through the mob, and got hold of him by the collar; I then took off the hat and told Wood to hide it, and not to let the prosecutor see what marks there were about it, Stanton took hold of the other side of him, we then led him away; going along, the prosecutor said it was his hat, there had been some paint dropped on the top of it which had been scraped off, the hat was so marked as he has described; I handcuffed him, and thought he was secure, then he made his escape and ran away, we caught him again with the handcuffs on; I took this hat from the prosecutor, this is the hat the prisoner left behind; the prisoner said this was his own hat that he had left behind, and that he had picked up the prosecutor's hat by accident. (This is the prosecutor's hat, and here is the place as he has described.)</p>

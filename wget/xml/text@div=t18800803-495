                  </hi>. I am a clerk, living with my father at Fern Lodge Southgate—on 26th June I was aroused from my sleep about 2.30 a.m. by a noise like somebody breaking in—I called out—not hearing any reply I went downstairs, put my hand on the dresser, and the knife-box had been removed—I went to the kitchen window near the door, and heard footsteps slowly running down the garden at the back of the house—I called my father—I went back upstairs, put something on, came down again, opened the door, and ran down the garden and down the paddock at the back into a road which runs to the bottom of the field—when I had proceeded a short distance I saw the prisoner a little way from the field in the road—I asked him if he had seen any one—he said "No, except a policeman he had passed five minutes before"—I ran after the policeman, and overtook him nearly in front of our house—we ran down the field, and found the prisoner nearly in the same place where I had seen him previously—he was searched—nothing was found on him which would arouse suspicion, and he was let go—this pair of boots is mine—I saw no one else there but the prisoner.</p>

On 26th June, about 2.30, I was called out of bed, and went down into the kitchen—the window was raised opening into the yard—the knife-box was gone—I looked for my boots to run after the thief—I could not find them—I had left two pairs in the kitchen—it was dark—I examined the window—it had been broken, and a piece of paper put on some days before—the paper was intact the night previous—it was broken through on this morning—these are my shoes, and this is my boot—I left them in the kitchen—I found the fellow boot still there—I missed some knives out of the box, and a fork.</p>

               <p>and came back, in consequence of what I heard from the last witness—finding some boots in the hedge, I concealed myself in a garden, about 150 yards from the back of the house where the burglary was—a little before this I had seen the prisoner going along the Green Road, close to this hedge where these boots were found—he walked up and down for five or six yards, pulled the twigs of the hedge aside, and looked in three or four times—I saw he was a stranger—I went to him and told him I should take him custody on suspicion of this burglary—I asked him if he had any knives or, boots about him—he said "No"—I searched him, and found this boot between his coat and waistcoat—I took him to the station—I subsequently examined the garden of Fern Lodge—I saw footprints there—several nails were out of the prisoner's boot, and the marks corresponded exactly with it—the prisoner's boot was very wet; so was the bottom of his trousers, and there were pieces of grass on the boot—I searched him at the station, and found a shilling on him—I took his shirt off—there were two moles on his back—he said "That is good enough, Maclntyre knows me well enough; only <hi rend="italic">come</hi> out two days ago; I had 10 months last time from Highgate for stealing tools"—he also said he had had seven years, and would as soon be in prison as out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector Y</hi>). I am stationed at Southgate—from information I received I went at 2.45 a m. to Mr. Turner's house—the back kitchen window was open; a pane of glass had been broken; the kitchen was in confusion—some brown paper had been pasted over the outside of a broken pane, and there was a hole through the brown paper sufficiently large to admit the arm—the window catch had been forced back; it could be reached easily by the arm—I saw footprints in the garden walk, which was very wet, as it had been raining the previous day; they were well defined; I covered them up—after the prisoner was charged I took his left boot off; I took it to the garden path, and im<lb></lb>pressed it by the side of the footprint I had covered up; it corresponded exactly; I noticed particularly the three nails in the heel of the boot—he was charged with stealing the boots and the knives—he said "I know nothing of the knives, those you will find."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in the station when you were brought in—I think it was No. 40 came in with you—he made some such observation as "Here is the old man, I found this boot upon him"—I do not think that remark was answered—the other officer recognised you as the man he had searched and found nothing on—I am not aware that I silenced him; it would be my duty to do so if he was talking while a prisoner was there—No. 40 is not here—you said "I know nothing of the knives, you will find them"—I think those were the words, and not "They will find them for anything I know about them"—there were lots of marks made by your running in the garden walk—I took the measure of your boot, and the measure of the impression of some one's boot at the back of the house, and put it in the same print afterwards, and the nails fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>

               <p>slept for some time. I then went down the lane to search for running water, and saw two policemen; they said nothing to me. The young gentleman asked me if I saw anybody. I said "No." He asked if I knew where he could find a policeman, and I said "You will find two at the top of the lane." I picked up this boot, thinking it would fetch me a few halfpence I moved the bush about to reach it. I was taken into custody. There were four persons there, and the policeman never tried their shoes or his own. You will find a similarity in the nailing of boots in any shop, and I think it is cruel that a man should be convicted on this evidence. I saw two policemen at the top of the road, and if I was there I could not be at the prosecutors house, but they have taken care to keep that man back.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Whitechapel. The deceased, Joseph Gale, lived with me—we were not married—on the 5th of Nov., at half-past ten o'clock</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184611230059"></xptr>
               <p>at night, I was at the Crown and Seven Stars, Rosemary-lane—the prisoner was there—he was pot-boy there—there was card-playing going on—Gale went to look at it—Hannah Buckley and the prisoner began to <hi rend="italic">sky-lark</hi>—the prisoner knocked Gale in his eye with his elbow—Gale turned round and gave the girl a slap in her face, thinking she was the person who had struck him in the eye—the prisoner said, "What made you strike her? the blow was not meant for her"—after that there were a few words between the prisoner and Gale—there were no blows then—Hudson, the bar-maid, came in and said to the pot-boy, "Oh! that is <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Gale, why don't you put him out?"—the pot-boy put him out of the card-room into the tap-room—I followed him—when he got into the tap-room he gave the prisoner a slap on the mouth—the prisoner made no reply—Gale said he would not fight there, but would take him out into the yard—Gale walked out at a side door into Blue Anchor-yard—he remained there about two minutes, then came into the house again, and as he came into the door the prisoner met him and gave him a tremendous kick in the fore part of his stomach—the kick just grazed by me—Gale fell down from the kick—I went into Blue Anchor-yard and spoke to him, but he could not answer me—he remained where he fell upwards of ten minutes, and then asked me to wipe the perspiration off his face—he turned very sick—I wished him to get up—he said he could not—he crawled from where he had fallen to the door of the Blue Anchor—that was about five or six yards-while he was there a policeman came up—he did not stay with him long—I stayed with him, and afterwards assisted him to Mill-yard with a fellow lodger—we got him home about twelve o'clock—next morning I sent for Dr. Little—on Saturday, the 7th, he was taken to the hospital—I had lived with him three months—he was in very good health when this occurred—I am not aware of his having any rupture.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are married to another person are you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was not the landlord's sister that put him out—I can positively swear it was the prisoner put him out—I will swear the pri<lb></lb>soner struck him in the eye—it was not Hannah Buckley—I have heard her swear it was her, but it was not—I do not know what the words were between them—I will swear Gale did not in my presence call the prisoner a broad<lb></lb>faced b----r, and say he would jump on his b----y breast-plate, as he had served his father before him—I was there the whole time, and he never used words of that description—I cannot recollect what he did say—Gale had been forbidden the house before—he was a very quarrelsome man when in liquor—he was more healthy and stronger than the prisoner—the landlord was not in the tap-room—I believe the house was in the care of Mrs. Hudson and the prisoner—Gale struggled a little when he was put out, but not much—he was perfectly sober—it commenced about half-past ten—it was not half-past eleven—it did not last very long—when the kick was given, the prisoner was standing with the door in one hand, and the other hand on the side of the wall, and as Gale came in he gave him a kick with his right foot—I saw no blood when Gale slapped the prisoner in the mouth—if there had been any, I must have seen it—it was a slight blow, that would not kill a fly—I was quite sober—I had had no<lb></lb>thing but tea and coffee—Gale had had nothing but a pint of porter—he did not remain outside for some time abusing the people of the house while I was with him—he fell the instant the blow was given, and never spoke to any<lb></lb>body but me—he did not stand at the door and abuse them—several men were present when the kick was given—none of them interfered—nobody came to his assistance from the Blue Anchor—as soon as he got home he fell again, and rolled about for half an hour, like a person out of his mind—he would not have a doctor that night—he said he would leave it till the morning</p>

               <p>we did not get Dr. Little till about five o'clock on Friday evening—I went to him in the morning and told him what was done, but he would not come till I got an order from the union—he then came and gave me an order to go to the London Hospital—Gale walked there himself on Saturday.</p>

My brother keeps the Crown and Seven Stars, Rose<lb></lb>mary-lane—on 5th Nov. there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at the house—Gale was concerned in it—I ordered him to leave the house—he refused, and I pushed him out of the tap-room in front of the bar—he went to the door, came back towards the prisoner, and attempted to strike him—I pushed Duggan back, and pre<lb></lb>vented him—Gale then attempted to kick him—I pushed Duggan back again, and Cook ran between them—I did not see the prisoner kick, he did not kick—after this struggle, I saw Gale standing in the doorway abusing the prisoner, telling him to come outside, and he would jump on him—I did not see the door shut till Gale left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How old is the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nineteen—he is a peaceable, quiet person—I saw his mouth bleeding when I went into the tap-room—he said in Gale's presence that he had struck him—it was me pushed Gale out of doors—the prisoner was not near him—after he tried to strike the prisoner and kick him, I heard him abusing the prisoner at the sill of the door, saying he would jump on him—I did not see him crawling on the ground—when I saw him, he walked away very well—I and my sister and the prisoner were in the house after Gale had been put out—I did not see him try to come in again—he was very much intoxicated.</p>

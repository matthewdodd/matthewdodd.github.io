                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman N</hi> 69.) I was watching near the premises of Mr. Carden, in Shacklewell-lane, about eight o'clock on the 1st Nov., at night—I saw Steele pats and repast the front at the house—she then took up some gravel, and threw it towards the kitchen window—then crossed over to the other side of the way, and very shortly after the side-door opened, which leads to the back yard—it is the servants' door—Moroton case so the iron gate of the fore-court—Steele met her—Moreton handed over a par<lb></lb>cel to her, which Stock took under her shawl, and in a few seconds she went away—I followed, and stopped her about two hundred yards off—I asked what she had got—she said a parcel, which was her own property—I asked what it contained—she said a few bones, which the servant gave her after some hesitation; I found it was this mutton us a cloth—there was one bone, and about 3lbs. of mutton—I did not weigh it.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner Moreton lived with me as cook—I had had a leg of mutton on the Thursday previous—she was taken on the Saturday—we had a loin of mutton on the Saturday—these appeared to be slices cut from the leg and part of the loin—none of it was left in the house—I did not dine at home, and do not know how much should be left—there appeared to be two or three pounds before the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate—it did not appear meat which had been left, but slices cut out of the meat.</p>

             - I knew him by that name for, I will say, six months previous - I had frequently seen him - he always used the name of Williams in that time - I heard them asked in church - they were married by banns - Mary Ann Slade is in court now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are beadle of that parish? A. I am - I believe this prosecution is instituted by the brother of the first wife - Slade was pregnant at the time of the marriage, and the parish authorities had found it out - she married on the 18th of February, and the child was born in about a week - the marriage was by the application of the man himself and his mother - he did not try to run away as he was going to church - he might have wanted to go back and change his clothes - he was not in my custody - nobody said he should not go back - he applied to me, and the parish gave them thirty shillings or 1l. - whatever he asked for he had - the woman was not living in our parish - I believe the parish officers gave them a room of furniture, and twenty or thirty shillings - the man said he did not like to live as he was then doing, and had not the means of marrying, and would I intercede with the overseers to get him the means of marrying her - he did not ask leave to go back and change his clothes - he met me in the church - I said, "If you do not like to marry the woman, I have my other business to attend to, and I must go" - I did not want to stop him - I did not contrive to get him to marry her - they wanted to get married - she was with child, and had had a child before by him - we had to keep that, and so we do now - he was in his working dress, and said he wanted his other things to put on, and I said,"I cannot stop" - Slade is not living in our parish - her child is chargeable on the parish - I cannot say whether she herself was - the parish does not prosecute this case.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they live together before marriage? A. No - he had one child by her before marriage, and another coming - I understood she was brought to bed a fortnight after she was married, it might not be so much - the second wife has not employed me to get up the prosecution - most likely it is against her will - I apprehended the prisoner with the officer, and I took out the indictment - he requested to be married, and put up the banns himself - she did not run away after they were married, or I should have known it - he ill-used her, he kicked her, and locked her out of doors.</p>

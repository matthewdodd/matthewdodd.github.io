                  </hi>. I am a wine and spirit merchant, at 12, Cooper's-row, Tower-hill. I know the prisoner—he came on 29th July and asked me if two casks, which were lying in the warehouse, were for sale—I said, "Yes"—he asked the price, and I said they were 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he came from Messrs. Capel, of Seething-lane, and he would call in the morning, bring the money, and take them away—I did not see him again till he was in custody ten days after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On 30th July, about 1 o'clock, the prisoner came and told me he had come for two casks, pointed to two in the warehouse, and said those were the two—I asked if he had brought the money, or an order for them—he said he came from Messrs. Capel, and had brought their truck, and that would e order sufficient, and pointed to it—it was one of Messrs. Capel's—in consequence of that repre<lb></lb>sentation, and seeing the truck, I told him he might take the casks away, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160067"></xptr>
               <p>he did so; but at the same time he observed that Messrs. Capel had to send to change a check, and the money would be sent—the money was not sent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I stated that I was going to take them to Mr. Capel and Mr. Irvine might come for the money, not that I bought them for Mr. Capel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Capel and Co.—it is my duty to buy and sell—I have the whole management of the business—I did not authorize the prisoner to go to Mr. Irvine's and buy any casks—I lent him the truck, after he had plagued me three or four hours, to get rid of him—I told him it was not our habit to lend trucks—I was not aware he was going after casks—I have known him for years, and have ordered him off the pre<lb></lb>mises hundreds of times—he brought back an hogshead and a quarter cask on the truck, but not for us—Mr. Capel was not in town on 21st or 22nd—he was away, laid up with the lumbago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not I tell you there were a lot of casks near the Royal Exchange, and ask you to fetch them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I told you the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> was not in town, and I could not fetch them; the parties were strangers to us, and I should have wanted a check for them—there were two loads—I did not tell you to go and seek out some more, or that I would fetch these the next day—you did not tell me there were two casks at Irvine's, and I did not tell you to fetch them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I told Tibbs the casks were at Mr. Irvine's, and he said be would take care of them; I took them to Capel's, Tibbs was not at home, and I put them inside the gate, and put Irvine's name on them; when I went again he said they were not worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I went and exchanged them away, and was on my road to settle the matter when I was given in custody.</p>

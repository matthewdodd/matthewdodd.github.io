               <p>Q. About nine or ten o'clock at night did you go any where? - A. Yes, we went to a cook's shop, No. 18, Butcher-row, East-Smithfield; we had a bason of soup each of us; I put my hand into my pocket to haul out my money, and I hauled out a five-pound note; I laid it on the table to get at the silver; they were both in my waistcoat pocket, the note was uppermost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a Bank of England note? - A. Yes, I had received it as a Bank note at Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it when you laid it on the table? - A. It dropped on the ground by my putting my arm on the table; the prisoner at the bar stooped down and whipped it up, and ran out of the door; I called to her to stop, but she would not: I called to the landlady of the house, and told her that she went away with a five-pound note of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240054"></xptr>mine; I ordered another bason of soup, but did not wait to eat it; I thought if I stopped she would be out of the way; I found her at Mr. Houghton's, the Golden Anchor; I tapped her on the shoulder, and I said, Rosey, give me that five-pound note which you ran away with from me; she said she had no five-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched? - A. Not then; I gave her in charge of the watchman; she was searched in the watch-house and nothing found upon her; I gave her in charge of the officer of the night, and he discharged her in a few minutes; she was taken again the next morning about eight o'clock; I rapped at the door where she lived, and she lifted up the sash and looked out; I told her she had better give me up the note before I would go and have her taken up; she said she had no note, nor never took any from me; then I went to the Flying Horse, Lambeth-street, to Mr. Griffiths, and he came and took her up before the Magistrate, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you more than one Bank note in that pocket? - A. I had four ones; they were by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure that the one you put on the table, was the five-pound note? - A. I opened it, and looked at it before I laid it on the table, and saw it was a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Are you a scholar? - A. Not much.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read so as to know whether a note is from one bank or another? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You only supposed that this was a five pound note because you received it from Somerset house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been from sea five weeks, how long might you have kept company with this girl? - A. About ten days; I lived with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any little pet, a little jealousy, take place between you and her; there was a young man along with her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in consequence of a young man being along with her, did not she and you quarrel; she charged the watch with you? - A. Yes, and I charged the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, your friendly intimacy ceased; you separated from her? - A. Not then, we slept together till she took the note from me at the soup-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober or drunk at the time? - A. I was as sober as I am at this time, I had drank nothing to do me any hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you desire the landlady of the house to look for it? - A. No, I told her of it; I said there, the note dropped down at the end of the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you assist the landlady in searching the place for the note, after the woman had gone away? - A. I took the candle in my hand; she asked me where it dropped, she looked round, I said it is of no use to look; I saw her take the note away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen her since she has been committed by the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not told her, if she would come and live with you, you would not prosecute her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been to Newgate to see her? - A. I did not go to see her; she came in the place; I told her to keep away; I said to her, I do not want to have any thing to say to you.</p>
               <p>Q. If I was to ask you whether you saluted her there, and put your arms around her neck, do you mean to say you pushed her off; did not you drink with her? - A. She drank out of the same pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you call that drinking together? - A. Of course it was drinking together; I did not give it her to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not go to see her there, were you unlucky enough to have another acquaintance in prison? - A. I went with a woman of the name of Neave.</p>
               <p>Q. She is an acquaintance of this girl; she went to see this girl? - A. I cannot say whether she did or not.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 18, Butcher-row; I keep a cook-shop: On the 15th of April, between the hours of nine and ten at night, the prosecutor called for two basons of soup; the prisoner at the bar went out; I heard the prosecutor call, Rosey, come back; she did not return; he called for another bason of soup; when I brought it him he had four one pound notes on the table; he had been looking under the table with a candle, to see if he could see the five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him look? - A. I did not, my partner did; she is not here; he had the candle in his hand when I served him the second bason of soup; he asked me to look for it; he said he had lost a five pound note, and the girl had gone out with it; I looked for it, and I shook the tablecloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor appear to be sober? - A. As far as I saw he did.</p>

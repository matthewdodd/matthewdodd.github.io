                  </hi>. I am a private gentleman, of 9, Caroline-place, Camber<lb></lb>well-green—on the morning of 24th December, about 11 o'clock, I was in Camberwell-road; at the corner of Southampton-street—I saw an old gentle<lb></lb>man crowing the road I did not see him leave the pavement; he stood still and remained about the centre of the road—there was very great shouting, and I turned round and saw a gig approaching me from London towards Camberwell-green; it was about forty yards from the old gentleman when I first saw it—the prisoners were in the gig and Wilton was driving at about twelve miles an hour—they were shouting at the top of their voices in a very noisy manner, and when they had arrived within about twelve yards of the old gentleman they all but polled up and approached at a much slower rate, not exceeding seven or eight miles an hour; I should say about seven miles an hour—the old gentleman stood still, hearing the shouting; and they ran over him; the off wheel went over him—there was plenty of room on the other side of him for it to have passed without knocking him down; there was no vehicle in the road at all; there was much more room on one side of him than the other—it did not stop after it had run over him, but I stopped it; I seized the horse and took hold of the bit—they pulled up within the length of the horse and gig, and I went and took hold of the bit and unbuckled the rein, as they tried to go on—they first one got up and then another; they made a demonstration; I could not find a policeman, and I took them to the station-house—one got out of the gig first; they were very violent and would not leave go of the horse's head—they were both drunk—I took them to the station and charged them with being drunk and incapable, and they were locked up—I am accustomed to driving; up to 1834, I always kept one or two horses for my own riding or driving, and I have had six or seven in my stable—I did not know the old gentleman—I afterwards saw him dead at his house in January.</p>

               <p>gentleman was in the road at that time, he was stepping off the kerb when I first heard them cry out—there was plenty of time for him to cross if he had not stood still when he got to the centre of the road—he walked to the middle of the road and then stood still. but when he left the kerb, the gig was forty yards away from him—when they began shouting to him he had just stepped from the kerb, and when they shouted he stood still—I was not in the least excited; I was as calm as I am now—I do not take stimulants; I am gene<lb></lb>rally calm—when we got two-thirds of the way to the station-house they wanted to go back to see what was the matter—when I seized the horse's head one jumped off, and I made the arrangement that if one would walk alongside of me the other should walk by the horse's head, but they would not, and I unbuckled the reins—they tried to drive over me—I am on my oath—they did not want to get back to see what bad happened to this poor man.</p>

I am a private gentleman—on 24th December, about 11 in the morning, I was near the corner of Southampton-street, Camberwell-road, and heard some peoplet calling out—I saw the prisoners in a gig, going from the City towards Camberwell-green—I saw the old gentleman in the centre of the road, about sixty yards from the gig, which was going between eight and nine miles an hour, as near as I can guess—it knocked the old gentleman down and passed over his foot—the shaft or the breast of the horse knocked him down; some part of the side of the vehicle or horse—I did not see whether the prisoners slackened their pace at all—the gig was stopped about four or five yards after knocking the old gentle<lb></lb>man down—I cannot say whether it was stepped by any one, but I should say that the driver stopped it—I then saw that the prisoners were drunk, Crown was the worst of the two—there was plenty of room for the gig to pass on either side of the old gentleman; there were very few vehicles in the road.</p>

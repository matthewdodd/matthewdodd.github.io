               <p>Q. Where was he when he gave you the eighteen pounds ten shillings? - A. Opposite my accompting-house door, just where he had been cleaning the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards that you took him up stairs? - A. About five minutes, (produces the money); the eight half-crowns I can positively swear to, because I had marked them myself; I had missed money before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make an application to him for the money, or did he offer to lend you the money? - A. He offered me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Lovatt comes into the shop, does not he? - A. Yes, I consider him as the only person capable of being intrusted in my absence.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you pay him for the trouble he has in the shop? - A. He is only with me for a few months, he has no share in the business whatever.</p>

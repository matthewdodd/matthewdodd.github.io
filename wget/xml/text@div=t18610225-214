                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at 32, Tufton-street, West<lb></lb>minster. On Sunday evening, 21st January, between 7 and 8 o'clock, the prisoner came to my house—I had not known him before—he said, "I have a gold watch for sale;" and he pressed me very much to buy it—I had not stated to any one, except my brother, that I wished to buy a watch—after a great deal of per<lb></lb>suasion I asked the prisoner into the parlour with another man who is not in custody—they produced a watch to me, and asked me twenty guineas for it—I did not like the appearance of it, and said it was rather too much—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the watch—I said I would rather not have anything to do with it, I would rather go to a respectable place and purchase one—he said, "I will take 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "No; I will not have it at all"—then he said 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and after a great deal of per<lb></lb>suasion, I said, "I will give you 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I do not care whether I have it or not"—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, and gave an I.O.U. for another pound, to be paid in a month from that date—next day I tried the watch, and found it to be quite a spurious article—it is not gold.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker of 2, Rochester-terrace, West<lb></lb>minster—this watch is a brass one washed over—I should have thought it gold, but for the mark "18 K;" and a coronet, which raised ray suspicion—all foreign watches, if they are genuine, have "18 K" on them—that means 18 karats, the quantity of gold—the watch is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was made in Switzerland.</p>

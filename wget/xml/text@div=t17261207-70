               <p>Mr. Marsh depos'd to this Effect, That Mr. Heysham being an infirm Man, and often afficted with the Gout, he intrusted the Prisoner to negotiate Affairs, and in the Year 1725, being then employed in the said Service, he (the Prisoner) wrote Mr. Heysham a very formal Letter, desiring Mr. Heysham to impower him to receive his Dividends of Stock; but soon after Mr. Heysham having some Business near the South-sea House, he desired me to go along with him, and like wife, that I would go and enquire at the South-Sea House, if the Prisoner had received his Dividends of Stock there; I went to the proper Office, and one of the Clerks told me Mr. Heysham had not any Stock in that Company - I went back to Mr. Heysham and inform'd him of it. He appeared extremely surprised, desired me to go back again, and he would go to the Prisoner, (who was then ill at home) and desired me to come to him there; I came to the Prisoner's accordingly, found Mr. Heysham ruffled, and talking very warmly to him. Who insisted, that as for his Stock being disposed of there was no such Thing done, and that it was a Mistake of the Clerk's - Upon which I told the Prisoner, that it was in vain to make any such Pretence, for I had made a proper Enquiry, and was very well assured that Mr. Heysham had no Stock in the South-Sea Company - When the Prisoner see me so positive, he said he had a General Letter of Attorney for transferring it; but upon Mr. Heysham denying he that ever gave him any such Authority, he desired Mr. Heysham to be easy, and confess'd that he had been under some Necessities that obliged him to dispose of it, but promised he would reinstate the said Stock to Mr. Heysham in a short Time. And for his further Satisfaction, the Prisoner takes Pen, Ink and Paper, and drew up and delivered me a promisory Note, to Transfer Four Thousand Pounds South-Sea Stock; which Note I have here to produce. Here is also an Account which the Prisoner sent Mr. Heysham, wherein he gives Mr. Heysham Credit for the Dividends of his South-Sea Stock, as if none was disposed of, the Prisoner having disposed of Part of it without his Privity or Knowledge long before. Some Time after this I made Application to the Office, to see by what Authority the said Stock was Transferred and they informed me, by several Powers of Attorney. which Powers I got leave to inspect.</p>

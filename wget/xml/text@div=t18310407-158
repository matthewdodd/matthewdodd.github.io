            . On the 19th of February I kept the Barley Mow - Lane came there that night about twelve o'clock - the prisoner came in soon after, with another man - Lane stopped there half an hour or three quarters, and was perfectly sober, so was the prisoner and his companion - there were other persons in the house; I believe they were all gone except the prisoner, his companion, and another at the time Lane left - the prisoner and his companion left about the same time as Lane; I wanted to clear the house - I then fastened the door, and heard a person cry out, "Murder! they have robbed me;" I said,"That is Lane, I suppose;" it appeared to be his voice; I opened the door immediately, and saw Lane close by the door - the prisoner and another person were near him; I saw nobody else - if others had been near him I must have seen them; the moment I opened the door and went out, the prisoner struck me a tremendous blow, and he and his companion went off; Lane was then on the ground, I believe - I took him in doors; he complained of being very much hurt, and that they had robbed him of half a crown - I knew the prisoner, as he frequented the house; I understood he lived in the neighbourhood, but did not know his business - he came into my house three or four nights after, and I went down to the Police-office; he left before I returned, but was taken that night - the street was rather dark when this happened; I think he knew me when he struck me - I have been unfortunate, and have come from the debtor's prison - my licence was taken away before the 5th of April, but I was allowed to keep the house open; I think it was on the 5th of April that I went to prison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The person who struck you ran away directly? A. I believe he did, but my senses were gone just for the instant; I cannot say whether Lane was on the ground when I opened my door, as it was rather dark, and I was flurried at the moment - I was sober; I had put out the lamp at my door, and it was dark - the house is in a court; there are two or three lamps, but when mine is out it is quite dark - I lost my licence in consequence of such characters as these coming there, and a witness he is now going to bring forward being there; I had frequently fastened them out of my house, and gone to Worship-street to complain of them, but could not keep them out - I generally serve till one o'clock on Saturday nights; I cannot say whether the others went out about the same time as Lane or not - I gave information of this at the Police station on Sunday; the prisoner owes me two or three pounds - I do not know where he lived: he represented himself as having a great many houses, and being very well off - the man with him was Sherring, or some such name, and the prisoner went by the name of Boney and Donkin; he was tried here by that name, for the same sort of concern - I believe he was acquitted; he is a noted body-snatcher.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man is outside who was present at the time - Roberts repeatedly threatened to serve me out for owing him money; this is done out of spite: on the morning it took place I left the house alone, to go home, and in Bunhill-row a child was hurt; I took it to the Police-station, and stopped there half an hour or more, at the same station as Roberts says he went to give information - the greatest part of the Police were there; the inspector knew my house - I was not in Roberts' house till a quarter-past one o'clock that morning; four other persons came and stood at the bar, drinking - Roberts, 1, and Lane had rum, gin, and ale together; if I had committed the robbery, it is not likely I should have gone to the same house - I do not live two hundred yards from it; I went there on the morning I was taken - a Policeman whom I and Roberts knew went there to see the fiddling and dancing - I had a glass of rum, and some tobacco, which I paid for; I had a pot of half-and-half; two Policemen were going by, and I gave it to them; if I was guilty, why did not Roberts give me in charge, instead of sending a woman to watch where I lived?</p>

            . On Sunday morning, the 20th of February, I got up, because my child had the measles, to get a light at Roberts' lamp, about half-past three o'clock in the morning - I live in Gravel-walk, the first court at the side of Roberts' - I knocked at Roberts' door, and he let me in; the lamp over the door was burning - I took a light home, and then went to have half a pint of beer; I saw the prisoner at the back of the bar, talking to Mrs. Roberts about going to dinner on Sunday morning - I heard the prisoner invite her to his house to dinner; I stood close to the bar - I am sure this was at half-past three o'clock, and they had two, three, or four half-pints of gin; there were six of them together - Mr. Lane and all drank; the landlord took a glass, and they gave me a glass - his wife did not drink; Roberts just came out, and said it was too late to draw any more - they went out, and in a few minutes knocked again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to wait when your child was ill? A. Roberts told me to stop; he did not say why - I had taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070081"></xptr>the light home, returned for the beer, and then I had an other half pint; I always get up at five o'clock on Sunday mornings, and did not mean to go to bed again - I sell milk; Roberts and Lane know it was half-past three well- the second time that they were let in, the Policeman came in in his uniform, and drank a glass; this was all between three and four o'clock - the serjeant came in, caught him there, and reprimanded him; the Policeman and serjeant went out together - Roberts persuaded them all to go, it being late, and they all went out; I remained in - Roberts said to his wife, "Give Daddy a glass of gin;" he put his lamp out before they went out - they had not been out five minutes before somebody cried Murder! Mrs. Roberts, said, "It is Mr. Lane," and Roberts went out - I followed, and saw Lane on the ground, and a big stout man was fighting him; I picked him up, and the man made a kick at him, I think on the shins - he said he had lost his hat; I went back - Mr. Roberts and the prisoner were fighting together; I got Roberts in, and shut the door - he wanted to go out to fight again, but I took the key out of the door, and gave to his wife - I was sober; Roberts and Lane were in liquor - Roberts wanted Lane to treat me and him with a quartern of gin; Mrs. Roberts would not draw any more, as Lane had had quite enough.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew the prisoner very well, did not you? A. No, only for about a week before; I went to Worship-street when he was taken, but I met Roberts at the door, and he said it was all settled without me - I did not tell him the prisoner was innocent; I did not want to have any thing to do with it - I went there to see how the prisoner got on, and if I was wanted; Roberts said it was settled without me: I returned with him and Lane, and had a quartern and a half of gin at the Cock - I did not tell them they had made a false charge; I did not know what they had sworn - Roberts told me at the Baker and Basket that he was committed for the robbery - that was immediately after we left the office; I did not tell them he was innocent - I was quite ignorant, and did not know what to do.</p>


               <p>Q. Can you give any reason why you did not go in to the Magistrate, and say you knew it was a false charge? A. I did not - I went home with Roberts and Lane, and had some gin at the Cock; I had seen no robbery committed, and knew he had committed none - I knew if he had he was liable to be hung.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so base as to drink with people who charge a man with an offence affecting his life, when you knew it was false? A. I did not know it affected his life till yesterday - I did not know it was a highway-robbery he was committed for; I live at No. 4, Blue Anchoralley, Gravel-walk.</p>

             re-examined. In consequence of Lane stating what took place, I thought I was in duty bound to apprehend the prisoner - Barber was in my house that night about the same time as the other party, but I deny that it was three o'clock; I was gone to bed then - I am sure Barber was not sober; I think he was in the tap-room at the time the party were at the bar - he did not come for a light; he was drinking the same as others - he said nothing about a light, nor did I see him take one; I heard no complaint about his child having the measles - he came out of the tap-room after they were gone, and I asked him to wait a bit, as I heard people talking outside; he was rather fresh - I wished him to wait till they were gone; there were no Policemen in my house- I saw Barber at the door of the Police-office, and he told me he did not want to say any thing, for if he spoke the truth it would be all against the prisoner; I drank with him afterwards, and next night a message came to my house, saying they would be the death of Barber if he did not come and speak for Davis - he said he could not for if he spoke the truth it would be against him, and he told me this morning that they had been to him again, and he did not want to come.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM BARBER. Q. Who did you see when you went out of the house? A. The prisoner, brother, and four more - there was nobody but the stout big man engaged near the prosecutor; the prisoner was fighting with Roberts, and the others stood round; what Roberts has said is false - I have not seen him for a week.</p>

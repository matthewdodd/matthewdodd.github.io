               <p>Q. You had no occasion to look after it till the prisoner was apprehended - A. I had not. A Lambeth-street officer came to me, I went to the prisoner's house in the hay loft, I saw a pair of wheels; I have never seen the axle-tree again. The wheels were fresh painted red; I rubbed some of the paint off; I found them to be the wheels that I had lost; they were painted yellow and prickled down with black.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself with positiveness to say they are your wheels - A. I positively think they are; I can swear no further.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 20th of April, in the morning, I had occasion to go to Flower's house to search it, and to apprehend him, which I did. In searching of the hay loft I saw these two wheels, which are in the indictment; they were fresh painted, and in the hay loft merely to dry. I took the prisoner to the office. I knew of a person that had lodged an information a few days before, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170042"></xptr>he had lost a pair of wheels. After I had locked up the prisoner I went to Mr. Parson's house and informed him, and took him into the hay loft, where the wheels were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing about the premises that wheels would be useful to - A. No, nothing at all. Mr. Parsons immediately said he would swear to them wheels; he took a cloth and wiped some of the paint off, and pointed out the box where he had altered it. I have one wheel here, and the other is at the New inn. I asked the prisoner how he came by these wheels; he said he bought them in Smithfield market about two months before; he meaned to get a little timber and knock up a body himself, and make a little cart, and drag it about with a jack ass, for the benefit of his wife's health; she was far advanced in her pregnancy; it was to ride her about.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There is witnesses to prove that I bought the wheels in Smithfield market.</p>

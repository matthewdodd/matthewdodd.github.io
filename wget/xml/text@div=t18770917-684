I live at 22, Prospect Place, Cambridge Heath—I have known the prisoner for some time—he was a teacher in the Children's Home—he came to me on the 27th June last and asked me to cash this cheque for him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I did, and then paid the cheque away—I asked him no question about it—it was subsequently returned marked "No account"—I next saw him on the 5th July when I told him the cheque had come back—he said he would see about it—he had taken it of a man he had cured of the gout. (<hi rend="italic">Cheque read</hi>: "London and Yorkshire Bank, Limited, Halifax. Pay Urban Rack, or order, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. R. B.

I am manager of the London and Yorkshire Bank, Limited, at Halifax—an account was opened in the name of Henry James and Son, before I took the management—I have examined the books and we have no customer of the name of R. B. Huntley, nor do I find that there ever has been such, on going through our signature book—that book (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) was issued to Henry James and Son, before I came to the bank—it was a very small account—they are not customers now, they left in June, 1876.</p>

            . I am officer of Lambeth street. On Saturday the 31st of January, I searched the prisoner's box; I found a pair of breeches and two waistcoats tied up in a bundle; the shirt was loose in his box; the box was locked; I took the key from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, the crime alledged to my charge is the first that ever was imputed to me; I cannot account how the property in question came into my bundle; I should be sorry to lay an imputation upon any one person in particular. I had it in my power to defraud my masters to a considerable amount; on the evening I was taken in custody the woman servant asked me to go for some milk; I said I would oblige her, as there was no one else in the house; I put the bundle on the table and went out of the house, I could not get any; the woman said she would go; she went out and brought in one of the clerks; she had egress to every part of the house, the same as me; she and I were never in the habits of friendship; I hope my master will give me the character I deserve, and the honourable court and jury will pity my case; my fellow servant afterwards told me that she or me should leave our situation. It was certainly put into my bundle unknown to me.</p>

               <p>Miller. He said when I took him it was the first time, he hoped his masters would be as partial to him as they could.</p>
               <p>JURY. Was the servant and him at variance - A. No, they were very intimate.</p>

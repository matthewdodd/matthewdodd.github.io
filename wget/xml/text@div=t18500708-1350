                  </hi>. I am potman at the Marquis of Granby, Union-street, Borough. On 21st June, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner outside the house, threatening a boy, who was going out with half a pint of beer—he said he would knock his b—y head off when he got outside—the boy was in the house—I was called to take the beer, as he would not let the boy go—I do not think he had been in the public-house—as I went out he struck me on the head with his fist—I had not spoken to him, or interfered with him in any way—he has a wooden leg, and I did not wish to touch him—I asked him what he did it for—my master came, and told me to turn him away—he then kicked me across the shins with his wooden leg, and upset a pint of beer which I had—I took him by the shoulders, and put him towards his own home, in Ewer-street—I went away, and returned in five minutes—the prisoner was still there, and several other people—he came and laid hold of my waistcoat, dragged me outside the door into the gutter, and tried to bite my legs—I got away into the house—about ten minutes afterwards I went out for some pots, and he was not there—I came back in about a minute and a half, and he was standing in the middle of the court, close to the side of the house—he struck and kicked me several times, but I told him as he was a cripple I would not hurt him—and one of the others struck me once or twice—I went into the public-house again—in about three-quarters of an hour I had to take some beer into Ewer-street—on returning, the prisoner rushed out of a court upon me all at once, with something sharp in his hand, and said, "You b—r, I have got you now"—some one standing on the left struck me on the back of the head, and knocked me over to the prisoner, who instantly stabbed me twice in the arm, saying, "There, you b—r, I have done for you now"—my arm bled—I went to a doctor, and afterwards gave the prisoner in charge—my arm is still stiff, and has not the strength in it which it ought to have.</p>

On 21st June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the road, tying up his shoe—I saw a boy go into the public-house—in three or four minutes Murray came out, and struck the prisoner in the mouth—that was the first thing I saw—they scuffled, and fell, Murray at the top—as Murray was being pulled away, he kicked the prisoner in the mouth—it filled with blood, and he went to Mrs. Plummer's, opposite, for some water to wash his mouth—I saw no more of him.</p>

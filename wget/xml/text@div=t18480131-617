                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I knew William Ives—on 24th Dec. I was at work with him in the Cambridge-road, scraping the road with shovels—the prisoners and another man came up—they were not sober—the other two <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> Kemp on Ives, who said, "What do you do that for, I would not hurt you?"—Crudgington said, "You b—y fool, if you grum<lb></lb>ble at that, I will give you something to grumble for," and struck Ives in the face with both fists—Ives had not struck either of them—he put up his shovel before his face to shield it from the blow—he had one hand in the han<lb></lb>dle, and the other on the iron part—I was close by—he made no attempt to hit Kemp or Crudgington with the shovel—Kemp rushed into him, pushed the shovel out of his hand, and struck him an open blow on the side with the edge of the shovel, with a swing—he staggered, but did not fall—I spoke to him, but got no answer—I believe his breath was taken away with the blow; he was quite bent up putting his hands to his side—Crudgington then struck at him his fist—I cannot say if he struck him in the face or not—he then said, "Don't hit him any More"—Kemp threw the</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Essex. I was going along the Cambridge-road towards London—I saw four men in the road, fifteen or twenty yards off—they were going to fight—Crudgington struck Ives a severe blow in the face with his right hand—Ives had nothing in his hands, they were down, but the next moment he raised a shovel with both hands before his face—he did not attempt to strike—after a little hesitation, perhaps half-a-minuts, Kemp seized him by the left arm, and got hold od the shovel with both hands—a severe struggle ensued for the possession of it—the blade was towards Kemp, who succeeded in wresting it from him by twisting it, and then held it in both hands, and struck Ives a full swinging blow on the left side with the edge of it—I kept my eye on them from the moment Crudgington struck—I and two or three others cried "Shame!" and "Police!"—I followed the pri<lb></lb>soners, and saw a policeman, who took Kemp in one of the back streets, near North-street, Whitechapel—there was am attempt to rescue him—I saw Crudg<lb></lb>ington strike the officer once.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">BENJAMIN CLARK</hi>. I am a surgeon, at Hackney. I was fetched by Cobley, on Sunday evening, 2nd Jan., and found lves almost in a dying state, labouring under an attack of small-pox—he complained of an injury in his side—I administered such remedies as I thought applicable, and attended him every day till he died, on Monday morning, the 10th—I considered it a favourable case of small-pox, though very severe, but it declined—there is a crisis in small-pox; it reaches its highest point, and recedes—that had com-pletely passed before his death—I should say, when I saw him on the 2nd, it wanted about forty-eight hours to the crisis, which was on the evening of the 4th—he passed it remarkably favourably—I said, that as the small-pox declined, his side would be affected—I heard that he was suffering from violent paroxysms of pain in the side, and before I could reach him he died—the small-pox would act as a counter-irritant to assuage the pain in the side—as it approached the crisis, the pain in the side diminished, and as it declined, the man complained—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and finding none of the marks which we usually find on death from small-pox, my opinion is that the disease, in its inflammatory stage, prevented inflammation going on in the stomach, as the result of the previous injury—four ribs were fractured, and the spleen immediately under them was contused—there was inflammation of the membrane lining the cavity of the stomach—the inflammation and contusion of the spleen were clearly referable to the fracture of the ribs, which appeared to have been done a fortnight or three weeks before; but the disease had prevented union—there was very little attempt at bony union; that would be checked by the small-pox—there was nothing during life, or after death, to induce me to think death was caused by small-pox—I should say he died from extreme exhaustion, by the shock he received from the injury in the side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you swear the small-pox had nothing to do with his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The combined effects of the small-pox, with its ex-hausting influence coming on that which had previously exhausted him, would of course accelerate, or rather produce death—the exhaustion was the com-bined effect of the two causes—it is more than probable he might have rallied from the effect of the injury, if there had not been small-pox—in saying it was severe, I mean the eruption was extensive—Mr. Bull assisted me in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—in my opinion, death was caused by the com-bined effects of the injury and the small-pox.</p>

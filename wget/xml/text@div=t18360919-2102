                  </hi>. I am shopman to Lawrence Kennedy, of Shadwell, a pawnbroker. On Wednesday, the 24th of August, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner was in my shop—I missed some shawls and the next morning, one red and one green—the prisoner came and offered the green shawl to pledge the same morning—I had a private mark in ink on the corner—I can swear that none of my shopmen sold it—I have one besides my self and the boy—I asked where she got it—she said she had bought it of me last Saturday, and gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—that would be the selling price—I then taxed her with stealing it—she said she had not stolen it—she had not bought it of me, but it was lent her buy another woman, and if I would allow her to go she would fetch her—I allowed her to go, and she came back again and said she was gone, and would come presently—Mrs. Eeles told me she had the red shawl—when she came back I asked her where the red shawl was—she said has had left it at home—I gave her into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was going up King David-lane and met a man who asked me to have something to drink—I paid for one glass, she paid for another, and not having any more, she asked me to go and pledge that red shawl—If I had stolen it, I should not go again to that shop to pledge it—her name is Mary Ann Thompson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in Mr. Kennedy's shop-the prisoner came there and asked me to show her some 1 shawls—I showed her about a dozen and a half of various patterns she noticed a green one, which she said she should like to have—it was this one, or one the very picture of it, and red one but no the one we lost—I did not miss any that night, but the next morning; and when the shawl was offered for pledge, I told Sizer I thought that was the one we had lost.</p>

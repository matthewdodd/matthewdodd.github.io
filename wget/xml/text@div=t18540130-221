                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a boot and shoe maker; I have been in England about eight weeks; I have been lodging at Mr. Rose's, No. 1, Shorter-street, Wellclose-square. On Monday night, Dec. 19th, I left home about 5 o'clock, leaving sixty-three pairs of boots and shoes in my room—I locked the door of my room, and the door of the house when I left—I returned at half-past 10—I found the street door to, and my bed-room door open; the street door was locked, the key was turned—I went into my room and missed all my boots and shoes—these produced are mine—the bag in which they are is not mine—I had left some of the boots on the table—I had left no one in the room, my wife was not in England—these boots (<hi rend="italic">looking at a pair</hi>) are my property—they have my mark—some of the boots are marked with the letter K.</p>

From information which I received touching this robbery, I went on Wednesday afternoon, 21st Dec, at 5 o'clock, to a marine store-dealer's, at 4, Queen-street, Tower-hill; it was kept by the Chapmans—I saw Mercy Chapman in the shop at the time I went in—I have known the marine store shop for some time—Mercy Chapman's name is over the door—I have had occasion to go to the shop several times.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Vandenberg at the marine store shop at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did not go there with me—I ran round there first, and he came after me—I had not had any communication with him, two other constables had.</p>

               <p>"No; I don't lay out more than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day"—Smith was trying to push the boots towards the passage; it is a passage that separates the shop and back parlour from the backyard—there is a partition between the shop and parlour, and the passage runs along by the side of them into the back yard, there is a door leading from the passage into the back parlour; the passage is an ordinary side entrance—Smith said, "If anybody is to blame it is me; take me, Mercy and John had nothing to do with it"—she said, "I took the boots in, a man brought them, and said he would call again at 9 o'clock to-morrow night;" both the Chapmans said, if I went to John-street to inquire, I should find they had been making inquiries about a loan when the boots were brought—Mercy Chapman said so—I do not know whether John Chapman said so; he might, but I very well recollect that it was said—another constable, named Payne, came in shortly afterwards; he came in about a minute after me—Vandenberg came in about five or six minutes after me, it might have been ten minutes—some time after I had been there, John Chapman went out; I went away to the station house to fetch some one else down to help search the house, and he went out in the mean time—he came back again—I do not know how long he was away, it might have been three quarters of an hour; when I went away at night, after searching the house through, I left Vandenberg in the house; that was at Mercy Chapman's request—I heard her ask him to stay—he said, "Well, I shall go home," and she said, "Pray don't go, don't go away and leave me; stop here"—I left him in the house with two others, a man named Matthews and his son—Smith told me that she was a servant out of place, and that she had been lodging with Mercy Chapman—I do not recollect that she told me how long she had been lodging there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

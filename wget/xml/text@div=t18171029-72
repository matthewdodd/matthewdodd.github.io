I had lost money, and on the 16th of October, after business was over, I marked 40s., and put 20s. into the till, which I usually did, for change for the next day-there were several 3s. pieces among it. In the morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Hawkes gave me information. I got Dennis, the constable, and told him to search all my men, which he did, and produced a 3s. token to me which was one that I had marked. I asked the prisoner if that was found on him? he said it was.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Taylor. On the 17th of October, about seven o'clock in the morning I examined the tills, and found 20s. in each, all marked. I went to breakfast, leaving the prisoner in the shop alone-there had been no customers that morning. The other man returned to the shop after me. I came up at half-past eight, and missed a 3s. piece from one of the tills-there were only 17s. there. When the constable came he searched us; he found a marked 3s. piece on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There is no animosity between me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>DANIEL DENNIS. I am a constable. I searched the men, and found a 3s. piece on the prisoner, which was marked; he had 21s.6d. on him.</p>

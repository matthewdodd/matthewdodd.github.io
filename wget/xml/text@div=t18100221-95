            . On Saturday evening the 13th of January between seven and eight o'clock, being in company with Valentine in Dog-row, Bethnal-green, we saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, we stopped him, and asked him what he was carrying; he said, it was nothing, we took him into a shoemaker's shop, and examined what it was; it was withinside of his great rough coat, buttoned up round the body, tied up round the collar and bottom with rope yarn, so as to conceal the contents; he said, it was hemp that a man of the name of Freeman working for Mr. Tierney in the Commercial Road had given him. There is such a rope-maker there, close to Mr. Dawson, we told him that we did not believe his story, that we must take him before the magistrate, he then said, he would tell us the truth, he worked for Mr. Dawson in the Commercial Road, and that it was hemp that he had been to work on that day, and that he had stolen it from his master, we went to Mr. Dawson, and asked him if he worked for him, he said, he did.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is worth twenty shillings; it is very much the appearance of the hemp that we were making use of at the time, it is a thing that is impossible for any person to swear to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Them officers told me, if I would tell them where I took it, they would let me go about my business.</p>
               <p>- GLEED. He said there were only us two, he offered us money to settle it with him, we told him it must be settled before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

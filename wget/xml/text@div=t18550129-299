                  </hi>. I reside in Grove street, Camden<lb></lb>town; I am a carpenter and turner. I know the prisoner—I first saw him about the 12th Sept.—I went then to where he resided, at No. 42, King-street, Wool<lb></lb>wich—I was first introduced to him by a man of the name of Thompson—the prisoner said to me, "You are the party that wants to go to Australia, are you not?"—I told him I was—he asked me what I was—I told him I was a carpenter and turner—he asked if I was married—I told him I was, and I had three children—he asked me their ages—I told him a little girl six years old next birth day, a little boy three years of age, and another little boy about sixteen months—I asked him if he could get me out—he said, "Oh, yes," and he gave me a printed form—there was nothing done at that time with that form; it was not written on, it was folded up—he asked for a sovereign, and I paid it—nothing further was said with respect to the price at that time—he told me to take that form home, and fill it up accord<lb></lb>ing to the directions on it, and bring it to him in about a week's time—I filled up that form, and went to him about a week afterwards myself, along with a man of the name of Hindes—I took the printed form which I had filled up, with me—I gave it to the prisoner—he looked at it, and said it was filled up incorrectly, on account of my name—there was a mistake in my name, and he gave me another one to fill up, and said I was to send it down to him as soon as I could—but then there were three of us wished to go, and it was agreed I should act for them—there were three families, myself, my wife, and children; Learmond, and his wife and family; and Hindes and his family—that was mentioned to the prisoner on the second occasion—I mentioned it to him myself—I said, "Now, Sir, let us under<lb></lb>stand: what have we to pay you to get us out?"(the other persons had had an introduction to him, and he had given them a form the same as me)—I said, "What have we to pay you to get us out?"—he said, "Let me see, how many of you are there going?"—I told him the three families, that was Hindes, and myself, and Learmond—I told him how many there were, and I said, "There was something said about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—he considered for half a minute, and he said, "Yes, that will do"—he said, "I would rather treat with you than a good many, and I will look to you for the money"—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me, and he said, "You make me up 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now, and the other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I obtain for you what is called an approval order, and the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I obtain for you the embarkation order"—I said to him, "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid you when I got the form, Learmond has paid you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I paid you myself, and Hindes 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and here are 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which makes 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—previous to paying the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I asked if he had authority to get us out, and he said, "I have sufficient influence to do all I say I will do, and all I promise you"—there were two different papers given me to fill up—this is the last one (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he could not have the other, because I destroyed that myself—at the time he gave me the second form, he said he had influence to get me out—the form was to be directed to S. Walcott, Esq., Park-street, Westminster—he did not mention the Commissioners, or Park-street, before I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards—he said that he could send me—he did not say anything about having autho<lb></lb>rity to receive any money; no more than he said he could do it and he would do it—he did not say he had authority to receive money—I saw him again after the second interview—he said I was to see him again in a week or ten days—I filled up the form and sent it to him by post—I did not post it myself, but this is the form—I saw him again in about a week or ten days, at Woolwich—I always saw him at Woolwich—he told me that my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290085"></xptr>
               <p>paper was right, I should go—I told him I thought I could not go—he said, "Why not?"—I told him I had three children under seven years of age—I he said, "That is all nonsense; I will make that right"—he then turned round and took a memorandum book off the sofa, or some place, and he said, "Mr. Bishop," or "Mr. Bailey has passed you all; you, Learmond, and Hindes, and you are all right."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say anything about the number of persons who were waiting for turns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—one and another were talking, and I said, "How is it we can get out?" and he said, "If you apply to Park-street, in the ordinary way, you will have to wait your turn of 15,000 or 16,000"—he said if we paid him the money, he would get us out when we pleased—I believe he said that every time—he said it before he got the money—he said, on the first occasion, "Mark down on your paper the time you want to go"—I said I wanted to go about Feb.—he said, "That will do"—he said on the first occasion, "I can get you out any time you want to go "; and he asked me what time, and I said, "February"; and in the course of the same con<lb></lb>versation he said, "I can get you out any time you want to go"—I believe nothing was said about our having to wait our turn of 15,000 or 16,000 on the first occasion—I believe that was on the second occasion—it was before I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because directly I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we came away—he told me to destroy the first form—on the bottom of this second form here is, "Wish to embark at the end of Feb., 1855"; that is my wife's writing—the first form was filled up just as this is—I can swear that "Wish to embark at the end of Feb., 1855," was on the first form—I wrote it myself—on the second occa<lb></lb>sion he said, if we applied to Park-street, we should have to wait our turn of 15,000 or 16,000, and it would take us two years, as all these applica<lb></lb>tions were before us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induced you to pay him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was introduced to the prisoner by Thompson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But what representation of the prisoner was it that induced you to pay that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not represent anything, he only said that he could do it—that was the whole and sole reason—I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because I knew that he had got other men out, and he said he would get me out in the same way—I took his word for it, and paid him the money—he said he would do all that he promised to do, he would get us out to Adelaide—it was his promise induced me to do it, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you believe him to be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A gentleman—I did not at that time believe him to hold any office—I relied on his promise, and his saying he had influence and power to do it, and would do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the third or fourth occasion, having told you you were passed, did he say anything about the orders waiting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on the third occasion he said, "You are passed"—I then asked him when we could have our approval orders—he said, "When you like; they are all ready, waiting for you "; and he said we had to pay him our 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Will it do if we come for them in about a week's time; we may have our 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ready by that time; can we have the approval orders?"—he said, "Yes," we could have them—I made some inquiries on a Saturday at the emigra<lb></lb>tion office—I got some information—I saw the prisoner afterwards on 3rd Dec; I told him he had been deceiving us; he could not send us; he had no power to do it; "You have no power to get us out, "I think I said—that was on the Sunday—I told him the papers were not at Park-street; he had told me that they Were when he told me that they were waiting</p>

               <p>for me, he told me they were at Park-street—I told him the papers were not at Park-street—he said it was all d—stuff, he had the power to send us, and he would send us; he had the power to do so, and would do so, in spite of the Commissioners, or anybody—he brought up some papers and said, "I have heard from the Commissioners in Park-street; I shall go up there to-morrow and set this right," and he would come round and fetch us all in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and take us to Park-street—that was on the Sunday previous to his being apprehended—he did not come and fetch us—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I never paid him the second 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who is Thompson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A working man, a sawyer; he is gone to Australia.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you know whether it was through my agency that Thompson went out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only know what Thompson told me, that you got him out—I came to you with Thompson on the first occasion—it was on that first occasion that I came to you that you gave me the printed form—Thompson did not say in my presence, "This man wishes to go out in a similar manner to what we are going"—you did not point out to me on the form under what regulations persons would be sent out—the form was not opened—I never opened the form till I got home—you did not tell me to read it—you said, "Fill up that form, and bring it down with you in a week's time to me"—I read it when I got home—the form stated under what qualifications or regulations I would be taken out, and that was the reason I pointed out to you respecting the children—I told you I was not qualified, and you told me you could do it—I believe I pointed out that to you every time I saw you, because I had my doubts about it—after I had discovered it, I pointed it out to you, and you told me you would settle that—on the third occasion you told me I was passed—(<hi rend="italic">at the pri<lb></lb>soner's request the witness's deposition was here read</hi>)—I said on the first occasion that I was not eligible on account of having three children; that was after I had filled up the first paper—when I brought you the first paper I told you that—you took out a memorandum book, and told me Mr. Bailey or Mr. Bishop had passed me—it was an ordinary penny memoran<lb></lb>dum book—I think it had red covers, but not being sure I did not say so—I know it was an ordinary penny memorandum book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your object was to employ me to get you to Australia 1<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My object was to go there—I went to you because I thought you could get me out—I did not know by what means—I took your word for it—you told me you could get me out—I went to you in consequence of what Thompson told me, that you could get me out—that was the reason I went to you—when I stated that my friends had paid you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I meant that my friends Learmond and Hindes had paid you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I believe Learmond and Hindes had applied to you previous to my coming—they told me they had been there—when I brought the first form to you, you told me it was incorrectly filled up—I applied to you in the name of Frederick Greenwood and the first form I filled up in the name of Frederick Greenwood—I signed the declaration attached to the form—you looked at me and said, "I thought your name was Hales"—I said, I thought it was no consequence; I was illegitimate—I took my marriage certificate on the second occa<lb></lb>sion,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290087"></xptr>
               <p>but it was with the first paper that I took back that the name was Greenwood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you took the certificate on the second occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when I took the form back—on the certificate, the name is "Frederick Greenwood Hales," and in consequence of that, the defendant said my name was incorrect as Frederick Greenwood—I took Greenwood as a Christian name—I had not gone by the name of Frederick Greenwood Hales—I went by the name of Greenwood—my shopmates knowing me by the name of Greenwood, and Thompson knowing me by that name, I was introduced to the prisoner in that name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not state to me that you had seen a letter from Mr. Bailey to Thompson, saying that if he did not pay me he could not go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am certain I never did state that to you—I do not believe that I ever did state so—I did to Mr. Bailey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not at my lodging say that you saw a letter from Mr. Bailey to Mr. Daniel Thompson saying, that if he did not pay me he could not go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say for certainty that I did or did not; I cannot recol<lb></lb>lect whether I said in course of conversation that I thought you must have great power, for I had seen a letter from Mr. Bailey to Thompson saying, that he could not let him go without he paid you—I do not recollect—when I first had the form, I paid you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards which made 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I then paid you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more on account of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was men<lb></lb>tioned to get us all out—on account of the whole of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not understand that this was for my expenses and loss of time; going up to town and inquiring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never understood any-thing of that sort—I gave you the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get us to Adelaide—I did not know for what services, or how you were to do it—you said you would get us to Adelaide, if we paid you that money.</p>

"—it was about the 12th Sept. I first came to you—I do not know that you stated on the first occasion, that I should have to wait my turn of 15,000 or 16,000—you did on the second occasion, I will swear that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you had seen a letter from Mr. Bailey, saying that he would not let Thompson go out, unless he paid the defendant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was shown me by Thompson—he said, "Look here what I have got from Mr. Bailey," and he showed it me—the name of Bailey was signed to it, saying that if he did not call and pay the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Maturin, he should not go—Thompson told me that Maturin had got him out—my deposition, and what I stated on cross-examination is true to the best of my belief—there may be a little word or two altered—I said, on the second time I showed him the printed form and said I did not think I was eligible, because I had three children under seven—he said, "I can do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290088"></xptr>
               <p>that," and laughed—he took out a book and said, "Mr. some name has passed you"—the first time he merely gave me the form—I signed the declaration after I had called his attention to the ages of the children, because he said it was all right, he could do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> On the Sunday did I not read to you a letter which I had received from the Commissioners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You read some long paper—I could not say what was in it—that was on the Sunday previous to your being given into custody—you did produce a letter, and said it was a letter you had had from the Commissioners at Park-street—that was on the Sunday before you were apprehended—you read it, and you read what you repre<lb></lb>sented as your reply, but I do not know what was in it—I did not read the letter which Thompson told me he received from Mr. Bailey—Thompson came down with a letter in his hand, and said, "Look here, what I have received from Mr. Bailey"—I saw the name of Bailey on it—it was not a form—it was on a small sheet of note paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Upper Harland-street, Kentish-town, and am a carpenter. In September I was desirous to emigrate—I saw the defendant at his house, at Woolwich, about 12th Sept.—I was introduced by a person named Thompson—the defendant asked my age, my family, and my occupation—I told him I had a child two months old, and I had a boy nearly three years of age—I said, "Do you think there is any chance of my getting out?"—he said, "Certainly, you are eligible; I will send you out in spite of everything, or else I should not take your money"—there was nothing said that night about the pay he was-to have, but we paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Hales and me, the first night—I paid him that, because Thompson had told me before—Thompson was with us—Thompson introduced me—he said, "This is Learmond, the party I told you about"—the prisoner said, "Take a seat"—I sat down, and he asked my age and my family's age—I said, "Am I eligible? can you send me out?"—he said, "Certainly, I will send you out in spite of everything"—he gave me some papers, one form for me and one for Greenwood Hales, and I. paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "I will get you out in spite of everything, or else I should not take your money"—I paid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290089"></xptr>
               <p>that pound became he told me he had sufficient influence and power to send me out, and he had a brother out there—he said that after I paid the money, and before also.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he said it twice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he used that word "power," that he had power to send me out, before I paid my money.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>about my papers, and I went to Fendall's, and found the defendant there—I said, "Mr. Maturin, Mr. Bishop says I must have more certificates, the certificates of my children and my wife" (the baptismal certificates)—the defendant said, "I will come along with you"—he went back along with me—he went up to Mr. Bishop's office—Mr. Bishop said he did not see any<lb></lb>thing against me, but it was out of his power, or any other man's, to offer me a passage—I said to the defendant, "I can't get the certificates of my wife and children so quickly as they are wanted"; and he said, "You can make an affidavit of their ages"; and Mr. Bishop said that was perfectly right, that would do as well as my certificates—I was not passed at all—I was told to get these certificates—Mr. Bishop did not say I was eligible; but he said he saw nothing against me, if I got my certificates or the affidavits—he said that neither he nor any other man had got any power to offer me a passage, until the Commissioners had given their consent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer—I live in Lea Bourne-road, Camden-town—I was working at Collard's—Hales and Learmond were working there—Thompson had worked there—I sent in an application to the Emigration Office, in Park-street, Westminster, and on 22nd Oct., I received a refusal order—from something I heard, I went on 29th Oct. to No. 42, King-street, Woolwich—I saw the defendant—he first sent his servant to know who it was—after a little waiting, another party came, and the defendant came down—he said to the other party, "Have you got your papers?"—he settled with that man, and then he said to me, "Are you the man that wants to see me"; I said, "Yes; I have come about a passage to Australia"—he asked me where I wanted to go; I told him to Sydney, but I said, "Before we go any further, I wish to state I have applied to Park-street, and received a refusal answer"—I opened the envelope and handed it to him; he took it from me, and laughed at it—he said, "Because there are so many applications, 15,000 or 16,000, there must be some refusals; they must refuse somebody, but you are the very party they want out there, having a wife and no family"—he took the order and said, "I will see into it"—I thanked him and was coming away, and he said, "Do you know what you will have to pay for going to Sydney?" I said, "Yes, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. according to the regulations—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the commissioners, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within fourteen days after my arrival in the colony"—he said, "You had better go to Adelaide; you will only have to pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I will give you a letter"; I said I thought it would not suit me so well—he said, "I have a brother there; I have influence"—I declined to go there, and he then</p>

               <p>said, "You will pay me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I have a percentage from the Govern<lb></lb>ment; 1' I told him I had noticed that nothing was said about paying the money in the form—he said, "Well, I can do nothing in it without the papers and the money; meet me to-morrow morning at my office in Park-street"—previous to my coming away he said, "By-the-by, it will be better to meet me between 1 and 2 o'clock, when the clerks go to lunch at Story's Hotel"; I was to meet him there—I went about a quarter before 1 o'clock, and had my marriage certificate and my wife's certificate—I said I could only raise him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I gave him; he said it was all d—d stuff, and he could do nothing without the remainder of the money, because he had got so many parties their approval and shipping orders, and they had never paid him the money—on 5th Nov. I went to his private house at Woolwich; I paid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me a new form—he told me it must be sent directly, as he was going to Wales; I filled it up, and sent it down to his house by post on 8th Nov.—this is the first form (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) that I sent into Park-street; I got a refusal answer to this—this other is the form which I obtained from the prisoner, and sent him by post filled up—I had given him at Storey's-gate, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Woolwich, because he told me he was authorised to take the to obtain my approval and embarkation orders—if he had not told me he was authorised, I should not have parted with my money; most decidedly not; I work too hard for it—I believed he was authorised by Government—on 12th Nov. I went to him again, and he told me I was passed, and that I must go directly—he told me he had my approval order, and everything ready for me, and I must go directly; I told him I was not ready—he got up and walked about the room, and said, "If you don't go it is not my fault, mind that"—I told him I would be ready when I obtained my orders, and he said, "Send the remainder of the money by Learmond; it will save your losing time"; I sent 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 13th Nov.—I said to Learmond, "Here is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., don't part with that till you get my orders"—it was in the belief that the defend-ant had the orders, that I sent the money—I parted with everything, and sold every individual thing during that week, because he told me I was to go early in Dec.—I was not able to get my passage, and have never got any of my money back.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say, "If I have got you into a scrape it is all the fault of that little man, Mr. Baynes, for I took care to call him out to know that his name was Baynes, before I gave him your note?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—you said, "I have done wrong in sending you to that fool, Baynes; I ought to have sent you to Bailey, for he has got your papers, and I will make him tremble"—you told me to be particular and give the note to Mr. Baynes—I did not tell you at the Royal Exchange that I had called Mr. Baynes out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My lord, I stand before you under the greatest dis<lb></lb>advantage; in the first place, my case has been placed since the last Session in the hands of a solicitor, and I was under the impression and informed that my brief and the whole of my case has been in the hands of Mr. Clark-son, and I was further informed that Mr. Ballantine and Mr. Clarkson had agreed that my case should come on this day; I paid no attention to this matter, resting sure I was in good hands, I gave myself no concern, but to my great astonishment I was brought up on Monday morning without a brief, or anything, and told that my trial was put off till this day. The wit<lb></lb>ness has stated that he remarked to me when he brought the form filled up, that he was ineligible on account of the children, and that I told him he had passed; how was it possible for me to tell him that when he knew that the case had not gone up to Park-street? to him, and to every man who applied to me, I gave them the Government form, stating the regulations on which they can be conveyed; they are there informed that they are not to pay any money to any one; they! are informed that no person has any power or authority to grant or promise a passage, except the Commissioners, and they are not to give up their business till they have received the approval of the Commissioners; every man who applied to me was in possession of that; I was cautious in pointing it out; I asked them all if they could read and write, and they had days to look at the form and study, and read it, and therefore they had sense enough to know whether they were doing right in coming to me; I was at the dockyard one day, when a man of the name of Thompson came to me, and said, "I know you are very well connected in Australia; there is one of our men who wishes very much to go out; he is a hardworking man, will you be kind enough to try and get him out? his name is Neale"; I said, "I have no means of getting him out, but if he goes to the Commissioners' Office no doubt he will go"; this man came to me on several occasions, and I said the first time I was in town I would inquire at the Emigration Office; I went and spoke to some one; I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290096"></xptr>
               <p>no idea who, and I obtained a form and gave it to this man Neale, and I said, "If you will fill it up, if you are eligible, you will go out"; it went to Park-street, and he got an order; for this I received no remuneration; it never entered my head; a few weeks after, Thompson came to me at my lodgings, and said, "I want to speak to you particularly; my brother and three shopmates are very anxious to go out to Australia"; I said, "What nonsense are you talking? if a man has not money to pay, let him go to the Emigration Office"; he said, "They would give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you could get them off"; he went away, and he came again, and said the men could not leave their work, and they knew if I would undertake it, I could get them off, and they would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a piece; I said I would consider it; I con<lb></lb>sidered whether I was justified in acting as an agent for these persons, and I spoke to others about it, and asked their opinion whether I could act as an agent; the person came a second time, and said, "Will you do it?" I said, "Bring the men here to me," and he said, "Very well"; his brother, Daniel Thompson, Chamberlain, and another came; they said they wished to go as soon as they possibly could; this, I think, was in the early part of Aug.; I had no form, I had nothing of the kind; I went to Park-street, and asked them to give me three forms; these were given, and I brought them down, and gave them to the men.; I desired them to fill them up, and bring them to me, or take them to Park-street; they brought them to me; I told them to take them to Park-street; they took them, and in a few days they came and told me they had received approval orders, and they brought me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and in a few days they received their embarkation "orders; a few days after Taylor brought me his boy, who had been thrown on his hands; he had been: to school, and they were desirous to take him; I came and spoke to Mr. Kent, and he let me have another order; this gained great notoriety; they knew on what terms these persons had gone, and they all came to me from Camden-town and the different suburbs; they all came to me, knowing the advantage they would have in coming to me; knowing that they would get there for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this was the reason why so many persons sought me; when Hales came to me, he came with Thompson, and he must have had conver<lb></lb>sation with him, and he must have known what he had said; I said, "I am not going to run about for you without I am paid for it"; he then gave me., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as be states to you, and he said he would leave that; I said, "I don't want any more money till you get your orders"; in case of any one not going whom I apply for, I return their money; Hales states that he was not to pay me till he received his approval order, and then only a portion, and the remainder when he got his embarkation order; this was my own proposal; this shows that no felonious intention was in my mind; from the confidence which these persons had in me, I might have obtained from them and the numerous persons who applied, a vast amount of money had I chosen to act fraudulently; I had every possible means of leaving the country, and going where I thought proper—having been in the earlier part of my life in the Royal Navy, I had volunteered for the Black Sea, the ships were going out day after day; I might have lined my pockets pretty well, and joined one of the ships in the Mediterranean, or the Black Sea; if I were desirous of remaining at home, my residence was in Wales where my mother and the whole of my family reside; I was anxious to go there and retire for a short while, and then go to the Mediterranean; the whole of our family are known in Carnarvon and Monmouthshire; under these circum<lb></lb>stances, I applied to the Commissioners to appoint me their agent there; if I had designed to defraud these men, it is not likely should have applied</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290097"></xptr>
               <p>to the Commissioners; I must hare known it would eventually have come to their knowledge; Learmond said to me, "Mr. Maturin, you have always behaved to me as a gentleman; I am perfectly satisfied with what you hare done"; Osborn went with me there, and he expressed himself satisfied; another man was found ineligible, and he said he would like to go to some other place, and afterwards he said he would not go at all; I said, "Very well; I must return your money; I will not retain any man's money that I do not do the business for"; Learmond gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I never saw him again till I was taken; Hales states that I took out a red memorandum book, and told him that Bailey or Bishop had passed him, and when Mr. Pelham held up the only book that was found in my possession, he said that was not the book, it was a red memorandum book that I read to him; now I will prove that I never had such a book in my possession; he stated that Thompson paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and subsequently he denied that he said so; afterwards he said that he meant Learmond and Hindes; it is very odd that Thompson should have been there the same day, and yet they should have been there separately; he knows very well that he had only paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on a subsequent occasion he gave me another pound, and that was given me to pay my expenses, and from these persons I received no other sum whatever, neither have I demanded any; when the forms were brought to me they all stated that they did not want to go till Feb., 1855; I said, "What do you come to me now for, when you don't want to go till February? there the forms must lie; I will put them in at the proper time"; I presume that would have been in the latter end of October; I therefore retained the applications till I considered it was a fitting period to send them in; during a conversation I had with one of the officers of the Emigration Office, I said, "If applica<lb></lb>tions are sent in, what is the usual time they come in?" he said, "It depends very much on the number of applications on the books"; I said, "Persons intending to go in February, when should they come in?" he said, "In about six weeks' time"; I said, "Very well; there are two persons I wish to send out"; Hales states in his evidence that he came to me in consequence of what he heard from Thompson, who told him I could send him out; he says he did not know in what manner I could send him, and that I did not represent that I belonged to the Emigration Office—with respect to the amount offered to me, when they offered me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I told them all I required was to remunerate me for my loss of time and the expenses I was at; I cannot recollect all the conversation, and I am perfectly certain they cannot; with respect to Seamer's evidence, he acknowledges that it was in cones<lb></lb>quence of what he beard from Thompson that he came to me; now he had applied to Park-street, he knew very well the proper form to go through, he had gone through it, and was unsuccessful; he knew that his other shopmates had got away, and he came to me to obtain my services; it is not likely he would have come to me, a perfect stranger, to get him over to Australia, or to give him advice, without he had known or imagined that I had some influence, and if he paid me I would get over that difficulty; he states that I said, "You know what you will have to pay for going to Sydney, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. here, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after you get there"; I said, "You are a very foolish man; you had better go to Adelaide, that is a registered colony; you would do better there"; he said, No, he would rather go where he said; I told him there must be some mistake, which I believed to be so, because on the face of the form it states that sawyers are eligible, and I now request that the Jury may see the form; he says that I said, "I will do nothing for you unless" you pay me, for I have got so many off who have not paid me"; now having</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290098"></xptr>
               <p>told him that, how could he believe that what I received was on the part of Government; these men came to me because they had an idea that I could get them off; when persons applied to me, I said I would inquire for them; I took Seamer's case, because he was out of work, and he said he would be very much obliged to me to get him there; I thought he was a most eligible person; I read the form, and told him that there must be some mistake in his mode of application; I said, "Meet me at Storey's-gate, I will make some inquiries, bring your certificates of your marriage, your birth, and your trade"; he came and spoke to me, and put something in my hand; I could not tell you what it was, for I put it in my pocket with other money; I do not know what it was; I said, "Very well, I will make some inquiries; I will give you a new form"; I gave it him; I told him I was going to Wales, and the sooner he sent it me the better; he sent it by post, but I was taken ill, and was attended by a doctor; that was the reason the application did not go up; as to my saying that I had his approval order, I deny it; he must have been aware that I had not got that order; he knew that I sent a note to Mr. Baynes, and he heard the reply of Mr. Baynes to me, where he says the case would be taken in turn; I intended to have taken his papers in, but I was ill, and not able to do so; when he sent the money by Learmond, I received it; I said I would not get his orders; I would not work for nothing; I was perfectly justified as a private individual to act as an agent for any one that came to me; if a person applies to you, and you think you are able to perform the service, you merely receiving enough to pay your expenses, on an understanding that they are afterwards to pay you for the service that you agree to perform for them, have you not a right to do so; I was not in the employ or payment of the Emigration Commission, nor have I ever received one farthing from them; I had a perfect right to act in the county of Kent; I had been appointed an agent in Wales, but I bad never gone there; I will prove that after my appointment, I gave instructions that no more persons could apply to me on the subject of emigration; I trust you will see that I had no fraudulent intention; thirty-five or forty persons have gone out through me, and they have gone on with their work till the time they were to go, and they are on their way to Australia; Mr. Kent has acknowledged, that several persons have gone out through my recommendation; it has been stated that I have in several cases returned their money; Hales never demanded his money from me, nor did Seamer; all they desired was to get away; when they came to me that Sunday, I read to them the letters from the Board of Commissioners, and my reply; I said, "You see the situation I am in, I can do nothing more, but I am determined to take every man of you to Park-street to see the Commissioners"; that was my intention, but I could not; I was sitting at dinner on Friday, and was taken by the officers; the Commissioners considered that I had acted a fraudulent part if I had received that money, but I stated on what terms I received it; I would have returned the money if I had had time, but I was not permitted to do it; I have been kept here two months; I will now leave my case entirely in your hands, if I have been in error or thoughtless I have borne punish<lb></lb>ment enough for it; but as for any idea of defrauding one of these men, such a thought never entered my mind; I have been in her Majesty's service, and suffered as no man ever suffered, in the West Indies, and other places; my thought and ideas were of a very different nature to this; could I have obtained access to my papers, I could have shown you what has been my situation and my intentions; when my country required my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290099"></xptr>
               <p>service, I volunteered to go to service again in the Mediterranean; I obtained this agency to go on with till I went in the spring; I intended to go to Wales to my mother, to stay there till I went away; I trust you will give me every justice, though a great deal of the truth has been concealed from you; though you can see that as Learmond, and Seamer, and Hales gave their evidence, there was a degree of vindictiveness, I believe, to excite compassion on the part of the public; I have nothing more to say, I throw myself on your hands; I firmly believe that whatever verdict you give will be according to conscience, and whether you return me guilty or not guilty, it is the will of God, and I am prepared to meet it.</p>

I am a timber merchant at Curtain Road—on going to my office on the morning of 11th September I noticed the safe had been taken from its stand and put on the floor—my cheque-book I had placed in the safe, and from what I heard I examined the cheque-book and found one cheque had been removed—this (cheque) is not my writing, and I never authorised any one to write it—I know all the prisoners; neither of them work for me.</p>

I am chief clerk; at the Shoreditch branch of the London and County Bank—this cheque was brought to us by Obney on the morning of 11th September, and submitted to me by a cashier—I detained it as irregular—I asked Obney from whom he had received it—he said from Mr. Gray, of Phipps Street—I said "Will you bring Mr. Gray to the bank!"—he was silent—I allowed him to go and followed him, but lost sight of him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G R</hi> 26).

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Smithers said he knew nothing whatever about it, and was innocent of the charge—the inspector thought there was not sufficient evidence and discharged him on the Saturday, and he came to the police-court as a witness, and from other evidence we received he was put into the dock as a prisoner.</p>

I am a gasfitter in New Inn Yard, a thoroughfare running from Curtain Road to Shoreditch, near the Bank—on Thursday, 11th, I was standing at my shop door, and saw Smithers come and knock at Obney's door—he touched his hat and said "Good morning, Mr. Dent"—as he knocked at the door I saw in his hand a London and County cheque—there is only five inches between my door and Obney's door—I saw him go into the passage, and afterwards saw him go towards the bank with young Obney.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not a friend of the Obney family—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I am subpœnaed here, and was not asked to come—Smithers was not three yards from me when I saw the cheque—he had it twisted round in his hand as if to keep it from blotting—anybody could see what kind of a cheque it was—I could see the London and County Bank written in the cheque—perhaps it was a branch—I have been in the habit of employing Obney to collect my little debts on Saturday for the last two years, and have never found anything wrong with him, and I think he has been misled.</p>

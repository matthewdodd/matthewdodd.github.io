                  </hi>. I am widow of General Sir Joseph McLean; I at present live in Wood-street, Woolwich. On the 24th of December I resided at Woolwich Common—my house was destroyed by fire that night, and the furniture that was saved was moved to a stable in the Royal Artillery barracks at Woolwich—about a fortnight after the fire I saw a star of the Hanoverian order of Knighthood at the Commandant's house—it was in a chest of my drawers—I had possession of the keys of the drawers—some of the furniture was afterwards removed from the stable to Wood-street—the military assisted in moving it—after it had been so removed I examined the drawer in which the star had previously been, and it was missing—there were marks of the lock being broken open, picked, as if the drawer had been forced—I also missed a gold ring which was cracked, and a purse with some gold and silver in it—I afterwards saw some pieces of silver at the Commandant's house at Woolwich, which decidedly belonged to the Hanoverian Order, but there was not the whole of it—it was mutilated.</p>

               <p>the 20th of January, I saw Murphy and a soldier named Hardy, they were on fatigue, moving her ladyship's baggage—they brought two chests of drawers from the Artillery barracks to Wood-street—I noticed the top drawer of the chest, it was firm and secure—I afterwards locked up the stable of the house in Wood-street—I had previously left Murphy and Hardy in the stable where the chest was—I missed them for a few minutes and asked what kept them there so long—they said it was so heavy, they could not get the things properly placed—on the following Monday, the 25th, I went to the stable with her ladyship, and found the drawer open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Woolwich. About the 22nd of January, Miles came to my shop in the evening, and asked if I bought old silver—I said, "Yes"—he said he had some in his pocket, which he would show me—he produced what appeared to have been a star of some order, broken in pieces—I asked where he got it from—he said, "From Spain"—I said he must get some one to prove it was his property—he said he could easily do that—he left the shop, and returned with the prisoner Murphy—I asked Murphy what he knew about this cross—he said he knew it belonged to Miles, and that he (Miles) had brought it from Spain with him—I asked Murphy his name—he said, "Murphy"—I asked him what he knew it by, how he knew it belonged to Miles, and what sort of a star it was—he said it had marks all over it, and the lion and unicorn on it—the star had no lion and unicorn on it—Miles called him-self Sweeney—they were dressed as they are now (as soldiers)—I told them I should apply at the Commandant's house, and told them to meet me there next morning—I sent the silver to the Commandant's house that evening, with the particulars of the affair—this is the silver now produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Royal Artillery. On Monday, the 25th of January, in consequence of information, I had all the men who had been employed in moving Lady M'Lean's furniture, collected, and brought to my quarters, having a sergeant-major with me—I examined them all separately, having Mr. Davis by me at the time, to get him to recognise any of the men—when it came to Murphy to be ex<lb></lb>amined, I saw at once from the way he answered, that he was a suspicious person, and on questioning him about the star, he said be had not a star, but he knew a man that had—he then gave me the name of Miles—I sent for him, kept them separate, questioned them, and in a very short time I got them to contradict each other—Miles told me that the star which he had brought from Spain, he broke up in Spain before he brought it home, and Murphy told me that he saw it in Miles's possession, a short time before, whole—Miles said he had got it from some fort in Spain—I then went with Miles to the guard-room, and held out some expectation, if he told me the truth, that it would be better for him—he then told me that what he had told me before was all false—I afterwards sent for Hardy—the silver produced was given to me at the Commandant's office, by the person who brought it from the pawnbroker's—I was present when Miles made a statement before the Magistrate—it was precisely the same as he had communicated to me—I had told him I would stand between him and punishment, if he would tell me the truth—Miles has been only four months in the regiment, and Murphy eleven or twelve, and both bore a very good character.</p>

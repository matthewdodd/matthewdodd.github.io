                  </hi>. I live in Richmond-street, Maida-hill. On the 6th of May I met with the prisoner in the Harrow-road, in the morning—I found she was very interesting in conversation respecting the East Indies—she said she was tutor, in a nobleman's family, and taught the young ladies music—she told me a variety of interesting things—she said she lodged in the City-road—we came on to my own door, and I asked her in to breakfast—I introduced her to my wife and sister—she was very familiar with my sister—I asked her to come and tea with me on the next Sunday—she came on the Thursday, the 9th—she stopped till four o'clock or half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, and then said, she, wished me to go out of the room, while she tied up her garter—I went out—I then showed her out of the house, and when I came back to the room, my watch was missing, which had hung over the mantel-piece—this is it—it had a chain, and seal, and key, attached to it.</p>

I know the prisoner by her visiting my sister—I was going to sea, and she promised me a great many things—I came home on Saturday, the 11th of May, and the prisoner was there—she had this chain and seal and key—she said she had promised them to my sister, but if I liked, and my sister would give them up, I might have them, and she gave them to me—I gave them to the police-officer.</p>

He has a Step-mother, and was turn'd out; and what he has done these three or four Years I cannot tell. He was clear'd by the Court last Wednesday. His Father knew that I had some Friends in St. Thomas's Hospital, and he wanted me to get his Son in there for a Distemper.</p>
               <p>Q. What Distemper?</p>
               <p>Charles. I believe the Fonl Disease. I went Yesterday to Lang's Shop, the Prosecutor, and he told me he had a great Misfortune, he said he had been robb'd, &amp;c. and, said he, 'tis by one Hudson: The Boy was by, and made Answer, that he was try'd Yesterday; and, says Lang, Are you clear'd; Yes, Sir, said he, I am. So he stoop'd down and took that Shoe in his Hand, and said, These are my Shoes, I will swear to them; and he said to me, Do you know any thing of this Boy's Character: I said, I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>

On the 27th of January, in the evening, I went into the Eagle and Child public-house, St. Martin's-le-grand; I called for a glass of rum. I sat down at a table where the prisoner and others were sitting; I asked the prisoner to partake of the rum and water, as she sat next to me, and when I drank a drop I paid for it, and went out, and she followed after me. We got into conversation together until we came to Dean's-court, and at Dean's-court two men were going backwards and forwards. I asked her if she knew who the men were. They passed arm in arm together before us. When we came to <placeName id="t18140216-74-crimeloc416">Dean's-court</placeName>

               <p>Q. Perhaps your breeches were loose at the time - A. No, they were not. I picked it up, and put it in my coat pocket; she took it out of my coat pocket, and ran away with it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did not you run after her - A. No, I did not. She was gone out of my sight in a minute. I cannot say which way she took.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you overtake her - A. No, I missed her. I went back to the house, and asked if they knew her; they said, yes. I gave the officer orders to take her up. He found her on the Saturday night afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure that she put her hand into your pocket - A. Yes, I am quite sure of it. There was nobody nigh but she and me.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Saturday evening I took the prisoner into custody. Mr. Hetherall said, that is the woman, and nobody else. The prisoner said, I did not do it, I know the two young men, I may get the ticket for him.</p>
               <p>COURT, to Prosecutor. Were the two young men near you when she took it - A. No, there was nobody but she and me together at the time.</p>

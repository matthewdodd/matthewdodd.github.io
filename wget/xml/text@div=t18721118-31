               <p>laughable tales, and were very friendly together, and at about 4.50 they began light sparring in a friendly manner—Little said "Only just take the fly off the nose"—the prisoner proposed slapping with the open hands, and Little agreed to it—the prisoner gave Little rather a hard smack in the face, and Little said "That is a cowardly action, and I take it as an insult;" and he put up his fist and hit the counter, and said "So help my Christ, if you only attempt to do that again, you or I will be a corpse"—the prisoner went out first, and left us both there; I went out next, and left Little in the public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman of 8, Springfield Gardens, Kilburn—on Saturday, 26th October, I was in the stables in Carlton Mews, about 6 o'clock p.m.—the prisoner was engaged there, he is a coachman—Little came in and asked me for a pail—he was employed at the same stable, as a coachman—the prisoner said "Hallea, <hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> are you ready for another go"—Little told him to <hi rend="italic">ax</hi> his b——a—; and prisoner said "F—your b—a—; you know <hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> I told you before, you are no man"—Little said "You are no man"—the prisoner said "I am man enough to be your master, when and where you like"—Little said "Yon had better start"—they were then about three-quarters of a yard apart, and the prisoner struck him in the mouth with his hand—I think it was shut, but I can't swear positively—they dosed together immediately, and reeled against the the stall-post and down into the stall, where there was a horse, which set to kicking directly, and kicked them both—I could not see where it kicked Little—I ran and caught him by the heels, and pulled him out immediately—he did not speak, he was not conscious—he was taken to St. Mary's Hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He reeled right under the horse; they both reeled, but the prisoner got out, and clutched the post, or no doubt he would have shared the same fate as the other—the prisoner has been my fellow-servant seven years, and is, generally speaking, quiet—I never saw anything wrong with him—Little did nothing to provoke him in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman, and live at 24, Elgin Terrace, Maida Vale—I was in this stable—I have heard Moore give his evidence; it is true, but there were one or two additional words—the prisoner was sitting joking with me in the stable; he was in liquor a little, but Little was not, that I could see—the first blow was not a blow to hurt; it was a sort of challenge—the prisoner said "I am man enough to be your master," and Little said "Then you can start," or "You had better perform," or "You can strike when you are ready"—I considered that "start" meant fighting—I do not know that "start" has any meaning among our people—Little was outside the door; he had turned back to go for a pail when the prisoner spoke to him.</p>

               <p>from compound fracture of the skull and depression, of the brain; there was also a fracture of the jaw in two places, and some scratches on his face—a compound fracture is when the bone protrudes—they were such wounds as would be occasioned by the kick of a horse—he died on the following Tuesday night, soon after 5 o'clock—he was never conscious—there was a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; death arose from compression of the brain, resulting from the fracture.</p>

He suggested the case of a man pursuing another down stairs, who falls and is then bitten by a mad dog, and dies; death could not there be said to be the act of the person pursuing him. The blows in this case were outside the stable, and it was no fault of the prisoner's that the deceased fell under the horse, nor was it proved that the prisoner knew that there was any horse in the stable. Death did not, therefore, flow out of the act of the prisoner, so as to constitute manslaughter. (See</hi> "Russell on Crimes," vol. i, p. 854.) <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOUGLAS</hi>

It was an accident, in the language of Foster, 'which human prudence and foresight could have prevented.' Two people fight in a stable, and it it not an improbable result that they should get among the horses' feet. Gould that be said to be an accident which human prudence would not have foreseen? A horse's kicking was the probable and obvious result of persons knocking each other down, and scuffling at his feet Therefore the. case must go to the Jury.</hi>"</p>

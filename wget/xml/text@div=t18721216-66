                  </hi>. I live at Umberstone Street, Commercial Road East—on the night of 21st November, just after 12 o'clock, I was in Central Street, and a person who I do not know gave me charge of two parcels while he went into an urinal—I waited for him, and while he was there, four men came up to me—the prisoners are two of them—Davis said "Shall I carry those things for you?"—I said "No, I am carrying them myself"—he went to get hold of them, I would not let him, and he struck me on my breast and knocked me down, and two of them came to my pockets—I called out "Police!"—the police came, and two of them ran away—these two were over me, and the policeman got hold of them—a gentleman came up—I was on my back, and Davis was <hi rend="italic">tussling</hi> with the officer—I had some money in ray pockets, but they were too small and narrow, and I only lost my knife, with which I was cutting some tobacco just before—I never lost sight of the prisoners; they were right over me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Dacey. Q.</hi> Did not I pick your hat up, and put it on your head?<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—my hat was down in the mud certainly, and my elbow was cut, and my hip hurt; I have been lame ever since—I was as sober as I am now—during the <hi rend="italic">melee</hi> the man who gave me the parcels took them up and walked off—I did not say at the station that I lost the parcels.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not you walking with a stick before this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I always carry a stick, but I was lamed on that night, and my elbow was cut to pieces where I fell against the wall.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 117). I was on duty on 22nd November just before 1 o'clock near the urinal at the corner of Central Street, City Road—I was attracted to the urinal, and saw the prosecutor on his back on the pavement, and the two prisoners stooping over him with their hands in his waistcoat pockets—as I came up they got up and turned to run away, but I seized them and held them, and sent Swift to get assistance—not finding another policeman handy, I asked some one to hold one of them while I sprang my rattle—assistance then came, and we took them to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw two men running away, and the two prisoners stooping over the old man—the policeman caught the two of them—I called "Police!" and went back to help him—the old man said, "I can swear to these two," and that Davis was the one who knocked him down.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dacey's Defence.</hi> I saw the old man lying in the gutter, and asked what was the matter; they said, "Never mind." His hat was in the gutter; I picked it up and put it on his head. I never saw this prisoner in my life before. If I had been guilty, should I not have tried to get away? but I knew no more what it was than the dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Davis's Defence.</hi> I went into the urinal, and as I came out the prose<lb></lb>cutor was on the ground as drunk as he could be, and I fell over him, and got up and stooped and asked what the matter was. He said, "Oh, nothing; I am waiting for my friend, who is inside." When he gave us in charge he said he had lost nothing but a parcel; afterwards he said, "Only a pocket-knife." It does not stand to reason that an old man like that, and drunk as well, could hold two young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> like us.</p>

               <p>on the 14th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing Rich Street, not far from my house—I met the prisoner, who asked me if I had anything for him to do, and I said, "No"—he said, "Will you treat me?"—I said, "No," and he then gave me a dig in the nose with his fist, and kicked me in the privates—I fell down, and became <hi rend="italic">insensate</hi>—when I came to myself I was lying a little further off from where I fell—I lost nineteen shillings from my watch pocket, a pair of boots, a coat, a necktie, a pair of cuffs, and a cap—I have seen them since—I had seen the prisoner often passing by there before—I am quite sure he is the man—I had a good view of him—I could see his face—I afterwards pointed him out to the constable—I have been under the hands of a surgeon since.</p>

From information I received, I went to the prosecutor's house on the morning of the 15th of January, about twenty minutes past one—I found him apparently in great pain—I then went to a house in a court in Rich Street, where I found Mahomet—the prose<lb></lb>cutor followed me there—Moulton came in about half-past one in the morning, and the prosecutor pointed to him and said, "That is the man who knocked me down, kicked me, and hit me in the nose"—the prisoner said, "He came to the house about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; he went to bed with a girl, and slept with her all day; when he got up he struck me, I struck him, and took my own part"—the prosecutor said, "I have never been in the house; I never struck the man; it is all false what he says"—I then searched the house, and found a pair of boots and a cap in a cupboard upstairs, which were identified by the prose<lb></lb>cutor—Moulton said, "The old woman has pledged the coat; she got nineteen shillings on it"—I asked him where the ticket was—he said, "I believe she has got it in her pocket"—he then said, "I will search your pocket, and see whether you have got the ticket"—Mahomet said, "Take care; do not put it in my pocket, and say I have done it"—he then searched her pocket—I went into another room, Moulton came after me, and said, "What is this lying on the table?"—I said it looked like a ticket, and took it off the table—he said it was a ticket—it was not on the table when I first went in—I found a coat at the pawnbroker's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of letter carriers at the Gene<lb></lb>ral Post Office—in consequence of directions I received on 28th July, I made up a letter and enclosed in it a sovereign, a sixpence, and six postage stamps—I marked them all, and put them in a card which I put with the letter in an envelope—I did not direct it myself—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some frag<lb></lb>ments of papery</hi>), I recognise these as parts of the letter and envetope—the letter was directed to Mr. George Fielding, Nottingham-mews, High-street, Marylebone, London—that was a fictitious address—here are portions of the cards—I put two stamps on the envelope; I put them a little apart and in a slanting direction—I put the letter into the letter box at the chief office, between 1 and 2 in the day—I afterwards went inside the office and saw the letter taken out of the letter box—I kept it in my pos<lb></lb>session until about 10 minutes before 6 next morning—I then gave it to Green with certain instructions—the letters are sorted into districts in the Inland office; they are then sent upstairs to another office to the letter carriers' seats or districts—they are sent up by a machine in trays—about 10 minutes after 6 I went up and saw the prisoner at the tray in the letter carriers' office—he was a letter carrier for the Hyde-park-square walk—it would be his duty to be at the tray where I saw him, to collect the letters to clear them away—I saw him bring the letters for his own walk, and also another bundle of letters in his hand—he took them from the sorting box to his own seat—I saw him take one bundle of letters and run through them; he came to a letter with two stamps on it, which I imme<lb></lb>diately recognised as the one I had made up—he felt it in his fingers and shook it—he appeared to satisfy himself that it contained coin, and he put it amongst his other letters—it had been in the other bundle which belonged to Shuter, the letter carrier of the Nottingham Place district—he then put that bundle of letters on Shuter's seat, returned to his own seat, took his own letters down again, and selected the one I had seen him take from</p>

               <p>Shuter's bundle, feel it, and then put it amongst his own letters—he had no business at all with Shuter's letters he left the Post Office about 7 o'clock to deliver his letters—Shuter left about the same time—I stopped Shuter, and looked over his letters—in the ordinary course the letter in question would have been with Shuter's letters—I did not find it there—I after<lb></lb>wards went to Hyde-park-square, accompanied by the police constables, Bingham and Smee—I saw the prisoner go to the receiving house in Sussex-place; I was in a cab waiting near—it would be his duty to go to that receiving house after he had finished his delivery, to get a card signed of the time he had finished—that is done with every letter-carrier—another letter-carrier passed close by us and went into the receiving house—I then saw the prisoner come out and run across the road very fast, and round the corner—I went into the Victoria public house and there I found him—I had not seen him go in—I spoke to the potman, and I saw the prisoner coming from the water-closet, he was about ten or twelve yards from it—I told him I wanted him—I went out and saw Bingham, and desired him to search the closet, and he shortly afterwards brought me these papers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier in the General Post-office—my district is the Nottingham-place district. I was stopped by Mr. Clare on the morning of 29th July: he examined my letters—there was no letter amongst them directed to Mr. Fielding—I did not ask the prisoner that day to deliver any letter for me to Mr. Fielding—we generally go out about the same time—I had no conversation with him at all that morning.</p>

Q.</hi> When your letters were examined, did you examine them all at the same time, or did you give them to Mr. Clare to examine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Clare examined the bundle and then gave it to me—my attention was called to this again the same day by Mr. Clare.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Victoria public house in Sussex-place. On the morning of 29th July, about half-past 8, the prisoner came to our house—I knew him before, by coming to deliver letters—he asked me to open the water-closet door for him—I did so—it was fastened by two bolts—no person had been there that morning—I unfastened it, and he went in: the door that I unfastened opens into a little yard, and the water-closet is there. Whilst he was there Mr. Clare came in: he asked me some question, which I answered—soon after that, the prisoner came out of the closet, and met Mr. Clare at the street door—I had fastened the door leading to the water-closet at half-past 12 the night before, after the house was closed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer attached to the Post-office. On the morning in question, I accompanied Mr. Clare to the neighbourhood of Hyde-park-square—we went there in a cab—we stopped about 100 yards from the receiving house in Sussex-place, in sight of the receiving house—while we were there, a letter-carrier came and delivered letters close roundus, us, on both sides of the cab—he had the opportunity of seeing us—he then went into the receiving house; the prisoner immediately came out of the receiving house, and ran across the road very fast towards the public house—the door of the public house was not in sight from where we were; he ran round the corner, and I lost sight of him—I jumped out of the cab and ran after him—I ran past the public house, up the street—I had not seen him go into the public house—I went about 200 yards and then re<lb></lb>turned—I saw Mr. Clare come with the prisoner from the public house—I went towards them: they turned back and I met them at the door—in consequence of directions from Mr. Clare, I went into the Victoria and searched the water-closet, and there found these fragments of a letter and two pieces of card, which I have produced—they were in the pipe at the bottom of the pan of the closet—there was no trap: they were swimming in a little water.</p>

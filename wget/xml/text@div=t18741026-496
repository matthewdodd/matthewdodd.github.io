                  </hi>. I live at 73, Georges Road, Southwark—on, Saturday night, 10th inst., about 12.30—as I was crossing the Waterloo Bridge Road, near the Obelisk, a man made a rush at me and snatched at my watch—I had my coat open—I put my left elbow down over my pocket—the man then put his head down and tried to butt me in the stomach, and so I hit him a blow on the left ear, and seized him by the collar and said I would take him off to the police-station—I had only gone a few paces with him in my grasp when about four men made a rush at me, one of them caught me round the throat, and in the struggle I was knocked down—I still held the first man—I was kicked all over the body while I was on the ground—I have not been able to use my hand, since—one of the men caught hold of my chain and pulled the watch out of my pocket and they all ran away—I got up and tried to pursue them, but my knee cap, which I bad put out a short time before, had been hurt by the fall, and I found I could only limp—I have not seen my watch since—I afterwards went to the police-station and gave information—some men were shown to me, but I failed to identify the prisoner—I can only say he resembles the first man who attacked me from his height—I noticed the man when I held him he was much smaller than myself—I thought it was rather cool his attacking a tall man—I was helped to the station—during the time of the struggle, the witness Coombes called out to me "You had better let him go I know the man"—I was calling "Police" I all the time, but there was no assistance I seized a black silk scarf that one of the men had on and I gave that up to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 225, Waterloo Road—about 12.30 on this Saturday night, I was ind-oors going to bed—I heard some one calling, "Police!"I want out to the door, and saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner, and one man was running away, then I saw three or four come back, and they knocked him down—the man got from him and they all ran away—he was assaulted when he was on the ground, and I said to him "Let go, I know the man by sight, and don't be kicked about in that way," I am sure the prisoner is the man—there was a lamp near where it occurred and I have been in the habit of seeing the prisoner for twelve months—I gave a description of him to the police, and I afterwards went to the station where I saw a number of men and I picked out the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the business of my brother, Thomas Holloway, a medicine vendor, in the Strand—I used to give Utton cheques to send to the parties whose names were on them—it was his duty to send them off—these three cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were signed by me, and handed to Utton—two are made payable to the Messrs. Brooks, and one to John Swainson—two are crossed "London and Westminster," and one "and co"—In consequence of information given to me, I called on the prisoner Locke—he is a licensed victualler, and keeps the Holyrood Palace, within ten or a dozen doors of our place—I told him I had been given to under stand he had been receiving from Utton a quantity of our cheques, which he had stolen—he said that he had received from Utton a quantity of cheques, that he did not know whether they were stolen or not, and that that was no business of his—I asked him if he had made any inquiry as to where Utton had got them from—he said no, that did not concern him, and he produced a memorandum-book, from which he tore this leaf (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave me this, and I put it in my pocket—it is a list of goods he had supplied to Utton the same afternoon Locke came into my place and asked to see the cheques, and a quantity were produced—I asked him who his banker was—he said, "The London and West-minster Bank, Temple Bar branch"—I requested him to go to that bank with me, which he did—I saw the manager, and asked him if these cheques had been handed to him by Locke—foe said that was a question be could not answer then, but he would refer to his books and see—I left the cheques with him—when Locke came to me in the afternoon I handed fourteen cheques to him, and after examining them, he said he had received twelve of them from Utton, but the other two he had doubts about—before handing him the cheques, he said he could not tell exactly how many he had taken, but he presumed from twelve to twenty, and that they amounted to from 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cheques were all made payable to persons to whom the firm was indebted—each cheque was brought to me in the ordinary course of business by Utton to be signed, and they were then handed back to him—Mr. Hutchings was present during the conversation with Locke, and he accompanied us to the bank—I told Locke, Utton was a clerk, receiving five shillings a day, and was paid daily, and I said, "I pre<lb></lb>sume you know that"—he said it was no business of his, he did not know how the cheques came into Utton's possession, as they were presented, so he took them.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> how long have you been a traveller? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was traveller about eleven years—I travelled for Messrs. Gibbons Brothers, of London-wall, for seven years—I will explain this transaction in reference to the wine; I took a sample of champagne to Mr. Locke, and he gave me a order for six dozen—I took it to him; he was playing at cards, and said, "Do not go away, I will be down directly and settle with you"—when he came down he said, "Well, I cannot settle with you to-day"—I said, "I shall be in an awful fix, because I borrowed the money to pay for them from M. Lay, and I want the money to pay him"—he said, "Well, my boy, I have not got it; I will show you my bank-book; I have not got a pound in the bank"—I told him I had not got sufficient to pay the cabman—he said, "Well, I will let you have a sovereign if that is any good to you," which I took—I left a receipt with him—that is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I only had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I applied at Bow-street Police-court a day or two after the date of this receipt—I had in the meantime applied to him for the money—ultimately I got the wine back, less a dozen bottles—Locke, never preferred any criminal charge against me.</p>

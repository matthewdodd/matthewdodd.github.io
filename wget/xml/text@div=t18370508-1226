                  </hi>. I am an earthen ware and glass dealer, and live in Farringdon-street, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. The prisoner was in my service in 1835—I had no other person in my service, either male or female at that time—I had to attend a funeral on the 11th of March that year—on the evening before, I examined the state of my money—I kept it in a looking-glass drawer in my bed room on the second floor—I had 75/. there, 55 sovereigns, 20 half-sovereigns, and the rest in silver—I examined the money after ten o'clock at night, after I had closed the shop—I locked the drawer, and put the key into a drawer underneath that, which I left unlocked—my wife, and my wife's mother were in the house that night—I have since lost my wife—the prisoner did not sleep in the house—he left about ten o'clock that night—I told him I had to go to a funeral at Hampstead, the next morning, and requested him to come earlier than usual, as I should be obliged to leave home about seven o'clock, and that I should return about one o'clock—he was generally in the shop, and has seen me go up stairs for money—I am not aware that he knew where I went to for it, but he knew I went up stairs for it—I ordered him to pack up some things during my absence, which were on the second floor—I left on the following morning, leaving the prisoner in charge of the shop—I returned about one</p>

               <p>o'clock—I did not find him there, and he never returned—he boarded in the house, but did not sleep there—I never saw him afterwards till I took him into custody—I had not dismissed him—half a week's wages were due to him, he had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—I had not refused to raise his wages—he never asked me to do so—I remained at home the rest of the day, but had no occasion to go to my cash—on the following morning a woman named Cobb called on me, and in consequence of what she said, I immediately went and searched for my money—I found the drawer locked and could not find the key—I forced the drawer open with a small screw-driver, and missed the two bags containing my money—I made a commu-nication to the police, and published handbills, offering 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for his apprehension, but saw nothing of him—in consequence of information, on the 25th of last month I went to the Angel, public-house, Farringdon-street, which is two doors from my own house—I found the prisoner there—before I spoke to him he said, "How do you do?"—I said, "You scoun<lb></lb>drel, you have robbed me, and I will give you all the law will allow"—he made no answer—I gave him in charge—I afterwards went with him before the Alderman—I heard the Magistrate ask him why he went away—I believe his answer was not written down—he was remanded for a week—I do not think that any of the evidence on the first occasion was taken down—it was on the 26th—he had been about three months in my service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the late Mrs. Bias. I was residing with the prosecutor at the time in question—I remember on the morning of the 11th of March the prosecutor going to a funeral at seven o'clock—the prisoner was in the house then—after his master was gone, he was packing up some goods in the shop—he had occasion to go up stairs to fetch them—I do not exactly know what part of the house he fetched them from—I was in the shop—he did not go up above once—he and I were the only persons in the house—he went out of the shop while I was there, about eleven o'clock—I considered he was coming back—he never spoke to me, nor asked my leave to go—persons must come through the shop to get up stairs—nobody came between the time of Mr. Biss leaving in the morning and the prisoner's going away, nor afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you in the shop all the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—till Mrs. Biss came in, which was about a quarter of an hour after the prisoner left, and she minded the shop then, till her husband came home—what took place in the shop after that, I cannot tell, but I was up stairs in the kitchen, and nobody could go up without my knowledge, and nobody did go up—they must pass the kitchen door—nobody could go up without my seeing them—I was at needle-work, sitting in view of the door, which was open the whole time, I swear that positively—the shop shuts up between nine and ten o'clock—we had our meals on the first floor, in the kitchen—I dined by myself that day—my daughter dined in the shop, because the prisoner was gone—I did not go out of doors all that day—I was in the house the next morning—in the kitchen and in the dining room.</p>

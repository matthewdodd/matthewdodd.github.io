               <p>Q. What did you say to her? A. I asked if she knew any thing of a sheet - she said she and the housemaid had had it made into under garments - the ring she stated the housemaid had taken and given it to my groom to pawn, and when he brought the money they had divided it - the policeman took her to the station, and I locked her bed-room door - in the evening, I had her box brought down to the room where my wife was ill in bed - I found in the box some towels and this handkerchief, which are my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was it she said about the sheet? A. That she and the housemaid had had it made into chemises; and one was marked in her name and one in the housemaid's - the policeman was there at the time - I did not desire her to tell the truth, to my recollection - self, the housemaid, slept in the room where the prisoner's box was - self was a witness at the police-office, and then returned to my house for a short time - I did not go to the house with her - I do not know whether self had a key to the room where the box was; she might, but it is not probable - Self has run away because she was frightened, as the magistrate said that at the next examination he should place her in the same situation - she gave me no notice of going - I have included her in the indictment, at the suggestion of the magistrate - I have no doubt of her dishonesty - I think she left the day the prisoner was charged with the robbery, or early the next morning- I had not searched her boxes - she took her boxes away with her - the officer has searched for her - the prisoner's box had been left in the room - the box was not locked, but the room door was - Self had made a communication to Mrs. Broackes, which induced me to go for the policeman- the prisoner did not know that there was an investigation going on - Self had access to the room where the prisoner's box was, after she made the communication to her mistress - the officer searched the prisoner's boxes in my presence - I do not recollect whether any thing was found in it then - I really do not recollect - on the second search, these towels and handkerchief were found - the prisoner was then in custody - I cannot tell whether any thing was found on the first search, but my impression is there was not.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did you first charge her with it? A. About ten o'clock in the morning in the presence of the officer: her box was then searched - I cannot tell whether any thing was found, but it was impossible for me to examine it to know what belonged to my family - I then locked the room door - the box was searched again in the presence of Mrs. Broackes - I locked the door till she was in a state to see the box - the key was not out of my possession - I do not think Self had access to the room at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever say to any body that, in consequence of Mr. Humphries and myself not accommodating you to take this case out of its turn, you would say more against the prisoner than you should have done? A. I did not, Sir; nor any thing to that effect - I said, I did not come here with any vindictive feeling; that I had been repeatedly robbed by servants; and that I only wanted to make an example of one of them, to prevent a recurrence of these things - I told her father that I had intended to recommend her to mercy, but after the treatment I had received, I should not do so.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the person you sold them to here? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Self tell you of her intending to run away? A. No - I thought the ring was the prisoner's - I gave all the money to Self - she gave me 6d. for myself - she said, "Jane says you are to have this 6d., and you may keep the duplicate, as the ring is too small for her finger" - I did not tell the magistrate that I got the 6d., but he was told - I told my master about this after Self was gone - I had been at the police-office once before, to take a man there for breaking my nose: and I was taken there once, but I was discharged; it was because I was walking by a gate when a robbery was committed - the boy's name was Clewes - I was in custody two days - the boy had two months for it - it was for stealing pigeons.</p>

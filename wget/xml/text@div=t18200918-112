On the 28th of August I was looking out of window, and saw the prisoner and his wife in the yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180058"></xptr>with North, consulting about parting - his wife had cohabited with North, and wanted her clothes to go away with him; the prisoner said if she came up stairs she should have them - then all three came into the passage. I heard words at the foot of the stairs, went down, and saw North against the wall - he said,</p>
               <p>"I am done for." I saw his hand drop against the wall, it was all bloody. The prisoner was about half a yard form him. I did not see him do anything, and never heard him threaten North. I saw a knife in his hand, and said</p>
               <p>"Long take care what you are at, and give me the knife." He shut the knife up, and gave it to me - it was rather bloody. North had three cuts in his face; I saw nothing more. He was taken to the doctor's. A quantity of blood laid at the door. Whatever happened was done before I came down.</p>
               <p>HENRY BETTS. I am a constable. About eight o'clock on the night this happened, I was sent for, and knocked at the prisoner's room door, and told him to open it. I found it open, he was there in bed with his wife, she was in liquor. I took him to the watch-house. Four or five days after I saw North, his wounds were dressed. He had one cut from his ear down towards his mouth, his lip was cut, and he had a stab in his cheek.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My wife had deserted me, and gone with North; I met them together, and North said if I touched her he would break every bone in my body. She followed me home, I was going to take her up stairs, and he seized me by the throat.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker's servant, the corner of Bedford street, in the Strand; the prisoner offered one sheet to pawn on the 8th of March. I stopped it; I asked her whose sheet it was, she said it belonged to Mr. Smith; and the other sheet was brought before by another woman. I saw the name of Harrison on them, I sent to him, Mr. Godfry came; he identified them to be Mr. Harrison's, and she was stopped.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave one of these sheets to the other woman to pawn, she went with the sheet to the pawnbrokers, and that man that stands there, he is a perjured person, he kept that one sheet; I had joined with this woman in the lottery; I never asked that man any thing on the sheet; the other woman when she saw the name on the sheet, she slipped out; I told him I had got them to wash; I said if he would be so kind as to let me have them I would take them home to my master, he said no, I will not let you; they fetched. Mr. Godfry.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of one sheet. - A. Nineteen shillings.</p>

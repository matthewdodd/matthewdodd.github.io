               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is a person that is alledged on one of the counts to be defrauded he cannot be a witness on this indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. He is a person to whom this was offered, he has no interest in it; it would be a different case if Mr. Watman was to be called and say it was his hand writing, because he would then be liable to pay five guineas, but you never knew a case of this sort, where a man stands in this way, was never objected to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Robinson. Pray have you indorsed this note? - No, I went to get it changed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to you at any time, and when? - He came on the 10th of September last, between the hours of eleven and twelve; he came to my house and ordered a pot of beer, he asked my wife if she could change him a five guinea note? I was present, I made answer I did not believe there was cash enough, I was not willing for her to change; then my wife looked at it and said it was a very good one, and he said so too; and there were three pints of beer owing for, and a pot to go home, then my wife said, there was cash; and she went and fetched him five guineas, and after that he changed one guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with the five guineas? - She gave him the five guineas, and he gave her the note for five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the note? - He changed a guinea, and payed me for five pints, and a pot to go home after he was gone out, and a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the note? - I went and took the pot of beer, and I said to my wife, I do not much like the note, but I will take the pot of beer; as soon as I came back from taking the pot of beer to his lodgings, I shewed the note to a neighbour, I cannot read nor write myself, and he said, he did not like it.</p>
               <p>Court. We must not hear what any body else said.</p>
               <p>Witness. I went immediately to the Bank of England; it said four partners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080010"></xptr>on the bill, but it did not say where they lived, I enquired of one Mr. Pearce, clerk of the bank, and he told me to go to No. 18, Change-alley, to get the money for it, I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did you go to there? - I do not recollect the name of the bankers, but it was No. 18, Change-alley, where I went to get the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the note again? - Yes, I should know it again, I marked a cross on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Armstrong. Have you got that note? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce it.</p>
               <p>Court to Robinson. Tell us whether the note was paid at the bankers? - No, they told me it was a forged one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now look at that note, is that the same note you took of the prisoner? - To the best of my knowledge it is, that is the mark I made, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you swear that is the mark you made? - To the best of my knowledge it is, because I cannot read not write.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be positive, so as to swear that that is the note you received? - Yes, it is, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Why do you think that is the same note? - By the mark I made.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the same note that you received from your wife the same note that you gave to Armstrong? - It was the very same, I had no other in my possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner at the bar was known to you as a customer to you in the house? - He had lived about five days in the neighbourhood as a ready furnished lodger, he lived at Mr. Dugard's.</p>
               <p>Q. He had used your house? - He has come there of a night to have beer.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you knew the prisoner five days only? - Only five days.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you apprehend him? - He was apprehended about an hour after; I went immediately to the bankers.</p>

               <p>Q. I would ask you whether there is any firm of J. Watman and Co. in that place? - No, there has not been any such during the last sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. None, either bankers or of any other description? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any enquiry? - I have, generally through the place; I have examined the cess books there, the poor rates, the highway rates, the land tax; and enquired of the post master, if ever he had any letters or parcels directed to J. Watman and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire at the inns there? - No, not at the inns; I got the books of the poor rates from the principal inn, the landlord of the principal inn who collected the poor rates last year.</p>
               <p>Q. With that assistance besides your own knowledge, you have not been able to find such a person? - No, no such a person.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Robinson. Did not the prisoner at the time you took him desire of you, that he might go back to his own lodgings, for that the man that he received the note from was there? - He was in his own house when I took him; he said there was a man, a farmer, that was a witness of his taking of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did not permit him to go back? - Not at all, we took him to Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he desire to be taken back to his house on that account, to find the man? - No, he did not say so, he said there was a farmer, one Jones, that was a witness of his taking it, who was in the house when he was took, and his wife.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any questions to ask the witness?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel. I frequently folicited my prosecutor either to go back, or to go in the public house, to settle my business; I told him the person was at my house, which I had the bill of, he did not wish to go in any public house; but still persevered with me to go forward, till we came to the public house next the office; my prosecutor came afterwards to me at the New Prison, and told me he wished he had come to me himself, and not have brought any officer along with him, then the business would have been settled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Robinson. Did you ever go to him and tell him that? - I went into the prison about a man that stole my pots and I happened to see this prisoner there, and I told him that I wished the affair had not happened in my hands, because I could very ill spare the money, I wish it had not happened on me.</p>
               <p>Jury. The signature of this note appears to be engraved, and not wrote, nor on a stamp, I should never have taken it if it was offered to me.</p>

               <p>Armstrong. I found this Birmingham one for ten guineas, a duplicate, and a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no more notes than that? - No, I found two pounds eight shillings in money, which I was desired to keep by the magistrate, the prisoner asked for it, and the magistrate ordered me to keep it till I came to court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing more to say than what I have asserted, I had no knowledge of the bill being any thing but upright and just, and as such I got it discounted with this man.</p>

Immediately after Mr. Ball had taken measure of Mr. Harcock, a person of the name of Warrell came up, and said, he had come up to look at some buttons that he had got to dispose of, he immediately shewed him them, after he had shewed them, he asked him what they were to be? Mr. Ball told him two pounds thirteen shillings, there was six gross for the coat, and three gross for the breast, that is for the waistcoat; Mr. Ball said, as he took them altogether, he should have them for that; Mr. Warrell immediately gave him a bill of exchange that had got so long to run, so many days to run, what the time was I cannot exactly tell; Mr. Ball said, he could not get that cashed; Mr. Warrel I immediately took that up as Mr. Ball could not give cash for that, he took and put the bill in his pocket, and laid down a five guinea note immediately on demand, the prisoner told him he could not give cash for it, but he would go out and see if he could get it changed or not, and to the best of my knowledge he was gone a quarter of an hour, and returned back again, when he returned back, he told Mr. Warrell he had got the bill discounted, and he gave him the balance due, which was two guineas in gold, and ten shillings in silver; Mr. Harcock and Mr. Warrell and the prisoner at the bar drank together, out of a pot of porter; I went down stairs, and in the course of half an hour the prisoner at the bar came down to call me up, when he came down, the officer and the prosecutor took Mr. Ball into custody, and took him away; I ran up stairs immediately to Mr. Warrell, and I said to him, there is some dispute about that note; he said, what dispute, I know better, I know that is a very good one; he took the buttons and put them in a pocket handkerchief, and walked down stairs, and said, he would go and seek after him, and I did not see any thing more of him. The gentleman who was with the officer that took Mr. Ball, came to me afterwards, and I took him to the house where I have heard Mr. Warrell say he used to frequent; the officer came back and fetched me, and I took him to where Mr. Ball's boxes were; afterwards I took him to the house that I heard this old man say that he frequently, to see if I could find him, this Mr. Warrell, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080014"></xptr>a house in Tash-court, the number I don't justly know, when we were there the people told us that they expected him home at three o'clock to dinner; accordingly we waited till that time, and he did not come home, and he has not returned there any more.</p>
               <p>Q.

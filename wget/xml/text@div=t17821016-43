               <p>Some of these half-pence have been passed, and in currency, therefore it is a very nice thing, rather too nice for me to find out.</p>

               <p>PRISONER VOTEAR.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>PRISONER DEAN.</p>
               <p>I wish to speak the truth of Franklin and Scott, there was no candle in the cellar; Scott brought down nine pounds of candles, and two pounds of soap, I took them in; says I, go along about your business: his hands were clean, mine and Votear's were very dirty, we had been at work; and Scott, he he went up stairs; I did not know but what he was gone home; I had no thought of his being stopped. I took the cellar of Franklin, as a glass-grinder; I was to give him 5 l. a year for it; he never knew any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>PRISONER FRANKLIN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am entirely innocent of any guilt in the whole affair; I had notion that they were coiners.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you explain that letter? - That letter was for Mr. Dean, he had spoke to my wife for leave to have a letter directed for him, my wife took it and gave it to him; I never saw the directions, nor the contents of the letter.</p>
               <p>Court. It was found upon your desk, you know? - Yes, Dean had been in my apartment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dean. I suppose in paying him for a pair of shoes, and pulling out the half-pence, I must pull out the letter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Franklin. I had several letters, as I suppose I took these up with the rest.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Franklin called eleven witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

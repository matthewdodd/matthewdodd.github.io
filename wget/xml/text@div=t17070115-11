            </rs>. The Evidence which was the Prosecutors Wife, Deposed, that the Prisoner with five more, on the 61th of Decem. about 6 a Clock at Night, mounted the Pallisadoes, broke a Sash Window, and 3 Men got in at the Window, and let the other 3 in at the Street Door; that they searched the House, and being demanded their Businesses, one of them replied, they wanted an Appearance, for they had a Writ to serve. Another Evidence Deposed, that he was in a Room joining to that wherein the Men had broken in, and hearing an Outcry, hasten'd into the Room, and saw the Window open, two Men upon the Ground, and the third entring. Being ask'd what time this was, replied just at Candle lighting. The Prisoner in his Defence, said, that it was soon after 3 a Clock, and that what they did, was without the assistance of Candle, that he went there to serve a <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="17070115003"></xptr> Writ upon Mr. Mugg. and not one of any Felonious Intent; and there being no Proof to the contrary, the jury <rs id="t17070115-11-verdict54" type="verdictDescription">

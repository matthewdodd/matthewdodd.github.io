I said I knew the house, and well he might be ashamed of it - it is the sign of the Rising Sun - he said so afterwards. said he took the note of Parkinson, at a public-house, in Old Round-court (he keeps the Rising Sun), in change for a 5 l. note, which he took four or five days after the funeral of the King. I asked him how he came to pledge property when he had these notes; he said he often pledged property to the amount of 2 s. or 3 s., rather than change a note. I said the duplicates were to the amount of 14 s. or 15 s. He said he could not account for that. He said the things pledged in another name he bought of a young woman.

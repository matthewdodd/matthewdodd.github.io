I am the wife of William Goodfellow, and live at 93, Norfolk Road, Essex Road—on Saturday evening, 24th April, I went out at 10.45 to meet my son—I returned at two or three minutes past 11, with my son, and when I got near my gate, I saw the prisoner jump out at the window—I went after him, caught hold of him, and asked what business he had in my room—he said he had not been in the room—he pulled his coat open, and said, "You see, I have got nothing about me"—I said, "No, but you were in my room with intention to rob me"—he said, "I have not been in the room; go back to the house and see, and let your son stand by me;" but I stood by him myself, and sent my son back—a policeman came up, and I gave him in custody—the policeman went into the house—when I went out I had left the house fastened securely—the window was shut, and the doors all shut and fastened.</p>

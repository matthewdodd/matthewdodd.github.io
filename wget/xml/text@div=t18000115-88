               <p>Q. What quantity of soap was there? - A. There might have been from six to seven hundred weight; it was all in a fluid state, and remained in a fluid state for a day or two afterwards, till it was fit to cut out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you much hurt? - A. So much that, I could not put on my close bodied coat for three or four days, from the number of bruises that I had received in my arm; I was obliged to survey in a great coat.</p>

             and John Kiernan; I asked them what time they supposed they should cleanse; they said, it was rather uncertain, they did not know when; I called upon Wakely about eight o'clock, and about eleven we went to the spot; there were crevices through which we could see what was going on; Riley was taking the soap out of the copper, and Rooke was carrying it to a cart in which the boxes were placed;

             was nailing the cover on to the boxes as Kiernan filled them, and young Kiernan was lighting him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not disturb them at that time? - A.We did not; in consequence of seeing there were four of them, besides the lad, and only us two, we went for assistance; I requested Wakely to continue on the spot, while I went to a public-house to get the assistance of some soldiers that were quartered there; I was gone, I suppose, a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes; I returned without assistance, and on my way back, I observed a cart coming out of the soap-house into a lane that led on to the Forest; I let them pass me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was it to Kiernan's house? - A.Rather more than a quarter of a mile, perhaps the third of a mile; I followed it, and it went into Kiernan's yard, it was four hours and a half after that before I found Wakely; I was about Kiernan's house all that time, watching till between four and five o'clock in the morning; I had no soldiers, I could not get any assistance; Wakely and I then went to Kiernan's house, Kiernan came out, and requested to know what authority we had got; we told him what we were come for, and we were certain the soap was there; I told him I had seen it deposited there in the night; he abused us very much in language; he then took up a pitch-fork, and threatened us with immediate destruction unless we desisted.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. It is needless to ask you if he knew you were an officer, as you knew him? - A. Yes, he knew I was an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How near might you, or Wakely, be to him when he took the pitch-forth? - A. About a yard; in consequence of that, we withdrew from the yard to the common side-gate, and when we had continued there a minute or two, we thought it most prudent for one of us to go to another public-house to get assistance; I went to two public-houses, and returned in, I suppose, about twenty minutes; I sent two soldiers that I met with to go to the spot, and they went without me; I went further on; when I returned, Wakely had got possession of the soap, he was coming to Ramford with the soap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. If I understand you right, you have been acquainted with the prisoner? - A. I know him, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been at the soap-house at seven o'clock in the evening to survey it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason why you did not stay there till the soap was carried away? - A. I did not conceive it was my duty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the copper before you went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That is giving an opportunity to a man to take it away? - A. It could not be done while the soap is in a state of operation.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you have not been in the habit of dining with him, and riding his house? - A. I never dined with him in my life; I once had his horse when the waters were out.</p>
               <p>Q. You have drank his wine, have not you? - A.Never but once, and that was the first time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two women there at this time? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Kiernan did not attempt to do any thing to you till after you had setched more assistance? - A. He held the pitch-fork up, and threatened us.</p>
               <p>Q. But did not strike you? - A. I rather think Kiernan did make a stab at Wakely's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You were close to Wakely all the time? - A. Yes.(Mr. Alley addressed the Jury in behalf of the defendant.)</p>

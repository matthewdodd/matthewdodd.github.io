            . I am an officer on duty at the docks; on the 20th of October I heard the prosecutor had lost a shovel, and I found the prisoner about three hundred yards from the place, in East Smithfield, with a shovel; I asked him how he got it - he said he bought and paid for it - this was about half-past six o'clock.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was there at work; I put down my shovel where there were a lot of shovels - the foreman told me to go and get the earth down for some stones to pass; I went for my shovel but some one had taken it, as I suppose in place of his own, as we never mind to have our own - I said some one had got it, and the officer said "Come along, I will shew you the man who has got it," and he struck me a rap on the head; my foreman came up and said "Let the man go, he did not want to steal it," but they would not let me go.</p>

               <p>COURT to THOMAS HAYLOCK. Q. Will you swear positively that the prisoner said he had bought it and paid for it? A. Yes, he did; when he got to the prosecutor he said,"Well, then, it may be a mistake;" the prisoner is a pavior, and the prosecutor is in the employ of Messrs. Bennett and Hunt.</p>

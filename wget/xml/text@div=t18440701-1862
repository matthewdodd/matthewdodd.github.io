                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and lodge at the Sailors' Home. Between ten and eleven o'clock on the 14th of June, I fell in with Wright, and went with her to a house in Bluegate-street—Neale keeps the house—I saw Neale there—I had two half-crowns and five shillings in my watch-pocket—I felt it safe as I was going up stairs—I went to bed, and kept my trowsers on—the next morning I found my watch-pocket turned inside out, and my money gone—Wright was in the room, and had slept with me—I asked her where my money was gone—she said she knew of nothing but my jacket, she had pawned that—Neale came in and out, and when I came down, I asked her about my things—she took up the fire-tongs, and said if I did not get out of the house she would break my head open—I cannot say who came into the room I was in during the night.</p>

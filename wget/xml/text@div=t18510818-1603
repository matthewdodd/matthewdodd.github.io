                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Barker, pawnbrokers. On Thursday, 24th July, a female, not the prisoner, came and offered this gold brooch in pledge (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had suspicion and stopped it—she was after<lb></lb>wards charged with the prisoner at the Mansion-house, and it was stated that she was the prisoner's mother.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my sister, Mary Ann Hayes, at 7, Circus-road, St. John's Wood. The prisoner was my sister's servant; she left on Tuesday, and the policeman came on the Friday—it is three weeks or a month ago—I went to Bishopsgate-street station, and saw a box which I had seen in the prisoner's possession at my sister's; I looked over it with the policeman—these two yards of barge, pocket-handkerchief, and two habit-shirts were in it; they are my sister's, and this brooch is mine—about five or six weeks before she left, my sister gave her a pink tarlatan ball-dress by my hands—it is three weeks or a month since she left—I last saw the brooch about a fortnight before she left—I am quite sure I saw it after giving her the ball-brass—I never made her a present of it—I did not miss it till the policeman came to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How often were you in the habit of wearing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very seldom; I kept it in my bedroom, in a drawer which was not locked—I do not recollect wearing it more than once all the time she was at our house—she lived there three months, and then left in consequence of ill-health, and returned and remained nine months—there was an interval of about a year between—when I say I saw the brooch in my drawer, I mean I saw the morocco case of it there—I did not open the case, but concluded that the brooch was in it—I do not think we have given her anything but the dress—I have not given her anything—my sister is out of town, she is single; her name is Mary Ann.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman.</hi> 638). On Friday evening, 24th July, about half-past six o'clock, I took the prisoner at her mother's room in Rose-alley, Bishopsgate-street—I asked her if she had sent her mother to pawn a brooch; she said she had—I said, "Is the brooch yours?" she said, "Yes; I have had it in my possession two years"—I said, "How did you come by the brooch in the first instance?"—she said, "I found it about two years ago in St. John's-wood"—I asked her if she knew its value; she said she supposed about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she sent it to pawn to get some money to get her things, as she was going out to service again—I took her to the station where her mother was, and detained them both—I saw the same box opened at the station, which I had seen at the prisoner's lodging—it was full of goods; among which Miss Hayes identified these two handkerchiefs, habit-shirts, and piece of barge, as her sister's property.</p>

               <p>before the Magistrate—I have not mentioned before to-day, that she said it was worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said when she went to unroll the dress, the brooch tumbled out—she mentioned that before the Magistrate, and at the station as well, the night before—I swear she said she bad had it two yean, it was not two weeks.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows</hi>:—"My mistress sent me down an old ball-dress, and the brooch was in it; I did not know it was there till yesterday.)</p>

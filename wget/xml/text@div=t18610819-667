                  </hi>. I am a packer, and live at 8, Newcastle-street, Strand—about 5 o'clock, on the morning of 3d August, I heard a noise—I went down stairs in consequence, but not the first time I heard it—a few minutes after I got down to the kitchen, I discovered that these two chairs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

               <p>Q.Whereabout in Fleet-street was Mr. Mason's? - A. About the middle of Fleet-street, he is a seedsman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any servant with the chaise?- A. No, I had no servants; Mr. Mason request<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160005"></xptr>ed me to go up into the dining-room to take some bread and cheese and ale, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a window in the dining-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see your chaise from the window?- A. The chaise was gone in a moment; I went down stairs, and the apprentice,

            , went down Fleet-street, and overtook the man with the chaise and horses.</p>
               <p>Q. You have charged two sets of harness? - A.Yes, because I run double; there were two horses.</p>
               <p>Q. When the chaise and horses were brought back, were they in the same state in which they were, when you lost them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the mare, as near as you can state? - A. As well as I can recollect, I put it at 40l. and the gelding at 20l.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when he was brought back? - A. He said, that some person saw him at the door, and told him, if he would take that chaise and horses to Blackfriars-bridge, he would give him one shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you were the owner of this chaise and horses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you left your chaise and horses standing? - A.At Mr. Mason's in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you afterwards find them? - A. They were brought back to me at Mr. Mason's.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you found it exactly where you left it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the trouble of going to the window to see if there was any crowd? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell whether there was a stoppage in the street at the time or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN BANKS sworn. - I am apprentice to Mr. Mason, a seedsman, in Fleet-street, on the right-hand side from here; I saw the prisoner get into the chaise, take the reins in his hands and drive off; I then asked the shopman, whether he was a servant of Mr. Taylor's, he said, he did not know; I then ran after him, went to the shafts of the chaise, and asked him where he was going with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the door, when you first saw him? - A. Six or seven doors to the best of my recollection; he told me, a gentleman came to him, and told him he would give him a shilling to drive it to Blackfriar's-bridge; I then told him to stop, and asked him who the gentleman was; he said, he did not know who the gentleman was, he supposed he was at the door where he took the chaise from; he would not stop, and I ran to the horses head and stopped them, he them jumped out of the chaise, and endeavoured to make his escape, I caught hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking or running? - A.Running; he then began to hustle and push me about, and endeavoured to get away from me; my fellowservant, the shopman, then came to my assistance, and by that means he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This transaction happened in the morning? - A.Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner told you he had been desired by a gentleman to drive this chaise to blackfriar's-bridge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know it is a difficult thing to drive through Fleet-street in the middle of the day, and therefore not at all unnatural for a gentleman to ask him to drive so far for him? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment you stopped the horse, he desisted, and gave the chaise into your possession? - A. He got out of the chaise and I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not run away till after you had laid hold of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he was frightened, and attempted to get from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see any gentleman near your door, at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRUCE sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Mason, seedsman, in Fleet-street; I saw a man in the chaise drive away from the shop door towards Fleet-market; the boy ran out after the man, and stopped the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you see any gentleman near him, or hear any gentleman give any orders? - A. No person whatever; I saw the boy stop the chaise, and I went up to his assistance; I saw a man scufiling with him, and trying to get away; I then laid hold of the prisoner's collar, and brought him back to my master's house; some other people brought the chaise back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The shopdoor was open? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A man must have been mad to think of stealing a chaise in that situation, and you looking at him? - A. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. We all know that Fleet-street is a noisy place at noon-day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, a person might have said, take this chaise to Blackstiar's-bridge, and you not have heard it? - A. No; I work close to the door.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER AULD sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for to take the prisoner in charge; I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from Berkeley-square, and coming down Fleet-street, there was a a great crowd; a gentleman's phaeton stood by the side of the pavement; there was a stoppage, and the phaeton got across the road, and a gentleman's coachman that was coming could not get along, and he desired me to turn the horses round, and I did; I had no intention of stealing them.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mr. Taylor.) Did you leave your horses close to the kirb, or were they across the road? - A. No such thing as across the road, I left them close to the kirb where they ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bruce.) You saw the prisoner get into the chaise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chaise then standing near the kirb, or across the road? - A. As close to the kirb as it could. <rs id="t18010916-4-verdict18" type="verdictDescription">

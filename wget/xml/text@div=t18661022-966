                  <hi rend="italic">the Defence</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY WOODGATE</hi>. I keep a loan and discount office, 69, Oakley Street, Lambeth—I have known the prisoner about two years, his family longer—on 9th May he came to my office and handed me this bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said he was desirous of introducing to me a very good transaction, the acceptance of Major Curzon, that he was the son of Lord Howe, and a very first-class man, that the major was in want of a little ready money, and he had desired him to get this discounted privately if he could—he was not to leave it with any of the regular discount people—if he could not get it done privately he was to return it to the major—I asked him if he knew the major—he said certainly—I asked if he saw the major sign the bill—he said certainly—I asked him the same question several times, to which he made the same reply, and pressed very hard that I would do it—he said that I could deduct 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the discount, and Lieutenant Burgess would pay his bill of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I held, and I could give him my cheque for the difference—I asked him, "Does Lieutenant Burgess know the major?" he said, "Oh, yes, they are friends—I assented to the terms and gave him this cheque for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also gave him Lieutenant Burgess's bill for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is a cheque on the Lambeth branch of the London and County Bank—it has been received by my bankers as paid—it is endorsed "A. Wright," in the prisoner's writing—there was no endorsement on it when I gave it him—I know the prisoner's writing—the body of the bill is his writing and his signature as the drawer—I have a very strong opinion that the acceptance is his writing, in a feigned hand, and written with a quill—the body is ap<lb></lb>parently written with a steel pen. (<hi rend="italic">The bill was dated May 5 th, 1866, at six months, drawn by the prisoner, and accepted, Ernest G. Curzon, Major, 52nd Light Infantry. Payable at Cox &amp;Co's., Craig's Court</hi>.) On 18th September I accompanied a police officer and Mr. Charles Wright, my solicitor, to 70, Horseferry Road, Westminster—I and the officer remained outside, and Mr. Charles Wright went into the house—I afterwards went in and found the prisoner and Mr. Wright in conver<lb></lb>sation—he was about to say something about Lieutenant Burgess, and I told him I had come to give him into custody for issuing to me a forged bill of exchange knowingly—he said, "Well, make no fuss about it; come along"—I then gave him into custody (<hi rend="italic">looking at some bank notes</hi>)—here are three notes bearing the prisoner's signature, numbers 61355, 61360 and 61359, all dated 12th March—I speak to his writing from my general knowledge of it—I have had letters from him, and I have seen him write.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has he been in the habit of bringing bills to you to be discounted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I first knew him from a small loan transaction for himself—I charged him about fifteen per cent. interest when paid by instalments, which made a larger rate of interest, that is about my usual charge on small loan transactions—I think there were two transactions which ran over the time; they were paid, the last on the 20th March—I</p>

               <p>first commenced discounting other bills through him about March this year I think he has brought six bills to me to be discounted—there were other bills than those for Lieutenant Burgess—most of them did not turn out good bills, two were paid, and two were bad bills—I mean dishonoured—they did not all come from Aldershot—they were principally officers—there were two of one party's, they were both paid—the last of the other two was paid, but it was under very peculiar circumstances the prisoner paid it—I might have charged at the rate of sixty per cent. interest for those bills—for the first one I charged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—the prisoner first brought me a bill of Lieutenant Burgess's on 30th April, that was for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the one that merged in the transaction we are now speaking of—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was charged for the discount of that—there was one other bill of Lieutenant Burgess for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were both done on 30th April, about that time, or two or three days afterwards—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was not met when it came to maturity—nothing was paid on it—I hold it still—I believe Burgess has taken the benefit of the Act—I know he is a bankaupt—I did not know it till recently—it escaped me in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>—I did not know it till August—I did not take any steps with regard to that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—that was done through the prisoner, he brought it to me—I charged 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest for that—he had 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, it was a three months bill—the prisoner brought this bill of Major Curzon's to my office—25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was more interest than I am in the habit of charging, between 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I asked him at least three times if he saw Major Curzon write it—he pressed it very hard, and reiterated the respectability of the acceptance several times, and I said, "Now, did you see the major sign that bill?"—he said, "Yes, certainly," and so forth, and pressed it very closely—he did not say, "Well, as to seeing him sign, I cannot be sure of that, but I was introduced to him in a room by Lieutenant Burgess, and I was going in and out, and it was handed to me by Lieutenant Burgess, and I believe Major Curzon signed it"—I swear most positively no such words were uttered; this is the first time I ever heard them—he did not tell me that Lieutenant Burgess had introduced him to Major Curzon—I did not ask how he came to know Major Curzon, and I will tell you why, because of his knowledge of military men, he told me he was in the army and navy agency, and travelling for them, and he knew these gentlemen so well, having business with them, and they often asked him to get a matter of that kind done—I asked him the question three times, because I had a little hesitation about doing it—I do not employ agents or advertise to lend money—I may sometimes—I do not regularly—I send out circulars and such like—I have never lent money to officers before.</p>

               <p>Friday, the 21st September, I went to 70, Horseferry Road—I left Mr. Woodgate and the officer outside the house, and I went in—I saw the prisoner—he asked me to be seated in an armchair the moment I entered the parlour, and he then went to a desk opposite to me to show me a list of debts that were owing to him, before I said a word to him, which amounted to about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then said to him, "How about that bill of Major Curzon's? Did you see the major sign it?"—he said, "I did. I am privileged to go to the camp privately. I did so on this occasion, and then saw him sign it "—I said, "What can Major Curzon, a man in his high position, want to do with discounting bills of exchange?"—he said, "It was all balls and pleasure parties"—Mr. Woodgate thencame in.</p>

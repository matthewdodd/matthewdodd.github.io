                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Three Colt-street, Limehouse. The prisoner was in my service for a fortnight, the last week of which I re<lb></lb>peatedly missed money—between eight and nine o'clock on Saturday morning I counted a bag of silver for a customer, and put it into a drawer in my bed-room—the drawer was locked, and at ten I missed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from it—between eight and nine on Sunday night I had a sovereign safe in the same drawer, and I missed that between eight and nine on Monday morning—I then called</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184306120145"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoner and her fellow-servant up—I said what I had missed, and asked if they knew anything of the missing money—I asked for their keys—they each produced one key, and said that was the only key they had—I told them I should feel it necessary to search their boxes—I afterwards told the pri<lb></lb>soner she had been so short a time in our service, I should like her to leave with a clean person, I should like her mistress to search her—she ran down stairs, and endeavoured to escape into the street—she got into the middle of the shop—I went after her, stopped her, and told her she had better submit if she were innocent, if not I should send for a policeman—after a deal of trouble she went back—I left her with Mrs. Hebditch and the other servant—Mrs. Hebditch afterwards gave me two keys—this is one of them—it un<lb></lb>locked the drawer in which I keep my cash-box, but it did not belong to me—this other key was given to me by my wife—this is my silk—it was found in the prisoner's box—I have no doubt it was cut from the bulk, which was in a drawer in the same chest as the money was kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nursery-maid to the prosecutor. The prisoner came as housemaid about a fortnight before the 21st of May—on the 22nd of May, I and the prisoner were called up by my master and mistress about some money that had been lost—my master asked us for the key of out boxes—I gave him my key, and the prisoner gave him a key, and said it was all she had got—my mistress afterwards searched her boxes and mine—a key of the shop was found in her box—my mistress searched the prisoner—I was present at the time, and she found two more keys in her bosom—my mistress took one key and unlocked the cash-drawer—she said to the prisoner, "I think this will unlock my drawer"—I afterwards went and searched her box again—the prisoner was present then—I found all the things on the floor as the prisoner had thrown them out—that was directly after the first search—we went back, and I saw my mistress pick up these two pieces of silk off the floor—she said they were pieces of her dress—the prisoner said nothing—my mistress said if the prisoner had got the sovereign, she had better give it up at once—she said she could not give what she had not got.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner's box was searched on two occasions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, my master was there on the first occasion—my box was searched after the prisoner's, and while it was being searched, the things out of the prisoner's box were lying about the room—I did not assist in taking the things out of the box—she took them out herself in presence of my master, and mistress, and me—I could see every thing that was taken out—my box was at one part of the room and the prisoner's at another—I took all the things out of my box while my mistress was standing by—nothing was found in the prisoner's box but the key—the silks and satin were not found in the box—when we had done searching both the boxes I went down stain to get the children's breakfast—the prisoner was up stairs—my mistress went down into the parlour, and my master was in the parlour too—the prisoner was left up stairs by herself for half an hour—when I went up again Mrs. Heb<lb></lb>ditch was up stairs, and the prisoner was there, and then we found the pieces of silk on the floor, wrapped up in a piece of silk belonging to the prisoner—I know it belonged to the prisoner, because it did not belong to my mistress—I had never seen her with it, nor seen it in the house before—I generally see what my mistress has got—I have the charge of the children's clothes and of my mistress's—I generally go to every drawer except the cash drawer, and I never remember seeing the piece that these were wrapped up in before—the prisoner was by when these pieces of silk were found—Iam not a judge of these articles—I should think this satin is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and this silk worth 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is not very uncommon in the texture—I do not know that females in my situation wear satin, they may wear satin scarfs.</p>

I was called in, and had two keys handed to me—one of them opens a drawer in the bed-room—the other is of a door leading to the shop—I went up stairs, and tried this key to a drawer, in which there was cash, and it opened it freely—after I had seen the pieces of silk, I told the prisoner I must take her into custody, that she was charged by her master with stealing these pieces of silk, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a sovereign—she said, "Though I had a key which opened his drawer, I know nothing</p>

               <p>about the money, only the bits of silk"—there were three pieces of silk in the drawer—I found this bit of green silk matches with this piece—it is cut in a zigzag way—this bit of black satin corresponds with a piece that was in the drawer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten years—these bits of silk were handed to me—I compared them with the pieces, and found they matched—one of them is cut in a crooked way, by which it matches with the piece on the roll—here is a bow on one piece, and a hollow on the other.</p>

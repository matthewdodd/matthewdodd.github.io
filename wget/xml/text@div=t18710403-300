                  </hi>. I live at 22, Cottage Road, King's Road, Chelsea, and am a tailor—on Saturday, 25th March, I was at the "Nell Gwynne" public-house, with my wife and some friends—we came out about 11.50 or 11.55—the prisoners were against the door—Clarke insulted my wife, and used very bad language—I asked him what he meant—he struck me in the eye—I turned round to defend myself, and we both fell on the ground—he <hi rend="italic">cuddled</hi> me while we were down, and when he got off, my watch was gone—I said "My watch is gone"—I looked round, and they had both dis<lb></lb>appeared—I was fetched by a policeman about a quarter of an hour after<lb></lb>wards, and I gave them in charge then—I have not seen my watch since—it was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I was with my husband—as we were coming out of the "Nell Gwynne," Clarke used very bad language to me—my husband said "Do you know who you are insulting?" and the prisoner hit him in the eye—they fell on the ground, and were lying there a little time—my brother helped my husband off Clarke, and Porter caught hold of him and took him away—as soon as my husband got from Clarke, he said "My watch is gone"—they were on the ground a minute or two—I did not see where Clarke's hands were—his arms were round my husband's body—they were lying quiet—Porter was standing at the side, quite close to them—my husband had his watch about two minutes before—I had not seen it; I had seen the chain—the chain disappeared with the watch.</p>

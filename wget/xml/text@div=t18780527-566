Sir,—I have no wish to injure any person in your employ, or say anything that may be deemed done out of spite, but I consider it my duty to inform you, the foreman, the witness in whom you placed so much confidence, was the very man to come to me and ask me to purchase some size, which he said (to use his own words) could easily be managed unbeknown to you, for he should be glad to make a few shillings, as he did not get much. I have a witness to prove what I say, and I think I am entitled to ask what dependence can be placed in a man who thus makes such a suggestion behind his master's back. It cer<lb></lb>tainly is rather a singular way of studying an employer's interest.—Yours respectfully, Henry Carvalho.") I know Mr. Foster, who is employed by the prisoner—I have not seen him nor the prisoner write—Francis Ball had been in my employ 12 months in January last—I had confidence in him—on receiving the letter I wrote to Mr. Carvalho, and in a few days received this post-card. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: 29th March, 1878. Dear Sir,—In reply to yours of 26th inst., I beg to say that what I stated in my letter can be proved if necessary.—Yours, &amp;c., Henry Carvalho.

I am working foreman of Buchan Sands, Cardigan Mills, Cardigan Street, Kennington Cross, ink and dye manufacturers—I have been employed by him 12 or 14 months—the prisoner cleared some drains for Mr. Sands in January—there was some currey size in the yard—it is used for dressing black leather—the prisoner picked some up and said "I think I can make some use of this," referring to some which was thrown aside as dregs—I said "Can you? there it is, it is thrown away for a time"—he took a lot away, but not at that interview—he invited me over to his premises at Kennington—he said it could be used in the building and painting business for producing a blue tint in whitewashing, and could be made a business of by a traveller knowing the building trade—I made no suggestion to him whatever about the purchase of it—I did not give him leave to take any away, nor say it was my perquisite—I was a witness for my employer in a County Court action against the prisoner—the prisoner when we came out of Court said "You are a d—sneak;" and turning to a bricklayer, "Jack, he has given you a good lift up"—that was before the 22nd March—my employer made a communication to me, in consequence of which I instituted these proceedings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not know the stuff had been taken away till the prisoner showed me some afterwards—I did not mention it to my master—I know Henry George—he was not present at this conversation—I heard his evidence at the police-court—I did not ask the prisoner to buy it in George's presence—he did not say "What does your employer want a ton for it? you had better go and ask him"—I did not say "It does not matter about seeing the governor about it, I can settle all that."</p>

I am eleven years old, and a scholar at the St. Cyprian Schools, Park Lane, Dorset Square—I knew a boy named Herbert Wyley, who is now dead—I saw him at school on the 31st August—the prisoner was the master of the school—the school commenced at 9.30 in the morning—Wyley was in the first class, and I in the second—I was pretty near to him when in school—I saw the prisoner, about 10.30, hit him on the top of the head, with his closed fist—he hit him rather hard—I heard the sound of the blow, and the prisoner told him to learn his lessons or else he would have another—the boy directly put his arms on the desk and laid his head down on them—I think he was sitting at the time—I heard him crying—he con<lb></lb>tinued</p>

Wyley fetched me to his house one Saturday night and asked me about it—he spoke to me on three occasions—I saw Mr. Chip<lb></lb>perfield and some other gentleman, but I never heard who they were—the deceased was in the habit of staying away from school in the afternoon, but I think he was there on the afternoon in question—I saw him standing at his own door in the afternoon after the blow, but he was not at play.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Wyley, and live at 4, Park Lane, Dorset Square—I am the mother of the deceased—he was ten years old in January last—I remember his coming home from school on Monday, 31st August—previously to that time he was a strong healthy boy, and never bad a day's illness in his life, to my knowledge—he was a stout-built child—he attended St Cyprian Schools for a good many months, but I cannot say exactly how long—I spoke to him when he came home on the 31st—he had been crying very much, and seemed very low—I knew he had been crying, because the tears were all dried on his face—I asked him what was the matter, and he told me that his master had hit him a severe blow on the top of his head, that he had got such a pain in it that he could not hold it up—he sat in the room for a few minutes, then got up and went into the yard and vomited very much—he kept on vomiting, and did not go to school in the afternoon—he had gone to school that morning in his usual health; he ate a hearty breakfast, and there did not appear to be anything the matter with him—the next morning I went to his bed-room and asked him how he was—he said, "Not much better, mother"—he still kept vomiting, and complained of his head and back of his neck—the symptoms became more violent after a few days, and he seemed as if he was gradually sinking—he told me that he had not passed any urine for several days;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230037"></xptr>
               <p>from the Friday till the Monday—MR. Baker, surgeon, saw him, and he ordered him to be put into a hip-bath, and that caused him to make water—he kept his bed for a fortnight before his death—he went to school on the Tuesday morning—he was not willing to go, but I said, "Pack of stuff, you will be all right;" and he went; that was the last time—he became much worse on the Friday, and, in consequence of that, I went to the school, but did not see the prisoner—I saw a gentleman whose name I do not know—in consequence of my communication to him and Mr. Sedgwick, a surgeon, between 5 and 7 o'clock the same day, I did not see him afterwards—I went, but he did not come to the child—I cannot say how long Mr. Sedg<lb></lb>wick saw him; it was a very few minutes, at his own house—on the Monday, about 10 o'clock, I saw Mr. Baker, another surgeon, and told him all the symptoms of the child's illness; he prescribed for him, and saw him twice that day, and, I think, almost every day afterwards, up to the time of his death—he died about 2 o'clock on Sunday, 20th September, as mad as a dog ever was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it an undoubted fact, that he did go to school on the Tuesday morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is; from the day after he received the blow, until the day of his death, he got gradually worse—the weather was not so hot, during the week commencing the 31st August, as it had been; if any<lb></lb>thing it was cooler; it might have been so hot as to oblige me to carry an umbrella, to protect my head and that of my son's—I always carry an umbrella in hot weather—on the Friday I sent the deceased of an errand, but it was only into Dorset Street, a few minutes' walk from where we live—I saw that he was very ill on his return, and that different symptoms had manifested themselves—it was before 8 o'clock in the morning I sent him out; he was only gone a few minutes—his brother lives in Norfolk Square, near the Great Western; I believe he went there on the Friday, about 1 o'clock; when he came back at two, he seemed to be much worse—I went in the morning to St Cyprian School, and saw the gentleman I have spoken of—I believe it was between 10 and 11 o'clock—when I saw Mr. Sedgwick, I told him that the boy complained of being hit—he put his hand on the boy's forehead in this way, and asked him if that was the place where the master had struck him—the boy said it was not, and Mr. Sedgwick then asked him where it was, and the child, to the best of my knowledge, put his hand up and said, "Hit me like this," only so much harder—I did not see Mr. Sedgwick examine the head, except in that way; I did not see him examine it all over; he told me to keep him quiet—it was before this that the lad had gone to Norfolk Square—MR. Sedgwick did not tell me that he did not find any tenderness about the boy's head—he said but very little about it—he did not say that it was the effect of the heat of the sun—he did not mention the sun at all—the Coroner's Inquest was not held in ac<lb></lb>cordance with the wish of either my husband or myself—I supposed it was held because they could not give a certificate for burial—I did not get any of the witnesses to go there—there were no witnesses that I know of—I am not aware that a Mrs. Jordan was examined—the beadle told me that no witnesses would be required, and we did not interfere at all about it—MR. Sedgwick was not examined.</p>

               <p>the name of Mr. Sedgwick, and in consequence of that I took him to his surgery—it is quite true that from the Monday to the Friday the lad gradually got worse, but of course I did not apprehend anything serious—on the Friday, after he had been out to buy some peas for his pigeons, he sat down and said, "Oh, mother, I have been looking at some boys flying their pigeons in Dorset Square, and I began jumping round and round, and I do not know when I should have stood still if a gentleman had not caught hold of me. Mother, I cannot look up;" and he put his hand over his eyes—he looked as white as a sheet when he came in, quite differently to what he did when he went out—on the Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, he merely went out for a short walk in the street—the vomiting continued every day, but I cannot say how many times—he began as soon as he got out of bed in the morning—the inquest took place on the Thursday after his death—I did not understand it when the beadle brought the summons for my husband—I said, "Oh dear; I am sorry you have not summoned me in the room of my husband, for I consider I know more about the child's death than anyone else can do"—the beadle said that no witnesses would be required on either side—the two boys, Cobb and Toms, were not called at the inquest, but I and my husband were—the prisoner was called several times, but ho was out of the way—he attended afterwards, and said that he had a witness who could be heard—the inquest was reported in the newspapers.</p>

I am the wife of Elijah Brown, and live at 83, Boston Place, Dorset Square—in August last I worked for Mrs. Wyley—I was at her house on the 2nd September, and noticed the little boy—he was lying with his head on his hand, on the table—he appeared to be suffering in his head—the prisoner came to my house on the 3rd September, and brought some shirts, but I did not see him on Sunday, the 6th September—he came to me and we had some conversation—he asked me if I worked for Mrs. Wyley, for if so he might get some information about the little boy—I said he was very bad, and that he had told me he was suffering from a blow which he (the prisoner) had given him—the prisoner asked me if I thought he would do such a thing—I said I did not know, but should think it very cruel if he did—he told me the boy was at school on Tuesday, the 1st September—he said, too, that he had not learnt his lessons when he came there, and he asked him the reason why, and the lad answered that he could not learn them because his head ached so from the blow which he had given him on the Monday—he allowed the boy half an hour to learn them, and the boy learnt them within the time—he then said that he remembered the time when he hit him, that he just merely tapped him on the side of the head, and he showed me how he did it, by tapping the head of my little girl—I told him the boy had said that he hit him on the top of his head, with his closed fist, and caused a pain down the back of his neck—the prisoner said that he did not hit him on the top, but merely on the side of the head—I did not see the lad again before his death—I had no further conversation with the prisoner—I saw the lad about throe times altogether—on one occasion, when I went to his bed-room, he did not seem to know anybody—he once said to his mother that he had no feeling in his fingers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The boy went out a good deal on Friday, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not notice him go further than the door—MR. Baker lives about three-quarters of a mile off—I do not know whether his mother took him there that day—I did not miss the lad for so long as two hours during the middle of the day—he did not go out to play with the other children on the Wednesday or Thursday—he went out for a few minutes merely—he seemed to be much worse on the Friday—I think the alarming symptoms showed themselves in the morning—I may have said to the prisoner, and also to his mother, that the boy told me that when he was hit on the head a pain ran down his neck—the mother told me what the prisoner had said to her—I was examined at the Police Court, and I repeated what the lad had told me—I cannot recollect whether I said at the Police Court that the lad had told me the pain ran down the back of his head and neck—I would not like to swear positively that I did say so—I have heard the expression used by other people—I have heard Mrs. Page say so—the matter was talked over by Mrs. Wyley and other persons—I was called before the Coroner, and I said that I never saw the boy ill, or heard him complain before this occurred.</p>

I am an optician, carrying on business at 75, Cheapside, and produce a correct thermometrical chart of the weather during the months of August and September, registered at 8 o'clock in the morning, at my place—the chart shows the highest and lowest temperature each day—the maximum temperature, on the 31st August, was 73 degrees—the high<lb></lb>est reading during August was on the 5th of that month, when the tempera<lb></lb>ture was 84 degrees—I do not feel myself competent to say that 72 degrees of heat is enough to give sun-stroke if a person is exposed—on Friday, the 4th September, the temperature was 76 degrees—that was in the shade—my place is on the south side of Cheapside, and so situated that we obtain a fair temperature—on the following day it rose one degree, and then there was a fall to the 7th.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 42, Grove Road, and am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons—on the 7th September the little boy, Wyley, I believe, was brought to me by his mother—it was about 11 o'clock in the morning—the boy told me the particulars of his illness—when I examined him externally I found that he complained of a good deal of pain in his head—his eyes were intolerant of light, and when he left his mother's chair to be examined more particularly, he walked with a tottering gait and staggered—he said, in answer to my inquiries, that his bowels were not open, and he had not passed his water—I put my hand on his head and pressed it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230041"></xptr>
               <p>firmly, to feel if there was an effusion under the scalp, because he had told me that his schoolmaster had hit him on the head with his hand—I did not find any bruise, or any indication of a blow—he complained of pain when I pressed his head—I did not find the scalp elevated from the skull—he com<lb></lb>plained of soreness when I pressed my hand, and also of pain through the head and neck, but there was no external mark that I could discover—he pointed out the place on his head where he had been struck—he said it hurt him when I pressed my fingers in there—I cannot account for there being no external mark—I simply mention the fact—I attended him to the time of his death—I told his mother that he was in a bad condition, not fit to be brought out, and that he ought to have been kept quietly at home—I ordered a bath and a purgative to be given to him immediately—before his death symptoms of an aggravated form manifested themselves, and they continued till he got effusion on the brain, and then he became in a comatose condition—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination—I removed the scalp, but did not find any mark of external violence—on removing the skull I found that the membranes covering the brain, and at the base of the brain, were thickened—this was the result of extended inflammation—there was inflammation under that part of the skull where the deceased said the blow was struck—it was under the crown of the head, and extended down to the back of the neck—such a blow might be struck, and yet leave no external mark—in my judgment the cause of death was concussion of the brain—I mean by that, vibration of the brain sub<lb></lb>stance, or, as the French term it, a commotion of the brain substance; a shaking of the brain—there may be concussion of the brain without any external evidence of the actual injury—I think a man is capable of giving a blow on the head of a child, in chastisement, and produce concussion of the brain—from what I have heard and seen of the size of the prisoner, I should say that a blow like the one described is sufficient to account for the injury I found on the brain—I think concussion may be caused by a blow with the palm of the hand, as well as with the hand shut—the boy's skull in this instance was very fairly ossified, con<lb></lb>sidering the age of the boy—a blow of the sort given on the top of the head would be very likely to damage the brain going down to the base of the skull—the vomiting on the Monday and subsequently would be an indication of injury to the brain—vomiting continued nearly up to the time of his death—his inability to bear light, the retention of urine, and the tottering gait, indicated injury to the cerebellum, which I assumed was the effect of a blow, and which prevented him having control over the muscular actions—the effusion on the brain was the consequence of inflammation—the immediate effect of the blow would be a stunning, temporary insensibility—the laying of the head on the desk was the result of the injury—after a time he rallied, and became sufficiently susceptible to walk home—the concussion of the brain, arising from the blow, was the cause of death, in my opinion.</p>

               <p>appear to lose his senses momentarily—the dropping of the head would denote a degree of insensibility—I do not call putting his head on his arms on the desk and crying, insensibility—the tottering gait, the pain at the top of the head and neck, the constipation, vomiting, and retention of urine, are all symptoms of concussion—thirst is a symptom of sun<lb></lb>stroke, but I do not know that a tottering gait is—a tottering gait might be produced from giddiness consequent upon sun<lb></lb>stroke—pain at the top of the head and back of the neck would be a symptom of sun<lb></lb>stroke—it would be a symptom of cerebral irritation, which might come from sun<lb></lb>stroke—vomiting and retention of urine at certain periods would also be symptoms of the same—I will swear that the deceased did not die from sun<lb></lb>stroke, to the best of my knowledge—I certainly said, when before the Magistrate, that certain of the symptoms might arise from concussion of the brain or from sun<lb></lb>stroke—I said that, on removing the skull, I found that the membranes of the brain were thickened, caused by inflammation of the brain—I also said there was evidence of effusion from the inflammation, that I attributed it in the first instance to congestion, and then to inflammation succeeding that; and that external violence or sun<lb></lb>stroke might produce congestion of the brain—I undertake to say that the symptoms in the case of the deceased were not consistent with death by sun<lb></lb>stroke—all the symptoms have not been taken in—you have not included all the symptoms of the child when living—some of the symptoms you have named are consistent with sun<lb></lb>stroke—I knew that Mr. Sedgwick had seen the boy before I had—I did not suggest that he should be called in when I made the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination—cases of sun<lb></lb>stroke certainly have been prevalent during the past summer—there may be congestion of the lungs in sun<lb></lb>stroke—any red spots, or ecymosis, might have been removed by the time I made the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination—I do not think the blow in this case was sufficient to rupture any large vessel in the head, but it might rupture a smaller one, disturb some nerve centre, and bring on inflammation and death—in sun<lb></lb>stroke a person gets giddy, falls down, and lies quiescent—he is afflicted with vertigo or dizziness.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Park Place, Upper Baker Street, and am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries—I have been to India and China, and in those countries, as well as in England, have had great experience in cases of sun<lb></lb>stroke—on the evening of Friday, the 4th September, the deceased boy was brought to my surgery by Mrs. Wyley, who was accompanied by the Rev. C. Gooch, the clergy<lb></lb>man of the district—in consequence of an application being made to me for advice, I made a very careful and prolonged examination of the deceased's bead; in the first place, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was any lump, swelling, or sign of external violence; there was none—I then examined it with the points of my fingers to see if there was any tenderness in any part; there wasz none—I then proposed to make a medical examina<lb></lb>tion of the child, and I examined the tongue, the condition of the eyes, and the skin, and from the symptoms of cerebral excitement that were present, from the top of the head, and the heat generally about the upper part of the body, from the quickened pulse, from the excited appearance of the eyes, from the pain complained of at the back of the head, and generally in the head, I formed the conclusion, from the statement of the mother and of the boy himself, that he was suffering from exposure to the sun—I told the mother there was nothing to indicate to me, as a surgeon, that the child suffered from any blow—having previously ascertained that he had some constipation of the bowels, I directed her to give him a dose of opening medicine, and to keep him quiet at home, and I intimated that she might expect the symptoms would subside—before the child left my consulting-room I directed the attention of the mother to the formation of his skull, and to a somewhat peculiar projection of the forehead as being an additional reason why she should keep him at home, and not allow him to be exposed to the sun, and told her with that formation of head the child might be more liable than other children to suffer from exposure—there are two forms of sun<lb></lb>stroke recognized by the medical profession—this was the cerebral form, which affected the back of the neck—I have not heard anything to give me the slightest idea that there could have been concussion in this case.</p>

               <p>the cerebral form of sun<lb></lb>stroke—retention and the increase of urine might both occur in cases of sun<lb></lb>stroke—I believe the child died from effusion on the brain, the result of sun-fever, which is the terra now given to what was at one time called sun<lb></lb>stroke—a patient may have sun-fever after being exposed to the heat of the sun, with exposure to the direct rays—I do not think he died from concussion of the brain airing from violence—numbness in the hands is very frequently the first features of sun<lb></lb>stroke—in this case it was very indicative, in consequence of the child being transient.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you of opinion that the blow on the top of the head had nothing to do with the child's death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am; and that has always been my opinion; I say it is my opinion, that he was not suffering, directly or indirectly, from any blow received, then or at any period of his life—I was not present at the inquest, and cannot say what evidence was given by the gentleman who made the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination of the body—I was not permitted to be present at the inquest—I received no notice of it—it was concealed from my knowledge—(<hi rend="italic">A letter, written by the witness to Mr. Bakery dated</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th September</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">was produced</hi>)—That letter is in my hand-writing—I wrote the words, "Dear Baker, I intended to have been at your inquest on the little boy, Wyley, but could not manage it"—the hour at which it was held was concealed from me—"He went, it appears, to school up to the time he was brought to me, when I advised he should be kept at home * * * he was only a little strange at the time. It was impossible to say whether the symptoms were due to the blow or to heat<lb></lb>stroke, to which he was exposed"—Hearing afterwards of the death of the child, it was impossible for me to form an opinion whether there might not be extravagasation of the blood subsequently, and an interruption of all symptoms previously—I have quite forgotten the circumstance of having expressed myself so decidedly in that letter, but with regard to the symptoms, as showing that death arose from con<lb></lb>cussion of the brain, I may say there was nothing at all to indicate that—I must admit that the expression in the letter is more doubtful than I could have been justified in stating, but with regard to the interruption of the symptoms, when we hoar of death under those circumstances, we are always aware there may be an interruption in the sequence to a certain extent—the letter was written after the death of the, child; and then, hearing the child had died, I could not be able to give so decided an opinion until after the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination had been made—we might have found extravagasation of blood, which we could not tell before—I believed it when I wrote the letter, but I say that I should not have expressed myself so decidedly, hearing that death had taken place—the next sentence, "I therefore decline to give any opinion as to the cause of the symptoms," is a mis<lb></lb>statement, arising from forgetfulness—"I should have been rather desirous of seeing an undoubted case of heat or sun<lb></lb>stroke, and thought it possible that this might have been one;"—I mean by this that I have seen a great many cases of sun<lb></lb>stroke, but I have not been present at a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination of a person who had died from one—the point of interest to a medical man in the case was, that hearing death had occurred, I was desirous of knowing whether it had been an un<lb></lb>interrupted case, resulting from an undiscovered injury during life, or not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230045"></xptr>
               <p>—by saying that I wanted to see an undoubted case of sun<lb></lb>stroke, I meant a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination, as being a matter of interest to me—"Of course, the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> appearance would be vague, and, in some respects, negative;"—In the face of this I still adhere to the statement that I was desirous of seeing one case of sun<lb></lb>stroke, with reference to a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination of the body—I mean by "vague" that we should not be able to tell, from the appearance after death in the brain, that that was the condition resulting from any one form of disease of the brain during life, necessarily—the extravagasation of blood would prove a fact in the case that there was a blow given during life, which would, to a certain extent, show that death might possibly not have been absolutely due to sun<lb></lb>stroke—I mean that if I had heard there was extravagasation of blood, then that that extravagasation had been caused by a blow—that there was no extravagasation of blood is not the only reason why I think death was not caused by a blow—in this case there was an absence of any mark on the place of injury—if it had been a slight blow the marks might have disappeared between the day that the boy was struck and that on which I saw him—if there had been a severe blow it certainly would have showed itself, and I do not believe the evidence as given by the two boys—I do not think the prisoner struck the deceased in the way they have stated—the letter goes on, "The report of the case in the papers is too short, and influenced too much by local party feeling, to be of any medical value"—I mean by "local party feeling" the statement that the boy was struck at a school represented as being a Roman Catholic one—it is not a Roman Catholic school—the party feeling referred to the religious aspect which was given to it—I have attended the Rev. Mr. Gooch professionally—he passes the door of the house occupied by the Wyleys, which is near to the vestry of the church, and I supposed he asked how their son was, and then that Mr. Sedgwick would see him—the school is a district school, maintained by contributions—I had not spoken to Mr. Gooch before I saw the boy—the boy told me that the blow was given by the master with his flat-hand—the fact of the boy crying immediately after the blow showed that he was not unconscious—the signs of concussion vary according to the severity of the injury—there must be partial unconsciousness in every case of con<lb></lb>cussion—I do not agree with the opinion that in slight oases the patient may be merely confused and giddy for a few minutes—the sinking of the lad on the seat immediately after he was struck, and his remaining motionless for a few minutes, may be accepted as a condition of concussion—vomiting is a sign of recovery from concussion—it is the first symptom which a surgeon looks upon as the most favorable—patients vomit on recovering from unconsciousness.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you so far forgotten that you had written the letter to Mr. Baker as not to tell the solicitor or myself that it was in existence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was very anxious to be present at the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi>, because I expected to find extravagasation—the words "It was impossible to say," refer to the time I examined the boy—the difficulty of the case arose from hearing there was death, and the possibility of extravagasation of blood being found; therefore until the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination was made I declined to commit myself to an opinion; I could not feel justified in doing so—I did not receive any summons to attend the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi>—I remained at home during the greater part of the day, as I supposed they would naturally send for me when the time came—if the child had died from con<lb></lb>cussion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230046"></xptr>
               <p>I should have expected to find evidence of either extravagasation of blood or ecymose spots on the brain, or one or both—effusion on the brain would be a negative symptom, and would not show anything—the child showed me how ho was hit by the master—he said he was hit like this, with the palm of the hand—notwithstanding all that has taken place, I am still of opinion that the boy died from sun-fever.</p>

I am the wife of Edward Carroll, a coachman, who has lived for twenty-nine years at 38, Dorset Square—I have known Mr. Cosbey ever since he first kept this school, about twelve months—my boy went there, and speaks of him in most high terms; and among the boy's mothers generally he bears a very high character.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know Shields? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he left the school for a little time—just before he left he had been struck, I do not know where—I did not know Smith—I knew McGrath, he left the school—the master wanted to strike him because he was going to throw a slate at him—he did strike him once, I think with the cane, because he did something wrong, and then he took up the slate—he was not removed by his parents, he went out of the school himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Goodwin, and live at No. 4, Oxford-street, Agar<lb></lb>town, in the parish of St. Pancras. On the evening of the 30th of Oct., about half past eight o'clock, I left my par<lb></lb>lour, and went up stairs for about five minutes, leaving my little girl, four years old, in the parlour—she called out, "Mother, some one has opened the window"—I was coming down stairs at the time—I directly went to the parlour<lb></lb>window, and found it partly open—it was quite safe when I went up stairs—I saw a pillow, a bit of a coloured counterpane, and a piece of a mattress, hanging partly out of the window—they had been lying on the foot of the bed, which was against the window—I missed all the articles stated—I opened the door, and picked up a jacket of my hus<lb></lb>band's, which laid at the door—the witness, Mendy, came up with my little child's frock—he went in search of the prisoner—I afterwards went to the station, and saw the prisoner there—I had never seen her before—I also saw two blankets, a quilt, and handkerchief, all my property—they were lost at the same time as the other things—the bouse we live in be<lb></lb>longs to a Mr. Huxtable—he does not live in it, nor do any of his servants—it is a lodging-house, and each person lives in his own part, and has a key—there is one door for us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and life in Cambridge place, Agar-town. On the 30th of Oct. I was going along Cambridge-place, and met the prisoner about ten yards from my house, and about 100 yards from Mrs. Goodwin's—she had a lot of these things dragging after her—she slipped when I came along, and she said, "D—the things"—my daughter was with me—she picked up a frock—I heard a cry of, "Stop thief," and went towards Mrs. Goodwin's—I afterwards went in search of the pri<lb></lb>soner, and overtook her in the main road with the things—I said she was the very person I had been looking for—she said, "Me? I have just left work"—I caught hold of her, and held her till the policeman came up and took her in charge—she dropped the things at her fett.</p>

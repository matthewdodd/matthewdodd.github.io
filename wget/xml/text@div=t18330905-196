               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been in the Birmingham business? A. More than twenty years - the firm was originally Jenkins and Hands, Jenkins was my father, and Hands was his cousin - I was an apprentice there, and so was the prisoner; I don't recollect whether it was it the same time - the prisoner was not engaged for a rival house when I had him taken into custody, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not know that he was engaged in executing the commission of a rival house, and were you not expressly informed of it by his brother? A. On my oath, I did not know it - I do not know that he was engaged for any house in the same business; I did not know he was engaged to sell on commission, or in any other way for any house in Birmingham or any where else; I know Mr.

             of Birmingham; I did not know that the prisoner was engaged in business for him - I never heard that he was, or was about to be; I heard in the early part of July, that he had been in negotiation with Mr. Moore - Mr. Moore is a manufacturer in the same line of business as I am; I never employed the prisoner by commission - I offered him a commission to take place subsequent to Midsummer last; that was the subject of conversation in the early part of this year; I did not offer him that after the 29th of May - I am quite sure of that - I cannot say positively how much my returns have increased since the prisoner came into my service; he met me at Stony-Stratford in September, 1831, to look over the business of the establishment, but nothing was then mentioned about increase of salary - he mentioned that I had not given him credit for the present I had been in the habit of giving him - I wished him to leave the house of mine which he occupied, and I told him I would give him £30 a-year in lien of it; I cannot tell whether £52 a-year was mentioned, it might be matter of conversation - I never said that I would give it him; his salary was £120 a-year, and £30 additional for leaving the premises in Queen-street, where he had resided free of rent, coals and candles.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever say that you had been studying how to improve his situation, and that the conclusion you had come to was, that instead of his receiving £120 a-year as formerly, that from the 1st of January, 1832, he should be entitled to a commission of one per cent on all monies received? A. There was a proposal for a commission on his part, to which I did not consent - I did say I had been studying how to improve his situation; I had been in the habit of giving him a present, and I might have given him more - I had a very good opinion of him; I did not succeed to the business of his friends at Birmingham, they live in another part of the town - I swear positively and without reserve, that I never agreed to allow the prisoner any commission of any kind on any occasion; on the 30th of March, 1832, I sent him a statement of accounts desiring him to examine and return them, but he never returned them - I don't recollect his writing to me to say that the statement was not in accordance with my agreement, to allow him a commission of one per cent; I have no knowledge of his objecting to that statement.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discharged him on the 29th of May, did he not remonstrate with you on your conduct, and say that you were to allow him a commission, and that you had sent him a statement which he had returned, as not being in accordance with your own agreement? A. No; he appeared a good deal affected, and said his friends should make good the deficiency; he said nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050119"></xptr>about commission - I have no recollection on the 9th of June, of receiving any application from him, to be furnished with an account of the money received since he had commenced on commission - I will not swear it was not made, I don't recollect it - I think that a commission of one per-cent on the sale of goods would have fallen short of his salary; the prisoner called upon me about the end of June, to know if I would reinstate him in his situation; he did not mention the accounts; I have no recollection of his saying a word about them; I will swear he did not; it is probable I might tell him I should be in town in three weeks, and he might call upon me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that interview inform you that he was about to join a gentleman in partnership, and mention several commissions that had been offered to him? A. I don't recollect it - I don't recollect that he mentioned a commission from Mr.

            ; he mentioned a per-centage from Mr. Moore, but whether at that, or an after interview I cannot tell - I have no recollection of its being at that meeting, but some such a point was a matter of conversation - I don't recollect his saying he should be at Birmingham in ten days, and he would wait upon me there; he came to Birmingham, but I cannot tell at what time, he called upon me at my warehouse; and I said I wished to see his brother before I had any conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not say that you wished to see his brother before you entered into any arrangement with him? A. I have no recollection of it; I cannot speak to the precise words - I wished to see his brother - I said I would call upon his brother; I cannot swear I did not use the word "arrangement;" I called on his brother the same evening, he was going to tea, but I did not drink tea with him; I received a visit from the prisoner and his brother, but I don't know whether it was on the following day; I had some conversation about his receiving a commission on the sale of brass and copper metal, but I did not enter into any arrangement - his brother had an agent in London of the name of Stevens, with whom it was stated the prisoner was about to go into partnership in the commission business, and his brother asked me if I had any objection to give him some commission, if he should succeed in going into partnership - and I said if anything fell in his way to sell to customers whose names were not on my books, I should have no objection to allow him a commission; I can swear this was in June or the beginning of July - it was before I discovered this; he stated that he had been offered a better commission from Mr. Moore than from me; I don't recollect his saying he would not take mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his brother ask you this plain question;"Mr. Jenkins, am I to understand that if my brother accepts the commission from Mr. Moore, that he will have nothing to fear from you as it respects his account with you?" A. I have no recollection of his making use of such an observation - I might say - "Certainly not; I will be no obstacle to him, I wish him well;" I had no hostile feeling towards him, until I discovered the money had been received and not entered in the book - none of these charges had then been brought to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now so far from your not knowing that he had been acting for Mr. Moore - did he not on his return to Birmingham, a week afterwards, call and tell you that he had arranged with Mr. Moore and taken his business? A. He never did, nor did his brother either; I came to London on a Saturday night, in the early part of August, and the prisoner came to me on the Monday after - I do not know what he came for; he said, he wanted to speak to me; I told him I was so engaged I could not speak to him then, but I should be at liberty at nine o'clock in the evening - I had made some discovery before he came, and he was soon after taken into custody, but they were matters distinct from this indictment; I had no knowledge of these at the time - I have had no communication with the prisoner since he has been in custody; the book has not been shown to him since.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Just tell me the amount of the present you were in the habit of making him? A. 10l. a year; I remitted to him money on account of his salary once a month; April was the last time; I have had his acknowledgment for them; there had been conversation about allowing him a commission from June in the present year, if he had continued with me, but it was never acted upon - at the time I saw him at Birmingham I had no reason to believe that there was any account between us, but that which left him in debt that 60l.; and when I went before the Lord Mayor I was not aware of the items in this indictment.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BOULTON. I am a needle and pin-maker. I deal with the prosecutor; I knew the prisoner in his employ - I settled this account with him on the 23rd of August, 1832, by bill 13l., bill 9l. 10s., cash 34l. 10s. making a total of 57l. - the bill was 57l. 12s. 4d., here is the prisoner's receipt for it - (read.)

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you dealt with the prosecutor? A. I am not certain, perhaps two years or more - this bill is headed, Jenkins and Son; I am not certain whether all the bills are so; I had returned to the prosecutor, on the 9th of February, 2 cwt. of old metal, which came to 4l. 10s. - I cannot say whether the 4l. 10s. was due to me for that metal when I paid this bill - the prisoner used to go to my clerks, and they settled it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say whether on this occasion, you paid the prisoner bills and money amounting to 57l., or that you paid this bill deducting 4l. 10s. and the 12s. 4d.? A. No, I paid him 57l. in money and bills.</p>
               <p>ROBERT FAIRBURN. I am a wire-drawer, and live in Old-street. I dealt with the firm of Jenkins and Son, in 1832; I knew the prisoner as their clerk; this is my account with their firm, it is 45l. 4s., but it was originally 35l. 4s. - on the 20th of November, 1832, here is the prisoner's receipt for a bill 18l.; cheque 8l. 10s.; and cash 8l. 14s. making together 35l. 4s. and signed,

            Hands - the account was only 35l. 4s. but it was 10l. short, and he called the next morning, and said, he had made a mistake, and reckoned it too little - I then paid him 9l. 10s. more, and here is the 10s. he allowed for discount.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050120"></xptr>MR. JENKINS re-examined. Have you any partner? A. No; I trade under the firm of Jenkins and Son; I did allow my father a settled sum out of the business, but it did not depend on the trade.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What is the usual credit of your trade? A. We profess to give six months, but it often extends to eight or nine months; but a great many of our customers pay earlier; some only one month; no doubt money has been received, both from Mr. Boulton and Mr. Fairburn since these embezzlements, but I did not examine my ledger with reference to these sums till after the prisoner was committed by the Lord Mayor - I had a regular debtor and creditor account with those persons, but the collecting was in the prisoner's hands till he was discharged, so that I had no means of discovering it - our accounts are sent in half-yearly, or in some cases quarterly; if any objection had been made to these accounts, it would not have come to me but through the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who kept the ledger? A. Mr. Alccck; these sums appear in the ledger, but the prisoner had the settlement of all accounts - I received information that there was a deficiency in these accounts, and then I looked over the ledger and found it; I then applied to the parties, to know what had been paid.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, read a very long address, stating that he had been for some years in the prosecutor's service, and that he had exerted himself to increase his business, which he had from 100l. to 400l. per week; that the prosecutor had offered to allow him one per cent. commission on all monies received from Christmas, 1832, but which he had never done; that having been discharged without any notice he had no time to correct any errors, which might have crept into the account, and that he had not been since allowed to settle, and that he firmly believed there was now a balance in his own favour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wood, Newcastle-street; Mr. Simmons, Birmingham; Mr. Lewis, Bow-street; Mr. Stevens, Thaives-inn; Mr. Jones, Grafton-street; Mr. Linford, Doctors-commons; Mr. Jackson, Butcher-hall-lane; and Mr. Joyce, of Wood-street, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On the 14th of March, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop and said he wanted five legs of pork for a supper for Mr. Hocker, of St. John's-street, who I knew, he brought a clean tray with him. I put three legs of pork, weighing 24 lbs. into it - he wanted to take them himself, but I sent my own servant with them. I told him to bring the money back; he went away with the boy, but the boy returned without the money or meat. I apprehended him next night at a butcher's shop in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did not you doubt about his being the man - A. Never; I knew him well. I desired the boy not to leave them without the money. I should not object to give Hocker credit.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner in my master's shop; he had three legs of pork weighed and a tray, and was dressed like a butcher; he asked for them for Mr. Hocker - my master gave them to me with strict orders to take them to Mr. Hocker and receive the money for them. I went out with the prisoner, and by the turnpike he told me to go on to Mr. Hocker's, and I went there till he came as he was going back to master's again; he overtook me before I got to Mr. Hocker's, and said he had got two more legs of pork; left two sovereigns for them, and I was to bring the change and those other two legs to Mr. Hooker's after I had delivered these; I followed him down the road into Rosamond-street; he took me to the Red Lion, public-house, and called for a pint of beer, pen, ink, and paper, and went into the tap-room and made out a bill for three legs of pork - he took two away first; he was gone about five minutes - he then came for the other, and told me to wait there for there was a gentleman coming to ask me the price; he then took the other leg away. I waited twenty minutes; he did not return - I went back to my master's, and asked for the other two legs, but found it was a trick - I saw him again next night, and am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Should you have left them with Hocker - A. Yes, if I had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your master told you when you came here not to say that you should part with it without the money - A. Yes; he did tell me so - he did not threaten to beat me; my master certainly did tell me before I left the shop with the pork, that I was not to leave it without the money.</p>

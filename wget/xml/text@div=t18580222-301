                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 161). I was on duty in Whitechapel on the morning of 17th Feb.—I heard a cry of police, I ran to the place, and found the prosecutor and the two prisoners; Brown was stooping over the prosecutor, apparently in the act of robbing him—I took him into custody—Brian had a tussle with the prosecutor, and got away from him; he made a kick at him once or twice—I cannot tell whether he struck him—as he ran away he picked up Brown's cap, which he had dropped—I took Brown to the station, and four or five minutes afterwards Brian came back with the cap and said, "Policeman, he has done nothing, let him have his cap "—I recognized him, and told a constable to take him into custody; he ran away, I sprang my rattle, he was pursued by another constable, and brought back—I am sure he is the person—about seven or eight minutes previous to their attacking the prosecutor, I saw them cross the street within about fifty yards of the spot—I knew them both by sight previously.</p>

I am a boot maker—I was coming from Sadler's Wells theatre, about half-past 12 o'clock on the Tuesday night, and saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor and Brian in a scuffle together—Brown put his head in the prosecutor's chest, and threw him down on the ground—thinking it was a common street row I did not pay much attention to it; but as the policeman was proceeding with Brown to the station, Brian, to the best of my belief, but I cannot swear to him, came up with a cap, and he was pursued and brought back.</p>

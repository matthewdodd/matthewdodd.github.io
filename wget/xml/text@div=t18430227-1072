                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, and have a house at Ilford, in Essex. I had a pear-tree growing in my garden a year and a half ago—it was taken up by the roots, and carried to my yard—I did not miss it—I was told it was gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 63.) On the night of the 16th of Feb. I was on duty near Ilford—I know Biggs—I saw him that evening, with another person, whom I did not know—they were carrying a piece of a tree—out, "Biggs, what are you at?"—they both ran away, and left the piece of the tree behind them—I got assistance, and took it to the station—I took Biggs at his father's house the same night—I am sure he is the man.</p>

Q.</hi> He said he knew nothing about it, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I saw him with the tree he was about six feet from me—there was an iron pallisade, about six feet high, which prevented my laying hold of him—it was seven o'clock at night, but it was not dark—there were two gas-lights, about fifty yards apart, and he had to run past one of them—the fence was six feet below my feet—I was above it—I could not get over it—I was about sixteen yards from Biggs.</p>

I have worked for Mr. Tyler—I remember the pear-tree that was grubbed up—I should know the trunk of it well—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—from my knowledge of the wood of that tree when it was growing, I can undertake to say that this is part of that tree—I know it by cutting the branches off myself, and the marks I made on it at the time, and here is the mark of a trellis fence that it laid against—I am sure it is a part of Mr. Tyler's pear-tree.</p>

I know both the prisoners well—I remember, on the 16th of Feb., being at a beer-shop, where the prisoners were—we were very joyous and singing there—Joyce, asked me if I would go with him after a piece of wood—I refused—my brother was outside the house—he did not come in—I left the house at the time the prisoner did—we went together just outside the door—we then parted, and the prisoners went away together, towards Ilford, and towards Mr. Tyler's—I bade them good night, and told them to mind they did not get <hi rend="italic">cotched.</hi>

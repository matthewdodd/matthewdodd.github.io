               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Stark, it was on Tuesday the 15th of October when he was robbed, the prisoner came to my master's shop, and asked for Stamford, a taylor; I told him there was no such person lived there; then he asked if my master was at home? I told him no, then he told me to go and ask my mistress, and I left him standing at the door, and I went into the parlour to ask my mistress, and I returned from the parlour, I saw him running out of the shop with a parcel under his arm; I followed him and cried out stop thief! and he dropt the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300037"></xptr>things down in Castle-street; I picked up the goods, and laid them on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the parcel afterwards? - They were taken and packed up in a piece of paper; I have had the care of it ever since, I have got it here now.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these articles laying? - In the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you last see them before he came in? - They laid on the corner of the counter, and more with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know them to be your master's property? - I knew them to be in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and see if that is the man that came into the shop? - I am sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him after he went out of your shop? - Only while he turned round Castle-street, but I am sure he is the same man.</p>

               <p>I am a shoemaker. On Tuesday morning the 15th of this month, I heard a cry of stop thief! I see the prisoner run and drop a parcel; he ran across the way towards me and I took him, he ran down Castle-street; I did not see him in Mr. Stark's shop; the boy picked up the parcel, I saw him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am certain they are my goods, I can swear to the particular pattern of the muslinet; I am well satisfied they are all my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing further to say than that I would be glad to serve his Majesty, either as a soldier or a sailor; I have had people here for my character but their business called them away, and they could not stay any longer.</p>

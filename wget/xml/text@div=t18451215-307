I received directions, and went near Ainsworth's house, at West Ham—I watched his premises till the 28th of Nov.—on the morning of that day I saw the two prisoners come out of his house in company—I followed and watched them to a coal—wharf at West Ham Abbey, belonging to Mr. Tanner—I saw them get on the roof of a coal-shed, and commence ripping and tearing the lead out of the gutter—they threw the lead they had ripped, down on the ground in two lots—they then came off the roof, and carried it to Ainsworth's house—I saw them pick it up, and carry it openly before them—I followed and watched them into Ainsworth's house, which is fifteen or twenty yards from the building the lead was taken from—I then got three other officers; I placed two of them at the back of Ainsworth's house—I and Wilcox went in at the front-door—I found the two prisoners at the back of the house—on seeing me they each took a bag under their arm, and threw them into a ditch at the back of the house—they ran away, but they were taken—I observed where the bags were thrown, and took them up—they contained this lead—I took it to the building, and found it to correspond.</p>

On the 6th of June the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for a lace horse-shoe and a remnant of lace,which came to 2s. 10d. - she paid me for them. An officer, who was in the shop, charged her with taking a piece of lace - I saw him find it in her apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I believe she had her apron in one hand and her money in the other. It was possible for a piece of lace to hang to her apron if she leaned on the counter.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in the shop-the prisoner was looking at some lace in a basket. She stood with her apron against the counter-the piece of lace was between her and the basket. I saw her look both ways, then put her hand to it, and drew it under her apron; after which she rolled it up in her apron, and went as far as the door. I told her she had something which did not belong to her; she said she believed not. I found the lace in her apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember being before the magistrate yourself - A. No; I was sent for, and said I would go on Monday, but could not. It was about a charge that was taken last Easter. A man had been gambling - I searched him, put the money on the table, and the other officer took it up; I did not keep the money. I have paid it out of my own pocket, but I never had it.</p>

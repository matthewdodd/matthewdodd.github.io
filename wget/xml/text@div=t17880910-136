               <p>The Indictment was opened by Mr. Partingon.</p>
               <p>And the Case by Mr. Fielding, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, my learned friend, Mr. Partington, has put you in possession of the charge now exhibited against the prisoner at the bar; you perceive therefore, that the capital crime of forgery is now imputed to him; and to be sure, it would be mispending time to gentlemen of your appearance, if I were to dwell long on the importance of the paper credit of this kingdom, and consequently on the consequences of the real detection of forgery. The prosecutors are Messrs. Drummond; and from the relation they stand in to the public, they are especially called upon, whatever expence it may be to them, to prosecute this indictment. - Some time in 1787, a Mrs. Newton lodged at their bank the sum of 170 l.; this 170 l. was again paid by the Drummonds to orders that apparently came from her. - In the month of June last, Mrs. Newton having occasion to pay a small bill to her wine-merchant, she gave an order to Mr. Smith to carry to Messrs. Drummonds, expecting that that note would be honoured as the others had been. - When the person applied to Messrs. Drummond, that note was refused, the clerk telling the person then, that all the effects were expended; in consequence of this, Mrs. Newton having got early intelligence of the refusal of her bill, the next day she went to Messrs. Drummonds to know the reason; when there, the clerk, to her astonishment, informed her, that all her money was expended; and producing a heap of notes, to the amount, I think, of 13 or 14, shewed her that the money had been paid upon notes bearing her name; she was extremely alarmed, declaring at that time, that the signature was not of her writing, but that there was some forgery or gross imposition. Gentlemen, I have set out with this history of the transaction, because that will lead to the immediate discovery of the forgery; and why the suspicions are fixed on Mr. Vaughan, the prisoner now at the bar. It happened on the very day that Mrs. Newton went into Mr. Drummond's house, that she was seen to go into this house by a person whom I shall call to you of the name of Quarrington; Mr. Quarrington being there, was extremely desirous to say something to Mrs. Newton; what was said, it will not be fit for me to say, as I am regularly apprised of its not being fit evidence for a court of justice; they had much conversation, and at last, when Mrs. Newton was going again into the shop of Messrs. Drummonds, another person appeared, of the name of Johnson; they behaved in a manner reputable to themselves; they were very desirous that punishment should not fall on some other person; their behaviour also indicated a desire that guilt might not fall on themselves. The Messrs. Drummonds sent to Mr. Bond of Bow-street, who I believe very obligingly gave them his attendance; there it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100159"></xptr>discovered from the evidence of Mr. Quarrington and Mr. Johnson, that this very note had in the term preceding the month of June, been delivered into the hands of Mr. Johnson by the prisoner; that as he was coming from Westminster Hall, he delivered to him this note, desiring him to get cash for it at the Drummonds, and to return with the cash to him at the Salopian coffee-house; this was the evidence of Mr. Johnson at the time, and Mr. Quarrington happened to be present at the place, when the prisoner and Mr. Johnson had removed from the coffee-house, and there, in the presence of the prisoner, Johnson informed Mr. Quarrington what he had done for Mr. Vaughan; this will corroborate Mr. Johnson extremely. Mr. Quarrington before the magistrate, informed him of all the circumstances, namely, that on the day when this woman went to the house of Messrs. Drummonds, that he himself sitting in a coffee-house, had accidentally, seen Vaughan go past in a hackney-coach, and from the hackney-coach he gave him a letter; which letter, as it will be produced to you, and as it will be for you to give it its application, I shall take the liberty of stating it:</p>

               <p>"My dearest and only friend, every</p>
               <p>"reliance is put in your exertions; but at</p>
               <p>"the same time must recommend caution</p>
               <p>"and guardedness, for you know who we</p>
               <p>"have to deal with; restitution must be</p>
               <p>"held out as a salve to the sore: I need</p>
               <p>"not say more. Johnson will tell you</p>
               <p>"where I am."</p>
               <p>Mr. Quarrington being informed of these circumstances, and Mr. Johnson informing him that the prisoner was the man that delivered him the note, of course he became chargeable as the publisher of this forgery; Mrs. Newton looked on the note; she declared that was not her writing, therefore so far as the evidence went before the magisrate, it was compleat. - This is the short history of the transaction; now it will become me to state to you a little what you are to expect in the course of this prosecution; I must necessarily, in order to substantiate this charge, call before you Mrs. Newton herself; she now keeps a coffee-house on the Surrey side of Black-friars bridge; she did formerly keep a coffee-house called the Lincoln coffee-house; this woman and the prisoner had a long intimacy; it is but fair that I should say. that this woman's character does not stand perfectly free from the imputation of immorality; this man has lived with her and cohabited with her a considerable time: therefore, when you see a woman of that description before you, as she will not deserve that credit from a jury which is due to a witness of another description; therefore of course, you will look with considerable deliberation to her evidence; at the same time I premise this, there are circumstances which will equally call for a particular investigation, If in consequence of this cohabition, and the knowledge he had of her pecuniary affairs; if again, in consequence of the imbecility of her mind and the ascendancy he had over her, he has done this; then there is a degree of aggravation, in proportion to the degree of intimacy between them: therefore, gentlemen, as this will be the case of Mrs. Newton, I think it proper I should apprise you of the evidence you are to expect. Again, I must call before you Mr. Johnson himself; now it is but fair to apprise you here, that as Mr. Johnson is the man, and was the man who carried this note to the bankers; he of course would first stand chargeable as the publisher, suppose there had been an immediate detection there; therefore, this evidence again, you will view with the same caution; at the same time I am sure you will look at it with all that nicety of investigation which you can exercise to Mr. Johnson's conduct on the immediate discovery; his explanation to the magistrate of his being there, not at all wishing to evade justice, or to escape himself; then you see the materiality of that circumstance I stated to you before, the confirmation he will derive from Mr. Quarrington; and when the prisoner acknowledged most compleatly all that Johnson had done in the day, it will furnish that sort of clue which is always satisfactory; for speaking of distant transactions,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100160"></xptr>without assigning a reason for their accuracy, is always attended with dissatisfaction. One of the material circumstances is this; when they met in the evening, Johnson informing Mr. Quarrington he had that day received seven pounds for Vaughan, and had then given him the money; then you see that Mr. Johnson, the witness I must necessarily ca to you, will stand exactly in the predicament I have before described, and confirmed essentially by those circumstances of Mr. Quarrington, as to the manner in which he behaved before the justice; and that behaviour before he will repeat to day. Mr. Quarrington will tell you, this was the behaviour of Vaughan; what has been said by Vaughan to them, it is impossible I can be apprised of; I take it for granted, that when they stand here on the solemnity of their oaths, they should tell the whole truth. Mr. Quarrington will inform you, he received this letter from him; therefore those three will be the material witnesses on the occasion; the situation of those parties is such, that I can but expect when the woman stands before you, the most effective cross-examination must take place, from the ingenuity, and the properly exerted ingenuity of my learned friends; if this woman has at any time given him the authority to sign her name for that purpose, God forbid that I should urge this prosecution any further; Messrs. Drummonds will be satisfied, and I shall be satisfied, by that exercise of candour, which at all times becomes people of our profession: if that was under her authority, then of course there is an end of it; but at the same time I shall take the liberty to suggest to you, if you suspect he has made use of the opportunities he had, and that this woman did not give him that authority, then he is guilty. Gentlemen, the circumstances you will attend to are these; of her going to the house, certain it is, when this woman went to the house she expected a considerable sum of money there; certain it is, she took these notes at that time or forgeries, whatever may be the state of hers mind since, or who may have been about her; it was our duty to bring the prisoner before you; if it be a forgery, she has a right to the money. I am sure the public may expect, with great confidence, that verdict which the case deserves.</p>

               <p>Continuation of the Trial of Shaftoe Vaughan.</p>
               <p>What was the purpose of your going there? - For some cash.</p>
               <p>What happened at that house? - They shewed me some drafts that I had no knowledge of.</p>
               <p>Among the drafts so shewn you, was that presented to you? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Look at the signature there; (looks at it) is that your hand writing? - No.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The draft read.)</p>
               <p>"21st of November, 1787.</p>
               <p>"Pay the bearer seven pounds, for your</p>
               <p>"humble servant,</p>
               <p>S. Newton.</p>
               <p>"Messrs. Drummonds and Co. Charing-Cross."</p>
               <p>You had at the time when you lodged your money with Messrs. Drummond, I suppose, an accountable receipt from them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you sign your name in the book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you sign your name there? -</p>
               <p>"S. Newton."</p>
               <p>Do you know whose writing this is? - No.</p>
               <p>After you had received these notes, there were thirteen or fourteen notes that were shewn you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>None of them, you said, was your writing? - No.</p>
               <p>At that time, did you see Mr. Quarrington, or Mr. Johnson? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went with Mr. Quarrington, where? - To a public house.</p>
               <p>Afterwards you went again to Drummond's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did you see Mr. Johnson? - At the door.</p>
               <p>When was it that Drummond sent for Mr. Bond, the justice of peace? - While I was at Mr. Drummond's house, I was introduced to Mr. Bond.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100163"></xptr>Was Mr. Johnson and Mr. Quarrington there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they examined? - I do not know; I was in the room first.</p>
               <p>Did they come into the room voluntarily? - No, sir, Mr. Bond ordered them in.</p>
               <p>How many drafts do you recollect to have drawn on the Drummonds, during the time they had your money? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you keep copies of the drafts? - I did, but I lost them at Hick's-hall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Mrs. Newton, you are well acquainted with the prisoner, and have been for a number of years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe, as to the coffee-house you keep, the wine licence was taken out in his name; there was that degree of intimacy between you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he living in the same house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This money was put into the Drummonds' house, some time in July 1787? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was part of the produce of the sale of some goods of yours from the Lincoln coffee-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe the defendant accompanied you, when you lodged this money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were sold by Mr. Murrell, and he paid the produce of that money into the hands of Mr. Vaughan, by your desire, as your agent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaughan, I believe, has for these five years transacted all your business? - He has.</p>
               <p>He has been very largely intrusted by you? - Yes, to several hundreds; I am a very bad scholar myself; and Mr. Vaughan did every thing at my request for me.</p>
               <p>Has not he signed several papers for you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have not you requested, that he, as your agent, might sign papers for you, as like your name as possible? - Yes, sir, S. Newton; I write so bad myself, I did not like to sign my own name.</p>
               <p>How many drafts on your bankers may he have signed for you? - I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. To be sure, gentlemen, this makes an end of the capital charge.</p>

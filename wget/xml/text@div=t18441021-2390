                  </hi>. I am a constable of the West India Docks. On the morning of the 28th of Sept., about eight o'clock, I stopped the prisoner, took him into my box, searched him, and asked him where he bad picked up this tile of copper, which he had got concealed under his clothes, slung to his back, over his loins, with a piece of twine—he said he picked it up against one of tile privies on the south side of the Export-dock—there was no copper there—I took him to the dock police-office, then went on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Sir Charles Napier</hi>, and in the hold of the vessel I saw tiles of copper of the same description and the same mark—I compared it with the piece in question—the vessel laid within the docks.</p>

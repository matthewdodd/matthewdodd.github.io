                  </hi>. I am a tailor, at 25, Duke-street, Aldgate—the pri<lb></lb>soner came to work at my house—he was there about the 18th of last month—he was there about two months; not exactly in my employment—he used to be downstairs, to do anything—on 18th May I sent him on an errand—he did not come back—I never saw him again till I saw him in custody—I missed a Crimean medal and a coat—I missed a good many things before that—I did not take any notice of it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the coat I missed—it was hanging on a row in the bedroom when the prisoner went on this errand—that room was not locked up—he could have gone there if he wished—I have not seen the medal; it was in a little tin-box in the drawer, in the same place where the coat was—my wife had the medal in her hand that day—I also saw the coat the same day—I know this to be the coat I lost; I told all the marks that were on it before I looked at it—it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The Sunday I was taken at Victoria-park there were two witnesses with me that knew where I bought the coat, but I was taken to Arbour-square-station, and it was too far for them to go—I did not know where they lived.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 371). I was on duty near Victoria-park about half-past 6 on Sunday evening, June the 1st—from information I received I took the prisoner in custody for stealing a coat and Crimean medal—a friend of the prosecutor's saw him in the park, and followed him out—he was wearing the coat—I told him he must go with me to the station for stealing a coat and a medal—he spoke to the party who gave me the information, and said he could not prove it—he gave me an address—I went to his lodging, but he had left there about a fortnight—he lodged there for about two nights, but left about 18th May, the time the robbery was committed—I cannot find the medal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Two witnesses saw me give the money down for the coat. I do not know where they live; it was just after I had done work</p>

               <p>at Billingsgate-market, and going through Petticoat-lane, I bought it there. At the place I was at they gave me a bottle and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to go and get some brandy; they used to give me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and when I had done a hard day's work they used to give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I broke the bottle, and went down to Billingsgate. I had not been there fire minutes before a man asked me if I would carry some winkles for him to Smithfield; I said I would, and I never went back to the other place any more. I left Cohen's lodging-house because they said it was going to be broken up, and I lodged at 64, Wimpole-street, Spital-fields. When the prosecutor's friend met me I was against a new drinking fountain; he asked me about a medal first, and never about a coat. He asked me if I would walk down as far as some house. I said I would. I had a pipe, and when we got out of the house he said, "Oh! there is the gentleman; I will go over to him." I said, "I will go with you," and then he gave me in charge to the policeman.</p>

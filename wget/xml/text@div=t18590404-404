On the evening of 3d March I was sitting in the shop—it opens into the road—my husband was also sitting there—a man dressed in soldier's clothes came in; it was the prisoner; it was a little after 9 o'clock, he said, "Let me look at that watch again"—I had not seen him before—my husband reached a silver watch from the window, closed the door, and then gave it into the prisoner's hand—the prisoner asked the price of the watch—my husband told him it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said, "Can't you take 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it?"—my husband refused—he then offered 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my husband said he could not take it—the prisoner said it was a great deal of money, and he should have to work forty-one days to earn that—he asked me if I could persuade my husband to take less—I said I had nothing to do with it—he then said, "Take that and nothing;" at the same time striking my husband a terrible blow on the head, and he rushed out of the shop with the watch in his hand—he struck my husband</p>

I am a surgeon—on the evening of 3d March I was called in to attend the prosecutor, a little after nine o'clock—I found him in the back parlour, faint and exhausted from haemorrhage—it proceeded from a lacerated and contused wound in a longitudinal direction over the superior and posterior portion of the frontal bone, about an inch or an inch and a quarter in length—such a wound might be produced by a blunt instrument of the character of this stick—his life was considered in danger at the time—he has in some degree recovered now, but not wholly so.</p>

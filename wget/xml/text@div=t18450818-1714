                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Ratcliff-highway. The prisoner was in my service—it was his business to take money for anything that he sold—I charged him with having sold a truss for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 30th of July, and not giving me the money—he said he had sold the truss, but it was his own property, and he offered to give up the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know of any trusses that he had.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 30, Richard-street, Commercial-road. I went to the prosecutor's shop on the 30th of July with my husband—I paid for the truss to the young man who was in the shop—I cannot swear to him—the truss was taken from out of the window.</p>

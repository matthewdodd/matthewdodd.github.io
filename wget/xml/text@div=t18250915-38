               <p>JOHN NEWING. I am single and live at Tilbury-fort. I came to town about eight o'clock in the morning of the 25th of June and went to Spitalfields-market. I met the prisoner who was a stranger to me about eleven o'clock in the forenoon - she passed me several times in Whitechapel; she asked me to follow her, which I did to a house in <placeName id="t18250915-38-crimeloc206">George-street, Whitechapel</placeName>

I had 70 l. in 10 l. notes, two sovereigns and some silver - the notes were in my trouser's pocket, wrapped up together, and the pocket was buttoned - there was no other person in the room. I gave her two half crowns,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150021"></xptr>and buttoned my pocket again; after we had been on the bed together about two minutes, I felt her hand about my pocket, but I could not tell whether it was inside or out; as soon as she had got it, we heard a knock at the door, she said "I have got a friend with me;" there was another knock, and she got up and went away - I missed my money immediately. I saw her again in about a fortnight, and can swear to her. I went to Lambeth-street Office, and gave information - the money could not have fallen from my pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. What did you come to town for? A. To get money. I was sober - there were no other girls with her.</p>

            . I am a fruit salesman at Spitalfields-market. On the morning of the 25th of June, the prosecutor came for his father's account. I paid him in seven 10 l. notes and two sovereigns; he came back in about two hours and said he had been robbed.</p>

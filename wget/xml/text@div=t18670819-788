                  </hi> I am a jeweller, at 188, St. John Street Road—on the 8th August the prisoner came to my shop and purchased a ring, for which he paid me—after that he selected some goods and asked me to allow him to take them to a lady customer to show them, and he would either return the goods or the money within an hour—I asked his name—he said, "My name is Barnett, 83, St. John's Wood"—I said, "Do you know a gentleman there who keeps a curiosity shog? "—he said, "Yes, he is an intimate friend of mine, Mr. Lazarus"—then I let him have the goods, and he went away with them, but did not come back—on the fol<lb></lb>lowing day I went to the curiosity shop, and afterwards to 28, Victoria Terrace, where I saw the prisoner—I asked him why he did not come back with my goods—he said, "Oh! the goods I left with the lady"—I said, "Where does the lady live? "—he then said, "I made a mistake; I left them with Mr. Shepherd"—I asked where Mr. Shepherd lived, and he then said, "I sold the goods and made use of the money"—these three stones (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>. are a portion of the property I let the prisoner have.</p>

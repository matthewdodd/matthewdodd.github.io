            . About April, last year, I was in the habit of leaving my son in care of the bar; he was then not eleven years old; when my payments became due I found I had not the money I expected, but did not know how it went; the prisoner was in the habit of coming to my house; his mother has sent him for things - he lived near.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you miss your money? A. Chiefly about nine months ago - I received the letter three or four months ago - I did not mention it to my son till then - I showed him the direction of the letter, and asked if he knew the hand-writing; he said he did not - I showed him the signature; he said he knew that; he burst out crying, and said he had been robbing me; he wrote down the boys' names, which were also in the letter, but he had not seen them; he never saw more than the signature of the letter, and he does not now know the contents; here is the letter, it is signed by Dean - I know he had paints - I had given him the money to buy them - I found he had pistols and powder in the garret; he said one of the pistols was the pot-boy's,(Burkins) who denied it; the only person who spoke to me about him was Goner - I do not think I told him not to let boys drink there - I found a few seals in his possession.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about four years - I first gave him money about Easter twelvemonth, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; I was in the bar at the time; the first time he came, he said he was in great distress, and if I would lend him 1s., he would pay me the first he got - I said I could not, it was not my property, but at last I gave him one - I took it from the till; he saw that; he came again next afternoon, between six and seven o'clock, and said if I did not give him 1s., he would tell my father I had robbed him, and I did it for fear he should tell; he saw me take that from the till - I saw him several times on the same business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before your father received the letter had the prisoner been to you? A.About three months - I was out when the letter came; my father, when I came in, told me to get a sheet of paper to write down every farthing I had robbed him of - I did so, to the best of my recollection; he showed me the direction - I did not know the writing; he then showed me the signature, and it was Dean's; he showed me the letter, and I read it myself - I read what I was charged with then in the letter (looking at it), and this is the paper on which I wrote what had I taken; the largest sum is 25l., and the smallest 2d.; my father took me to the Thames Police next day - Stapleton gave me a box of paints - I never had any other - I had thirty or forty small seals, a few watch-keys, and a knife - I gave them back to Stapleton; Berkins gave me a horse pistol - I never had any other - I did not ask Berkins to say they were his pistols.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that your father only showed you the signature, and not the other part of the letter? A. Only the signature - I did not know the contents when I wrote this paper; after I put down what was in this paper, I read the letter.</p>

             offered to give me a watch, a box of colours, and some money, if I would say they were mine: Stapleton used to come every morning, about seven o'clock, for half a quartern of gin in a bottle - his friends lived close by; he was a very good boy.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you always in the bar? A. Yes, or about the bar; I had to clean the shoes and the tap-room - I was there eleven months, and he came every morning.</p>

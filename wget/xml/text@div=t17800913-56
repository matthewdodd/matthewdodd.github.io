               <p>I am a constable. On the 19th of May I went down to Battlebridge to take an account of nuisances. About six o'clock in the morning the prisoner and a man was at the Maidenhead at Battlebridge, drinking tea; I went in and they were talking about a fire in Great Russel-street, Bloomsbury. I saw them examine some things they took out of a bundle; there was a ring which is here.</p>
               <p>Did they do that in your company? - No, I sat, and had a pint of beer at another table; they were saying that they had been at the play over night, and as they were coming back in the morning they saw a terrible fire in Bloomsbury. The man pulled out a book with an ear-ring in it, and said my dear, is not this a diamond. She said I think it is. When they had had their tea, they had no money to pay for their breakfast. The man pulled out a medal and sold it to the landlord for their breakfast; the landlord allowed them eighteen pence for it. I staid till they had got their breakfast; and then stopped them on suspicion of a robbery. On searching the prisoner and the man I found some letters on each of them; they were directed to No. 5, Great Russel-street, Bloomsbury. I took them to New Prison, and by the direction I went to No. 5, Bloomsbury, I saw the house had been on fire, the next door was No. 5. I took the prisoner to Sir

               <p>What did you find on the prisoner? - Here are two purses, one is a green one, the other a crimson coloured one; there was another purse with a crooked halfpenny in it, a pair of round robbins, as they call them; I do not know one from the other; she said before Mr. Addington, at Sir

She said she stood down stairs;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130060"></xptr> that she never was up stairs at all; that just after he came away and across the street; she saw something under his arm, and asked what he had got there? He said I will show you by and by, my dear. That then they went to Copenhagen-house; that the people were not up there; then they came down to Battle-bridge.</p>
               <p>Did she say who the man was? - She said she did not know him before that night; she said they had not examined the things till they came to the Maidenhead at Battlebridge, where they breakfasted; I did not hear them say anything about the things; when they pulled them out at Battlebridge they were looking at them. When he took the letters out they looked at one of them; she snatched it out of his hand and said, This letter came from my friends in the country.</p>

               <p>As I was walking early in the morning, the man overtook me; when we got to Battlebridge he said he had been ill of a fever and asked me to go in and drink; I went in and drank with him; he had a bundle; I did not know but it was his own property. As we were drinking the constable came in, he was shewing me a ring, and asked me if it was a diamond one; but how he came by the property I know not. I never was near the fire nor knew nothing of it till he mentioned it at the publick-house.</p>

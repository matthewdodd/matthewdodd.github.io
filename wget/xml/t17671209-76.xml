On the 30th of October the prisoner came when I was licking the dog because he would not go under the cart, he asked me what business I had to beat him; he said, you dog you shall not beat him; presently I heard the pia of the tail board fall, I ran behind to see if my master was there, I found the rope was cut; I saw the prisoner with a basket under his arm, running cross the road as hard as he could; I ran and said, where are you going with that; he said, you dog, what is that to you, if you have more business than I, I'll soon let you have it; he canted it at me, I believe intending to knock me down; I called stop thief; his hat fell off, and he was stopped in Leadenhall-street by two butchers; he was but just out of my sight when taken; I had hold of his coat when he flung the basket down; I know the prisoner is the same man, this was about six at night; (the basket and things were produced and deposed to)</p>

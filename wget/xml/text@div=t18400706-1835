                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my aunt, in Adam-street, Manchester-square; the prisoner lodged in the attic, and had done so for three weeks. At five minutes before twelve o'clock on Wed<lb></lb>nesday the 24th of June, I went down into the kitchen, and left on the table in the parlour my bonnet, shawl, gloves, and my purse, which con<lb></lb>tained four sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, two half-crowns, and four shil<lb></lb>lings—I went up stairs in about ten minutes, and missed my purse and its contents—I do not know whether the prisoner was in the house at that time—I went up to the first-floor, to Miss Sowerby, and made inquiry of her and the other lodgers—about half-past five o'clock the prisoner came home—I was in the parlour—I asked him to come and speak to me—he said, "Very well," but he still kept going up stairs—I followed him—he got into his room two or three minutes before me—the door was ajar, and I went in—he had his hat on, and a stick in his hand—his other hand was in his portmanteau, and I heard the jinking of money—I asked him what time he went out in the morning—he hesitated some time, and then said, "When the bell rang"—I understood by that the chapel bell, which com<lb></lb>mences at eleven o'clock—he asked whether any thing had happened—I said, "Nothing particular"—I made no charge then—Miss Sowerby fol<lb></lb>lowed me to his room—I then left his room, and told Miss Sowerby not to let him go till I got a policeman—he might have heard me say that—I went out, and when I returned I found him at the street door, Miss Sowerby had hold of him by the collar, and he was struggling—he got away, and ran as fast as he could down Adam-street, into Manchester-square, and as far as Duke-street—I followed as fast as I could, and saw two young men stop him—I said there was a purse missing, and he having gone out, there was great suspicion attached to him, and I wished him to return—one of the young men asked why he ran away—he said, because he was fright<lb></lb>ened—he was brought back and given into custody—(he paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a</p>

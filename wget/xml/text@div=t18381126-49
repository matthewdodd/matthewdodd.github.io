                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the St. Katherine's Dock steam wharf. On the 20th of June I received this order by the Twopenny Post—I handed it to Mr. Wright, a clerk in our part of the establishment, in due course—Mr. Dale contracted for the cartage of the respective Steam Companies who used the wharf, and the prisoner Barker was delivering foreman and clerk to Mr. Dale-all orders for the delivery of goods would pass through his hands—he would in the performance of his duty have an opportunity of seeing the different trusses and bales brought by vessels, and of seeing the marks, &amp;c. on them—it was his particular duty to look at them, and examine them with the manifests of the vessels, to which he had access—he would have an opportunity</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could he, without producing this book, take away any goods without any check by you or the clerks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly net, without producing the book, because the goods must be entered in the book—he must produce the book to me, or some clerk, with the entry of the goods to be taken away-no goods can go out of the Dock without such entry being shown to me, unless fraudulently taken away-if a bale was stolen the order would not appear in the book-unless forcibly stolen: away, they mutt appear in the book.</p>

M. Van Bergh, London"—till we received another manifest with other goods, with Mr. Van Bergh's address on it, we could not deliver it—a great many people could not have seen the truss on the wharf—we do not allow people to go there—the clerks of the wharf might see it, but not the messengers or porters, only the warehousemen—this particular bale was housed in the warehouse—it did not hay on the wharf twenty-four hours before it was housed.</p>

M. Van Bergh, London," giving a corresponding mark to that on the bale—the warehouse-men had the putting of the truss into the warehouse from the wharf—the parties connected with the Dock itself, have nothing to do with the steam</p>

               <p>wharf, except those employed there—there are no other steam companies at this wharf except those for whom Dale is employed as carrrier—he is the sole carman for the steam companies, but many merchants send their own carters, or hire carts, and they take goods on producing orders—Dale is the only contractor with the steam companies for the removal of goods-nobody but Barker has access to the ship's manifests to compare them with the bales, and see if they are proper to. be delivered-if this order had been personally delivered it would have come to me—I open all letters, and hand them to Wright, who hands them to Barker, and he would order the goods to be put into Dale's cart, and send them away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If an order was brought for an article not requiring a cart, might it be taken away on the shoulder without Barker's knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yet—Barker's knowledge was confined to Dale's conveyance, by which it would go, unless there was an order to send it by another conveyance-an order forwarded by post for general delivery would necessarily pass through Barker's hands.</p>

M. Van Bergh, to J. Southgate, packer, Old 'Change, I truss, I V," in a diamond-"No. 1. 2 cwt 1 qr. 6 lbs. free," and signed "R.

Collins"—I saw Barker give the delivery book to Abrahams-four trusses had been delivered to the address of Mr. Van<lb></lb>Bergh, about the 12th or 13th of the same month—I saw those trusses, and saw the address on them—they are also entered in this book-the. entry is in Barker's handwriting—the place of abode of Mr. Van Bergh is entered as "72, Leman-street, Goodman's Fields"—I know the ship's mani<lb></lb>fest—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—here is "I.

I pawned one piece of merino for him on Snow-hill—I do not remember the pawnbroker's name—it was in the evening, I think in July, and for a sovereign I think—I pawned another piece of the same merino in Newgate-street—I do not recollect that pawnbroker's name—I do not think I pawned any more myself—I left one piece with Gregory, and asked him to pledge it, and there were some pieces cut into lengths, two or three of which I sold Mrs. Gregory—I have seen Samuel Fletcher write—I have an I O U of his by me now—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this is Fletcher's, sen., writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>)—I do not think this is his—I cannot tell whose it is—these are the two duplicates for the merino I pledged—(<hi rend="italic">produced by Lea</hi>)—I cannot pick out the merinoes I pledged from the piece which went to Gregory's—I think this is the piece that went to Gregory's—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the merino</hi>)—I remember being at old Fletcher's, at Temple Mills, about the 10th of September, in the evening—he said that he had had a letter from Yorkshire, that his son George was taken up by the high-constable—he had the letter in his hand—I asked him to let me see it—he told me "No," and burnt it, and desired me, if I had any of the goods about me, to take them away immediately.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> These two pieces of merino produced by Scott, are our manufacture, and left our warehouse on the 1st of June last—they were part of the twenty pieces sent in the truss for Mr. Van Bergh, with the initial I have described—this other piece, produced by Warren, was part of the same truss of goods—the private number has been pulled out, but on looking at it through the light, I can see where it was, and the tab is cut off that produced by Scott—it would be sold with the tab in the ordinary way, but what we call the private picking, which is three pieces of cotton in the end of the piece remains—these two pieces are not in the state they left our premises-both those produced by Scott are the same—these produced by Walter are part of the twenty pieces—there is part of the tab remaining—this produced by Frances is also one of the pieces, and here is the thread-mark drawn out, but the impression left on the tab—this piece, found at Tibbs's, is the same quality, and this, found at Gregory's, formed part of one of the twenty pieces-here is the private picking-mark—we sold this merino for 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece, delivered free in London—it cost us in the grey state 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. we pay for dyeing black, which is 41<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

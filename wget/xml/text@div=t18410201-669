                  </hi>. I am a bedstead-maker, living in Clifton-street, Finsbury—I am in partnership with my son Edward—the prisoner was our apprentice. On Friday morning, the 8th of January, about eight o'clock, I came down stairs to breakfast, and left the prisoner at his bench in the shop on the ground-floor—in about five minutes I heard the street-door shut—I spoke to Newton, who I had left in the shop, about it—he said it was William—I went up—I found the prisoner—I asked where he had been, and where was the wood he took out—he said he had not taken any—I sent my son for a policeman, and gave him into custody for taking some<lb></lb>thing out of the shop, I did not know what—about ten o'clock at night, Featherstone brought these pieces of wood, which are called cornice laths—Idid not see them in the shop when I went down to breakfast—they are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they are unfinished—I have a great many about—I am sure they are ours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to the prosecutrix. I was in the shop when my mistress went down to breakfast—the prisoner went to the fire-side, and took this wood from behind some other wood there, and put them into the entry, then opened the parlour shutters, and went out with the wood—he returned in about two minutes—I told my mis<lb></lb>tress—Iknow these two pieces of wood—there is a mark of glue on one.</p>

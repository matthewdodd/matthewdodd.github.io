I asked him what he wanted for it; he said he had sold some at 2 d. per pound; I put his bundle of paper into the scale, and it weighed 12 lbs. I bought it of him for 2 s. I asked him where he came from; he said from Mr. Taylor's, Printers'-court, Shoe-lane, and that it was the perquisites of the boys, for cleaning out the office, which was to be pulled down for the new market, and that the money was to be divided among the boys. The overseer came on the following Wednesday, and I gave him the paper.</p>

I said I did not want to have any hand in it - he said I was a fool; he took some of it at dinner time himself, and gave me half the money. After that, he gave me some to take, and I took it and sold it - I gave him half the money.</p>

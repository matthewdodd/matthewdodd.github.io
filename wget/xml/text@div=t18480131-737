                  </hi>. I am a draper—the prisoner Mary was in my service about two months. On a Sunday evening, after she had been there a month, she went to Church—directly she was gone I missed the property, and found some piece of velvet, and two baby's caps, in a small box in her bed room, and on the following Sunday morning I found various other things in the same box—I got a policeman in private clothes, and told him to follow her when she came out of the house in the evening to go to Church—the things were then gone out of her box, and I told him to take het is charge—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine, and have my private mark on them—they were found on her, and were taken out of my shop—she begged of me at the office not to go to her sister's—we went to the house where Louisa was in service, and asked if she had received presents from my servant—she said she had never received anything—I asked if she had received any velvet—she said she had—I gave her in charge—I found these remnants of silk, merino, and various things, which are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 8, Stamford Street—on the morning of 30th January I passed through the toll-gate at Waterloo Bridge, and the prisoner looked at me very hard, and followed me down the Waterloo Road, when he passed me and crossed over, and I lost sight of him till I got into Stamford Street, when I heard somebody running behind me—I turned my head, and the prisoner seized me by the throat, caught hold of my chain, broke it, and ran away with part of it—I was with Isabella Russell, who I understand is dead—she was quite well that night—I got a letter from her in the hospital—I lost sight of the prisoner,</p>

                  </hi> (92 <hi rend="italic">L</hi>). On the morning of the 29th January I was on duty in Stamford Street, and heard a cry of "Police! I stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner running away from the prosecutrix and another female—he was about fifty yards from them when I first saw him—there was no one between them and him—I stopped him and said, "What have you done?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You must go back with me and see what it is"—I took him back and met the prosecutriz, who said, "That is the man"—he said that he had not touched her, but she said that he laid hold of her throat and almost strangled her, and snatched her chain with his other hand—I found no chain on him—but I saw that the prosecutrix's chain was broken—part is here—where I stopped him the prosecutrix could have seen him, but she seemed very much frightened—I went to Guy's Hospital on Saturday, and was told that Isabella Russell was dead, from jaundice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am innocent. I was going up Waterloo Road, away from Blackfriars, and she was going towards Blackfriars, and yet she says I came behind her and snatched her chain. I never touched her or interfered with her at all. Both the women were laughing all the way to the station, and therefore it is not likely that any violence was used.</p>

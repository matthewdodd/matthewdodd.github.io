            's; she said she had all these things of the prisoner at the bar; I went by her directions to Chelmsford, and at the Crooked Billet there I met with the prisoner; I told him the woman had been to town with some goods and was stopped, and had given an account of him, and we were come in search of him, as there was a suspicion that he had broke Mr. Russel's house; when we came out at the door, the prisoner immediately ran away; we overtook him and secured him, and carried him back to the Crooked Billet; there we found some shirts and the gold-laced hat, the same as has been produced here; when we got him into the coach to bring him to town, he said he was not the first, and hoped he should be the last that was brought into a snare, but as to the woman no person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176805180010"></xptr> could hurt her. The second time he was examined was on the 27th of April; there was farther discovery made; then I was sent down again to the Crooked Billet, there I found the boots and spurs belonging to White.</p>

             in Poorjury-lane, he asked me where I was going; I asked him if he had any money that he could spare me; he said he had none, but he would get me some; he asked me to carry these things to the Red Cross betwixt Stratford and Bow, and he would give me 18 d. I carried them and left them there, and had half a quartern of brandy, and left it to him to pay when he came for the things; I went home, and was asked if Buck had given me any money; I said, no; I said, I had got some things which he should not have till he gave me my money; this woman and I went there, Buck never came; I asked the landlord to let the things be there; he said it would be more convenient for him that we take them away, so I gave her one bundle and I carried the other; we took them home and kept them several days; he not coming, we opened them and took some of the things out; I believe Mr. Russel can give me no bad character for all the time I lived with him, please to ask him my character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russel. When the prisoner was my porter at first he behaved very well, but the last six or seven months he was with me, he behaved ill; I dismissed him, and ordered him never to come within my gates.</p>

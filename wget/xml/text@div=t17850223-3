               <p>On the 24th of January, about a quarter past twelve at night, I was robbed near Chelsea, I was returning to Ranelagh where I live; I was going home from town, opposite the New Spring gardens, in <placeName id="t17850223-3-crimeloc14">Ranelagh road</placeName>

               <p>How long might they be with you altogether? - About the space of two minutes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was very light, remarkably light, it was light enough for me to see to read my papers.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - Yes, bright moon-light.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was it? - It was the 24th of January.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing the persons of these men, so as to know them again? - Very distinctly, my Lord, I took particular notice of them, when they left me I saw a watchman at a little distance, and I made haste to call him; and I told him I had been robbed by five foot-pads, and I desired him to join me in the pursuit of them, and he came, and we went after them directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230014"></xptr>Had they got out of your sight? - Yes, they were but just out of sight, we made the best of our way; we came to the first watchman on this side the water-works, we called and asked him, if he had seen five men whom I described, he said, they were just gone on before; then we came to Buckingham gate and asked the guard, and he said, they had just turned up Petty France; we pursued them till they came near the Broadway, there were two or three more watchmen then, and we came in sight of them in the Broadway; I was apprehensive if we pursued them they would take up different streets, I desired the watchman to spring his rattle that they might be surrounded; when I went close to them I gave the charge, there were other people that were there, and four of them were taken, the other made his escape.</p>
               <p>Did you so observe the persons of any of them, to know them again? - Yes, I knew them then, and pointed them out to the watchmen.</p>
               <p>Do you know them now? - Yes, there are three of them stands there, and this little man, Russell, is the man that fastened round me, he is dressed different; I know both the others, they all assisted, I am perfectly clear in that man that is ill, his name is Thomas Wiggan; I am quite sure of the person of this man, I am equally clear of all.</p>
               <p>Can you in a transaction that took up two minutes, and in the hurry and confusion you was in, undertake to swear to the persons of four men whom you never saw before? - I am very clear in it, I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing remarkable in the faces or persons of any of them, that you knew them again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If they had got from you clear that night, had you observed them so that you could be able to know them afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You think you should have known them anywhere? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were any of them searched after they were taken? - They were taken to the watch-house, and searched in my presence.</p>
               <p>What was found on each of the prisoners? - My two pair of gloves and a guinea, was found on James Wiggan, I cannot swear to the guinea.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon Russel? - The pen-knife and buckle, and part of the stock.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon Thomas? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Any thing on Joseph? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your shoe-buckles or knee-buckle? - No, they were examined before a Magistrate the next morning, I swore to them positively then.</p>
               <p>What did they say? - They made no sort of defence.</p>
               <p>What Magistrate were they carried before? - Justice Abbington, in King-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>When they were taken were they all four together? - There were together, and one was a little distance.</p>
               <p>Which of the three were taken together? -

             was taken by himself.</p>
               <p>Which was taken first, the three or the one? - The three were taken first, but they were all partly together.</p>
               <p>When you first got sight of them, were they all together? - They were at some distance, we sprung the rattle on purpose to see if it was them, we could not be so clear.</p>
               <p>How far was you from them when the rattles were sprung? - Forty or fifty yards, I suppose.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by springing the rattle to try if it was them? - In order to come closer to them, as that would prevent them from separating; and when I came to them, I thought I should see if it was them.</p>
               <p>Were they altogether when you first sprung the rattles? - I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Recollect as well as you can? - They were at such a distance I could not perceive whether they were altogether or not.</p>
               <p>Were there other people in the street? - Not just at that time, I did not see any in the street at that time.</p>
               <p>Did you observe and take four men that were together, or take the first four men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230015"></xptr> that you could lay hold of after you had sprung the rattles? - They were together, I saw them four together, I am clear in that; one of them attempted to run away, that was James, the rest did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Council. Pray Mr. Bowden, the persons who robbed you got out of sight, while you was looking for a watchman? - I was not long looking for a watchman.</p>
               <p>I wish you would not look so much to consequences, but give direct a answer? - I saw a watchman directly, they were out of sight before the watchman and I came together.</p>
               <p>How long might it be, before the watchman and you set out upon your pursuit? - I suppose about four minutes.</p>
               <p>You never got sight of any four or five persons till you came to the Broadway, Westminster? - No, we did not, we heard they were just before.</p>
               <p>At Buckingham-gate you were told, that in such a direction, there were such a number of persons? - I was.</p>
               <p>The moment you got sight of three, four, or five men, you desired the watchmen to spring their rattles? - Most certainly.</p>
               <p>You did it in order to try by certain symptoms, whether they were the men that robbed you? - No, Sir, no symptoms, but that I might discover whether they were the men or not.</p>
               <p>Did not you spring the rattle to try if they were the men? - I was pretty certain.</p>
               <p>Then you was not before satisfied that they were the men? - No man could tell.</p>
               <p>No man could tell! Sir, I will have an answer to every question I put to you; you were not satisfied before, that they were the men? - I was satisfied by appearance but I could not see their features; I was better satisfied when I saw them.</p>
               <p>I ask you before you sprung the rattle? - I was not satisfied then.</p>
               <p>What was the fifth man doing at the same the others were robbing you? - There were three of them employed about me, the other two were holding me and standing by.</p>
               <p>What were they dressed in? - They were dressed in brownish coats, different colours.</p>
               <p>Some lightish, some brownish, and some darkish, I suppose most of them had lightish colours; had they round hats? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Something roundish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they all stand in front of you? - They were all in the front at first.</p>
               <p>It is a plain question? - They were all in front at times, they did not stand still all the time.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them before? - I do not know that I ever saw them before.</p>
               <p>You are equally positive as to them all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This transaction took up about two minutes? - A little more.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, knowing that these mens lives are concerned, that in two minutes under the alarm of being robbed by five men, that these are the men that robbed you? I took particular notice of them.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear it? - I do.</p>
               <p>You do; it is not common for Council to press it so; was you always of the same opinion? - I was always of the same opinion, never had any doubt.</p>
               <p>They never were committed on suspicion? - They were twice examined.</p>
               <p>They never were committed on suspicion, you gave a positive charge, and they were positively committed? - Yes, they remained for another examination, in expectation of other charges, I gave a positive charge.</p>
               <p>Did you attend at the second examination? - I did.</p>
               <p>If you had given a positive charge at the first, what was the purpose of your attending on the second? - I did not see the first commitment.</p>
               <p>Then I see it now, here in the calendar,</p>
               <p>"detained on suspicion of robbing you; was there any other charge the second time? - I was examined the second time, then they were fully committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230016"></xptr>I observed a singular sort of a smile about you as a prosecutor, when you told us that four were taken, and that you knew nothing about a fifth; now attend a little, have you never said, that you knew who the fifth man was that robbed you? - I never saw him since.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you knew him, Sir? - I should know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Have you never said, that you have seen him? - No, I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you knew him, I will repeat it till midnight, till I get an answer?</p>
               <p>Court. The question is this, have you ever said to any body that you knew the fifth man that is not taken? - I do not know where he is.</p>
               <p>That is not an answer, have you ever said to any body, that you knew the fifth man? - I believe I have said so.</p>
               <p>Who did you say so to? - I do not know particularly.</p>
               <p>Have you said so to many people? - It is a subject I have not talked much upon.</p>
               <p>Then to whom have you said it? - I do not remember talking about it.</p>
               <p>Why you told me just now, you believed you had said so? - I do not know where or when.</p>
               <p>Do you know who the fifth man is? - If I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Do you know who he was, yes or no, upon your oath? - I cannot know his name, I never saw him before, I should know him only by seeing him again, I never saw him either before or since that night, as I remember.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you any reason to believe that you ever saw the fifth man before or since you was robbed? - I have no reason to think that I have, I do not recollect any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am a little more in this secret than my Lord is, and therefore he will pardon my going on, do you recollect saying who he was? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you never said who he was? - Yes, I could not say who he was.</p>
               <p>But did you? - I never did say it.</p>
               <p>Never to any body? - Never to any body, I never could say it.</p>
               <p>Have you said it? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Have you ever said he lived in your neighbourhood? - No, positively.</p>
               <p>Have you never said, that you was afraid to go out, for that he lived in your neighbourhood? - No, never.</p>
               <p>How many men were in sight when you and the watchman came first in sight of the men in the Broadway? - I take it there were four or five, perhaps not so many, I could not distinguish.</p>
               <p>May be only three? - Yes, there were more than three, there were four or five.</p>

               <p>Did you know the maker's name on it? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you had it? - Three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Do you know the stock-buckle and piece of the stock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark on the stock-buckle? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark on the stock? - No.</p>
               <p>Who wrote those marks that are now upon it? - I believe I wrote it at the Justice's office.</p>
               <p>For what purpose? - I am not sure, I did not know there were any marks upon it.</p>
               <p>Have you any remembrance that there was any marks upon it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then why did you say that you believed you wrote it at the Justices? - I put no mark but at the Justices.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether any thing is written upon it or not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you remember the Justice desiring you to put a mark upon it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to tell me now that you did not know whether it was marked or not? - I know the stock perfectly well; I have been long used to the buckle, I have often had it in my hands.</p>
               <p>Have you observed any thing remarkable in it? - No.</p>
               <p>Now I have observed something remarkable in it, by which I think I should know it? - I had my buckle for a year and a half, the buttons of it are flat.</p>

               <p>I am a constable and beadle of Saint Margaret's parish, I was in the watch-house that night, and about a quarter before one the four prisoners were brought in, and the prosecutor and watchmen came in with them, the prosecutor charged them with a robbery, I asked him what, and I said we will search them, he said before we searched them, he had lost a stock buckle and some gloves, a knife, a pair of shoe buckles, and a knee buckle, he did not mention what gloves, he said two pair of gloves and a guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man has been in the Court during the whole trial.</p>
               <p>Cary. The prosecutor did not say what sort of gloves they were; James was searched first, and there was found upon him two odd gloves and a good guinea, and a bad guinea, and ten shillings and six-pence in his breeches pocket, that was all that was found upon James; the good guinea was found in his coat pocket with the gloves, and the bad guinea and the ten shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230023"></xptr> and six-pence in his breeches pocket: we next searched Russell, and we found in his waistcoat pocket a stock-buckle and a piece of a stock to it and a penknife; we searched the other two but there was none of the prosecutor's property found upon them.</p>
               <p>What account did the prisoners give of themselves? - James said he was a gentleman, I then said we will search him first, while we were searching him, Russell went to the further part of the watch-house and sat down, I did not search the watch-house till after he was gone, but I went after and I found this pistol, they did not say much for themselves, as for the other two prisoners there was nothing of the prosecutor's found upon them; he said he had lost two pair of gloves, the watchman went out and found two other gloves.</p>

               <p>I live in Newman's Row, in Lincoln's-inn-fields, I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Bowden? - Mr. Bowden the currier, I believe it might be a dozen or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>When did you see him last? - The last time I saw him I believe was on Tuesday last; he told me on Tuesday to the best of my recollection, that he was going to Clerkenwell to find a bill against some people that had robbed him; I was mentioning the matter to a person in our neighbourhood, one Ashley.</p>
               <p>When did you communicate to Bowden what passed between you and Ashley? - On Monday morning I spoke to Bowden, and told him the circumstance, that there were people that were very willing to pay any expences, or words to that effect; Bowden consented to that, provided he could be secured from the laws of his country taking hold of him, and his expences paid, he was very willing not to take away the lives of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>What was he to have? - Two hundred and fifty pounds, he did not ask it, but the gentleman who came along with him, told him in my hearing, that it would cost him one hundred and seventy or one hundred and eighty pounds, as he was bound over; that Mrs. Bowden was likewise bound over in forty pounds, to give evidence against them on account of the stock, which made it five: Mr. Bowden said it was so, and after this Mr. Ashley who was the person who first mentioned it to me, took me to the gentleman in Bridges-street, and Bowden was very agreeable according to the advice of his friend, to take it and keep out of the way: I asked Mr. Bowden if he would agree to be out of the way on the receipt of two hundred and fifty pounds, and when I mentioned the matter Mr. Bowden said it was so, and he must have something for his expences, and he would go to Bath or Bristol during the sessions.</p>
               <p>What was it Bowden said about the two hundred and fifty pounds? - He did not say two hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>He assented however upon terms that were talked of, to be out of the way? - He agreed to go to Bath or Bristol.</p>
               <p>Was that the reason that he did not prefer his bill on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. If it was, what then?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If it were true, it would go a great way against the credit of the prosecutor, who had first accepted it, and now has denied it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230024"></xptr>Was there any conversation about attending a suit in chancery? - Yes, Mr. Bowden sent a person off in my hearing to the Sessions-house at Hicks's Hall, to acquaint the people that he could not attend, having a cause in the Court of Chancery.</p>
               <p>Did Bowden say at all what he was to have, or what he was to do? - He said, he would go off that evening for Bath or Bristol, provided I brought him the money, and more over than that, the money I was to give him, I was to put it in a room; and he was to take it.</p>
               <p>What money was you to bring to Bowden? - The money I was to receive from Andrews.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any authority from any of the prisoners to make this proposition? - I had not, that I am clear in, I had seen none of them, nor none of their friends.</p>
               <p>In consequence of this you went to somebody or other, for the purpose of getting the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you get the money? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see Bowden afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - The same day, and the next? I told him that Mr. Andrews had sent to the gentleman on Poultney-hill, I believe his name is Kidney, and Mr. Ashley brought me for answer, that Kidney would see Andrews, and appointed four o'clock; then when I had told him that, he sent to the Sessions-house, to tell the people he could not meet them that day, for he had a cause in Chancery.</p>
               <p>Did you get the money? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see Bowden after that? - The next day he called at my house in the forenoon; I told him I had heard nothing of Mr. Andrews, or the parties, and I should not give myself any trouble about it.</p>

               <p>What did Bowden say to that, when you said, you should trouble yourself no more about it? - He said, he was going to Hicks's Hall, that was on the Tuesday; I have not seen Bowden since.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowden. You have heard now, the evidence that Mr. Powis has given? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to deny it? - I have an evidence, Mr. Allen that was with me at the time; I think it is very proper he should be heard.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Is this, that Powis has said, true? - No.</p>
               <p>What part of it is false? - I called on Mr. Powis about some business, and he asked me to step down stairs with him; and he asked me as he was acquainted with some of the friends of the prisoners, if he could get me indemnified against all expences, whether I would appear against them; there was nothing about Bath or Bristol proposed; but if this gentleman, Mr. Allen, was present, he would be an evidence.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowden. If this evidence of Powis's is false, and Mr. Allen is not present; you know what to do.</p>

               <p>HANNANEEL DA COSTA sworn.</p>
               <p>On Sunday the 28th of July, I desired to be reminded that I had a draft to pay for 220 l. to be sent from Messrs. Hankey to Mr. Blands, and desired a draft might be wrote, and left in the banker's book, and that I might not go out the next morning without signing it; on the next morning when I came down stairs, I found the prisoner already in the compting house, he reminded me of this draft; I asked him if any of the other clerks were come, he said none, I said then it is time enough to sign it; the clerks usually come about ten, this was a little after nine: he came a second time and reminded me of this draft to be signed, and I told him to stay; he came a third time, and said he was going to fetch some bills, which had been left for acceptance on Friday, and was going by the door, and would carry that; on which I signed it, and gave it to him to place it at Mr. Blands, to whom I had made it payable: I went out, I did not tell the prisoner to receive the draft in banknotes, nor did I say you must nor receive it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell him either to leave the note at Blands, or to get the money and carry it to Blands? - He asked me no questions, and I cannot tell but it was one or the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it that it was the intention of your mind that it should be so, or did you tell the prisoner in words that he should do one or the other? - It is usual in the mercantile line, to send drafts to one banker to receive it at another.</p>
               <p>Court. But there was nothing upon the face of the draft itself in which Bland was any way concerned, therefore it must be by your positive orders that he must do one or the other? - I gave him no positive orders, the word money was never mentioned; I think I might say, take this draft and carry it to Bland's.</p>
               <p>Are you certain that nothing passed from you to the prisoner, which imported that he was to carry either the draft or the money to Bland's ? - Positive.</p>
               <p>Should you know the draft again? - Yes. (The draft read.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you have got most of the money again ? - Seventy pounds; the first I heard of his being taken was from himself, that the major part of my property was safe, and that he had left the remainder with his wife; I have had 70 l.</p>
               <p>The other I believe is safe ? - I should hope so.</p>
               <p>It is in the hands of some officer or gentleman ? - It is in the hands of the court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant in the Central Bank of Perth, in Scotland. On Saturday, the 10th of Aug., I received from Mr. Burns a letter—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is it—here is some writing on the fly-leaf of it—the letter contained Bank post-bills, bills of exchange, and checks—I com<lb></lb>pared the bills with the writing on the fly-leaf, to be certain the bills men<lb></lb>tioned there were in the letter—I gave the letter with the bills to Mr. Rogers, another clerk, to have them endorsed, and the letter copied—it was returned to me—I then compared the Bank post-bills, bills of exchange, and checks, with the particulars on the fly-leaf, and found they corresponded—I inclosed them in the letter, which I handed to Rogers, to have it posted—it was di<lb></lb>rected to Messrs. Glynn, Halifax, and Mills, bankers, London—we were apprised in the course of post that it was not received.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman plumber, and live in Kings-gate-street, Holborn; I am employed on the water-closets at the Post-office. On the 12th of Aug., in consequence of directions I received, I went near the water-closets, and placed myself in a situation to enable me to see the whole of them, with Peak the officer, at a quarter to six o'clock in the morning—I was in a situation to see four of the water-closets, and if I moved could see the other two—there is a gas-light directly opposite the closets, so that I could see who went in and out—there is no door to the closet—Peak was about ten feet from me—the closets are beneath the letter carrier's office, on the base<lb></lb>ment, at the end of the kitchen—they are self-acting water-closets—when a person sits on the seat, he fills the box with water above his head, and when he rises, the seat rises an inch, and the water immediately rushes into the basin—there are two gallons in the box, and it leaves one gallon in the basin—when the person rises, it carries down whatever is in the basin—I saw the prisoner enter the closet at ten minutes past six—he was the first person who entered that closet while I was there—I could see distinctly what he did—he tried the closet twice, to see if the water would flow, by sitting down with his clothes buttoned up, and rising up—he then unbuttoned his clothes, and sat down, put his hand into his pocket, and took from it a letter or paper—he then put his bead down to listen, to know if anybody was coming—I then saw checks and Bank-notes in his hand—he commenced examining them, and put some of them underneath him in the closet, with his right hand, into the pan—he then rolled up the letter, or paper, in a round ball, and put that in the pan—I then communicated with Peak, and he ran round and took my place—I took my station again—the prisoner was then examining papers—I directly heard a struggling, then ran round to Peak's assistance, and found him on the prisoner, holding him down on the seat—I put my knee on the seat, to prevent the water flowing into the basin—Peak pulled the prisoner off the seat—I then called for a light, put my arm into the basin, and took out two letters, some bills and checks, and gave them to Peak—the prisoner said, when he rose from the seat, "You cannot hurt me now"—he was taken into custody—they were struggling together in the kitchen.</p>

Glynn and Co., a Bank post-bill for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and altogether post-bills and securities to the amount of 670/.—he was taken to the solicitor's office, and the letter shown to him—he was told he was charged with stealing and breaking it open that morning—he said he had broken no letter open—he lives at No. 141, Golden-lane, St. Luke's—I had seen him at that lodging on the 22nd of July, and then he said he had no money at all.</p>

Glynn and Co.'s letters would be sorted to No. 10.</p>

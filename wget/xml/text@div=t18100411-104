On the 8th of March he asked me if I wanted any change, I told him I did, and gave him a pound note, and received of him the change, I returned him a bad shilling he gave me; he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out two half crowns, and five or six shillings; he gave me another shilling for the bad one. Upon seeing him have so much money it struck me it could not be all his own. At night I counted all the copper in the till, I did not lock the till that night. In the morning I gave him the key out of my bed room to open the shop, and light the fire; I came down sometime afterwards and missed ten-pence. On Thursday night I marked all the copper money that was in the till; fifteen shillings of new penny pieces and halfpence, and eight shillings of old copper, and left the till not locked. On Friday morning I gave him the key, as I did the other morning, I came down in about a quarter of an hour; I sent him up stairs for something while I counted the money; I missed one shilling and eleven-pence halfpenny of new copper, and seven-pence halfpenny of old copper; I called him down stairs, told him to bring forward the money that he had taken out of the till that morning, I had missed two shillings and seven-pence; he hesitated, and pulled out a canvas bag containing two shillings and eleven-pence of new and old copper; he told me that was the money he had taken, and a few loose halfpence he had taken out of his pocket, and put into the bag. I then told him to take out what he had got in his pocket, he took out a one pound note and eleven shillings and six-pence in silver, and a small red leather purse, he said he had bought it with my money, and the money he took that morning he was going to buy a pair of stockings with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any character with this boy - A. No; he came out of the country; it was the first place he had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked me when I came down stairs to give him all the money, and he would have no more to do with me; I gave him the money, and he knocked me down. I sold a watch that I bought myself for one pound eighteen shillings; he took that money from me.</p>

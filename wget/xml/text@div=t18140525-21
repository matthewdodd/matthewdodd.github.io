I asked the prisoner what he was going to do with the clothes; he told me he took them from a man, and was going to deliver them to me, the moment he saw me. I took the prisoner by the collar, and took him into the servants hall. I took the clothes from him, and laid them on a chair. The case was made known to Sir

               <p>Q. Could any body have gone in without your hearing them that length of time - A. I should hardly think any body could have been there. He said, a man had knocked him down, and he had taken them from him. If that had been the case, I must have heard some kind of wrestling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where the man knocked him down - A. In the area. If any thing of that sort had happened, I must have heard it. I was not the distance of ten yards from there all the time; every thing was quiet at the time.</p>

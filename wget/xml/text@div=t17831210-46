               <p>Mr. Reeve, Prisoner's Council. How do you know that? - There was no other way for any body to get in, there was company in the house, I did not hear any particular noise to suspect any thing of that sort, one of my servant girls, who is not here, went up into the room, it is a bed-chamber facing Duke's-court, and upon her informing me I went up stairs, there is a case of drawers in the room, and I saw one of the drawers taken out from the case, and laid empty on the bed, the sash was down, but not fastened, and the door shut; it did not appear how any body got in, I was at this drawer about fifteen minutes before, I cannot say whether it was locked or not, the things mentioned in the indictment were missing, the window is about nine feet high, the room door was locked, and I had the key.</p>
               <p>Then how did the maid get in? - I gave her the key a minute before, I have two papers which were in the pocket-book, which were found in a publick-house in Downing-street, I have none of the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>What leads you to suspect the prisoners? - I should not have suspected them for it, but when I came down stairs again, I went to the door, and there were four men standing in the court, who informed me of them.</p>
               <p>Are any of them here? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeves. Do not you know these two men the prisoners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They frequented your house? - Yes they do.</p>
               <p>Do not they belong to a club at your house? - Yes they do.</p>
               <p>Are they not very decent respectable men? - I know nothing ill of the men, I say nothing against them.</p>

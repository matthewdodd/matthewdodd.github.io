               <p>Q. What day was it this happened - A. I cannot tell the day of the month, nor the day of the week; it was last month, the constable has got the day down. It was near six o'clock in the afternoon, Steadman came in and asked to look at some lace that I had in the window, Gray came in while I was shewing Steadman the lace, she asked for a pennyworth of shirt buttons; Steadman said that she would not take the lace then, she would ask her sister first; I told her that it was half a crown a yard. As I was putting the lace in the window again I saw

             lift up a velvet bonnet that was on the counter and take something that was under it; Steadman then said she would have the lace; I took it out of the window, and went round the counter to look for what was gone, and missed the velvet that was under the bonnet. The velvet belonged to a lady, and the velvet bonnet was for a pattern, it was to be made like it. Steadman went away without the lace; I stopped Gray and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do any thing to the other prisoner - A. I saw her bustle close up to her before Steadman went out of the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the velvet - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was it - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoners before - A. Yes; on the evening before they were both in my shop, Gray had a pennyworth of shirt buttons, and Steadman had a halfpennyworth. I know

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to Mrs. Dowling's on Friday the 15th of March, I apprehended Gray, I searched her and found nothing on her; Mrs. Dowling said there was another woman with her, she went away; I took Gray to the office, and on the 23d I went with Read to a court in Whitecross-street, there we apprehended Steadman; she said first, her name was Williams; we told her we knew her name was Steadman; then she owned her name was Steadman.</p>

            . On the evening of the 15th of March Bly brought Gray to the office. From information, a week afterwards, we apprehended Steadman in a court in Whitecross-street, she at first denied her name was Steadman, I told her I was not satisfied, she then said it was Steadman. I searched her house and found nothing. I told her Gray said she was the woman that went with her to the shop in Albemarle-street, where there was some velvet lost,</p>
               <p>"Oh, said she, she has told of me, has she, now I'll tell how she lives, and all her family, they live by smashing," that is, passing of bad money. I took her to the office.</p>
               <p>Gray's Defence. I am in the bonnet making way, and having lost my place of work I went to seek another, and coming up Albemarle-street I saw a bonnet shop, I went in and asked the prosecutrix for work; I told her who I worked for, and the length of time, she approved of it. On the next Monday I went in again, there were several people in the shop, I waited for an opportunity to speak to the lady, and when these people were gone out of the shop, she asked me if I had taken a piece of velvet, or a piece of ribbon, I told her I had not taken either.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that this was on the Monday - A. Yes, on the blessed ensuing Monday; she insisted upon searching me; I told her she was wellcome, I did not come in with intent to rob her. I was searched, and what halfpence I had they took away; I was taken to Clerkenwell. I sent my friends to her, she said, if I would pay for the velvet, and the expences, she would not appear against me; I said, why should I pay for a thing that I am innocent of, I would rather stand my trial.</p>
               <p>Steadman's Defence. I am totally innocent; I never saw the prosecutrix nor the shop before this gentleman took me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She did not call on the Monday, and when she came on the Friday she never mentioned any thing about work. She sent her father frequently to me, I sent word that I had put it in the law, I could not do any thing in it.</p>

I ran out and missed them; from the information that was given me, I heard he had ran up Newman-street; I did not see him till I got into Gouge-street, Newman-street is very long; looking to the right I see the prisoner at the bar, with these prints on his shoulder; I ran up to him as fast as I could, when I saw him, and took hold of him by the collar, and I said, you villain, you have taken these prints from my door; a stand of coaches being high, I put him into a hackney coach, and took him to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen them? - I really cannot say, they were not put out of the door till eleven o'clock in the morning; I really cannot say that I saw them after that. These are the prints, I know them by the private marks on them.</p>

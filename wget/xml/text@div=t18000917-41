               <p>Q. Were they women's shoes? - A. Yes; she then took a pair and two odd ones, and under pre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170040"></xptr>tence of trying them on, put them between her shift and petticoat; I saw her do it; she only tried one on; she pulled it off again, and left it upon the floor; she said they would not suit her, and was going away again; I stopped her and shook her petticoat, and the three shoes sell from under her petticoat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. He told me at the Compter, if I would pay for the shoes he would let me go; I told him I should not pay for what I knew nothing about; he knocked me down in his shop, and used me very ill.</p>

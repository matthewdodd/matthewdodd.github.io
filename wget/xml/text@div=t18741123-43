I am foreman to the Dock Company at West Ham—on 6th November, about 5 o'clock, the prisoner came to me at the office, where I was writing at the time, and told me that a keg of tongues was broken open, and I gave him directions to put them in the dock so as to have them coopered, which he generally did if anything was broken in the warehouse—I did not see the cask myself—I did not tell him to take any of the tongues out and put them in a handkerchief—he had no right to take any of the tongues.</p>

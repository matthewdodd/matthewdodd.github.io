In consequence of information which I received respecting the gar<lb></lb>dens in that neighbourhood, I went down there on Monday night, the 5th of April, between one and two o'clock—I saw the prisoner in an allotment of garden-ground, stealing cabbages out of one Pope's garden—I went round the school-gate, and got over a fence into the garden where he was—I went straight towards him—when I got within nine or ten yards of him, he came out from the cabbages to meet me—he then made away from me, and I after him—I caught him, and asked what he was doing with</p>

On the night in question, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner in a field near some gardens, at the back of Hounslow—I said, "Halloa, what are you doing here?"—he said, "Nothing particular"—I said, "I think it is almost time you were at home"—he made no reply, and I went on—in about a quarter of an hour I heard Beechey call my name several times—I was a quarter of a mile off when I first heard him—I made towards him, and when within a dozen yards or so he called my name again—he seemed quite exhausted—he said, "Look sharp, he has almost killed me"—the prisoner said, "Yes, and I will quite before I leave you"—I said, "Hold</p>

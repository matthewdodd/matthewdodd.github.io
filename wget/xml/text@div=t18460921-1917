I live in Gibraltar—walk, Bethnal—green—I have known the prisoner about eighteen months—he dealt in sacks—he came to me about the middle of Aug., and asked if I had any sacks to sell—I said I had about 2000—they are called gunny—bags, and are made of hemp—he asked what I could sell them for—I said, when mended, at not less than 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—he told me to give him three as a sample, and he thought he could get an order for 2000—he called again next evening, and said he had got an order for them from Mr. Marshall, of Cross—lane—he was to give me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a doses—they were to be mended—I said I had not money to pay for mending them—he said he would lend me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and when I got my money I could pay him the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., back, and pay him for his trouble—I did not have the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I might have had it, but I requested him to keep it to pay the women for mending them—they were completed, and on the 31st of Aug. they went in on a wagon which I hired—the prisoner went with me with them to Mr. Marshall's stores, at Limehouse—they were delivered there—I did not get any money then—I saw the foreman in the prisoner's absence—I went again the same afternoon, with the prisoner, to get a receipt for the bags, because he said Mr. Marshall would not pay it without the receipt from the foreman—the prisoner told me the foreman produced the receipt—I went with him to Mr; Marshall's counting—house, in Cross—lane—he went in and came out again and told me he had to go again in two hours' time—he wished me to walk with him to his apartment to have some refreshment, I went, and he asked if I would take a drop of porter—he left the room, and said he was going for a pint of porter—he left the house—I waited half an hour, but he did not return—I then went to Marshall's counting—house, and learned that the money had been paid to the prisoner—they came to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I was to have paid him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he paid for the mending.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 108, Blackman Street, Borough—on Saturday, 22th May, at 2 p.m., I was sent for and saw Ellen Conway in bed at 9, Little Suffolk Street—she complained of being violently sick and of having a headache, I treated her and saw her again on the Monday, she was then insensible, and she died shortly after, before 5 o'clock, because I went there again at 5 o'clock and she was dead then—she had not complained to me of any blow, I only had to treat her for sickness and headache—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Wednesday—there were no external marks—on removing the integuments there was inflam<lb></lb>mation and an infusion of serous blood over the left side of the upper part of the head, and on removing the bone the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> was very much in<lb></lb>flamed, and there was a large clot of blood underneath which had set up inflammation of the brain and the membranes were very much inflamed—the cause of death was inflammation of the brain caused by the clot which was caused by external violence I believe—I am able to say that external violence which at the time produced no immediate effect will afterwards cause the brain to become inflamed and insensibility to come on—I do not believe that this inflammation and clot could have arisen from internal causes the other organs were not particularly healthy, but there was no particular disease—I believe from the appearance of the stomach and liver that she was addicted to drink—it is consistent with what I saw that the external violence which caused this might have been as long ago as Whit-Sunday, 18th May.</p>

Me and Ellen Conway were in there drinking, having a drop of ale; then while I was in there Mrs. Conway crossed the road into the Old Justice, and while I was in there a costermonger came along and took up the dog into Mr. Carpenter's, the Rodney Arms. I took the dog away from him and took it to my door, and he came and took up the dog and rolled it up on the barrow in some sacks and I took the dog away from him and he ran away and left his barrow because I wanted to know his name. Mrs. Conway said 'Let the man have his barrow as he wants to get his living," She felt quite angry at me making the man's barrow stop. Me and Mrs. Conway got talking, and one word brought up another, and I was going to bring the perambulators in, she said I should not do it, so trying to get the perambulators in she tried to take them away from me and I didn't strike her. She went to her work as usual till the Thursday and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050111"></xptr>
               <p>when I came home from dinner I found her lying in bed, and she said she felt very bad, and got worse on Friday and told me to go for the doctor and I sat up with her three nights. That's all I have got to say."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I left my employment I had my tea, and a costermonger came in from a beer-shop, took up my dog and took it away; and he came a second time and deliberately took it again. I followed Him and he ran away and left his barrow. Mrs. Conway was in the Old Justice having a drop of gin, I suppose with the two witnesses who had been in her company night and day; she could never go outside the door without some<lb></lb>one else to have a drop of gin. She said "Why don't you let the man go about his business; he has got his living to look after," and she seemed quite angry. I had taken in three perambulators previously and I took up-another. She said "You shan't take it in; they are my property." I said "It is 9.30 and it is too late to let them out any more." In the scuffle I took it up to lift it over her head. She was not so tall as I am and it did not touch her. I took that one in, and while I was doing so she sent a little girl for a policeman. I said "There is the policeman, what are you going to charge me with." The policeman came and I heard what she said to him and soon after that we had a drop more drink, and consequently when she was sitting on a chair close to the door she fell down between the chair and the door, where there was a broom and a square bit of hearthstone. I picked her up, undressed her, and put her to bed and next day she was outside and got drunk again, and the following day, and the following day again; and on the Saturday she got blind, speechless drunk and could not stand. She fell on her face over a piece of carpet and I undressed her and put her to bed. As to striking her I know nothing about it. They have done this to get possession of my house and home, and the same day while I was away they sold 15 or 16 perambulators, and there were a lot of people in the house. The little girl can prove that Mrs. Conway's son came and ransacked the place and said "Where is the bank-book." I had been to the undertaker for a coffin, and then somebody said that I went to the under<lb></lb>taker before her body was cold. They ransacked the house and took every<lb></lb>thing, and I had a little home like a little palace.</p>

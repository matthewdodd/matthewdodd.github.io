                  </hi>. I reside at 71, Union-street, Southwark, and am agent to Mr. William Jones, who is trustee for certain property bequeathed to his sister—I know the house, 7, St. Margaret's-court, Southwark, that is part of the property so bequeathed, of which Mr. Jones is trustee—it is in the occupation of a man named Dennis Clary—on 30th November I heard a fire had taken place there, and I went to look at the place to see what had been done—that was the day after the fire; I went into the top room of the house—I saw some shavings and straw lying about the place—s portion of it seemed as if it had been burnt, a little of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and rent the house 7, St. Margaret's-court, Southwark—I let the top room to the prisoner—there are only three rooms in the house, kitchen, middle room, and top—on the morning of 30th November, I went into that room occupied by the prisoner, with Mr. Indiman—I saw some shavings in the room, with slight signs of fire on some, and I saw a little bit of rag about—that was all—the middle floor of the house was let to some one else.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at 6, St. Margaret's-place, Southwark, next door to the house where the prisoner lives—on 29th November, a little before 2 in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come out of the house into the court—as he passed me he said, "You b----, I have done it, for I have set fire to the b----house"—in consequence of that I went outside and looked up at the window, and saw some smoke coming out of the top window—I gave an alarm to the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he near you when he made use of that expres<lb></lb>sion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was about two or three steps from me—he said it loud enough for me to hear him—he appeared quite drunk to me by the way he staggered out of the house.</p>

On 29th of November, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was on duty near St. Margaret's-court, Southwark—in consequence of information I received I went to No. 7—I saw smoke issuing from the top floor window—the prisoner was pointed out to me—he was in the court walking direct away, from the house, about ten yards from the door—I took him into custody, and told him he was charged with setting fire to the house—he said, "All right, governor;" I took him to the station—I sent for a fireman, and went with him into the room—that was after the fire was put out—I noticed a great quantity of shavings, and it appeared to me like a mattress strewed on the floor—I never saw any one in that room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he remanded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was, twice—he was taken to the station at night and put back till next morning, the 30th—the Magistrate said he did not think he was quite sober enough to have his hearing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

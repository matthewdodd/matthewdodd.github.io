                  </hi>. I am a hawker, and live in Gun-street, Spitalfields—about 12 o'clock, on the night of the 11th of this month, I was going home to my lodgings, and I met the prisoner in Gun-street—he deliberately struck me, and knocked me down—I became insensible—when I came to myself, I felt in my pockets and found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and two duplicates gone—they had been in my left hand waistcoat pocket—I had them safe five minutes before—these are mine (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On the 11th of this month, about 12 o'clock, I saw the prosecutor about fifteen yards in front of the prisoner—the prisoner went deliberately up to him on to the pavement, and struck him a violent blow in the mouth and knocked him down quite senseless—he then knelt on his chest, and when I went up to him I saw his hand in the prosecutor's pocket—I took him into custody—he said, "It is all right, he is a friend of mine"—on the way to the station I saw the prisoner drop something, and after I got him to the station, I went back and found these we duplicates, about ten minutes after—the prosecutor had been drinking—he was not drunk—I found eighteen-pence on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Gun-street very drunk; this man was lying on the pavement, and as I was coming by he knocked me down with his legs; I did not see him; I shoved his legs inside the pavement in case any body else might fall down, and the policeman came up and said, "I want you; I saw you knock that man down"—I said I would go to the station-house, and I did; the prosecutor then said he had lost fifteen shillings; they found nothing on me, but eighteen-pence of my own money.</p>

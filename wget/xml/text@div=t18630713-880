Sarl and Sons (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>), "Please to give the bearer our pass-book. London, 10/5/03"—in conse<lb></lb>quence of that I delivered Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Savory and Sons, silversmiths—about 11th May the prisoner called at their establishment, and selected goods to the amount of 946<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked to see watches and chains—he gave a cheque, not filled up, on the National Bank of New York, or something of that kind—for the first five minutes I considered him insane—he selected a ring worth 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a ruby ring at 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an emerald at 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he picked them up as if they were brass buttons—I thought it was a clear ease of insanity, and I took no further notice, merely pencilled the articles down on a piece of paper—I saw a jaws-book similar to the one pro<lb></lb>duced, on the counter, under the prisoner's hand—I could not see the name on it; it was upside down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was his manner very peculiar indeed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have had thirty years' experience with all sorts of characters, and I could almost read in his mind that he was not right—he did not appear tipsy, and I could only conclude that he was insane—they were beautiful gems; he could not have selected finer for an Empress—he did not call himself the Baron Adrian Robert to me—I did not bear him say he was a Baron—he did not attempt to take anything away with him—I laid everything aside on a tray, and then Funnell came in—the prisoner seemed to me not to be answerable for his actions—I had never seen him before, that I know of—he gave our cashier a cheque, I believe this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>), "Pay to Messrs. Savory and Sons, or order, the sum of (<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>). London, May 11th, 1862. To the Cashiers of the National Bank of New York. Baron Adrian Robert. Jerrard"—I had never seen a cheque on that bank before—that confirmed my suspicions that he was not right in his mind, though I felt quite satisfied before.</p>

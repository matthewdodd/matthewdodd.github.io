             to a public-house, in East-Smithfield, and found the two prisoners there, drinking a pint of porter, one was on one side of the box, and the other on the other; this band-box was on the bench, by the side of Broadbent, (producing it;) I asked Broadbent whose property it was, he said it was his; I then asked him how he came by it, he said he picked it up in Blackfriars-road, facing the New-road, near the chapel; I told them we were not satisfied with that story, and we took them into custody, and took them to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did White claim any part of the property? - A. No; he neither said or did any thing, but they appeared to be in company together.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Griffiths.) Q.Which way did you come from Epsom? - A. Over Blackfriars-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the straps cut? - A. Yes. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Griffiths.) Q. You apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of December? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the robbery was committed on the 26th of November? - A. So I have heard.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found these persons with the property in a common public-house tap-room? - A. Yes. (The property deposed to by Mr. Fletcher.)</p>
               <p>Broadbent's defence. I had been out of an errand for my father in the city, and returned home between eight and nine o'clock; coming down Charlotte-street, near the chapel, I picked up the property, tied up in this handkerchief, (producing one;) I went to the public-house that I use of an evening, and where Mr. White uses; I had mentioned there, that I had found such things, and White said, he thought he could find me a man to buy them of me; I had been with him to a Jew over the water, and he was to come to this house, and we were waiting for him when Mr. Griffiths came in with another officer, and took us.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Broadbent, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Griffiths.) Q. Were these things ever advertised from the office? - A. I believe they were in two papers, after the prisoners were taken into custody.</p>

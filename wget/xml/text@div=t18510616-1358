On 2nd May I was on duty at Barnet, about 10 minutes before 6 o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner in the street, driving about twenty sheep towards London—they were of different breeds—I asked him where he was going to take them; he said, "To No. 4, Portland-terrace, to Mr. William Johnson, a butcher, he has a house five miles on this side London"—I told him I was not satisfied with his statement, and asked if he had not got a note or a memorandum, to satisfy me that it was correct; he said, "No, they were bought at Stoney Stratford, on 28th April, by Mr. William Johnson; he is my brother-in-law; I was present when he bought them at a market"—on the road, about a mile from Barnet, I said, "Mind, I ask you, have you a letter?"—he said, "Well I had one," and fumbled about in his pocket-book, and said, "I have lost it"—I handed him and the sheep over to Goodman, who went to town with him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 70). I was at home, on 2nd May—Hawkes came and told me about the prisoner and some sheep—I went on, and overtook the prisoner on Finchley-common, with another man—he had twenty sheep, which appeared of different breeds and sorts—I joined him—he turned to me, and said, "Come on, brother drover!"—I said, "Where are you going to?"—he said, "Five miles on this side London, to Mr. Johnson, a brother-in-law of mine"—he said he had brought them from three miles on the other side of Stoney Stratford, but he had brought them that morning from St. Alban's—when we got two miles and a half or three miles further, to the Bald-faced Stag, he began to make inquiry if a Mr. Johnson lived in the neighbourhood—he was told that he lived a little further on, on the right—he said, "I am glad we have got here; I am tired"—he went to the place, and rang a bell which did not belong to the farm—the servant told him that Mr. Johnson's farm was further on, and pointed to the yard—the prisoner drove the sheep into the farm-yard, and was coming out—I said to him, "Had not you better acquaint Mr. Johnson about it?"—he said, "It will be as well"—I had asked a labourer if Mr. Johnson was at home, and he said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "I will go and see him"—he went on some distance towards the house, but not to the house, and he returned back to me, and said, "Mr. Johnson is gone to town"—I said, "That won't do for me"—I took him back to the house, and there saw Mr. Johnson—the prisoner said to him, "Good morning; I have brought some sheep for you"—Mr. Johnson said, "Where from?"—he said, "From three miles on the other side of Stoney Stratford"—I said, "You told me Mr. Johnson was a brother-in-law of yours"—he said, "Yes, he is"—Mr. Johnson asked him what day they, were bought—he said, on 28th April; that Mr. Johnson bought them at Stoney Stratford, in his presence, and sent him to drive them up—(he said the Mr.</p>

               <p>Johnson who sent him with the sheep was his brother-in-law)—Mr. Johnson said his brother was not there on that day—the prisoner made no reply—Mr. Johnson asked where the sheep were—I said, "In the farm-yard"—he went with me, and saw them—he said, "My brother would not buy such sheep as these"—I asked Mr. Johnson to let the sheep stay there while I went on with the prisoner—I went on to Highgate station, and told the inspector—the prisoner said if he might go on he could find the owner at 4, Portman-terraee, and he was to be found at the Mitre, at Lisson-grove—we went to the Mitre first—the prisoner asked the landlord if there was a Mr. Johnson who fre-quented the house—the landlord said he had no recollection of any such person in the neighbourhood, or using his house—I then took the prisoner to Portman-square—I said to him, "Do you think it likely that a Mr. Johnson, a butcher, would live here?"—he then took me by the arm, and said, "It is useless taking you any further"—he began to cry, and said, "The sheep are stolen; but they are mine, and my money bought them"—I cautioned him that what be said I must repeat—he said, "If I am transported I can't help it; I am regularly duped into this job; you will never find where the sheep came from, they came too far out of the country for that; suppose they came two from one drove and two from another"—he said, "I met with them three miles on this side St. Alban's; it is false what I said about their coming from Stoney Stratford"—he said a man gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to drive them up to London.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185106160078"></xptr>
               <p>and beer there—I did not compel you to pay for it—you proposed some spirits, and I said, no, you had had enough—I did not sit down on the form And fall asleep—I did not put handcuffs on you—I did not ask you to pay for the conveyance home—I believe, when I overtook you, I asked if the sheep were your own—I did not say, "I know they are your own"—I did not say, "We will have <hi rend="italic">a jolly spree</hi> when we turn them into cash"—I swear I never repeated such words—I never said, "I shall expect 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a crown for my trouble."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I met Hawkes, I told him if he had any doubt he should take me into custody, and bring me before a Magistrate, and then I should try to throw as much light on the subject as I could; but there was no evidence to prove that I stole them, or received them knowing them to be Stolen; I should be much obliged to the officer if he would state what he said; I told him he should have no direct answer from me; I said, "I don't think you have any right to stop me; if you have, take me before a Magi<lb></lb>strate;" he did not think proper to do so, but sent another officer with me; I have been remanded for seven weeks, and never had a chance to get any friends; I did not tell him that I was brother-in-law to William Johnson, nor that Mr. Johnson was the party that bought the sheep; he says that I said I saw Mr. Johnson buy the sheep—it is totally false; I have never seen the man, nor do I know there is such a man living; the officer was actually drunk when he came to me, and he insisted on calling at every public-house, and on my paying, as he was altogether incapable of taking care of himself or me; he said if I turned the sheep into money, he should like to go into the busi<lb></lb>ness of droving, for he thought it was better than being a policeman, he was tired of it, he could not get 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and I think that a man's liberty is not to be sworn away in that manner; I leave my case in your hands, and ask you if you have a witness to prove that I stole them, or knew them to be stolen.</p>

               <p>JOHN BUSH. I am in the employ of Messrs. Freshfield. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 22d of April, I was in St. Peter's-alley, Cornhill; just as I got into <placeName id="t18250519-189-crimeloc1088">Gracechurch-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18250519-189-crimeloc1088" type="placeName" value="Gracechurch-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you walking? A. Yes, and felt a twitch at my pocket; I turned round, and saw it thrown down; I had taken it out of my pocket five minutes before, in Cornhill. I took the prisoner immediately; there was no one else present.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the gentleman lost his handkerchief he turned round, and tried to lay hold of a boy before me, who threw down the handkerchief at my feet.</p>

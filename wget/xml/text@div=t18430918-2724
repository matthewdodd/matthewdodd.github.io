                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On Sunday, the 4th of Sept., I met the prisoner, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I took her to my lodging—I could not get in, and went with her—I told her I had no money, only enough to get a bed for myself—I had a sixpence and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—I said, "To-morrow morning I will pay you the rest"—I left the money on the table when I went to bed, and when I awoke, between five and six, she had left, and my watch was gone, which I had put under the pillow at night—my money was gone too, and a handkerchief from my trowsers pocket—this handkerchief, watch, and rings are mine—they are what I had when I went into the room—she had the handkerchief on when I saw her again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On this Sunday night I fell in with Patterson—I passed some time with him—we came out and met the prisoner—Patterson said, "Good morning, Ann"—she came up and said she had got a watch to pawn—I asked her to let me look at it—she did—I gave it her back—Patterson asked to look at it, and she was rather loath to give it him—he took it from her, and said he knew she had stolen it, he would keep it—we went into a public-house and had a pot of ale—they had no money—I paid for it—Patterson sent for a policeman, and then the prisoner sent for one, and then I sent for one—Patterson asked the landlord to hold the watch, he would not—he then asked me, and I would not—the prisoner and Patterson went out together—she said to him, <hi rend="italic">"Jack</hi>, you have known me before, let us go and pawn the watch, and I will give you some gin"—I did not hear what he said—they went into a coffee-shop, and he got out at the back door—the prisoner came to me and said, "He is a shipmate of yours"—I said, "I never saw him before."</p>

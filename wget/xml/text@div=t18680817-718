                  </hi>. I lodge at the prisoner's house—on the morning of the 3rd August, about 10.30, I went up Manning Street to post a letter—I met Kate May—she said, "Tell Madame and Tayon that I am coming round to give her and him a b—good hiding"—I then went back to the house, and about half an hour afterwards I heard a very loud rat-tatting at the door; it was Kate May—the prisoner went to the door, and she said, "You old b—, I have come for the purpose of giving you a good hiding"—I was on the stairs—she was very violent, and squared her fists at him—he had a bottle of some white stuff in his left hand, and the cork out of it—he was using it to clean a white dog that he had—she rushed past him into the room where his wife was very ill in bed, and during the time she was there,</p>

               <p>a young man came in, and struck Mr. Tayon on the mouth with his full force with his right hand—I saw the whole transaction from beginning to end—the prisoner did not strike her, or use any violence more than he could possibly help—he tried the same as I should have done myself, to push her out of the door into the passage—Mrs. Tayon got up from her bed, and took hold of May, and said, "For goodness' sake, be quiet"—she said, "If you don't look out, I will give you a b—smack in the mouth"—the young man I spoke of came in with May, and several very loose girls as well, when she first came to the door—she came in with very great violence, and Mr. Tayon of course shut the door to keep the mob out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you lodge there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have been there about nine weeks—when May came in, she wanted to let the mob in, and Mr. Tayon fastened the door with a nail—she struck him as violently as she could with both hands, and said, "You old b—, if you are a man, come outside, and I will take it out of you"—she said that after he tried to per<lb></lb>suade her to be quiet—she made use of fearful bad language.—<hi rend="smallCaps">

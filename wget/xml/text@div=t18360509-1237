I keep the White Bear, in Barthelomew-square, St. Luke's The prisoner came into my house, between four and five o'clock on the 19th of April; the wind blew her shawl on one side, and I observed she had a pint pot; she looked into the tap-room and then went out—I followed her into Old-street, she then stopped at a chessemonger's shop, and put the pint pot on a board, with the intention of buying something—she then took up the pot, and went away—I told the policeman, and we went to her room where we found the pot there, I believe, which I had seen her with, and eleven other pots.</p>

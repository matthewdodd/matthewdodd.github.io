                  </hi>. I live in Compton-street, Soho. About eight o'clock on the evening of the 13th of November, the prisoner came to my shop, in company with two other boys—the older boy, who is not here, purchased a penny cigar—after they were gone, I missed two cigar tubes—I named it to my brother, expecting we should see them again—in the course of half an hour the prisoner and James Owens came in to purchase a penny cigar again—I noticed that the prisoner was very artful in his manner—my brother seized his hand, and found the cigar-tube in it—this is it—one was taken from his hand, the other was found on him at the station-house—they were taken from a box on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the witness's brother. I was sitting in the parlour and saw the prisoner come with James Owens—Owens asked for a penny cigar, and the prisoner put his hand to the box and took something from it—I went and took him, and found this cigar-tube in his hand.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you the person with whom they were pawned? A. Yes - I will not undertake to swear to the prisoner; he certainly looks different to what he did when he pawned them, and I have more doubt in my mind now than I had; whether it is from his dress, or what, I cannot tell - I did not particu-cularly remark his dress; I cannot tell whether he had a black coat or not, or whether he had a great coat on -I should not wish to swear to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. Yes - I saw a person before the Magistrate, but the prisoner seems different; there is some similarity - he certainly does not appear to me to be the same; the person I saw before the Magistrate was the same person I had seen at the shop, to the best of my belief - I do not think I expressed any doubt at the office; in the dress he had on then he seemed more fresh to my recollection than now - this deposition is signed by me; it is merely the dress, I suppose, that makes the difference in his appearance - I believed he was the man, certainly; I said,"The prisoner came into my shop," that is true; I had not doubt he was the man then.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You swear these shoes belong to your master? A. Yes, and they have No. 11 on them - here is a book in which they are entered, and not marked off as sold - there had been none pawned by my master's order for some time.</p>

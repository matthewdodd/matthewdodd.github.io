It was my duty to return again at seven o'clock in the morning - I did so, and found him at his post; I went up the yard, and he came out of the gate - I had not taken particular notice of him; he had nothing in his hand that I saw, but when he had got out I saw a bundle under his arm; it looked bulky; it was a bundle, but I cannot say whether it was in a handkerchief, as I have but a bad sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does this distillery belong to the Excise - A. Yes; nobody else keeps anything in it to my knowledge. I could see that he had something under his arm when he was in East Smithfield; there are very few persons in the streets at that time in the morning. There is a boundary fence and a lodge; there is nobody there but the watchmen. I was up the yard when he went out.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 2d of June I was in Lower East Smithfield, with Howard and Stevenson, going towards the Excise distillery; the prisoner was coming towards me, in a direction from the distillery - he had a handkerchief, and something tied up in it; he passed me; I immediately turned round and said,</p>
               <p>"I am an officer, what have you got there?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I am an officer also; you have no business to stop me." I touched him, and felt something in the left breast pocket of his coat. I said,</p>
               <p>"You must stop." I gave the parcel to Stevenson, who was with me. He said,</p>
               <p>"Take the things, and for God's sake let me go, it will be the ruin of me." I took him to the office - he said several times,</p>
               <p>"Let me go," and that he would give me all the money he had in his pocket. I searched him, and found bottles in his breast, a bottle in each side pocket of his coat, and three bottles in the handkerchief, containing altogether about three quarts of liquor. The bottles were wrapped up in a towel, and a night-cap and the handkerchief tied over all. I asked how he got them - he said,</p>
               <p>"Don't ask me anything about them, but take them and let me go; you don't want to know my name, that is of no use to you." I 
               <persName id="t18240603-221-person1892">drew</persName>
             the cork, and said I thought it was whiskey - he said,</p>
               <p>"It is only British spirits." I found afterwards that it was Hollands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the necks of the bottles out of the handkerchief - A. No. He was about one hundred yards the Excise distillery. I was twice examined at the Police office; I did not then say so much as I have now - there was about two hours between the two examinations - the first was very short; the Magistrates asked me if I knew much about him - I said the other officer knew most. I had not ascertained then that these spirits were 2 per cent. lower than the bulk. When he said it was British spirits he might have told the truth for what I know.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Is it easy to reduce the strength of spirits - A. Yes; the officer said various causes would make a difference in the quality; changing it out of the bulk, or the beat of the sun, would make a difference.</p>

            . I am senior inspector of the Excise watchman. The prisoner was an established Excise watchman; his duty was to watch these premises. On the 2d of June I went to the office, and saw him sitting in a small room there - I asked what brought him there; he said the officer, for taking some gin from the distillery; I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you been plundering the casks" - he said, No - it was stowed away in different parts of the yard, and he took it away. I told him I had but one duty to perform - I thought he was going to say something, but I did not hear him. I represented this to the board.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he not say he was going to take it to the Excise-office, and was stopped - A. No. He bore a very good character.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it ever happen that persons bring samples in these bottles, and they are left behind - A. Not that I ever saw or heard of. I am not acquainted with the nature and strength of spirits.</p>

            . I have tasted the contents of one of these bottles, and of one of the casks at the distillery, and compared them - they are of a similar quality; it is what we call foreign Geneva, condemned under the Revenue laws. I had tried the strength of the vats, and this sample also - the greatest variation was 2 1/2 per cent.; the lowest was 7-10ths of 1 per cent. lower than the lowest of the puncheons. The prisoner had access to seventy-nine puncheons, which were in the yard on the night of the 1st of June. The increase of the temperature would make a difference in the spirits; the better the spirits the weaker it appears. I consider that it had come from the puncheons, but was a little reduced in strength.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you tasted this in a public-house, should you have said it was the same quality - A. I do not know that I should. The spirits might have been got out by knocking out a bung; each vat is locked up by a spirit lock; he could get into the warehouse. We try the spirits by an hydrometer - I tried these spirits at the office at the same time, by pouring it into a tube. The temperature would not be the same in them as in the puncheons, because it would take two or three hours for them to get the same temperature.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Could there have been 2 1/2 per cent. difference in the quality of the spirits and those in the casks, unless something had been put to them - A. Certainly not; I consider that water had been put to them.</p>

            . Q. On Sunday the 23d of September last, where did you live. - A. No 7, Harp-court, Fleet-street. On that day, about half past six in the evening, I was in Bartholomew Hospital square. On my passing through the square, I saw the prisoner Trueman, who was tried last sessions. I perceived he was following of me. I saw two more with him. When I got to the steps of the hospital, with intention to go in, he put his hand to my face. I put up my hand to prevent him from striking me. He struck me in the bosom, and took the watch from my side. He ran away, and I called for assistance.

            . Q. On the 23d of September last, were you in Bartholomew Hospital Square. - A. Yes, about half after six, I was going through Bartholomew Hospital, I heard the cry of stop thief. I had just passed the gateway, I saw a man strike Mrs. Jackson. I immediately pursued him, and I was never more than four or five yards behind him, from first to last, I might be more, I cannot say exactly. He attempted to run down Hosier Lane. He saw one or two people coming up Hosier Lane. He threw a something from his hand at the time, and he turned again and ran towards the George Inn, and, opposite of the George, he stopped as though he had been shot. I ran up against him. I collared him immediately, and said, he was the person that robbed the lady. He denied it. In the course of a few minutes, Mrs. Jackson came up, she said,</p>
               <p>"you are the man that robbed me." I took him into the George public-house, and in a few minutes, the lady came in and said,</p>
               <p>"you are the man that robbed me." A gentleman came in in a few minutes, and said,</p>
               <p>"coming up Hosier Lane he picked up the watch," and directly the gentleman came in and gave up the watch, the prisoner and two or three more came up to me and said</p>
               <p>"d - n your bloody eyes let the prisoner go." I am positive to the man, he said,</p>
               <p>"the lady has got her watch, and what does she want more. I told him I would not let him go untill I put the prisoner Trueman into a prison, and the person that had got the watch, said, he would not deliver the watch up untill he delivered it to a magistrate, or to an officer. I then sent for a constable, and for the lady's friend Griffin. The constable came in. About three quarters of an hour after that, Trueman said he would go quietly with Griffin and me. The prisoner was present, and very abusive, because I would not let Trueman go. When we came to the corner of Hosier Lane, I had old of Trueman's right arm in my left, and I had hold of his coat and waistcoat with my right. Trueman said,</p>
               <p>"what do you hold me by the coat and waistcoat for." I said,</p>
               <p>"to make sure of you." I had no sooner spoke the words, than my heels were kicked up, and Trueman fell upon me and Griffin, the constable fell upon Trueman. I was dragged some yards in a few minutes. I kept holding Trueman's legs. I got up and saw several people that came to my assistance. I saw one Huggins. I was no sooner up, but I was knocked down again. They dragged me through the pens, beat me with sticks, and likewise kicked me, and there were a great many knives drawn at the time. After they dragged me through the pens, I got Trueman to Mr. Gent's public-house, Mr. Gent said, he would not let any thief come in there, and shut the door. We were dragged into the pens, and I was knocked down again. While I was standing at Mr. Gent's door, they cut Trueman's coat all round except what I had got hold of, so that he might slip out of his coat. They said,</p>
               <p>"d - n his bloody eyes cut his bloody arm off." I immediately stooped down, let go and got old of his thighs. They dragged me into the pens, and beat me a second time. There were many knives and sticks flying about, and when I got up I saw Trueman wrestling with Griffin to get his staff from him. Trueman and a number of others at the time said,</p>
               <p>"d - n their bloody eyes, hamstring them. I was then got very near the George with Trueman. I was so overpowered at that time, I said if they would let me go, I would let Trueman go, they said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your bloody eyes let him go, we'll let you go." I immediately heard a voice behind say,</p>
               <p>"throw him backwards." I turned round and saw a person at a small folding doors to a large gateway. I then threw Trueman's heels up, threw him in that door, and fell in with him. I took Trueman into the back part of the George public-house. The prisoner at the bar came in at the same time, and Bray, Griffin, and Huggins.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner during the whole of this time. - A. I saw the prisoner when he insisted upon me letting Trueman go in the public-house, before I had not seen him from that time to this. Griffin then got a cord and tied Trueman's hands behind him. I had hold of Trueman, the prisoner came and stood opposite of me. The prisoner called for a pint of ale, he gave Trueman the first glass of ale out of his pint, he said,</p>
               <p>"here my lad, drink." After Trueman drank he said,</p>
               <p>"he wished somebody would go and let his friends know where he was." The landlord of the house said if you will give me proper directions, I will go and let your friends know. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"you have no occasion to give yourself that trouble. Trueman is a stranger to me, I will let them know." After the prisoner had called for a pint of beer and a pipe, I said,</p>
               <p>"as you pretend to be a friend to this man, why do not you go and let his friends know." He said he would stop and see the coach off first. The landlord of the house then shook his head, and seemed to think he was one of the gang. A coach came.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got into the coach. - A. I, Trueman, Griffin, and Bray, I cannot tell exactly how many there might be. And the prisoner followed us out of the house, and after the coach. As soon as we got out of the door they gave a shout. When we got into the middle of Smithfield, the coach door was broken open on the left hand side. I then received four or five blows on my left thigh with a stick. I then looked at the coach door, I saw the prisoner at the coach door with a stick. I then asked some one to lend me their stick to defend myself, but they wanted it back again in a moment, and I delivered it to them. I then put my hand out to hold the door by the tassel, and received a blow on my arm. I got the coach door to, and held it by the tassel and the pocket. We proceeded, the coach was stopped several times before we got to Newgate Street. There were a number of voices at the time cry our,</p>
               <p>"d - n your eyes you bloody b - s, we'll rescue him." I cannot say the prisoner was one, there were so many crying.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I did not understand you that the prisoner struck you. - A. Yes, the prisoner struck me with a stick. We had not got far up Newgate Street, before the traces, and the reins, and the harness were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050024"></xptr>cut. The coachman was obliged to get off his box, to get one of the horses, the reins were cut. He had not gone many yards before the body of the coach fell down between the wheels, the main braces were cut. With that, one or two people in the coach left me, Griffin, and the prisoner in the coach. Bray who had jumped out of the coach, returned in a few minutes and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh Griffin my arm is broke." Griffin immediately jumped out of the coach, left me and Trueman together in the coach. Trueman began to cry at that time, and said,</p>
               <p>"he was a lost man," he was very sorry for what had happened. Just at that moment the prisoner came up to the coach door, he said something, I could not rightly understand what. He had not been at the door above a minute or two before Stanton the officer came up. I heard Stanton say,</p>
               <p>"the first man that came near the coach, he would blow his brains out." He had got a pair of pistols. I then said,</p>
               <p>"blow that man's brains out," which is the prisoner at the bar, or drive him away. With that he put a pistol to his breast, and told him,</p>
               <p>"if he did not go away he would blow his brains out." I told him he was the man that wanted to rescue Trueman. He immediately went away. We got Trueman into a fresh coach, and returned to Giltspur Street Compter. We could not go forward to the Poultry Compter. It might be near ten o'clock when we got to Giltspur Street Compter, and then there was a great shout gave. After we had lodged Trueman in Giltspur Street, I never saw any thing more of the prisoner untill the trial of Trueman came on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he is the same man. - A. I am positive he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You are sure he is the same man. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In Newgate Street Bray's expression was, that he had his arm broke. - A. I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. You did not see the state in which Bray was. - A. He was cut across his fingers. When he appeared at Guild-hall on Monday morning, he shewed it to the court. His fingers were cut across on his left hand, and his hand was in a sling.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened to you. - A. At the George, a coach was sent for, I went with them along to the Compter. Trueman was resolute the first time, but the second time he was very quiet, because his hands were tied behind him. The reins were cut, and the traces and the harness of the horses, in Smithfield. The coachman got on one of his horses and rode as postillion, untill we got into <placeName id="t18101205-39-crimeloc239">Newgate Street</placeName>

They cut the braces of the spring, and let the body of the coach down. I jumped out of the coach immediately, and Pike the officer. As we jumped out of the coach, there was a most desperate gang, some with knives, and some with sticks. One of them hit me on my head by the side of my ear, and knocked me down with a large stick. I was fighting at that time for about ten minutes. The other officer ran away and left me at the coach door. I dare say I was knocked down a dozen times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there assembled together. - A. I dare say near twenty; some beating me over my legs, and some over my thighs; they were armed with sticks and knives; they said, d - n your b - y eyes, let him go. One of them cut me on the fingers, on this hand, with a knife; another came up and hit me on my arm with a large driver's stick. I called out,</p>
               <p>"Griffin, my arm is cut, and I believe broken," immediately Stanton, the officer, came up with a brace of pistols. Somebody spoke to Stanton, in the coach, and pointed out some man at the coach door; he said, he was trying to rescue Freeman. Stanton put a pistol to his breast, told him, if he did not go away, he would blow his brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was. - A. No; my arm was in so much pain, I could not swear to any one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the man before to your knowledge. - A. I saw him in the George, drinking, all with the prisoner Trueman. I cannot positively say it was the same man, it was dark out in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Newgate-street was this. - A. Just by Christ's Hospital gate. I am quite sure I was cut across my hand with a knife.</p>

            . I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent for on the 23d of September. - A. Yes, to the George, in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar. Did you see him there. - A. I saw him after we had taken Trueman back again to the George. I asked Lloyd if he liked to have something to drink? Bray poured two glasses out of two pots. The prisoner said, let Trueman have a glass - that is the first time. I did not see him again until we got into Newgate-street, when the coach was cut, and then I saw him there. The street was lined with people when the coach was cut down. The prisoner came to the coach door. Lloyd was in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came to the coach, did he say any thing. - A. He said nothing. I did not see him do any thing in the least, at that time. Lloyd said, to a gentleman that came up, that man attempted to rescue Trueman out. When Stanton came up, the prisoner was standing at the coach door: I saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen to Bray. - A. Bray got out of the coach after it was cut down. The prisoner came up to the coach door, and Bray came up to the coach door. He said,</p>
               <p>"Griffin, I have got my arm broken, and my fingers cut.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after Bray came out of the coach that the prisoner came to the coach door. - A. Yes; and it was after Bray came out of the coach that Bray got his fingers cut. Lloyd said to Stanton,</p>
               <p>"Shoot that fellow, he has been at the coach door before." Stanton said,</p>
               <p>"Go away, or I will shoot you." I never see him after that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050025"></xptr>Q. How long was it before or after Bray's hand was cut. - A. It was about ten minutes after Bray said his hand was cut. When Stanton came up with the pistols, that was the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time he came up to the coach door, how near was that to Bray's coming up and saying he was cut. - A. A few minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. KNAPP. I do not understand you, to say at that time when Bray came up and said he was cut, and his arm broke. You did not see the prisoner then. - A. No, I did not see him at the coach door.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time that Bray informed you, did you see him at the coach door, or any where else at that time. - A. I did not. I saw him about ten minutes after that, the second time.</p>

            . Q. Were you sent for to the George inn, Smithfield. - A. Yes, I was. I knew Miss Jackson. When I came there, I saw the prisoner. He called for a pint of ale: he was along with Trueman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time the coach went away. - A. I do. I followed Sadler with the coach, when the coach went away. Sadler followed the coach from the George, and about an hundred yards from the George, in Smithfield, I saw the prisoner stop the horses. After having stopped the horses, he went of the near side of the coach, and tried to open the coach door; he could not get it open; then the coachman drove on very hard. He directly ran before the horses again. Just as the coach got opposite of the hospital gates, he 
stopped the horses the second time. After that, the coachman found the reins were cut. He directly hollowed out,</p>


               <p>"his reins were cut." After that, the coachman got into Newgate-street. I heard the prisoner say, to four or five of them,</p>
               <p>"Now, my boys, stick true to me, and we will have them away from the b - rs."</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there following of him. - A. Near upon thirty of them from what I could see in the gang: a great many had sticks and knives.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you saw the prisoner twice at the horses heads. - A. I did, and likewise in Newgate-street. After he made that expression to four or five of them, he went to the off side of the coach, and directly the coach fell down - it was instantly cut down. After he came up to the coach door, I heard Stanton say,</p>
               <p>"if you do not go away I will blow your brains out." After that I lost sight of him. I heard Bray say he had his arm broke. I did not see him struck. I am quite sure Sadler is the person.</p>

            . I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23d of September, were you in Newgate-street. - A. I had an information at the Compter. I went to Newgate-street. When I got halfway down Newgate-street, I saw a mob. I quickened my pace, and got up to it: it was a great mob, indeed. I tried to go through the mob. Some cried out,</p>
               <p>"do not let him go through." I pulled a pair of pistols out of my pocket, and swore the first person that offered to stop me, I would blow his brains out. They pushed me backwards and forwards. They would not let me go through. When I got to the horses heads, I was tried to be stopped by a man. I did not exactly notice that man. I got to the coach door; there were some trying to open the coach door. I pushed them of one side, and looked in the coach window. I saw Griffin. I said,</p>
               <p>"what is the matter?" he said,</p>
               <p>"for God's sake assist us." I said I would. Lloyd said,</p>
               <p>"Stanton, blow that man's brains out, if he does not go away from the coach." He said, " that man has been following of us all the while." The prisoner is the man, to the best that I can recollect; I have no doubt about it. That is the man that tried to shove me under the coach, when I was endeavouring to get at the coach door. The pistols were locked. I unlocked one, and presented the pistol to him, and told him, if he did not go away, I would blow his brains out. I never saw any more of him, he went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man that attempted to push you under the coach. - A. Yes; I have no doubt at all of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And the man that was pointed out to you. - A. I have no doubt of it. It was very dark. I saw him by the light of the lamps. I got another coach and put Trueman in, and then I saw Bray's hand was cut by something sharp.</p>

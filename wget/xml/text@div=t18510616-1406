                  </hi>. I live at 25, Borough-road, Southwark. On 7th May I went into the Wheat-sheaf, Marylebone, leaving my cart and horse outside, with the whip, cushions, nose-bag, and loin-leather—I was in and out three or four times—the last time I went out, I missed the horse and cart—I had seen them safe five minutes before—I went home, and sent Harrisson, my man, to look after them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Phillips's servant. I went to him for the horse and cart—I saw the prisoner in a pie-shop, near Astley's Theatre, buying a saveloy, with my master's whip in his hand—I waited till he came out, and taxed him with it—he said he bought it of two boys, for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., who were a little way down Westminster-road—he gave me the whip—this is it—I have mended it—I gave him into custody.</p>

I went to an acquaintance's house in Bow-Street, and not getting in there I was going to another place, and met this woman in Drury-Lane; and she said, Baker, where are you going?</p>
               <p>Jury. Were you sober?</p>
               <p>Caryl. I was not drunk - I can't say I was quite sober - No, no, I was not drunk: we went together into Windsor-Court, and I staid there all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie alone?</p>
               <p>Caryl. Yes, I did; the Prisoner gave me a candle, and I went up stairs and went to bed; and she came up and fetched the candle away - I had no liquor, the Prisoner and another woman or two that were there had some. I lay till near seven o'clock on Sunday morning, then I was going to get up. I went to take my breeches from under my head to look what it was o'clock, and my watch was gone. I happened to light upon the Prisoner the 24th of July and had her taken up - I am sure I had it when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Caryl. Yes, I am. I did not come here to take a false oath; when I came down there was only an old woman, and I asked her concerning it, and she said there had been nobody in the room but the woman who lighted me up - I never had my watch again, and know no more of it but by her confession before the Justice - She confessed she took the watch, and gave it to a gentleman who had pledged it, but she did not say where it was pledged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you up stairs?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I was not. <rs id="t17440912-32-verdict174" type="verdictDescription">

On the 7th of February, I went to bed, after having seen every thing secure. At four o'clock in the morning I was alarmed, and found the patrol at the door. The cellar-door was open, the padlock wrenched off, and laying on the ground. There was a hat and dark-lanthorn at the door. The watch-box is nearly opposite my door, and there is a lamp at the corner of the house.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my box is opposite Mr. Miller's house-there is lamp at the corner, which shews a clear light on his door. About four o'clock, I saw a man come out of Featherstone-street, and go into Banner-street; he came back, and stooped down by Mr. Miller's cellar grating. I came out, and he ran off. At four o'clock the next morning, as I was going my rounds, I heard Mr. Miller's private door moving gently open - I found it so. I called out, "who is there?"-no person answered. The prisoner shoved the door wide open, and walked out. I seized him by the collar-it was moonlight, and the lamp was a-light - I am sure he is the man. Francis Ensor (who was convicted here last Sessions) then came out. The prisoner said to him, "give it to him!"-the prisoner was then struggling, and I was beating him with my stick. I struck the prisoner on the head, and my staff drew blood, by which I knew I made a mark on his head. I was knocked down, and they both got away. On the 14th of March, I saw the prisoner at the Mansion-house, with another person, and pointed him out. I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I was examined at Ensor's trial-it was a great while after that I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.In the course of that time, had you been looking out for any other person - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I have your evidence here. - Did you, on your oath, say, last Session, any thing about your bloody staff; and did you not say, you had hold of him with both hands - A. I did not say I had. I know Richard Hutchence - I never felt a man's head of the name of Buckle, to see if he had a wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Hutchence, after you had sworn to the prisoner - A. No; I do not know where he lives, or what shop he keeps.</p>
               <p>Q. You never was at his shop in Chequer-alley - A. Once - He is a file-cutter. I think it was before I had been to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remember his asking you, how you could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160033"></xptr>swear to the prisoner, when you said you should not know the man from Adam - A.He never said so to me.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say,</p>
               <p>"I have sworn to him, and will stick by him, right or wrong" - A.Never - I was not with him two minutes. I went to ask him to grind my sword; I had no conversation with him about any thing but the sword. Cormick was in the shop when I was there.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I knew Hutchence by his once being a watchman. There was a wound on the prisoner's head when he was at the Mansion-house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at the Mansion-house when Grenville identified the prisoner - there was a mark on his head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He stood at the bar with other prisoners; his hat was off. After Ewer was committed, and before he was tried, I was at the Hope with Grenville - We went there for Grenville to see Buckle, to know whether he was the man. He said he could not speak to the man, unless he had the same dress on; he said, he made a wound in his head with his stick. We pushed Buckle's hat off, in a joke - I felt it; there was no wound on it. Grenville said he was not the man. He said the man had a fustain frock.</p>

            . I am a file-cutter, and live in Chequer-alley, Whitecross-street. In February last, a day or two after the robbery, I had been on duty as a watchman, on the same beat with Grenville, and asked him if he should know the other man (Ewer had been committed), as I would keep a look-out. He said he should not know him from Adam, as he was knocked down, and hardly saw him. He came to my shop a day or two after, leaned over my window, and said he had got the chap. I said,"what chap?" - He said,</p>
               <p>"the chap for Miller's crack;" and that he had sworn to him. I asked him how he could swear to him, when he told me he should not know him from Adam? He said, he had sworn to him, and would stick by him, right or wrong. My brother-in-law, Cormick, was in the shop at the same time - He went away. Grenville knew my shop as well as I did myself, and has been there scores of times. I am no acquaintance of the prisoner's. I gave up my place as a watchman when I had plenty of work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had been watchman there three years - I never had any discredit imputed to me. When I went to be sworn in as a watchman, the Vestry would not accept me again. This conversation took place when I was a watchman.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS CORMICK. I was in the shop when Grenville called; I was at work at the vice. He said, he had got the man for the crack. My brother asked him how he could swear to the man, when he said he should not know him from Adam. He said," I have sworn to him, and will stick to him, right or wrong." He went away directly.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in King-street, Covent-garden; these two girls came to me that evening; the prosecutrix's wound on her neck was about an inch and a-half in length, but the depth was very little, nothing of any consequence; it was of sufficient depth to be necessary to sew the wound up; it was across the jugular vein; if it had been deeper it would certainly have been dangerous - if it had been a quarter of an inch deeper it might have been fatal; I repeatedly asked the girl how she came by the wound, and she as often repeated that it was by falling on a scraper; and while I was sewing it up again, I asked her, and she said it was done by a spade; I said it certainly could not have been so, it must have been done by some sharp instrument, as the wound was cut; she then denied it being done with any sharp instrument - she never told me how it was done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went up Charing-cross, and heard a band, these girls came up and challenged me to fight, I said I would not fight, and one of them hit me; on going down Leicester-square, they all three pitched into me; one of them fell on a scraper; a gentleman pushed us all away from the door, and did not make any remark about her neck being hurt, only her head; next day the policeman came and took me from my own door.</p>

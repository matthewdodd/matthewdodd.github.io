                  </hi>. I am a police-officer at the General Post-office. On the 3rd of March, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, Mr. Hinton's chaise stood at the door of the King's Head, Newgate-street—the prisoner Bailey went and looked into it, and went away again—he returned in about a minute, took a parcel out, and gave it to the prisoner Smith, who had a bag which he put it into—I went over, seized Smith, put him into a shop, and left him in charge—I went over, secured Bailey, brought him into the shop, and handcuffed them and took them to the Computer—when I asked Smith what he had got there he said he did not know, a man had just given it to him to hold—when I brought them together I said to Smith, "Is this the man who gave you the sugar?"—he said, "No, I don't know that man."</p>

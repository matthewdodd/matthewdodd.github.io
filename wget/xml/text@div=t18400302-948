                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant—I am in partnership with Mr. Parker, and carry on business at the City-road basin. The pri<lb></lb>soner Haggett drove one of our teams for five or six weeks—I know Brett—we served him with coals for some considerable time—he lives in Cler<lb></lb>kenwell—I had frequent dealings with him, and always found him correct—he keeps a coal-shed—Haggett went out on the 22nd of January with coals—there was a nose-bag of beans, clover, and corn for the horses—the provender in the bag belonged to us, and if the horses did not eat it it ought to be returned to us—Brett had been in the habit of carting his own coals from our wharf—we very seldom sent our teams to his place—it is evident on this occasion the horses did go with the coals.</p>

               <p>to bail him also—I did not wish him to be locked up—I believe he had no felonious intention—he said there was a little corn remained in the bag, which the horses blew upon—he said he had received a little blown meat—he could not have been in the habit of receiving this, as it was very unusual for my horses to go to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I go out with Mr. Burrows's teams, to unload coals. On the 22nd of January I went to deliver coals at a public-house near Brett's—I did not shoot any coals at Brett's—we shot them at a public-house three or four doors from Brett's—we had two nose-bags—we did not put them on the horses—they were filled with corn and beams, and a little chaff on the top—Haggett sold the contents to Brett for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a pot of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale, for both bags—they were full—there was more beans than corn or chaff among it—Haggett backed round the horses to Brett's back-way, and Haggett took the nose-bags, and gave them to Brett, who took them up into his loft—as he went up stairs he asked Haggett how much he was to give for them—he said a shilling—Brett said that was too much—he brought the nose-bags down again empty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it not usual when carmen go with coals to ask for beer from the people they serve? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not hear Haggett ask the publican to allow him something—Brett asked if the publican had given him any thing, and he said not—Brett gave him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the beans, and went to the public-house, and <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> a pot of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale—that was in the bargain—we all drank of it—we got it for the corn—I did not sell the corn—I had seen this going on for five weeks as far as Haggett was con<lb></lb>cerned—I was afraid to tell of it—Haggett said he would kill me if I did—I told my master when I got him in private—I could never tell him before without being heard—my master told me I must not go out with wagons anymore, but stop and cut chaff—it was then I told of it, because I thought that was the fit time when they could not do any thing to me, but I al<lb></lb>ways meant to tell master—I told my master of it on Saturday, the 29th of February—it was three days before that that I went to Brett's—I told the Justice the day this happened—the horses had not had any part of the contents of the bags.</p>

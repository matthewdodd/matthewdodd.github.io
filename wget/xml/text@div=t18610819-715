                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, of 23, Thomas-street. Woolwich—I remember the prisoner coming into my shop on 29th July, and inquiring for a ring he had left to be repaired—he said a person of the name of Mary Ann Peel was to call for it, and I was to give it to her—he asked me about a watch, as he wished to buy one and pay for it by instalments—I took one out of the window and that did not suit him—I then took another out of the drawer, and said, I would be ready for him as Boon as he was ready for me—he then said, "There is one in the window—I am expecting a remittance from my friends to-morrow"—I took the watch out of the window and was in the act of opening it when he gave a whistle, snatched the watch out of my hand, and rushed out of the shop—I am sure he was the man, because of leaving the ring to be repaired—I did not see the watch again—I next saw the prisoner on Wednesday, when he was in custody—I mentioned this to the police, and described the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable of the R division, stationed at Woolwich—from information I received, I took the prisoner, he was then in military custody for absence without leave, for nine days—that was two days after the robbery—I asked him if his name was Boston—he said, "That is my name here"—I then told him he most consider himself in my custody for having stolen a watch from the shop of Mr. Barrell on the 29th—he said, "It is all right, you will find more to-morrow"—he stated that the detective was after him, and he thought he might as well give himself up as he was put back for court martial.</p>

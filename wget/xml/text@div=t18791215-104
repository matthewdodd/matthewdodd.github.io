                  </hi>. I have been in the service of Mr. Hartell, of 12, Earl Street, Westminster, 12 months—the prisoner used to wash for Mr. Hartell—she has not had the washing since about a week before this affair occurred—on 31st October she came to the house—I opened the door to her, and she said "Tell Margaret I want to see her"—Mrs. Henley's Christian name is Margaret, and she was housekeeper to Mr. Hartell—I was kitchen-maid and had to attend to the door—Mr. Hartell had a house<lb></lb>maid, kitchen-maid, and cook—I went to the kitchen and told Mrs. Henley, and she went upstairs—I followed her—before Mrs. Henley got to the top of the stairs the prisoner threw some vitriol in her face, and then opened the door and fled—she had her band under her cloak—I did not see her take her hand out—it was all done in a moment—it was a dark thick fluid—it burnt Mrs. Henley, who cried out "Oh, my eye!"—it went into her eye—she sat down in a chair, and seemed in much pain—there was a quantity of fluid lying about the hall—her dress was much burnt—the housemaid, Mary Keen, took her to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Mr. Hartell—on 31st October, when the prisoner came, I was coming downstairs to the hall, and prisoner was standing in the middle of the hall—I did not see anything in her hand—I went down into the kitchen as Mrs. Henley was coming up, and I heard her scream—I ran up immediately, and found her in a dreadful state, crying, and very much burnt about the face—I have been in Mr. Hartell's service three years—the prisoner has done the washing about 12 months, I think—about a week before the occurrence the washing was discontinued</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mr. Hartell, and have been in his employment 29 years next May—the prisoner did washing for the house, and washed the linen of the church a little over 12 months—Mr. Hartell told me not to send it her any more—I do not know whether the prisoner was pleased or displeased, for I did not see her—Mr. Hartell communicated with her about the discontinuance—there had never been any words between the prisoner and myself—on 31st October the kitchenmaid called me up to the ball, and as I was going upstairs I saw the prisoner standing on the mat, and the moment I got sight of her she threw a liquid into my face—she did not say a word, nor did I—I was going up to hear what she had to say—it burnt me very much immediately—I did not notice if she had any<lb></lb>thing in her hands—her hands were hid under her cloak—she took one hand out, and I could see that with that hand she threw something—I was burnt on my face in my right eye and on both hands—my dress was very much burnt—I cannot now see with my right eye; it is perfectly blind—the other is very weak—I was immediately taken to the hospital—I am still under the charge of the doctor—the only reason I can account for the prisoner's action is that she wanted to come into the house as a servant when she first came into the neighbourhood, and I refused her—this dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one I had on—it was not burnt like that before the vitriol was thrown on it—it was a new dress, and had been washed only once.</p>

                  </hi>. On 31st October I was acting as house surgeon at the Westminster Hospital—I examined the last witness—she was suffering from a burn on the right cheek and right side of the neck and right arm and slightly on the left arm—the upper part of the body of her dress was also burnt—the burning substance had penetrated the dress to the skin of the neck and upper part of the breast—the right eye was injured by the intrusion of some fluid—she was taken into the ward, and evidently suffered very much—she has remained in the ward ever since with the exception of attending at the police-court—sbe has entirely lost the sight of the right eye, and it remains a question whether the eye will not have to be removed to endeavour to avoid sympathy and to try to save the other eye—where there is an injury to one eye there is always a liability of the other to suffer—the burns were such as would be caused by oil of vitriol, which is the popular name for sulphuric acid—it is a dark liquid and oily—I submitted the dress to a chemical test, and undoubtedly detected oil of vitriol—she is still under my care.</p>

This property was at a hay-rick, near my house; I had used them on the 23d of May, and left them in the rick - I have seen the prisoner before, at Icknam; on the morning of the 24th, when I got up, I saw some person had been there, by the feet in the grass; I went to the blacksmith's, and received information - I got a warrant, and went to his house; he was not at home, but we found these things up stairs.</p>

            . I went and searched the prisoner's house on the 27th of May: I have known him a number of years; I found all these articles there - I took him the same evening, and put him into the cage; I took him out the next morning, to give him some refreshment, and he made his escape.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where did you find the prisoner? A. At lcknam, but not at his own house; I had not seen him at his own house for some time past.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

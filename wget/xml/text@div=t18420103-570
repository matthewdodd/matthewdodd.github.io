                  </hi>. I live at Mr. Roope's, a linen-draper, in Sloane-street, Chelsea. On the evening of the 21st of December I was in the shop—the two prisoners came into the shop together—Toomey wished to look at some silk handkerchiefs, which were shown to them by a young man in the shop—the manner of their looking at them excited my suspi<lb></lb>cion—I walked round the counter to watch them—Toomey held up a handkerchief between the gas-light and Burgess, so as to hide from the eyes of the young man who was serving them, what Burgess was doing—I saw her take a piece of handkerchief, and put it under her shawl—she then made some trifling purchase, and left the shop—they were taken, thirty or forty yards from the door—I saw the handkerchiefs drop from Burgess—they are the same as were on our counter.</p>

I went to Mr. Roope's shop on this evening—the two prisoners were in the shop—I stood on the outside—Toomey came out about four minutes before Burgess—he went to the corner of Sloane-square, and waited there till Burgess came out—I was going towards her—she turned to go into the shop again—I saw these handkerchiefs drop from under her shawl—I took them up, and took both the prisoners—I searched them, and found on Toomey three small pieces of ribbon in three parcels, but no money—I searched Burgess, and found 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

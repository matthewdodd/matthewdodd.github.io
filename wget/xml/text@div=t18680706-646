                  </hi>. I keep the Albion, in Lower Kennington Lane—on 5th June, the prisoner came for half-a-pint of porter, and tendered a bad florin in payment—I looked at it, and said it was bad—this is it; I can swear to it by this dent on the edge—I rang it on the counter; and, as I rang it, the prisoner took it up and put it in his pocket—he abused me slightly after that—a constable happened to be in the bar at the time; and as he went out, I told the constable to take him in charge, and he followed him—this florin was shewn to me next-day by Monk and Ash.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L</hi> 145). I was at Mr. Bond's on this evening—as I was entering the door I saw Mr. Bond throw this piece on the counter, and the prisoner snatch it up—Mr. Bond said, "It is a bed one, have you got a penny?"—he said, "No; I have only got a half-penny: give me a half-penny worth"—he also said, "You don't suppose I should offer you a bad one, seeing a constable in the house"—he then said, "I will sell it; give me 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—I said, "Would you not take 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—he said, "Yes"—I wanted to get it, and offered the 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but he would not give it up—he walked out—after he had got outside Mr. Bond said something to me, and I followed him—I was three or four yards behind him till we came to the corner of Pleasant Place—he turned up there, and by the time I got to the corner he was returning back again—he had passed the low wall, over which the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece was afterwards found—he crossed the road and went down Early Road, a little in advance of me—Ash was at the corner of Early Road, and he said to me, "I have seen him swallow the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—the prisoner said, "How could I swallow a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece; that is all you know about it"—I then took him to the station—he wanted water, and said, "I must have some"—he spoke as if he was choking for the want of it—I gave him some—he drank it with difficulty—I afterwards received this florin from Sergeant Wells.</p>

I was in the Albion when the prisoner was there—when he went out, I followed him down Pleasant Row—I lost sight of him for a minute—after that he came book—I told the constable to follow him up—he went on as far as the Early Road—I saw him put his hand in his trousers pocket, take out a florin, hold it up, and turn round, put it in his mouth, and then clap his throat—that was just before he was taken into custody, while the policeman was following him—it was when he had turned back, after passing the wall—on the following day Monk showed me this florin with the dent in it, which I had seen on the counter—I went with him to Mr. Bond, and he recognized it instantly.</p>

I am a lamp lighter, and live at 33, Barrack Street, Vaux<lb></lb>hall—on Saturday, 6th June, I was cleaning the lamps at the corner of Pleasant Row, Kennington Lane; some children asked me to look over the wall for a hat, I looked over and saw a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece lying there, in a yard—I got over and got it—Ash was going by, and I showed it to him, and we went and showed it to Mr. Bond, and I afterwards gave it to the inspector, at the station.</p>

"It was impossible for Ash to have seen me swallow a piece at the distance of twelve yards; if I swallowed anything he could not have seen what it was, and if I had thrown one away I might have thrown away two.

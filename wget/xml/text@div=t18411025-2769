                  </hi>. I am a brush-maker, and live in Lucas-place. The prisoner was my apprentice for three years and a half—I employed him to receive money when I was from home—I was from home on the after<lb></lb>noon in question—when I came home he told me Mrs. Plummer had sent 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was in the till—he gave me the key of the till, and I found two sovereigns there, but no third—he never accounted to me for the other 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. —indeed, he acknowledged that he only gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards had a settlement with Mrs. Plummer, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you have the settlement with Mrs. Plummer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About July—we very seldom have a settlement—we balance our accounts, just to see how we stand—it was on the 16th of July I found out she had paid the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not have the prisoner taken till the 29th of September, because I was not certain whether I had made a mis<lb></lb>take, whether the receipt was forged—two or three days before I gave him into custody I had some dispute with him about a young man who was in the shop on liking, being in his department—I received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the prisoner when he was apprenticed—he has no father—I told the prisoner he ought to be ashamed of himself, to encourage that boy in his place—he said he did not encourage him—I said, "I know all your plans perfectly well"—he asked me what I meant by it—I said, "You want to get into the shop again; besides, Mrs. Plummer says she paid you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you only gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "What money I received of Mrs. Plummer, you had"—I said, "You had better go to Mrs. Plummer and see about it, and if not you shall go before a Magistrate"—he said be should not lose his time to go—he said he had put 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the till and given me the key—I cannot say whether he said he put in all he had received—I think he said what I have stated—he said he had made an entry in a book, which I have here, but he did not say any thing about the entry then—this conversation was three or four days before I had him taken—he was taken about nine o'clock at night when he came home—I had a policeman waiting—I have not bound the other lad to me yet—I did not know what Mrs. Plumraer's account was—I never kept an account against her—we have had dealings for sixteen years—she pays just as it suits her, and I give receipts for it—I thought perhaps a mistake might have been made in this receipt, and that I would wait till I went to Mrs. Plummer's again to ascertain, before I spoke to the prisoner.</p>

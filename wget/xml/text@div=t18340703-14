               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did you mark these yourself? A. I did on the 18th of June - he had been about nine months in my employ - I had no character with him - he came to me merely to make out a few straggling accounts, and to collect money for me, for which I used to give him 7s. a week, exclusive of his breakfast and dinner, and other things I made him a present of - he was to stop as long as he liked, and when he could better himself, he was to leave - I only employed him because he had nothing to do - I had a brother-in-law before he came to me, and his employment was to market for me, and he partly kept my books - he was in my employ when the prisoner came - his duty did not devolve on the prisoner when he left - occasionally it did, but I generally posted the books myself - he kept the books partly - I wrote more in them then he did - I made no additional remuneration for that, except presents I gave him - his dinner and breakfast cost something.</p>
               <p>Q. During the last few weeks, did you continue to give him the 7s. a week? A. I believe so - he was always paid the 7s. per week - I never paid him myself scarcely - he, I believe, owes me money now - I did not, myself, pay him the last four weeks - he did not make much objection to be searched - he began to shake a little - he was about nine months in my employ.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner has been in better circum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030015"></xptr>stances in life, has he not? A. Yes, he kept the George Inn, in Aldermanbury, when I knew him, and it was through that I took him - he bore an honest respectable character.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. Are you quite sure he received more than 5s. for the 7s. lately? A. When he asked for money, he had it - he entered it himself; I always trusted him- he might not have had 5s. in a week; but, taking the four weeks, he had 20s.; I cannot say - whenever he wanted money, he said, "I want so and so" - I said, "Here, take it, and put it down."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you allow him to take money out of the till without asking for it? A. No; if he wanted a few shillings, I gave it him - he would put it in a little book, containing an account of his wages - I am so busy sometimes, I cannot attend to it - he did not ask me for money that day - I trust to himself to put it down.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, and went with Gorton into his counting-house - he told the prisoner the other servant had informed him that he was in the habit of taking money from the till, and putting it in his own pocket - he said, "I don't believe you would do it - but have you any money now in your possession?" - the prisoner said, "I have" - he said"Produce it, or you must submit to be searched" - he produced some money on the table, took up one half-crown, and said, "Is that yours?" - Gorton said, "No" - he produced a second, and Gorton said, "This is mine; I marked it to-day, and will swear to it, and three half-crowns likewise" - Gorton said, "There is the remainder of the money in the till, which is all marked."</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring his innocence, and stating, that he had placed 5s. in the till, and taken out two half-crowns to repay a friend, of whom he had borrowed that sum in half-crowns, and desired to return it in the same coin. Several very respectable witnesses gave him a most unexceptionable character.)</p>
               <p>MR. GORTON re-examined. I had 1l. 1s. left in the till- I had placed 1l. 6s. in it - I had locked the till and had taken the key with me, so that there should be nobody go to it - I had left 1l. 6s. in the till, and found 1l. 1s. in it - nobody could get to the till, because I had locked it - I gave my little girl a caution to put in her own pocket whatever was paid - I put the money in myself - nobody was allowed to go to it, or give change - I marked the money about half an hour before I missed it - I found no money in the till that was not marked.</p>

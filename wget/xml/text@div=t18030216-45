I told the officer I should appear against him; I thought it my duty to the public. The officer kept the handkerchief, it was marked.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On Tuesday, the 15th, I observed this man in Cornhill; I followed him, about twenty minutes, in Cornhill, Bishopsgate-street, and Gracechurch-street; I saw him attempt several gentleman's pockets in Gracechurch-street, between Fenchurch-street and Eastcheap; I saw him very closely pursue this gentleman, who was walking arm in arm with another gentleman; I was on the right hand side of the way, and he on the left, going towards London-bridge; a post-chaise passed between him and me, the moment the post-chaise passed me, I saw the prisoner go by the gentleman as quick as he could; I thought the gentleman had lost something.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the prosecutor? - A. Yes. I ran, across the way, and took him by the collar, and said, stop! I said to Mr. Greace, I believe you have lost something.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner do any thing? - A. I saw him do nothing but draw his hand out of his bosom, and run by the gentleman as fast as he could run; I thought he had picked the gentleman's pocket of something, because he passed him so quick. Mr. Greace felt in his pocket, and said, he had lost his handkerchief; I said to the prisoner, what you have got, give to me; he immediately put his right hand in his bosom under his arm, and brought out this handkerchief, it is a figured cotton handkerchief, I have kept it from that time to this. (Producing it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Greace. This is my handkerchief, there is I.G. and No. 2; I have one of the same pattern in my pocket, I have had it about five weeks; I bought a dozen of them, they cost me at the rate of two shillings and seven pence each; I don't think it is diminished in it's value; I am certain I had it in my pocket at Lloyd's Coffee-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to work, going by this gentleman I picked up this handkerchief; I kept it in my left hand till I delivered it to the constable.</p>

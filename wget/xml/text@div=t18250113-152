            . I am a brass-founder, and live on Snow-hill. The male prisoner came to my shop with about 20 lbs. of brass chucks and other articles. Chucks are very valuable in machinery, but useless for any thing else. I suspected something, and told my clerk to put them by - we paid him 6 d. or 8 d. a pound for them - they came to 15 s. or 16 s. He came again two or three days after. It was about the middle of November - all our dealings were within the space of nine days. I desired the property to be put aside, and put one chuck into my pocket; and as I went about, inquired of different people if they belonged to them. A few days after he came again with about 40 lbs. I asked him where he lived - he said in Creed-lane, and that his name was Earle. He came a third time, with about 90 lbs. of most valuable things to the parties they belonged to - they were manufactured for making parts of machinery. It was eleven o'clock. I desired my clerk to say we had no time to weigh them, and if he would call again at two o'clock they should be weighed, and he should be paid for them. I immediately went to different places, and was directed to Mr. Dollond, as the only person likely to belong to them. I produced them there, and they identified them, by their matching the machinery. The foreman came to my house with an officer, and when the prisoner came he was apprehended. He did not say how he got the goods. I am not in the habit of buying things, but bought these to detect the thief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He came to you in the middle of the day? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mr. Roper's, and found John Earle there, and asked how he came by the brass, he said he brought it from No. 2, Creed-lane, from Mrs. Earle - I said we suspected it was stolen, could he tell how she came by it; he said she dealt in old copper, and had bought it - I asked where he lived; he said he was a shoe-maker, and had a stall under her shop, and was in the habit of carrying goods for her, as a porter - I took him to the Compter; he said his name was Earle - I asked if he was related to Mrs. Earle; he said Yes - I asked him what relation, over and over again; he refused to tell; I went to Creed-lane, to Mrs. Earle, she keeps a chandler's shop; there was no appearance of her dealing in metal - I asked her where the man was who worked in the stall below; she said he was gone out, but she expected him very soon - I asked if she knew where he was gone; she said to Cock-lane, Smithfield - I asked if she knew what he was gone for; she hesitated for some time - I said I had a particular reason for asking; she said</p>
               <p>"He is gone to sell some old metal for me" - I asked what kind; she said old brass and copper - I said</p>
               <p>"Do you deal in old brass and copper, mistress?" she said Yes - I asked if she had any more by her; she said she had sent it all out - I asked where she kept it; she said in an old tub in the cellar: she went down, and shewed me an empty tub - I could find no metal - I returned to Mr. Roper's, and after some conversation with Godfrey, I returned to Mrs. Earle, and asked her if she knew a person named Godfrey, who worked for Mr. Dollond; she said she knew his father, but had no knowledge of the son - I told her I was given to understand she had bought the metal, which John had taken to Mr. Roper's, of Godfrey, Mr. Dollond's boy: she hesitated some time - I said I was certain of it, for I had proof that she had given 4 d. a pound for it; she said she had given more than 4 d.; she did not then deny having bought them of Godfrey - I said she must go with me: she said she should be forthcoming at any time, and wished me to let it stand over - I took her in charge; she said Godfrey's son had told falsities - I told her several things which he had said: she said</p>
               <p>"I suppose I must go after Old Maggs, and be transported." Cock-lane is near Mr. Roper's; one Barnard, a dealer in old metal, lives there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you told her you must take her, she said she supposed she must be transported? A. Yes; I had told her what Godfrey had stated.</p>

            . In November last, I was in the employ of Mr. Dollond, optician, of St. Paul's churchyard; my father, who is also in his employ, then lived in St. Martin's-le-grand; when my mother was alive, we dealt at Mrs. Earle's - I have known her five or six years; I went into Mr. Dollond's employ, in October - I went to Mrs. Earle's for a pint of small beer, and she asked where I worked; I said at Mr. Dollond's, with my father; she asked at what part of the business; I said in the brass way: she said if I would take her any, she would give me 3 d. or 4 d. a pound, according to the value of it - I said nothing then - I saw her two or three times after, and she repeated the same words, and at last I took her some chucks - John Earle was then in the shop, and looked at them; she weighed them, and gave me 4 d. a pound for them - I received 3 s. - John Earle took it out of the scale,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130056"></xptr>and observed, that it was not brass, but a mixture of pot met - I took some joints of telescopes soon after; John was present, and saw her buy them; there was a person in the shop, and she beckoned for me not to put them in the scale, while the person was there; when the person was gone I put it into the scale, the son looked at it, and said it was only a mixture of pot metal - I had 2 s. or 3 s. for that, and she told me, never to put any thing into the scale, while any one was there - I went there seven or eight times, within five or six weeks, and always took them with me - I took some stick brass, the third time, (her son was present,) and she told me, there was a person opposite, and not to make a noise with it, for the person opposite was worse than officers, that she had bought some bottles of a boy, who worked at Mr. Ellis, and the person opposite had told Mr. Ellis, who turned the boy away, and took the bottles from her; and, if any body saw me take it, to say. I never took any before, and to be sure I never let any body see me come into her shop; her son was present at this conversation; all the property which I took her, I had stolen from Mr. Dollond. These dealings went on till Mr. Roper went to my master - I received 16 s. or 18 s. in all, from her - some of the brass was rather old; but most of it new.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you come from goal now? A. Yes; I spent the money in different things, not in drink - my father did not know a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you give evidence here; is it to save yourself? A. My master asked me if I had stolen it - I said I had: it is not altogether to save myself, but to tell the truth - I do not know whether I am to be prosecuted - I am nineteen years old - I never stole any thing before - I used to go to their shop at breakfast time - I sometimes took it in my apron, and sometimes to my pockets - I had 15 s. a-week - I do not know whether I am to be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has Mr. Dolland, your father, or any one told you, that you will not be prosecuted, if the prisoners are convicted? A. Mr. Harmer said, I might get off, if I told the truth, but did not positively say I should. If my father had known it, he would have told my master directly - I should not have thought of it, if Earle had not set me on - the property produced is what I sold her.</p>

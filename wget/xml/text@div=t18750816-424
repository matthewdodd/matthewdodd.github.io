                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the Leicester Restaurant, in Princes Street—the prisoner was employed there in July last year as manager—on 20th July I gave him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and told him to go to a place in the Hay market to apply to have a grave opened for the reception of my brother who had died, and he was to send a telegram apprising another brother in America of his death—he went and took a hansom cab to call on several persons and pay little things—when he came back I asked him and he said he had sent the telegram—four or five days afterwards, in consequence of information, I said "It seems strange that my brother has not written or telegraphed on account of the telegram which you said you had sent"—he had the money to go to Regent Circus to send it—he said that he did not send it from, Regent Circus, but he had some business in Chancery Lane and had sent it from the office in Fleet Street—about a fortnight afterwards I went with him to Fleet Street, and he asked the young ladies in the office if there had been a telegram sent from Cooper—they referred to the books and said no such telegram was sent from the office; upon which the prisoner said he supposed it was neglect on their part.</p>

               <p>that you handed me the receipt for that—the boy Dyer was there when I handed you the money for the telegram, I was going to send him, but you said you were going that way and would send it, it was no use in trusting it to a boy—I had been drinking hard all day because I was very much distressed—I don't know whether I was taken up to bed drunk between 6 and 7 o'clock, I was very much distressed and Mr. Newton saw me upstairs—I was not taken to bed that evening by three people—I did not threaten to cut my throat—I don't know anything about that; I saw you about 11 o'clock or 11.30 on the Saturday morning in the restaurant—I think you were to send another telegram to Bridgeworth, but not to a friend of mine at Guildford—Mr. Lovett, a friend of mine lives there—I was very well in the morning, as well as I am now—I know you sent one of the boys to Regent's Circus to get a form; when we did not receive a reply to the telegram you suggested getting the post-office to repeat it—I sent a telegram to my brother afterwards, but you had nothing to do with that—you wrote out a second telegram but it was never sent—I have no books to show what you re<lb></lb>ceived as salary; you did not have any limit, I gave you money when you wanted it—I asked you several times what salary I should pay you, you said "Wait until we settle the affairs of your brother William," then of course you took advantage of it in my distress—after my brother's death you entered into a joint bond with me as my brother's administrator—I don't know that this is a straightforward account, you have made it very satis<lb></lb>factory to yourself.</p>

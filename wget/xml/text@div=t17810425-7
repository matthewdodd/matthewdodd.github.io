I went to take a walk after church on Sunday the 16th of April, and double-locked my door; when I came home I found my door open. and the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) gone: I went out about five o'clock, and returned about eight: it appeared to me that the doors had been opened by means of a false key, or a pick-lock.</p>
               <p>Did you leave any person in your house? - Nobody in my apartment: I had one room on the first floor. I went to a pawnbroker's on the Monday, and the pawnbroker, who is here, told me he had taken in such things of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Great Wylde-street. On the 17th of April, about nine in the morning, I received of the prisoner a linen gown, a Marseilles petticoat, and a black silk cloak; and in about an hour after, Mrs. Wilkinson came and described the things, and I shewed them to her; I was ordered to attend before Justice Addington; Mrs. Wilkinson swore they were her property, and I delivered them up: from that time till about six weeks ago I never saw the prisoner; then she came to demand the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250010"></xptr> gown, petticoat, and cloak, and I stopped her.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutrix. You found at Mr. Clark's the linen gown, the Marseilles petticoat, and the black silk cloak? - Yes. The gown and petticoat were the property of a young woman going into the country to service, her name is Smith; I delivered them to her after a certain time, the justice ordered me.</p>
               <p>Who did the cloak belong to? - It was mine: it was but an old one, and I did not bring it: the cloak had a D marked upon it; it was my own marking; I can swear to it.</p>

             told me she had some things in pawn; and, as she was going into the country, if I would take them out, I should have them: I went to enquire for them, and the pawnbroker stopped me; I know nothing of them; I did not pawn them.</p>
               <p>To Clark. Are you sure she was the person who pawned them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If she had passed by, or come to pawn any thing else, should you have known her? - Yes; I had some suspicion of her, after I had taken them in, and took particular notice of her as she passed by the window.</p>

On Thursday week, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I had occasion to melt a small quantity of gold. I weighed 21 dwts., and put it in a crucible, on the work board, where he was at work alone. Having lost gold and pearls at times, I thought I would fix the crucible, so that I should know if it had been disturbed - he had no occasion to move it at all. I returned in three or four minutes, and found it had been removed a few inches from where I placed it; it then weighed 19 dwts. 13 grains - he seemed confused, and went up stairs, and shortly afterwards returned, and was shuffling among some old boxes. I sent him on an errand, and found the gold wrapped up in paper, in an old box, among some old iron - I replaced it there, and sent for an officer, and when he came in, I asked him to produce the gold he had taken from the crucible; he denied having taken any. The officer spoke sharp to him, and he put his hand up the flue, and produced it. I had left it in the box - he must have moved it from there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. I believe you gave him leave to use a little gold to make a pin for himself - A. I had been robbed before by the apprentices; I then said, if they wanted a broach, to ask my leave, and they should have it; but the first who robbed me I would prosecute.</p>

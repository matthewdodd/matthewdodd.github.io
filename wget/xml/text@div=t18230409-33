The prisoner worked for me some time back, but not for the last eight weeks; he had not assisted in preparing any of the property in question. On Monday morning, the 23d of March, I went out, about seven o'clock. I cannot say whether I left the door locked, as I leave it open sometimes, for the peel to dry; I shut it, and left nobody in the house. There was about 65 lbs. of orange and lemon peel on the first floor - it was dry and fit for sale; I should have sold it for 6 l. I returned about eight o'clock, and every bit of it was gone. I applied to an officer.</p>

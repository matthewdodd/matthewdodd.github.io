               <p>Q. Look at the note, is that the same? - A. It is; the man's name was Long, as I found afterwards, he came for a pair of boots that I had had to repair, he asked what they came to; I told him half-a-guinea; upon that, he pulled that note out of his pocket, and gave it me. I went to the Three Tuns to get it changed; I afterwards had reason to believe it was a forged note, I returned it back to the man that gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were you to repair these boots for? -

            .</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Long told you, did you go any where and find Thomas Phillips? - A. Yes, I went with him into Portman-square; when we got about half way down the square, Phillips came up to us, and we told him it was a bad one; in consequence of that, Phillips took us to a public-house in Marybone-street, kept by Mr. John.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Phillips and Long said to you, who did you find there? - A. When we came there, the prisoner was not there; I went to Berners-street, and when I came back he was at the public-house; I asked him how he came by the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him the note? - A. After a bit he saw it; he said he had taken it at the Duke of Portland's office, he said he was at a King's Messenger; then I asked him if he would go with me to the Duke of Portland's office; he said, yes, as he was King's Messenger, he had taken it there in part of his salary.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shewn him the note by this time? - A. After that, he asked if he might see the note; I took the note out of my pocket and shewed it him, and he said it was his note; he asked what it was; and I told him it was a one altered into a five; upon that, he said he should be under the necessity of making an affidavit that he had taken it at the Duke of Portland's office, or he should be four pounds loser; upon that he went out, and stood in the passage talking with a woman at the bar, whom I afterwards saw, and who turned out to be Mrs. John, the landlady; after he had spoke to her, he came back, and said he thought he had taken it at the Duke of Portland's office, but the landlady had given it him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he tell you under what circumstances, or how the landlady had given it him? - A. No; he then, to the best of my knowledge, asked me to take his measure for a pair of boots, that he had great connections, and it might be the means of getting me a deal of work, I took measure of him for a pair of books; upon that, Long said, he wanted to speak to me, and I went out with him; when I came back, Crawford asked what business we had to go out, he said, if we had had any thing to say we might have spoke it there; then Phillips and he rather abused Long for calling me out; with that, I went to the landlady and enquired for a constable, I went away to Marlborough-street; when I returned I shewed him to the runners, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp - Q. When you first came back to the public-house there was some conversation before the note was produced? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, it was impossible for him to understand whether your conversation applied to that note or any other note of five pounds? - A. That note; he acknowledged the note.</p>
               <p>Q. But your previous conversation was not applicable to that any more than any other five pound note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till after he had had some conversation with the landlady that he corrected himself, and said he had it from her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it before he had been the note that he said he had had it from the Duke of Portland's office? - A. Yes, before he had seen it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You told him it was a forged note? - A. The two young fellows had told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew it was a forged note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was given to understand that you were going for a constable-you had said so? - A.Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, notwithstanding, he knew you were going for a constable, upon your returning with a constable, you found him at his lodgings at the public-house? - A. Yes, in the public tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there? - A. There was nobody that heard the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in the public tap-room? - A. Yes, and several persons came in and out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.After the note was produced, did he say any thing about the Duke of Portland's office? - A. He said, he was a King's messenger, several times, and that he had received it as part of his salary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Q. Did he not say, after he had had a conversation with the woman, that he thought he had received it from the Duke of Portland's office? - A. Yes; but then he said the landlady had given it him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After you had shewn him the note, he said, he was a messenger, and had received it is part of his salary-was that before he had had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040032"></xptr>conversation with the landlady, and after he had seen the note? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. I went to Mr. Ashfield's, for a pair of boots, Thomas Phillips desired me go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take that note to him? - A. I took a note, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. The note you produced to Ashfield, you received from Phillips? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PHILLIPS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. I gave the last witness a five pound note to pay for a pair of boots of mine that had been repaired. I met with the prisoner opposite Mr. John's door, about two o'clock in the afternoon of the Monday, I had got a pair of books in my hand, I told him, I was going to sell them; he said, they were not big enough for him, or else he would buy them; I told him, I thought I had a pair that would just suit him; he desired me to fetch them; I said, I could not, they were at the boot-maker's and I had no money; he asked me what I thought they would come to; I said, about ten shillings; the prisoner then gave me the note doubled up, and said, it was a five pound note; I owed Mr. Ashfield a trifle of money, which I was not able to pay, and I asked Mr. Long to go for the boots for me, because I did not like to make free with Crawford's money any further than he had given me toleration to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note you gave Long the same you received from Crawford? - A. Yes; I did not open it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Long came back to you? - A. Yes, he did, in the square, Mr. Ashfield came back with him; I went with them to Mr. John's, to see for the prisoner, we waited till he came; I told him, it was a bad note; he said, he was very sorry for it, he must be the loser.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say where he had taken it? - A. No. There were several people in the taproom; I believe every one in the tap-room might hear the conversation about the note and every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about where he got it from? - A. I understood that he had received it from the Duke of Portland's office, and afterwards, he said, he had found himself quite mistaken, he had it from the landlady.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.All the conversation that passed relative to this note, passed in the public tap-room, did it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And every body near the place might have heard it very plainly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, he had found himself mistaken, he had had it from the landlady? - A. Yes, and the landlady came forward to say it was the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Ashfield). Q. How long was it after you had left the house to go to Marlborough-street, that you came back? - A. It might be fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am one of the officers of Marlborough-street: I went with Mr. Ashfield to a public-house in Marybone-street; the prisoner knew me before I knew him, he asked me how I did; I told him, very well; I asked Mr. Ashfield, where is the man that gave the note to you; he said, he was not here; Mr. Crawford made answer, the note is mine; I said to Crawford, you must give an account how you came by that note; he said, he took it at the Duke of Portland's office, he was one of the King's Messengers. The landlady came forward, and said the note was her's, and he acknowledged he received it from her; I took him into the back parlour, and searched him, but found nothing on him but a sixpence and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any question asked at the Magistrate's before the examination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was it not taken in writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it afterwards put into writing? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went back to Mrs. John, and you had an opportunity of telling her of it, was any person with her? - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he heard what passed? - A. I believe he did. I told Mrs. John, it was a one pound note made into a five pound, and the prisoner at the bar looked at it, but I did not hear him make any observations upon it. Mrs. John said, she must be the loser of it; says I, you will lose but four pounds, and that is better than losing five, but, perhaps you may recollect in a few days where you took it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave her no advice? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. You kept the note about a fortnight? - A. Yes; I had it in my own possession about a week, and then I paid it away to Mrs. Kinsey, she is here.</p>

               <p>CHARLOTTE GRIFFITHS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am going of thirteen years old, the prisoner lodged at my aunt's house, Mrs. John.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being desired by the prisoners to ask your aunt to lend a sum of money? - A. No. On Sunday morning, the 17th of June, he asked me for change for a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the day before he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a ten pound note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was in the habit of borrowing money of Mrs. John? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this desire, did you go up stairs to your aunt? - A. Yes, she was ill at that time in bed; I went up and asked her for change for a ten pound note for Mr. Crawford, and she gave me the keys of the drawers to take it; I took out of the drawer five pounds, four guineas and a half, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a five pound note? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you correct in stating exactly what Crawford said at the time he desired you to go up to your aunt-did he ask for change, or cash, or in any particular way? - A. No; he only asked for change for a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your aunt desire you to pay it in any particular way, or did you take it as you found it? - A. I took it as I found it in the drawer.</p>

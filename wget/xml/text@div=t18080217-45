               <p>Q. Were you at her house in Princes-street on the night of the fire. - A. No, I was there on the next day at noon, I was in her house, I saw the prisoner there; I saw him first at the parlour door, he was standing looking on, but doing nothing; the fire was partly extinguished; the goods were chiefly removed. I afterwards heard a noise, I went up the garret stairs, there I saw the prisoner and another man loaded with things; I ordered them to take them to the room where they took them from, they did; when I came there there was my brother and another person assisting of him. I asked him where the prisoner was taking the things to, the other person said he had ordered the prisoner to take the things to the smith's shop; the prisoner was by and heard him say that; the prisoner then went away with the beadstead; I saw the prisoner afterwards, and hearing it was not delivered, I asked him what he had done with it; in the course of ten minutes I saw him near the ruins, his answer was, that he had taken it to a brokers just by; on asking him what broker's, he said he had not taken it away, two other soldiers had done it; when I found him denying that he had taken it, I insisted upon him being taken to Queen-square. The constable took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his soldier's dress. - A. When he was in the apartment he had a soldier's great coat on; when he returned he had taken it off, and he had a leather apron on.</p>

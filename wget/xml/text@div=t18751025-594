                  </hi>. We carry on business as "Peto Brothers," and I am the manager of the firm and sign cheques—we keep an account with. Messrs. Coutts—this is the old cheque-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) extending from Sep<lb></lb>tember, 1874 to 1875—the prisoner was in our service for about nine months; I am not sure from when till when (<hi rend="italic">referring to cheque book</hi>)—he was in our employ in September, 1874, and was dismissed in June, 1875—he may have been a month or two longer—the body of this cheque is in his hand-writing, that I have no doubt; the signature is an imitation of mine; it is not mine—the prisoner's duty when in our employ with regard to cheques was to fill up the bodies and counterfoils when instructed to do so—on referring to the counterfoil of this cheque I find that the cheque has been filled up against the wrong counterfoil, i.e., he has filled up the counterfoil of (Minson &amp; Locke, and the cheque of Henry Sykes—the next one is filled up to Henry Sykes, the same as the one before—I signed no cheque at that time payable to Henry Sykes—I think we had no transactions with him at that time—the bottom counterfoil I find is filled up "Quinter Colliery Company, for bricks, 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we had transactions with, Collinson &amp; Lock, and the Quinter Colliery Company, at the time—on com<lb></lb>paring the cheques with their proper counterfoils I find some referring to the same thing—the two sums Collinson &amp; Lock, are the same—at March 11th, the whole leaf of counterfoils has been taken out and gummed in, and while out it has been folded in two places—I did not examine the counterfoil book while the prisoner was in our employ—I have looked at it constantly, but not with the idea of auditing it at all—the prisoner had charge of the book—it would be his duty to keep it locked up—no one besides him and myself would have access to it without his knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was instructed to keep it locked up, I think either in the strong room or his own drawer—two of the three cheques <hi rend="italic">composing</hi> the whole leaf, the top and bottom ones, are marked "cancelled"—it was prisoner's duty to fill up cheques when instructed to do so—I believe our accounts are kept in perfect order—the ledger is worked up to the present time—I have not it here; it is daily use—we have a good business and are sometimes very busy—as a rule my manager tells him when a cheque ought to be filled up—he tells him to fill up cheques for those who have sent in their accounts, and he puts ticks against them—I never knew the manager to tell him by mistake to fill up a cheque for an amount already paid—I examine every cheque myself—we have had transactions with Sykes before—I cannot say exactly about the money we "may have owed Sykes previously, it was not 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at all events—we might have owed him a few pounds for re<lb></lb>pairing something—I don't know that Sykes was ever paid from this book at all—I don't think we paid him anything last year.—</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you always pay him by cheque? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Always by cheque—the whole sheet of counterfoils has been torn out—the signature on the cheque in question is a fair imitation of mine—I am not surprised at any cashier at Messrs. Coutts having cashed it, if the prisoner presented it, without looking at it very closely.</p>

The prisoner would draw out a list of the bills sent in, and the amounts, and the manager would examine him as to whether he had tested the bills to see if they were correct, and examine them himself, and put a tick himself—we invariably cross the cheques payable to tradespeople unless they told us they had no banking account, and could not get cash—they are nearly always crossed—I believe the word "cancelled" in the counterfoil is in the prisoner's handwriting—I rather think it is an imitation of mine—it is certainly not mine—it is my invariable custom to cancel any cheque I do not wish to be paid—I tear it up myself—it would not be the duty of the prisoner if a cheque were drawn in error to mark it "cancelled"—I understand the question—he would have no right to do so.</p>

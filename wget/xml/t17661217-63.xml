               <p>Q. What had you done to the women or prisoner to occasion this?</p>
               <p>Dale. I had done nothing at all; I almost lost my senses; I recovered my senses, and heard somebody speak; somebody came up that knew me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you?</p>
               <p>Dale. I never heard him speak a word, neither did the women speak to me at all; the woman that stood by him was picking my pocket; I desired the people to take notice of the woman and the prisoner; he went away, and I came home to my master's house, and three days after he was taken up by a warrant; I attended at Sir John Fielding's office; there he said he was at Chelsea at the time I was knocked down; my sight is quite lost of one eye; I had a surgeon attended me about six weeks, but he could not recover my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not at first indict the prisoner for an assault upon you?</p>
               <p>Dale. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And afterwards the misfortune of your eye happened, (which is a misfortune) you indicted him for a capital offence?</p>
               <p>Dale. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Dale. At that time I was very bad.</p>

               <p>Dale. I had heard of the act of parliament before.</p>

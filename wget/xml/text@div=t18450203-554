                  </hi>. I am the wife of Stephen Sandwell, a licensed victualler, at Woolwich—on the 8th of Jan. a man brought the prisoner to our house, representing her as his wife—they remained there that night, and the prisoner breakfasted with me the next morning—I was in want of my watch about eleven o'clock, and could not find it—I had placed it in the bottom of the cradle, in the bar-parlour, where we breakfasted—I complained of the loss, and turned everything out of the cradle to look for it—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030144"></xptr>
               <p>then ran to the yard to ask my husband if he had taken it, and during that time the prisoner contrived to tear a hole in the pillow-case, and put it in there—when I came back to the room I went to look again—I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the things that were in the cradle on the ground—the prisoner took up the pillow and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it on the ground, and said "There is something in the piliow, there is a hole here"—I put my hand in, and there I found the watch—I then told her to walk out of ray place directly—I swear that there was no hole in the pillow-case when I put the watch in the cradle—the pillow-case had the appearance of being torn down the seam part of it—it was made of calico—I missed a habit<lb></lb>shirt and a handkerchief—I asked the prisoner about them—she walked about the place, and said she had not got them—I saw her take the habit<lb></lb>shirt out of her bosom, and put it into the pot where the clean clothes were boiling on the fire, and she stirred it down with the stick—she had taken it from the dirty clothes where the woman was washing, but I did not see her do that—I found it in the pot—she had incurred the expense of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at my house—I had left this handkerchief in the parlour, and found it there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What took place after I breakfasted with you in the par<lb></lb>lour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Conversation—I drank some gin and water with you—about eleven o'clock I said, "What time is it?"—I did not say "I will see what time it is by my watch," nor say to my servant, "Do you know where I put my watch last night when I came home late with your master?"—I said, "I want my watch," and I could not find it—I allowed you to dine with me at one o'clock, because you said you did not do anything of the kind—you said you would go in fits if I accused you of such a thing—I did not say that my husband ill-treated me, and I wished he was dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Her husband came in and saw us drink gin and water; she said, "If I did not have a drop I should be dead;" I remained eating and drinking with her; it was six o'clock before she gave me into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I gave her in charge the same day—I did not hold any com<lb></lb>panionship with her—the gentleman that brought her said she was his wife—it was between eleven and twelve o'clock that the habit-shirt was boiled, about the same time that I found the hole in the pillow-case—I had do gin and water after that—between that and dinner-time I had work to do, and she remained in the room—about four o'clock she ran away down to Charlton, and I spoke to a policeman who was going by, and he went in search of her—she said she had plenty of money, and had left her situa<lb></lb>tion in town, to come to see after her husband, and if I would let her stay there a day or two, she should be obliged to me—my husband and I and the prisoner were the persons at dinner—the man who came with her did not have any with us—she took him some dinner in the parlour—the girl has lost a silk handkerchief, which the officers found on the prisoner—I had only drank out of one glass of gin and water—that was between nine and ten o'clock, before breakfast—I supplied some after, but I did not take any.</p>

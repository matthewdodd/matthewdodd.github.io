               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How long before had you received the information from Neale? A. I should think three minutes, but the first information was some days before - I had not known Neale till I was connected with him in this case; I believe he had left the prisoner's room just before we went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the wife, in your presence, say to Marchant, "Did my husband stamp it?" and did not he answer, "No, Neale stamped it?" A. I did not hear it, and believe that it is not true; I was in the room all the time, and swear I do not believe any such thing passed; I did not know Marchant before he and Neale were introduced to me by Ellis; I believe information had been given to him - a person came in who called himself the prisoner's brother-in-law; I believe his name is Kay- he gave me his card; he was not in the room all the time - I was there before him; I think Wintle went out and got some candles to search before he came - it might be five or six minutes before he came; the prisoner was handcuffed before he came in - I am not aware of the Goldsmiths' Company offering any reward for convictions of offences of this sort; I shall be very glad if it is so -I expect to be paid for my time; I never heard of a reward from the Stamp-office, except it was offered before by public print - I have been an officer twenty years; I have no recollection of seeing any watch-movements in the prisoner's room; I found some cases, which he said he had to do for Mr. Fox.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Fox? A. I did not; he has been pointed out to me since with a great many more in the neighbourhood of Bow-street, as a person in the habit of passing these things off - he was in a public-house in Russell-street, on the day the prisoner was examined; witnesses very seldom frequent that house - it is the Albion; it is rather too respectable for witnesses such as they appeared, but they were watched there.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 21st of June I accompanied Ruthven to New-court, to the first floor front room - the prisoner was there, a woman, who states herself to be his wife, and Marchant; I saw Ruthven find the mug and spoon, but did not see him find the dies - Kay, who called himself the prisoner's brother-in-law, came in; we might then have been there five or ten minutes - I saw a basin on the table, with liquid in it; I put a stick into it, to see if there was any thing at the bottom of it, and in the course of the evening I perceived the colour of my coat and trousers had discharged, but I did not at the time know I had spilled any of it on them; I found two punches, but not those in question.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. What have you done with them? A. Here they are - I do not know whether they are used by a watch-movement maker; I believe there is a kind of stamp on them, but what it is I cannot say - I do not remember the woman saying any thing to Marchant; she might without my hearing it - I was searching the room; I did not hear Marchant use Neale's name - he might do so without my hearing it; Kay was detained in the room till we had searched - he might be there a quarter of an hour; the first information I received of this was from the solicitor of stamps, or some person in his office - I am not certain whether it was Mr. Wintle or Mr. Tilsby, both of whom belong to the solicitors' office; the next conversation I had was with Neale - I did not know him before; he calls himself a wind-instrument maker - I was never at his residence; I saw Neale and Marshall two or three times on the day, I went to the prisoner's house - I know they had been together a few days before I went to the prisoner's house - they did not appear to have been acquainted when I first saw them together.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you know whether their acquaintance had been much or little? A. I understood they had not been acquainted, till Marchant was employed to go with Neale.</p>

            . I make keys for wind-instruments. I have known the prisoner since April; I had been at his lodgings several times before the 21st of June. On Sunday, the 20th of June, I bespoke some spoons of him; I called on him at eight o'clock on Monday morning and was to have them at twelve - I called at twelve; he said he had been to Petticoat-lane, and could not get any there- he said he had seen a pot in Playhouse-yard, and would go and get that; I went with him - he went into a shop; I stood at the threshold of the door - he pointed to a pot in the window, and asked me if that would do; I said just as he thought proper, (the pot produced is the same) - I saw him buy it, and when he was in the shop he bought a table-spoon and two tea-spoons; I did not know he was going to buy them till I saw them in his hand when he came out of the shop - I returned with him to his lodging, but left before the officers went in; they were stationed at the Black-Bull public-house near - I was present when Marchant received two half-crowns at that house; he went to the prisoner's lodging alone, I staid at the corner of the court - the prisoner's wife went out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080051"></xptr>after Marchant had been up there; I went part of the way with her - she went to buy some binding-wire, as she said when she returned; she was sent out again by her husband for some punches, which, I believe, were never out of the house, for I had seen them in the house that morning on the board - the punches were produced after that, and I saw the prisoner take up a table-spoon, take the punches in his hand, put the iron on his knee, and put the stamps on the spoon with three of the punches - I then went out as if to get some liquor, and the officers went in directly; I remained at the public-house - no mark was put on the mug while I was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first go to any person respecting this business? A. On the 29th of April, I was going to Goldsmiths'-hall, but asked an officer whom I met, to go with me - Nicholls, an officer of Battle-bridge station, was the first person I named it to; he is here -I gave information because I knew he was doing wrong, for I had been to Goldsmiths'-hall with my master's work, who was a jeweller; after seeing Nicholls I went to Goldsmiths'-hall - they sent me to the Stamp-office at Somerset-house; I was not at work as a wind-instrument maker at that time - I left that trade about a year ago; at the time in question I had left Mr. Wood in Harrow-road - he keeps a tavern and eating-house; I used to attend the company in the gardens for an honest living -I was pot-boy; I had been a pot-boy for two years before this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not tell me this instant that you had left the wind-instrument key-making twelve months ago? A. Twelve months or two years, I do not know the time exactly - it might be a year and a half that I was a potboy; I worked at wind-instrument key making for Mr. Rexter - he retired from the business, and took the Marquis of Cornwallis; I left him before he took that house - he may have had it six months or more; when I worked for him he lived in Nevill's-court, Fetter-lane, and East Harding-street afterwards - it is two years since I did business for him, to the best of my recollection, but I made no memorandum; I worked for him a long time - I lived with Mr. Stevens, a jeweller, in Hatton-garden; I have followed no other trades - I beg your pardon, I was a baker; I forgot that just at the moment - I was apprenticed to a baker, but did not serve my time out, as master ill-used me; he nearly broke my neck with a fire-shovel - I have seen his journeyman here; I have lived pot-boy to Mr. Sims in St. John-street, and to Mr. Tucker opposite him, and a Mr. Lane who came to the house when Sims left - I only remained with him to see that things were right and show him the customers - I did not exactly live with him - he did not turn me out for stealing tobacco and sugar; he did not dismiss me on that charge - he would not pay my wages; I summoned him to Kingsgate-street - if I had robbed him why not take me before a Justice? he did not turn me away nor make a charge against me - Tucker did not turn me away; I and my fellow servant had a bit of a to-do and I left - I was washing after dinner, my fellow servant was rather intoxicated and dipped my head into a bowl of water, I threw the bowl at him and it caused a to-do; my indentures were cancelled at Hatton-garden, as I told the Magistrate I had hardly any food, only a halfpennyworth of cheese and no tea - I was never at a Police-office on any other occasion; I was once a witness - I was never taken to Hatton-garden on a charge of attempting to stab my mistress, nor for embezzlement; I went there to cancel my indentures - my mistress came forward and said I had never paid her for some bread; she was subject to fits and often out of her mind - the Magistrate told her to pull off her bonnet, and she had two caps on; she charged a young woman with stealing her cap - she was a very good mistress, but subject to fits; she did not charge me with threatening to stab her - I did not take the punch to the prisoner's lodging; I never bought a punch for two-pence - I never produced one to the prisoner and asked him if it was King Charles' head, nor did he say it was more like King George; I did not take a salt-spoon from my pocket and stamp it with the punch, to see what impression it made - I have been in the prisoner's room with Kay; the prisoner stamped many a spoon before him - I do not know a woman named Plunket; there was a woman in his room sometimes besides his wife - he would do nothing before her; she was not an acquaintance of mine, she lived in the house - she came into the room on the 21st of June to fetch her child out, not for hot water; I was then sitting down, doing nothing - I was not scraping a spoon; the prisoner was at tea - if the woman came for hot water I was not there; I do not remember the child playing with the mug upon the floor - she did not see me scraping the spoon, and say I was industrious; the prisoner was cautious, as an officer lived on the other side of the way, and he partly knew of the transaction, seeing so many bad characters go up and down.</p>
               <p>Q.How did you become acquainted with the prisoner? A. I met a friend, named Jones, who lived in Sutton-street - he took me to a public-house, where I met one Rodwell, who had worked for my master; I asked what he was about - he said, "Why don't you do as I do?" I said, "Do what" - he pulled out a ring, and said, "Look at that;" I took it, and having been in the line, rubbed it, and it was silver gilt, with the hall mark on it - I knew by the weight and sound that it was not gold - he kicked up a to-do about my rubbing it; I named it to Mr. Nicholls - he said, "Purchase it, and take it to Somerset-house;" they told me to purchase another, and another, which I did - this man used to make them; I was introduced to him by Rodwell; I believe the people at Somerset-house could not do any thing in it, because they were made from the handles of silver teaspoons, with the hall marks on them, and then gilt over - he used to file them out; I had been in communication with the solicitor since May - what I got there was very trifling - 2s. 9d. at a time, to purchase rings, but nothing myself.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were not carrying on trade then, how did you live? A. My wife was carrying on trade - I did not get a farthing from Somerset-house; I expect to be paid for my time; when they could do nothing about the rings, they paid me for my time - I had 3l. 12s. 6d. when it was over, but when I was purchasing the rings I only had 2s. 9d. at a time. (Here the witness referred to a memorandum.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand-writing? A.Part of it - I was only looking at the date when the other business about the rings ended - the date is not on it; this was written by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080052"></xptr>Mr. Ivers, the officer, as he can write better than me - I can read it, but shall not let you look at it; I will show it to any gentleman but you.</p>
               <p>COURT. If that is introduced as evidence, the Counsel has a right to it - (Witness handed it in.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do I understand you to say you received no more from Somerset-house except 3l. odd? A. I had money to purchase things - it is all down in that memorandum; I bought about half a dozen spoons of him - they were salt, mustard, and egg spoons; I had money now and then, as I gave him a drop of something to drink - it is all down there.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this 10l. 5s. summed up on the paper? A. I had 3l. 12s. 9d., Nicholls 3l., and Ellis 3l. 7s.; I commenced the second business at Somerset-house on the 10th of June - I received 5s., and 5s., 2s. 6d., and 10s., to buy spoons with, and 5s., and on the 21st of June 1l. - that was to buy spoons, and for what I wanted; I could not be out all day, and have nothing to eat or drink - there might be eight spoons; I bought a pair of buckles of him, and a watch and case, which amounted to 15s. - the mark put on it was so small.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, have you not been endeavouring, from the beginning to the end, to trepan this man for the purpose of getting money for yourself? A. No, I have not -I did it for the sake of my King and country, not to get any thing for myself; when I mentioned it to the officer he would not let me leave it, or I should have declined it; I have worked since the 10th of May at blocking bonnets for my wife - it is just ironing a bonnet over; I expect to be paid for my time - I do not expect they will give me much, except half a crown a day, or something for my trouble; they paid me before at the rate of 2s. 6d. a day - I believe that is all I got; it is down there - I cannot recollect how many days I was employed for them; I live at No. 44, Ironmonger-row, St. Lukes, at Mr. Hills, a watch-case maker - that is not the prisoner's trade; he used to buy watch-cases in Petticoat-lane - there were watch-movements at his place; he used to take watch-cases to pieces, and do them up again for people to go out and trepan others with them - I recollect, a long time ago, his coming into a public-house and selling me a ticket, and on taking out the watch it turned out to be bad; I did not recollect him till he mentioned this to me - I never heard of the Goldsmiths' Company offering a reward for things of this sort; I never gave information against any body but the prisoner - my wife pays the rent of my lodging; I meant, from my first acquaintance with the prisoner, to give information at the hall against him - I did pretend friendship and kindness to him, and deceived him in every step I took; I did not do it for the purpose of gain, but for the good of Goldsmiths'-hall - he ought to be a man of property, from the trade he carried on; I knew a man, named Finney - I never lived with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you leave the neighbourhood of St. John-street? A.Because I heard of another place, and went to it - that was my only reason; when I lived there this man bought a watch - it did not go well; he asked me to buy it - I said I did not want one; I knew a man named Whittington would do it up cheap, and made a bargain to give him 5s. a week for it - I gave him 5s., and being out of work never settled with him, but I intend to do it; I did not pay him out of what I had at Somerset-house, as I expect my wife to be put to bed every day - he did not threaten to charge me with fraud: Nicholls introduced me to Marchant when this business first commenced - I saw him in Ruthven's company, about the spoons; Marchant is a very respectable cabinet-maker and undertaker, he lives at Pentonville; he accompanied me to the house to bear witness of this transaction - I cannot say whether he was examined at the Police-office; he was concerned in the ring business, and went to Somerset-house, but I had the best part of the money - he had money to purchase for himself, nothing else, except if he wanted any thing extra for being out.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q.Have you received any thing whatever from Somerset-house, except to purchase these things, and for your time? A. No, it will not make the least difference to me whether the prisoner is convicted or acquitted.</p>

I was introduced to Neale in April, by Nicholls, the beadle - I first saw the prisoner in St. John-street, in the street; I went to his lodgings at different times with Neale, who introduced me to him - I saw him next at his own house, where I went at different times; I was there with Neale on the 21st of June, when he was taken - I went with Neale to the public-house where the officers were, and received two half-crowns from them; I went back to the prisoner's house, and gave them both to his wife in his presence, and she went out - I saw the prisoner take the spoon off the board where it lay with some others, and put it on a flat-iron; he took something out of a tin-box and stamped what he took out of the box - it was like a file; I saw him make three different impressions on the spoon, which the officer afterwards found - he wrapped the things he made the impression with, up in paper, and threw them into a chair alongside where he sat - they were there when the officer came in, and he took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose it was by mere accident that you happened to be there? A. No, it was not; I follow the cabinet business in a respectable way - this took me out of my business; I left nobody to attend to my business - it was at a stand on this occasion for about three months; I do not know that it will be any particular loss to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What will make it up to you? A. Why, renuming the character of the people I work for - I mean by getting it back again; I am deficient in learning - I mean, by going to the parties I worked for, and getting them to give it me back; I engaged in this by Nicholls, the street-keeper's order, not as a friend of his, but as a friend to my King and country - he asked me to go with Neale, and see if it was as he had said; I left my business, and let it stand still, out of love to my King and country - I have received between 1l. and 2l.; this is the first time I ever embarked in such business - I am a master cabinet-maker; I got the money from Ellis, the officer, at his house, and some from my wife, who is a laundress; and for jobs I did in my trade - my business at home was standing still; I went out jobbing on my own account - I got 2l. from Somerset-house; I did not think of that at the moment - I had the 2l. from Somerset-house, to get a few things to put on my back to appear decent in Court; I have on part of the clothes I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080053"></xptr>bought - I got that 2l. about a week ago; I received no other money at Somerset-house - I never got any with Neale, I am sure; I went there with him six or seven times, and saw the solicitor - he caused one of the clerks in the office to give me the 2l.; I do not mean that he told him to give it me, to make me appear decent in Court - I do not know what he gave it to me for, but I wanted to go decent - I have been living at my wife's expence since April; I have had nothing from Somerset-house except this 2l. - I did not give my business up, only part of it; I am an undertaker and upholsterer - I do not know any other trade that I have carried on; I did not agree with Nicholls that I was to get money for this - he never employed me before; I have been to the prisoner's house a dozen times about the spoons - I had some more spoons of him, and there were some rings in April; I got no money from Somerset-house for that, nor did Neale to my knowledge; I went to the prisoner's three or four times about the rings, and to Somerset-house a dozen times, but never asked for money there till a few days ago, nor do I expect to get any there - I did this out of love to my country, but I find I must stand to my business; I do not expect a farthing more than I have had, nor do I want my expences - I do not know what I might take as a gift if it was offered.</p>

            . I live in Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street, and am a broker. On the 21st of January the prisoner came to my house, between two and four o'clock, with Neale - there was a small mug hanging in my window; the prisoner came in, and asked to look at it - I took it down, and gave it to him; he made a sort of signal to Neale, who was outside, and he came in - he handed the mug to him, and asked what he thought of it; the words that passed between them was "It will do", or something to that effect - he asked the price; I said 6d. - the prisoner paid me, and asked if I had any more plated articles, had I a spoon - I had one; my wife said she had two teaspoons, which were produced, and put towards them - they came to 6d.; they each looked at them - the prisoner said to Neale, "You will want one;" the prisoner said to Neale, "You shall pay 4d. for that, and I will pay 2d. for the two tea-spoons" - the prisoner paid for the spoons and mug; they put them into their pockets, but which took the table-spoon I cannot say; this is the mug - it had no mark when I sold it; and this is the table spoon, but it had no mark; the plate was not so much off the handle as it is now, but the bowl is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Neale carry away one of the spoons, at all events? A. I cannot say that - the prisoner would not buy the mug till he referred to Neale to know if it would do, and the spoon was given into his hands for his approbation.</p>

            . I am an inspector of stamps, and have been a silversmith. I was present with the officers when the prisoner was apprehended - I saw some watch-cases in the room; this mug, spoon, and punches were found in a chair in the room - I have examined them - this flat iron was found there; there was a brown pan, which contained a liquid - we call it a pickle in the trade; it is used as a wash to colour plate or copper - it produces a white colour like silver on copper; it will give base metal the appearance of silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it will have that effect? A. I have seen it used before; I was appointed inspector by the commissioners of stamps - I never saw Neale or Marchant till they came to Somerset-house, to give information of improper practices going on; Neale came first with Nicholls, the officer - I went in, and informed the solicitor, who gave instructions to the officers; I did not hear the first instructions given - I had several interviews with them afterwards; I knew they were employed to detect this man in the forgery - there was no reward whatever to be given; they asked for nothing at the time - they have had money to purchase articles; but I do not think they have had any money given them to live on yet; they were paid for their time in detecting the previous job - I cannot exactly say how much Marchant was paid, but I believe 5s. a day; I think they were each paid alike - there was an end of the first job, and then they came and gave further information; I knew they were employed to detect the prisoner - Neale knew him before he gave the information. I succeeded my family in the business of silversmith - I was in custody before I was employed as an inspector; it was in 1820 I think - I was charged with a similar offence to this, but it was investigated.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it was through the activity of your daughter that the bill against you was thrown out? A. I swear positively my children had nothing to do with it - my eldest child is now only eighteen: I was in custody about three weeks, and was out on bail - before that I was in Clerkenwell prison, and was advised it was not worth while to trouble my friends for bail for so short a time; nobody was charged with me - my father was taken up and tried, but not with me; it was some years ago, when I was quite young - I did not enter into league with these witnesses.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q.What was the first transaction? A. They gave information respecting some silver-gilt rings which the prisoner was making as gold; the officers had money to purchase several, and for the loss of their time; they were paid by the cashier in the solicitor's department - I believe an order was made by the commissioners that they should be paid; I did not see them paid, and have no exact knowledge what it was; I was present when an arrangement was made what they should receive a day - the rings was not a case exactly under the stamp-laws; the pawnbrokers should have procceded against them for fraud; I believe it is now under their consideration. My case was investigated, and the Grand Jury threw out the bill - I was immediately taken into the employ of the Stamp-office; it originated out of a great deal of jealousy in the trade, and was not a prosecution by the Stamp-office, but by the Goldsmiths' Company; they were in correspondence with the Stamp-office - the late Mr. Sykes attended, and immediately after the prosecution I was taken into the service of the solicitor.</p>

            . I am an engraver, and live in Trinity-square, Tower-hill. I am employed by the commissioners of stamps to engrave the King's head on punches to mark gold and silver, and also by the Goldsmiths' Company -(looking at the punches) here is one with a head; this was not made by me; I cannot say it much resembles mine; persons who did not know much about it would take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080054"></xptr>it for the King's head - here is another with a head; it is a mail punch, which is sunk into this to produce the impression - one is used to make the impression on the other, and on receiving the impression it is used to mark the plate; one is concave, and the other convex; this was not made by me - I make all the punches entirely with my own hands, not by others under my inspection; I know of nobody else who makes for the government.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do they appear to be counterfeits made to resemble yours, and to produce an impression similar to yours? A.When they are put on plate I have no doubt persons would be deceived.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Look at this spoon? A. Here is a head on it, which is impressed from this punch - this would deceive persons not conversant with it, but silversmiths would perceive it immediately, I suppose - it would deceive persons not acquainted with the form of my punch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Which mark do you call the impression of the King's head? A. The centre one; I cannot see a likeness of the king on it - if I saw it on a piece of copper I should undoubtedly say it was a head, but silversmiths or judges ought to know it was not genuine - it is very bad.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Does it appear to you to be an imitation of the genuine stamp? A. I hardly know how to answer - the arrangement of the stamps is quite different from the Goldsmiths' Company's; they do not stand in the same order - I think it would deceive persons not conversant, but it is so badly done, it hardly bears a resemblance.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it likely to impose on a person buying a spoon, as a stamp denoting that it was silver? A. Yes, I think so.</p>

            . I am senior assayer to the Goldsmith's Company, and have been there twenty years. I am in the habit of using their punches daily: I do not stamp plate now, but have done it - the mark on this spoon is not a genuine impression of any punch made for the Company; I consider it a resemblance of the punch of the King's head used by them; and such as would deceive the public, though not a person conversant with the marks; the Company employ nobody but Mr. Smith to make their punches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say this is not merely two bumps, and not any resemblance of a head? A. It is as much a resemblance of a head as most forged marks.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Is it what you in the trade call a counterfeit of the King's head? A. Yes.</p>

            . My husband is a flour-porter to Ambridge and West, of St. John-street - I live in the same house as the prisoner. On the 21st of June I went into his room for some hot water for tea, my child was there with me - the prisoner's wife and Marshall, as I call him, was there; I saw Neale there - the prisoner was not there then; Neale had a half-pint pot and a table-spoon in his hand - Marshall sat still in a chair; Neale was cleaning the spoon and scraping it; I said, "You had better turn housemaid as you are cleaning a spoon;" he then looked at Marshall and laughed; I could swear to the spoon which he had - after that my child was playing with the pot - that is the very pot and that the spoon; the child was on the floor -I was going to take the pot out of its hands, as I was going down stairs, and Mrs. Bispham said, "Don't take the pot out of the child's hands, let him play with it;" he had come in while I was there; Neale said to the prisoner,"Will you have a drop of gin?" he made no answer; Neale went to the cupboard, took a bottle, and went out for the gin; I went down stairs, and afterwards heard an alarm of the officers.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q.About what time was this? A. About half-past six o'clock; I got my hot water and went out - Neale was coming in with the gin as I went down stairs - he was alone: I had sat there a few minutes waiting for the water to boil - I was in the room as good as half an hour waiting for the water; Neale came in in ten minutes, and the prisoner ten minutes after him - I was often in their room, and frequently saw Neale there and Marchant; I have seen the prisoner at work cleaning watches - I never saw him at work on rings or spoons; I saw him solder a ring which I had picked up - that was the same afternoon; I never saw any thing in his room but watches, and the inside of watches - I was never in the room before when Neale and Marshall were there; I have seen them pass up and down, and have answered them often when they have been out; I never saw them in the room before the Monday; I have lived there since Christmas - the prisoner was there at that time; I first saw Neale there a week or two ago, I think, but cannot say exactly. I was standing outside, holding my baby up in my arms to Bispham, when the officers came; I had not been drinking - I have seen the prisoner cleaning watch-cases - he cleaned a watch for my husband; I have seen watch-cases in the room with the works which he cleaned - the officer came in five or six minutes after I met Neale on the stairs; he had said he would go out for more gin, but I was not there then.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember seeing Neale go out after bringing in the gin? A. I did; I was standing at the door - he was out when the officer came.</p>
               <p>ROBERT KAY. I am the prisoner's cousin; a few days before the prisoner was taken - I saw Neale in the prisoner's room; he showed me a punch - it was in the morning; he took it out of his pocket, and said it was the head of King Charles, and that he had bought it at an old iron shop for 2d.; the prisoner looked at it, and said it was

             the 4th. - Neale pulled two spoons out of his pocket, and marked one first with it - he stamped it on one of the spoons to see the impression; I am certain he is the person who brought the punch into the room - he pulled it out of his waistcoat pocket; the prisoner is a watch-frame maker - that is all the works inside; I am in the watch line.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you ever work with him?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080055"></xptr>A. No, nor assist; I now work at Wandsworth in the engineer line - I worked at the watch business about a week ago; I worked with my father for three or four years - he is a watch-maker, and lives at No.22, Eagle-court, St. John's-lane; I often go to the prisoner's to see him, he being my cousin and only companion - I was there every night, and two or three times a day; I live within two or three stones' throw of him - I never saw him at work on rings; I have seen rings in the room often, many; he bought them to sell again - from what I understand they were gold; he used to buy them of Mr. Sell, of Barbican; I might take one of them up - I knew there were marks on them, for I bought one of him about six weeks ago, just before I was married - it was in pledge for 5s. - he gave me the duplicate; I have seen him pawn one or two rings when I have been up and down there - I have seen watch-cases in the room, metal, silver, and all manner of cases; he had jobs to do to them for people - he had the movements and all with them; he polished the cases up, when he put the works in, he has just brushed them up; we generally brush them up when we have them to repair; I never sold rings or watch-cases for him to my knowledge; I cannot call it to memory - I never pawned any for him; I should not like to swear I never sold any, but I cannot remember it; a duplicate of a suit of clothes was found in his possession which I claimed - I had left the duplicate there; I was going to get them out on Saturday night, but my wife was disappointed in getting the money; they were pawned for 12s.; and a duplicate of a waistcoat was found, which I claimed - I have seen spoons there at tea time, and I saw that spoon and salt-spoons, but no others; I never saw him do any thing to spoons; I do not know what they were there for - they were of a copper colour, yellow; I did not afterwards see them white; I saw this spoon there the day he was taken; I went there about eleven or half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, staid about half an hour, returned between one and two, and saw the prisoner and Neale come in with it - Neale had bought that and the pot in Playhouse-yard; the pot he said was for his child - and then I went to work about a quarter to two o'clock; the spoon was put on the table - I went there again when the officers were in the place.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You saw the spoon there the day he was taken, but not before? A. Not before; I think my brother was handcuffed after I entered the room.</p>

               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. Did you ever hear him examined on oath? A. Yes, at the Court of Requests; he summoned me for wages which he said were due to him; he recovered them by giving representations to the Court, which I afterwards found to be untrue - that is one reason why I would not believe him; I lost property at various times while he was with me, and when I discharged him I would not let him go up to his room - the servant brought his things down, and under his bed found a great quantity of tobacco and sugar, I have no doubt he concealed it; nobody but him occupied the room, and he received money on my account and kept it - I gave the Court of Requests a list of monies he said were coming to me; I went with the officer to several places - no such persons lived there, and at the rest I found he had received the money, and never paid it over to me; before I got home from the Court he went to a customer, and demanded a debt - he insisted on their paying him and not me; I lost 3l. by these transactions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is your opinion founded on your observation of his general conduct and character? A. It is; his character is exceedingly immoral and bad.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker, and live in Rosamond-street, Clerkenwell. I remember Neale in the service of Mr. Collins, a baker - he was taken to Hatton-garden, and his mistress charged him with threatening to stab her with a knife; I remember it well - and his master charged him with embezzling money; I suppose he was taken to Hatton-garden as many as five times - his master at last applied to the Magistrate to cancel his indentures, which was done at Mr. Collins' request, and not his own. I would not believe him on his oath.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. Do you know of his having been beaten by his master? A. Yes, but he well deserved it - he went himself to the office, and complained of that; his indentures were not cancelled for that, but his bad behaviour - his mistress was subject to fits; his mistress had not two caps on at the office; she was not desired to take her bonnet off that I know of - she charged him with threatening to stab her; I was a witness - he did not attempt it; it was a threat.</p>

               <p>There was another indictment against the prisoner, for a similar offence, but no evidence was offered.</p>

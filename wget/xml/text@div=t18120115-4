            , KNT. Q. Have you for many years past employed the prisoner at the bar as your <rs id="t18120115-4-deflabel24" type="occupation">stock-broker</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18120115-4-defend99 t18120115-4-deflabel24"></join> - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe sir, in the course of the last summer you made a purchase or a contract of a large estate - A. I did, in the month of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the month of August apprise Mr. Walsh of your having made that purchase - A. I did, I told him that I had made the contract for the purchase of the estate, which I expected to be completed on the ensuing Michaelmas, and then to be called upon for the payment of it, for which it would be necessary to make provision by the sale of stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advise him that the amount of stock would be large - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consult with Mr. Walsh of selling the stock then, or deferring the sale until the time that you made the payment - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time in August what advice did Mr. Walsh give you - A. To postpone the sale of the stock saying that the prospect was that the stocks would considerably rise, that it would recover from the oppression it had suffered gradually, therefore the longer it was postponed the better.</p>
               <p>Q. The contract is not yet completed. Did you in the hourse of that morning tell him the execution of the contract was not completed - A. I am not sure whether I communicated that to him, but in the middle of the month of November Mr. Walsh urged me strongly to sell the stock, and at that time I certainly told him that the contract was not completed and that at present I had no occasion for the money, and it was quite uncertain when I should; I believe I said that it was probable it would not be completed before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Walsh give you any other reason for selling the stock - A. At an early period, for the want of money he told me it was his opinion that the stock would fall considerably; he urged the advice repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Q. By repeatedly do you mean different days - A. Different days, and at one of these times I very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150012"></xptr>well remember he stated to me to be the opinion of intelligent persons at the stock exchange that the 3 per cent. stocks would be low as 50.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time I believe sir they were about 62 or 63 - A. I believe so. He came to my chambers at Lincolns Inn for the purpose of repeating the advice, and he wrote notes (I have looked for them, they are lost, I cannot find them) for the purpose of immediate sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, sir, in consequence of this advice, on the 28th of November, give Mr. Walsh any advice to sell the stock - A. I wrote a note for that purpose on the 28th of November; I have not got that note now.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of stock did you authorise Mr. Walsh to sell - A. I think it was thirteen thousand in the 4 per cents. and eighteen thousand six hundred three per cents. reduced.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that was on the Thursday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Friday morning did you go into the city to Mr. Walsh's office - A. I did. I saw him, he told me that he had made a contract for the sale of that sum, and asked me whether I could come for the transfer of it on the Wednesday or Thursday following, saying it would be necessary to give notice before on what day I should come for the purpose, in order that the purchaser might have notice, and be prepared with his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he assign any reason why you were not to deliver the stock that day, or any other day - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you gone there for the purpose of selling that stock if he had done it that day - A. That was the only reason for which I went, and to purchase exchecquer bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that day had any thing passed between you and Mr. Walsh - A. I had consulted with him what was to be done when it was sold, until I paid for the estate what would be the best way of disposing of or placing the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Mr. Walsh told you would be the best way of disposing of your money - A. In exchecquer bills, the advice which he repeated to me on Friday the 29th. I believe I should mention that before I authorised Mr. Walsh to sell out the stock I had mentioned my intention to a commercial gentleman, who gave the same advice to sell the stock.</p>
               <p>COURT. To sell the stock and to place it in any thing of exchecquer bills - A. No. But certainly the idea of selling the stock at all premature was entirely oweing to Mr. Walsh, without which probably I should not have sold it to this hour, as I had no occasion for the money for any other purpose than paying for that estate.</p>
               <p>Q. After your return home did you find a letter from Mr. Walsh - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the letter - A. It is the letter, I believe it to be the hand-writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(The letter read.)</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday or Tuesday did you write a note to Mr. Walsh for your going into the city to transfer the stock - A. I did, either on Monday the 2d, or Tuesday the 3d. I have not got the note. I appointed Wednesday to be the day to tranfer the stock.</p>
               <p>Q. On Wednesday did you attend accordingly and transfer the stock with Mr. Walsh your broker - A. I did. I went into the city for the purpose of completeing the whole business, to transfer the stock, and to purchase exchecquer bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Walsh furnish you with exchecquer bills on that day - A. He did not, he told me it was too late to get exchecqur bills that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What was to be done with the money for the sale of your stock - A. I left him to receive it, and to pay it into my bankers, which he said he should do.</p>
               <p>Q. Your bankers are Messrs. Gosling and Sharpe, in Fleet-street - A. Yes. He told me he should call on me at my chambers in Lincolns Inn for the purpose of receiving a check upon my bankers for the money, in order that it might be laid out in exchecquer bills on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning did he wait on you at Lincolns Inn for that purpose - A. He did, soon after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him a check on your bankers - A. I did, I gave him a check on my bankers for twenty-two thousand two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. That exceeded by some hundreds what you sold - A. It did. The produce of the stock sold was twenty-one thousand seven hundred pounds, I made it up twenty-two thousand two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you give that check on your bankers of twenty-two thousand two hundred pounds - A. For the purpose of being laid out in exchecquer bills, and for no other purpose; and he promised to lay out the money in that manner, and to bring the exchecquer bills to my bankers or myself at four o'clock that day. This was Thursday the 5th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you on the afternoon of that day - A. He came to me about half past four or a quarter before five at Lincoln's Inn, he appeared a little out of breath; he came up stairs and complained of an asthma; he said he had the disease of which his father had died. I persuaded him to sit down and not to converse until he had recovered. After a little pause he produced a paper to me; that is the paper he produced to me, giving me the account of what he had done for me that day. This is the accompt of the stock sold, and the exchecquer bills that he had purchased.</p>
               <p>(The paper read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Walsh furnish you with the accompt of whom you had bought these exchecquer bills for fifteen thousand pounds - A. He did; the fifteen thousand pounds exchecquer bills of Mr. Coutts's broker. I think he mentioned Mr. Trotter, but I am not certain. He stated that they could not be delivered on that day because they were locked up in a drawer, but they were to be delivered at half an hour after three o'clock on Saturday the 7th, the next day but one, and that he should call on me that day at three o'clock to receive a check upon my bankers for the money to pay for the exchecquer bills, he having, as he stated, paid into the bankers that money, the fifteen thousand pounds into the bankers, Messrs. Gosling and Sharpe, he produced a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. They were your bankers for the exchecquer bills - A. Yes. Mr. Walsh left me in a short time;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150013"></xptr>after enquiring after my family he left my chambers.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Walsh was gone did you find there was no receipt at your bankers for the fifteen thousand five hundred pounds - A. I perceived there was no receipt for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which I believe you went down to your bankers and made some enquiry - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning I believe you went to Mr. Walsh's office - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe you found he was gone - A. I did not see him. I never saw him afterwards untill I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that he made an appointment for the money to pay Mr. Coutts's broker that money on that Saturday, did you receive this note - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this his hand-writing, and by whom was it brought to you - A. It is his hand-writing. Two persons called, one of them is Mr. Anstry, his clerk, the other is a professional gentleman, Mr. Titsell.</p>
               <p>Q. By this time it was quite discoverable that you were after Mr. Walsh - A. It was. (The letter read addressed to the Solicitor General.)</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that letter, in that the hand-writing of Mr. Walsh - A. I believe it is. (The letter read, dated December 6, 1811, addressed B. Walsh, Esq. M. P. London.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are these several papers the hand-writing of Mr. Walsh - A. I believe that to be; the second paper, the third paper, the fourth paper, the fifth, the sixth, seventh, and eighth; I believe them all to be the hand-writing of Mr. Walsh.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scarlet. I believe Sir Thomas you placed a very implicit confidence in the prisoner - A. I did, and I have done so for a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a stock-broker by trade - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the purchase of exchecquer bills came from you originally or whether it came from him - A. I am sure I cannot be positive; very likely it might be my own; I certainly communicated to him that I did not want the money only for the purchase of an estate when it was fixed, and certainly something must be done with the money, and I remember asking him whether it was worth while to invest it in exchequer bills, and he said it certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when the money was received whether he paid any money into the bankers, or by a draft - A. I do not know of my own knowledge, but I believe he paid it by a draft; I have understood there were two checks to the amount of one thousand pounds, and another check of his own not quite the whole amount; the whole amount was not paid in, he paid it short two hundred and seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you, sir, whether the whole purchase, the sale of stock and the purchase of exchequer bills are in the trade of a stock broker - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Your whole object was in laying out twenty-two thousand two hundred pounds in exchequer bills - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you, sir, whether it was left to his discretion to pay it in your own bankers - A. I gave him the check in the usual mode.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had paid the check itself to the person himself whom he bought, formed no part of the contract, or if he had paid the check into the bankers - A. I certainly expected he was going to pay the check into my bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether that formed any part of the contract - A. Certainly not. He had told me that he should pay it into my bankers, and that he should call upon my bankers to receive a check for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. It was no part of your contract that he should take the check from you and receive bank notes - A. It was no part of the contract; I expected he would. He told me that he paid it into the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was his practice to take the check to his bankers, or to pay it into yours antecedent - A. Yes; generally he used to lay out his money first, in former transactions, and then called upon me for a check upon my bankers to reimburse him what he had laid out. Sometimes I delivered him the money. (A letter read, dated December 5, 1811, and others dated December 6, 1811, December 7th, and 8th, 1811.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Walsh - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of November had he any conversation with you respecting the purchase of American stock - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he made any enquiry of you respecting American stock - A. He had; whether there was a good many in the market, and whether the sum of ten or eleven thousand pounds sterling money could be purchased. I told him that American stock was scarce, but I believe in a few days it might be accomplished; I would enquire and let him know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you respecting the sort of American stock - A. It did. I suggested it was necessary to know whether the purchaser meant to send it out as a remittance to America, or as a capitalist to keep it here.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say that was necessary to be known - A. Because there is some sort of stock that is best calculated for America, and others for those who reside here; Mr. Walsh said he thought it would be wanted for America.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect how long this was before the 29th of November - A. Two or three interviews had taken place previous to the 29th of November nothing more past than reporting what stock was to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. You had reported to him the condition of the market - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 29th of November had Mr. Walsh called at your office - A. I think he did; I think about twelve o'clock, and I afterwards went to him at his office; I then told him I found the stock could be purchased, and for so large a sum I would request him to give me a written order with the price for my government; he gave me this written order signed B. Walsh, November 29, 1811, Debirt and Co. please to purchase eleven thousand pounds in America 3 per cents or bank shares preference to be given to the latter; the price not to exceed to be paid for an Wednesday.</p>

               <p>Q. That Wednesday was the 4th of December on that Wednesday did Mr. Walsh call upon you - A. He did; he said that it was not convenient to pay for it on that day but he would pay for it on the morrow at twelve o'clock, if I would call upon him. On Thursday the 5th I called upon him soon after twelve at his office in Angel-court, he said here are eleven thousand bank notes, count them; I did; he gave me eleven bank notes of one thousand pound each; he said you need not hurry yourself in the delivery of the stock, make it convenient any time this morning. I delivered it that day I believe about a quarter after three with the accompt. I have that accompt with me, this is it. (The accompt read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Ten thousand eighteen pound ten shillings and sixpence was the sum that he had paid to you, for which he gave you eleven thousand pounds in bank notes - A. Yes, and the balance I gave to him by a draft on the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at this, are they American certificates of bank shares of American stock - A. Those I examined in Bow-street were the same; I examined them correctly there, and that is the identical stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass between you and Mr. Walsh - A. Upon Mr. Walsh locking up the stock in his iron safe, as he was locking it up; I said, Mr. Walsh if this stock is to go to America, shall I bring our notary to prepare it is usual. He then said I do- not know that it is going to America, but I am going out of town for two or three days, and you may call, or I will see you in the beginning of the week.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person take these things to America will they be of use to him there without a notary - A. If they are lost the record, the entery in the book is like a policy of insurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150015"></xptr>Q. If a person has them in his pocket it does not want to be registered - A. But then if lost it cannot be recovered. I immediately took the notes to the office that I received of Mr. Walsh; I think I delivered them to Mr. Dearman; my clerk, Ellison, was present.</p>
               <p>MR. JENKINS. Q. Did you see the last witness, Mr. Debirt, carefully examine these papers at Bow-street - A. I did. They are the same papers, they have been sealed up ever since. I am certain they are the same and in the same state.</p>

               <p>Q. In the beginning of December was he indebted to you in any sum of money - A. He was, and had been for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any short time previous to the 5th of December desired you to make out the accompt - A. I had been making repeated applications to him for payment from time to time, and having bought the lease of a house in Lothbury, for which I expected to be called upon for payment; I had been for some time particular urgent upon him. In consequence of which he said, I think about a week previous to the 5th of December that if I would make out the accompt he would compare it and settle; I think to the best of my recollection that I sent him the account on Monday the 2d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the 5th did he make you any payment - A. Upon the Monday he said he was in hopes that he should be able to settle it on the Tuesday. On the Wednesday I saw him he came and dined with me, and brought the accompt and mentioned some omissions which he conceived I had made in the accompt; I convinced him that my accompt was right. We agreed the accompt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was was the balance coming to you - A. Eleven hundred and ninety-nine pounds odd, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not make you the payment at that time - A. No, he told me he would pay me on the following day: I said, I particulasly wished it, as I had to make the payment for the house on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on what time on the Thursday did he make you any payment - A. About half past twelve, at his office; he called upon me about twelve o'clock at the Temple, and then afterwards walked with me into the city. I parted with him in Aldermanbury after having settled that he should give me a draft; I went and received the balance.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you in Angel-court receive the balance - A. Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. In what shape did you receive it - A. I received a note which I believe to be a thousand pound note and a draft for the balance; I received it for a thousand pound; I never looked at it.

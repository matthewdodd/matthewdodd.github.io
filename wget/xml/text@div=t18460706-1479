                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Cumberland-row, Newington. On Wednesday, the 15th of June, about two o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by the police, and found my shop shutter down, and some china ornaments and a phelme taken from the window—these are them—they were safe about twelve o'clock the night before—I was the last person up—I shut up the shutters, and fastened them by an iron bar—I found the shutter forced out from under the bar—there was no glass to the window—I found the articles next day in possession of the police—I have not found all the articles.</p>

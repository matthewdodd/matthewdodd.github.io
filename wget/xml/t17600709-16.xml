            . I am a corn dealer and lighterman; I sent a barge down, in order to fetch some flour from a mill. On the first of June, we brought the barge to the ship, and left it there, in order to work it on the next day. Then I sent my servant there; he return'd, and told me he miss'd 6 barrels of meal; we went out, and found the prisoner at the bar a washing his boat (he is a waterman) this was on the Monday morning, after he had sunk her in order to wash her; yet there were some stains of flour upon her. We took him in custody. I said you are a villain, you have robb'd me of 6 barrels of flour, tell me where it is; at last he told us it was at his house; we went and found it there, and weigh'd it, there were 900 and odd weight of it.</p>

            . I loaded this vessel on the 31st of May, about 2 in the afternoon, and came to London with them on Sunday the 1st of June. I went down on the Monday morning, and found there were 6 barrels missing; then I came and told my master; we went down to enquire of people about Ratcliff Cross; we found the prisoner washing his boat, with some stains of flour on it; we charg'd him with taking the 6 barrels out of the barge; he own'd he had taken them, and brought them on shore, and that they were at his house. My master went to his house, but I did not, when I saw the vessels heads with the name W. Slade were taken away, but I believe the vessels to be the same we lost.</p>

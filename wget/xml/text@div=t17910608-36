On Thursday, the 11th of May, the prisoner came into our shop between four and five o'clock; there was no person in the shop but myself; she asked to look at some tape, I shewed her some, and she bought as much as came to one penny; she gave me a shilling, and I gave her sixpence in silver, and five penny-worth of halfpence in change; she took up the change, and then asked to look at some black ribbon at three halfpence per yard; I took out the box of ribbons, and shewed her some; she said it was too narrow, and would not do; she then refused the six pence I gave her, she had then had it five minutes or more, and asked me to change it; I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080047"></xptr>the six-pence and went to change it, and then she appeared in great confusion, and asked me if I would give her some ribbon, at two-pence one yard only; I had changed the six-pence before I gave her the ribbon; she then gave me the two-pence for it, she then went out in a very great hurry: I missed a piece of black silk ribbon containing thirty-six yards immediately out of the drawer; I looked about and could not find it, I then followed her and brought her back, I found her two doors from our house talking to another person; I asked her if she would be kind enough to walk back, and she came back; she came into the shop, and was in great confusion, and would not stay; Mr. Winskell was up stairs, and the servant met me in the shop; I sent her to call Mr. Winskell, and just before he came she dropped the ribbon, I saw her drop it, it dropped from her left side; she turned round and dropped it, and said, there lay my ribbon. I am quite sure I saw it drop, and when I went out I passed that place, and saw the place quite clear; I told her she had no call to drop it, I was certain she had it; I gave it to the constable.</p>

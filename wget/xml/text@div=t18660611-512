                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Carter, a tobacconist, of 13, Cannon-street—there is a post-office at the shop, and we sell stamps—the prisoner came in about seven o'clock on Monday evening, May 7th, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps—she gave me 2 florins—the underneath one was very suspicious looking—I tried it, and found it was bad—I broke it—she had then left the shop—I put the pieces at the back of the till by themselves—I afterwards gave them up to the constable—on Tuesday, 15th of May, I saw the prisoner again about a quarter to six—that is the business time in the day, the time the letters are going out—I recognised her at once—she was at the other end of the shop—she asked for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, worth of stamps—she tendered in payment 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and half-a-crown—I saw Treen take up the half-crown and break it in the detector—I said to the prisoner, "You gave me a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece last week"—she said, "You must be mistaken "—I said, "I am not; I am quite certain you are the same party; I shall send for a policeman"—she said that she was a respectable woman, and received that half-crown from a gentleman—I sent for a policeman, and gave her in custody—Treen gave me the half-crown that he broke, and I gave it to the constable.</p>

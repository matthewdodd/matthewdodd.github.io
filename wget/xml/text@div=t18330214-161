            . I am a porter, and live in St. Andrew's-street. I work for Mr. Wells, of High Holborn - he deals in fixtures; the prisoner came and asked if my master did not buy fixtures - I said Yes; she said she had four or five old doors and some shelves in Lumber-court, which she had bought at a sale; when my master came home, he sent me there, and gave me 1l. 1s. to pay for them - I went there, and saw the prisoner; she said, "Are you come for those things?" I said Yes - I paid her the money, and she delivered me five doors in all, and amongst them were the two claimed by the prosecutor; the hinge of one is broken - this is it.</p>
               <p>MR. SHARP. This is one of the doors.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The doors were down when I took the premises - my husband is in confinement; I was taken nine times to Bow-street, and when the Magistrate asked me where I got them, I said I bought part of them at a sale, but that part was a carpenter's bench, and some other things - I offered the keys to Mr. Sharp, and he would not take them; that is twelve months ago - he said he had a deal of money owing to him.</p>
               <p>MR. SHARP. Some one called on me about nine months ago, and I think it was a woman, but no key was offered to me - the party stated they were about to take the houses, and asked if I had any claim for rent.</p>

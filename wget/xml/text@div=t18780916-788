On Wednesday, 14th August, about 9.45, I received instructions to go to Ashley's Hotel—I went there and asked for Mr. Upton—I was shown into the coffee-room and saw the prisoner—he asked me to sit down, took a cheque-book out of his pocket, and wrote this cheque; I went with it to the Merchants' Bank, and they wrote on it "Effects not cleared"—I took it back to him, and he said "D—them, why can't they pay a man his money?"—I went back, the cheque was paid, and I gave the proceeds to the prisoner, who counted it and said it was all right—he then took me to the Unicom public-house and told me to stay there; he might be gone twenty minutes or an hour, or five hours, but on no pretence to go away till he came back—he came back in twenty minutes and called a Hansom, and I went with him to the Shakspere Hotel, Pimlico, where he told me to get some dinner—he left me and went into the coffee-room—I did not see bun go out of the house—I should not have seen if he had—in three quarters of an hour or an hour he brought in this cheque.

Mrs. Godfreys, 49, Notting Hill Square"—I went to the Bank and got them changed and took the change to the prisoner at the Shakspere—he asked me if I would go to Brighton with him—I said no, I did not think I should be allowed—he said that he had some more work to do, and I was not to employ myself with any other person, but meet him at the office at 9 o'clock next morning—he did not meet me next day, and about 9.30 that evening I was in my ordinary clothes in Essex Road, Islington, with Inspector Sayer—I walked up to the prisoner and said "Good evening, Mr. Upton"—he said "Good evening; I don't know you"—I asked him if he did not know the commissionaire who was with him yesterday—he said "Yes," and shook hands with me and took my arm and said that he did not know me in those clothes—he walked a little way with me, and I asked why he had not come to the office at 9 o'clock; he said that he was very busy, out intended to see me next day—I asked him how he got on at Brighton; he said very well, but he had rather I had been with him—I then made a sign to Sayer, who came up and took him in custody—on the way to Scotland Yard in a cab he said "Don't you think it will be worth your while to settle the matter?

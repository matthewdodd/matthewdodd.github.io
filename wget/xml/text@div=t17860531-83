             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday morning last, between the hours of two and three, I was robbed of my hat in <placeName id="t17860531-83-crimeloc424">Elbow-lane</placeName>

               <p>Were those the words he made use of? - Yes, they were; upon my refusing to accompany him he knocked me down, and took my hat off my head, then I gave the alarm of stop thief, I pursued him very near to the highway, and in turning the corner of Elbow-lane, he returned and knocked me down a second time, and in the second scuffle he dropped the hat; I picked it up; I repeatedly cried out stop thief, and murder, and the watchmen assisted me, he then ran into a house in Elbow-lane; they would not let us in, but Mr. Orange the officer came up, and they let him in; he went into the back yard, and perceived a man's head in the necessary over the next house, he desired to come to him, and he took the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober? - I was.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking that night? - No, Sir, I had not.</p>
               <p>Where had you been at that late hour of the morning? - I was returning home.</p>
               <p>Where had you spent your evening? - In a private house near to this place.</p>
               <p>Had not you been drinking in that house? - No, Sir,</p>
               <p>Had you supped there? - No.</p>
               <p>Did this man take your hat off, or did it fall off in the scuffle? - I will take upon me to say, that he took it, it did not fall off.</p>

               <p>Did he demand any money of you? - I cannot say he did.</p>
               <p>Did he attempt any thing but your hat? - No, Sir, he snatched my hat immediately, and he knocked me down; I hallooed out immediately, and he ran away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you any watch at this time? - No, Sir, I left it at home.</p>
               <p>Do you usually leave it at home? - Very often.</p>
               <p>When you visit in that neighbourhood? - No, Sir, not particularly on that occasion.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that you had not supped, nor drank that evening? - Perhaps I had my supper.</p>
               <p>Had you supped at this adjacent house? - I had supped there.</p>
               <p>Had you drank nothing at your supper? - I drank some table beer only.</p>
               <p>No other liquors, nor spirits? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you been supping alone, or in company? - I supped alone.</p>
               <p>What time did you sup? - I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>I do this to try the probability and consistency of your story; now attend, at what time did you sup? - It might be between the hours of eleven and twelve, I believe it was.</p>

               <p>Had you been long in that neighbourhood?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310096"></xptr> - I was returning from the city to that part of the neighbourhood; my house is in the parish of St. George's; I came out of the city between nine and ten; I took a walk after supper.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came up to you was not you talking to a girl at a window? - I was talking to nobody when he came up, there was a girl putting her head out at a window as I passed by.</p>
               <p>Was you talking to her? - I might speak to her.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay talking to her? - I did not stay talking to her any time, that I can minute.</p>
               <p>Now perhaps it was an hour? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it was more than ten minutes? - It was not so much, it might be five or six.</p>
               <p>It was in Elbow-lane that you stopped to talk to this young lady, this woman, this nymph, this goddess? - I do not know, I did not see her.</p>
               <p>How many pair of stairs high was she? - I do not know, I was not in the dwelling.</p>
               <p>And you mean gravely to give that answer? - I do.</p>
               <p>You recollect, you are upon your oath? - I do.</p>
               <p>How far had you got from this lady's house before the prisoner came up to you? - About six yards.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not he tell you he was ashamed that a man of your appearance should be talking to such a bunter, was not that the case, Master Jones? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Then what was it? - I told you what it was.</p>
               <p>Then tell it again? - There is no occasion for a repetition.</p>
               <p>Yes, you must repeat it? - He put both his hands to my wrist, and desired me to go to that young woman.</p>
               <p>What that you was talking to? what did you say to him? I will tell you what it was; you said you had no conversation with any such creatures, was not that what you said? - I desired the young man to desist from me, and I had nothing more to say to him.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you, that you was a cox-comical puppy? - He said nothing; but he immediately knocked me down, and took off my hat.</p>
               <p>Was you stunned by the blow? - I was insensible at that time, whether he applied both his hands, or one.</p>
               <p>Who are you, let us just know that? - I am Mr. Jones's son.</p>
               <p>He must be a very lucky man, to have such a son! who may this fortunate man be? - He lives in Ratcliffe-highway; he is a chymist, I am in his business, and live at home.</p>
               <p>Did you go home that night? - Yes, soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>How long after? - Perhaps, it might be between six and seven; I came with Mr. Orange to the office after the robbery, and then I went home; there was a house-breaking committed, and I went with Mr. Orange to see that.</p>
               <p>Court. What house was this that you supped at? - At a person's house in Ratcliffe-highway.</p>
               <p>On a visit? - No.</p>
               <p>What then? - I called there in my way home.</p>
               <p>How came you to sup alone? - Because the person of the house had supped before; I was not alone.</p>
               <p>Who was you in company with? - The gentleman's name is Nightingale; I supped at his house.</p>
               <p>Elbow-lane was not in your way home afterwards? - Yes, Sir, it was.</p>
               <p>How far is Mr. Nightingale's from your father's? - I cannot say the distance.</p>
               <p>About how far may it be? - I cannot clearly say.</p>
               <p>Is it a mile, or an hundred yards? - It might be about an hundred yards from my father's.</p>
               <p>And how far from Elbow-lane? - About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310097"></xptr>Mr. Garrow. Is not Nightingale called by the name of Donkin? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Does not he keep a bawdy-house? - The person I supped with does not.</p>
               <p>What business is he? - He is not in the profession that you speak of.</p>
               <p>Is that, Sir, an answer to my question? - The person I supped with is a publican.</p>
               <p>What is his sign? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you tell me, just now, that it was a private house you supped at? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I heard the alarm between two and three; I dressed myself, and went into Elbow-lane; there were two watchmen; I opened the back door, and went into the backyard, and perceived a man in the necessary.</p>
               <p>What did the prosecutor charge him with? - Stealing his hat; but he had got his hat when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Was he sober? - He seemed so; it was not above a quarter before three; there is Nightingale, a shoemaker, but I do not know Nightingale the publican; and I am pretty confident there is no such person; the prosecutor told me he was standing talking to a woman out of the window, and as he was talking to the woman out of the window, a man came and took him by the wrist, and knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Do you know this Donkin? - He did live in the parish, he kept a bawdy house, but he was disturbed; he was called Donky die; the prosecutor went with me to the watch-house, and then to the White Swan in New Gravel-lane, and then he went with me to Spring-street; when I came to the White Swan, about six in the morning, I found him there.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you will consider whether you can safely place credit in such a story so told, as to convict a man of a capital offence; if you have any doubt, I will put the prisoner on his defence; I will sum up the evidence.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are satisfied.</p>

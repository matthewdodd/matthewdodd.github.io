On Wednesday the 27th of November, about half past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming from our clerk's desk, which is in the middle of the shop, I observed the prisoner walking out, and leaving a woman behind, who came in with her. I though her left arm, which was under her shawl, seemed encumbered, I followed her; she was walking very fast down Creed-lane; I came up to her, and looked her in the face; she endeavoured to walk slow and get behind me; I kept close to her side; when we came to Water-lane, opposite the shop of Mr. Carrick, I wanted her to go back with me; she refused, and endeavoured to get away; I put one arm round her, and with the other I endeavoured to take hold of her shawl to see if she had any thing there; she took the satin from under her shawl and endeavoured to hold it from me; I took it from her; and at that moment Mr. Carrick opened his door and pulled her into his shop. I delivered her into the custody of the officer, with the satin.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to Messrs. Ellis and Brown. The prisoner came into the shop with another woman, and asked for some cottage lustres, and some poplins; I showed them to her; they purchased a dress; while I was measuring it the prisoner walked out; the other remained; she said she had lost, or left her purse; she gave me a guinea, saying she would fetch the remainder; they came to 1l. 3s. 4d.; I gave her the guinea back, and told her we would send her the poplin; she then took the guinea, was going out, and said she would fetch her purse. I followed her to the door to persuade her to let me send the poplin. She gave me the guinea back, and told me to keep it if I was afraid; she has never returned for the poplin since; the shop was crowded from top to bottom at the time; there are 18 or 20 shop-people. I served both the women. I did not see the satin. I have heard that a young man was next to me showing satin to some ladies. I am sure he did not serve the prisoner. I am sure the prisoner is the person who came in with the other woman.</p>

            . I heard of the fire in Drury-lane, and went towards it; I looked about some time, and then went to Leicester-square, where I saw the prisoner with his hands in his pockets and no hat on - I asked where his hat was; he said he did not know - I then felt his pockets and found this book; I asked what it was - he said "Only a pocketbook," but it proved to be the Amulet; in his other pockets I found these other four books - this was about six o'clock on the Sunday morning; the fire was on the Saturday night - I took him to the watch-house, and, on searching him, I found this leaf of one of the books in his trousers' pocket; it has the prosecutrix's name on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found he had lost his hat? A. Yes; he appeared to be flurried and as if he had been exerting himself - I think he had been drinking; I had not seen him at the fire.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking at the Cheshire Cheese, a practice to which I am quite unaccustomed; I heard of the fire, and exerted myself in saving the things - I was much excited; I have no recollection of putting the books into my pocket, and I suppose I put them there to bring down some other property, and forgot to take them out.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAREY. I am a boot-maker. I saw the fire, and saw the prisoner particularly active in bringing out a great deal of property, which he deposited in my shop, just opposite - he brought a great deal over: one was a glass jug, which I should think was more valuable than these books; he did not appear quite sober - I do not know that he lost his hat; he seemed very quick, and anxious about the goods- he came to my house with a friend after twelve o'clock, and his coat was very much burnt with the burning lead which fell from the roof; I had not known him before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ACTON. I was assisting at the fire; I went with the prisoner - he was very active in extinguishing the fire; he was in a great state of excitement, and I think it likely he might have put some of these books into his pocket without remembering it - he exposed himself to greater danger than I was disposed to do; I saw the lead fall upon his coat, and warned him of his danger - he said,"The devil a bit do I care about it;" he might have concealed female apparel and other things.</p>
               <p>COURT to ANDERSON. Q. Did he say how he came by the books? A. He said he had bought them on Saturday night; I am sorry I did not mention that before - he said he bought four of them in Drury-lane, and the other in the Strand; he appeared in a great stupor.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he appear in such a state as not to know what he was doing? A.He did.</p>

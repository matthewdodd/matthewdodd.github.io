On Saturday, the 17th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, and pointed to some silk handkerchiefs which laid in the window. He made signs, and touched a coloured handkerchief which he had on his neck. I supposed he wanted something of that pattern - nobody but myself was in the shop. I took a parcel out of the drawer, laid it on the counter, and showed him several different patterns; one handkerchief in particular I remember opening, thinking it might strike his attention - he fixed upon two others; he asked the price in French, I told him 15 s. the two - he held up his hand, and said sancho, by which I understood he meant 5 s. I shook my head, meaning I would not sell them for that. He took a purse from his pocket, and produced gold and silver foreign pieces - he produced a double Napoleon, put it in my hand, and made signs for a pen and ink to let me know the value. I gave him a pencil - he wrote down 35 s. as the value. He offered me 11 s. for them, I refused to take it; he bought nothing, and left the shop. He put his hat on one part of the counter and his handkerchief on another, about half a yard off; he took up his handkerchief, shook it, and then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shake his hat - A. No. I threw the handkerchiefs promiscuously into the drawer. About half an hour after, a neighbour came in to make inquiry; I went immediately to Guildhall, and saw two handkerchiefs which belonged to me; I am certain one of them was on the counter when he was there, I particularly showed it to him; and the other was in the shop the evening before when I shut up. My young man came into the shop while he was writing the value of the Napoleon, and staid till he left. They are worth 13 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go to Guildhall the same day - A. Yes, about twelve o'clock the same morning. I knew him immediately. I did not suspect him.</p>

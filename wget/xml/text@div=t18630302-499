                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Lewis Austin, of William-street, Commercial-road—on 17th February I was at St. Paul's Cathedral with my daughter, near 5 in the afternoon—we were not far from each other, by the iron gates—there were several persons there—I saw the prisoner at the side of me—I felt something at my side, and saw the flounce of my dress up—I looked down, and saw the prisoner's hand at the side of me—I brushed my flounce down—I did not know that I had lost anything—my pocket was just under my flounce—I had a little leather bag in my pocket, containing two half crowns, a two-shilling-piece, two sixpences, and a shilling, I think—my daughter came to me and said something, and I felt, and my bag was gone—my daughter followed the prisoner right out of the cathedral, and I followed her—he had got hold of another man's arm just as he was going out—he was given in charge just at the gates—I saw the bag again at Guildhall—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are two half-crowns, a two-shilling-piece, and two sixpences, besides a threepenny-piece and a penny, which is not mine that I am aware of—one shilling is missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bryder—I was with my mother in St. Paul's Cathedral on the afternoon in question—I saw the prisoner there—he was standing at my right side—he put his hand to my frock-pocket—I looked at him, and thought I must be mistaken from his appearance, and moved a little further down—he then tried my frock again two or three times; he then came in front of me, stood against my mother and lifted up the flounce of her dress, put his hand in her pocket, and pulled it out again with something in it, I can't say what—he then moved away—I spoke to my mother—he then came to the front of me again and moved round, made a motion to another man, who went with him—I followed them—when they got outside the door the prisoner took hold of the other man's arm, who said, "What have you got?"—I was close behind them—the prisoner said, "Only a bag"—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said "Will you accompany me back to the cathedral?"—he said, "Yes"—I saw him pass something to the other one after I had spoken to him, and I said to the other, "And you likewise, if you please?"—he said, "Yes"—there was then a dispute between them which should go back with me—I saw that they wanted to get away, and I took hold of the prisoner's coat, and held him till the policeman came and took him into custody; the other man got away—I did not see where the bag came from that the policeman has.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you with your mother the whole of the time! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and never left her till I followed him out—I stood at the right-hand side of her, and the prisoner stood at the right-hand side of me at first, and when he went on the right-hand side of my mother I stood and watched him—I certainly did not say a word about what I saw, not in a place of worship—the prisoner was out of the church and down the steps when I tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

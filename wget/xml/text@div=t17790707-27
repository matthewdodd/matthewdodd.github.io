             was then with me. I am sure the prisoner is the man who robbed me; his coat was buttoned, and his hair down his neck. The prisoner and two more jumped out upon us; they stayed with us near a quarter of an hour. The prisoner pulled me away from the gentleman I was with, and threw me down in the grass. One of the men when he came up first said, stop, d - n you, and asked us what we had got. When he threw me down in the grass he looked to see if I had any buckles; I screamed out; the prisoner said if I did it again he would kill me. He presented a pistol when he first came up, and demanded my money. I had four shillings and two pence; he took that, d - d me, and said is that all? I said it was; he called me b - ch, bid me not look at him, and went away. I never saw his face till he told me not to look; I just saw it then, that was all. The next day I saw him at a publick-house at Shadwell. Mr. Mullings came for me, I knew him directly.</p>

             on Friday night from Vauxhall; walking in a field near Vauxhall, we were met by three men; one said stop, let me have what you have got. The other two men took me by the arm whilst the prisoner robbed Mrs. Rowell; afterwards the prisoner came up to me searched my pockets and took out some keys I had in my pocket; whilst he was taking the keys out I observed his face; I am certain the prisoner is the man. The next day I made an information at Justice Sherwood's, in consequence of that I was sent for to the prisoner's mother's house; there I saw him and knew him; I immediately charged him with it; he neither confessed it nor denied it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner and another young man came last Friday and hired a couple of horses of me about two o'clock; they brought them home some time after ten, and paid me for their hire; and they went from our house much in liquor as I thought; the watchman had gone ten o'clock; but I cannot tell how long. When they indicted them at Hicks's-Hall, I saw this gentlewoman and the gentleman (Rowell and Mullings) at Hicks's-Hall. I asked Mrs. Rowell, whether she could swear to this man; she said Yesterday, I thought I could swear to him, but to day it touches so near death, I think I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Jury. What sort of a night was it when he came home at ten o'clock? - It was after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - I could not have discerned them if they had been strangers to me; the prisoner was a stranger to me at that time; the other was a neighbour's child, I knew him very well, and had no doubt they would bring the horses home safe, or I would not have trusted them with the horses.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - Adjoining the New Road, St. George's within about three hundred yards of the place this gentlewoman swears to being robbed at. I asked Mrs. Rowell whether she could swear to that young man; she thought she could not swear to him; I asked her, whether she could swear to the other young man; no, said she, if I was to see him, I do not know whether I could swear to him or no; I replied, aye, you could swear to me now you see me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070031"></xptr>Court. How came you to say that to her, now, you may swear to me now you have seen me? - She said there were three men, and one was six feet high; and I don't know any body thereabouts that is near that size but myself.</p>
               <p>Court. You was saying that Mullings said something? - I asked Mullings the day before yesterday at Hick's-Hall, if he could describe any thing of the other young men; he said, he could not, only that there were three of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was with you at Hicks's-Hall when this passed? - Both of them.</p>
               <p>Any body else? - No, not in company at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Mullings say any thing about this man? - No, he said he had given a description of him to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ask him any questions about this man? - He would not satisfy me about the other questions I asked him; therefore, I did not ask him any questions; he said he could not describe them, nor he would not.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you heard him say before whether he knew the prisoner or not? - I asked him; he said he thought he could swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. You said just now you did not ask him about this prisoner? - That is the first question I asked him about, that he said he could swear to him; then I asked him about the others that I knew.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you say you asked him first about this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What answer did he make you? - He said he thought he could swear to this man.</p>
               <p>Court. He was not positive? - He did not say he was positive to this man; he thought so.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say any thing more about this man? - No, nothing else.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you tell him positively yes; or that you thought you could? - I told him yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Positively so, not that you thought you could? - No, I told him positively that I could swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say any thing more to you about the prisoner? - No; he told me the other men were neighbours of his, and asked me if I could give any description of them. I told him I had given a description of them to Justice Sherwood's clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give any description to him? - No; I gave none to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you refuse to give any to him? - He did not ask me after I said that.</p>
               <p>Did you in terms refuse to give him any? - Not in direct terms.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say you would not describe them to him? - No, I said I had given a description of them to Justice Sherwood's clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. But did you tell him you could not describe the other men? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Or that you would not? - No:</p>
               <p>Court. Where was this? - At the Two Lions, by Hicks's-Hall.</p>

               <p>What day of the month was it, and what time of night was it that you was robbed? - On Friday the 2d; the clock had gone ten.</p>

               <p>What are you? - A headborough for St. Paul's, Shadwell. On last Friday night, while I was drinking a pint of beer at the Gun in the Back-Lane, about two hundred yards from the New-Road, Butts the prisoner and another came into the bar; it wanted about five minutes of eleven o'clock; they came in in a great hurry, and drank a glass a piece, and went out again directly. I heard some body at the door, but one person did not come in; I said to the landlady they are in a great hurry about something; but I knew nothing at all then. I went down to the office at Shadwell in the morning, and heard there had been a robbery committed in the New-Road; I said I saw Butts and another together last night; therefore, I took him up upon it; we went to his mother's; he was sitting in a chair; I asked him who it was that was with him last night; he said, one Rusty.</p>

               <p>Court. How was his hair? - I did not take much notice of his hair; I had not time; though I knew him, I did not take so much notice as to observe particularly his hair; Mr. Fletcher and I took him; I said where is this Mr. Rusty who was along with you last night; he said he was at Mr. Jortin's brewhouse; we sent the servant maid for him; we bid her make use of Butts's name; the maid came back, and said he was gone home; we went to his home in Mill-Yard before we got down to the house Butts's mother was standing at the door, and the door was last locked.</p>

This young man ordered the maid to draw him a pint of beer; and he took the pint of beer over in his hand to one Rusty; and there he supped and layed all night. I will be upon my oath he had that coat on that he has now, and had the same hat; his hair was curled up as it is now, and his waistcoat was unbuttoned.</p>
               <p>Did he seem a little disordered? - He was a little in liquor; but not much.</p>

               <p>Jury. Will you undertake to swear that he had no great coat on at that time? - I have swore that already; I wish to serve the man, but not to perjure myself; I am upon my oath that he had no great coat on, and his waistcoat was open, and his hair was curled as it is now.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilson. Where do you live? - In Rosemary-Lane; I am a salesman.</p>

They came back again in about a quarter of an hour; it might not be so much; I cannot speak positively to the time; but I am certain it was no more than a quarter of an hour; they did not stay long; I said to the other young fellow, make haste home, your mother will be uneasy on account of your being absent.

She said she had none of them, this was on the Tuesday following, and three Weeks afterwards a strange Man came and asked me if I had not lost such a Suit of Gray. I told him, Yes. And then he told me, The Cloaths are pawn'd for a Guinea, and you must give me a Guinea before you see them or the House where they be. I gave him the Money. Then he carried me to the House of the Prisoner Martha Daniel, and she shew'd me the Cloaths, and said she had them at eight o'Clock the same Night that I lost them; I asked her why she did not let me have them when I first enquired for them and offer'd her the Money. She said she was afraid that when I had got the Cloaths, I would not be so good as my Word - I found that the Stranger was her Daughter's Husband.</p>

I asked her if she had not taken in such Things, and she said she did not know, but she would ask her Mistress. And so she called her Mistress into the Shop. Do you know, says her Mistress, in whose Name the Things were pledged. No, says I, for to tell you the Truth they were stolen.</p>

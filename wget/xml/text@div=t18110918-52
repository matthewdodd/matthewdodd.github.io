            . On the 1st of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon going out of Castle-street into Crutched friers; I felt somebody give me a violent push; turning round to see who it was; I saw the prisoner and asked him what he meaned by it; I told him there was room enough for every body; he gave me a great deal of abusive language, and went into the ale-house at the corner of Seething lane, thinking he was in liquor, I proceeded on my way. When I came to the bottom of Crutched friars, crossing of Cooper's-row, I stopped a few moments because the boys were breaking up school. I then went on into <placeName id="t18110918-52-crimeloc295">John-street</placeName>

I then began to suspect that he had some motive for it, and put my hand into my pocket, and found my pocket-book was gone; I exclaimed out, I have lost my pocket book, and I suspected the person who had pushed me so had picked my pocket. One of the boys said a person had just gone round the corner who had picked my pocket, and if you please I'll shew him you; I followed the boy, and he shewed me the prisoner; I immediately went up to him, and told him my suspicion. He again abused me, and said he was no more a pickpocket than myself, and asked me whether there was any money in my pocket book; I told him no, nothing of much value in it. The crowd desired me to charge a constable with him; I said why so, I can prove nothing against him, and he may have given<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180022"></xptr>the book to an accomplice. Somebody in the crowd said, sir, I believe I know where your pocket book is, he said seeing a crowd I came to see the occasion of it, and hearing you had been robbed I fixed my eyes upon the prisoner, and if I would go, and open a hatch, and go into a stone mason's shop, the corner of Cooper's Row, I might find my pocket-book, I went there; I rang the bell; I asked the maid who came to the bell whether any body had been there, she said no; I then asked her to look in the passage to see if there was any pocketbook there; she opened the hatch, and she and I found the pocket-book in there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I fancy there was nothing in your pocket-book of any value - A Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact you lost nothing, and your property was returned to you - A. It was.</p>

            . I live in Jewry-street, and and attend upon gentlemen. I was going with a letter into Gould-square, Cooper's-row, the boys coming out of school occasioned me to stop; I saw a man standing at Mr. Smith's door, reaching over to open it, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Where - A. At the corner of Cooper's-row, a stone mason's. I went into Gould-square and returned; I saw the same man standing among the boys. Soon after I heard great bustle in the street, the people said that a gentleman had his pocket picked; I then saw it was the same man that I had seen at Mr. Smith's door I heard the man repeatedly say what have I done, search me if you have lost any thing; I saw Mr. Manwaring, I asked him if he had lost any thing, he said, yes. I saw the same man come from the other side of the street, I said that is the man that I saw at Mr. Smith's door; it struck me that he might have thrown the book in that passage, or thereabouts. Mr. Smith's house has two doors, one in John-street, the other in Cooper's-row; I saw Mr. Smith's servant, I asked her to go round to the other door; she saw the book and I picked it up. I gave the book to Mr. Manwaring, he said it was his.</p>
               <p>- SHERRARD. Q. Do you belong to the school - A. Yes. As I was coming out of the school I saw the prisoner take something out of Mr. Manwaring's pocket, I ran and told him; Mr. Manwaring said, run and stop him; I said, I will shew you the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man - A. Yes; I came out of school first with another boy. I was buying apples, I heard the prisoner insult Mr. Manwaring I am sure it was the prisoner. I never took my eyes off the prisoner untill he was taken. I saw him lean over the hatch, and afterwards he was taken.</p>

            . Mr. Sellars knocked at Mr. Smith's door; he asked me if any body had been there upon business; I said no; he told me to go to the other door in Cooper's-row, and look to see if any thing was there; I went to see, and there was nothing there; he opened the hatch immediately, and came and looked behind the door, and saw the pocket book. I saw him pick it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. It was Mr. Sellars the witness that was at the hatch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Not the prisoner. - Was it possible for any man to place the pocket book in the situation it was found, without coming inside of the door - A. They must have come in to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sellars is the worthy gentleman who told you where it was, and insisted it was there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent. I am a taylor by trade, I was going to a gentleman in the Minories to measure him for clothes. When Mr. Manwaring accused me, I said I hope you do not suspect me; he said if you are an honest man tell me where you have been; I did, and shewed him the house.</p>

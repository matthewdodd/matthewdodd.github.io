               <p>Did you ever hear the prisoner say any thing respecting that chest, or any thing it contained? - Before my Lord Mayor, he spoke about it, and acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Had there been any promises or threats? - No, he said what he said voluntarily, without any inducement:</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Be so good as to tell whether your partners were with him before he said any thing about that chest? - I do not know, I have no reason upon earth to believe that any thing was said to him; a variety of things he acknowledged to the buying of people in the streets, which things were found in his chest; he never was examined before my Lord Mayor but once.</p>
               <p>What sort of articles were those? - Those were linen-drapery goods; new, and likewise remnants of muslins, and a variety of silks, and other things; we first found some callico handkerchiefs, at the house of Molloy; a variety of callico handkerchiefs, which I knew to be our patterns; in the chest we found one hundred and thirteen guineas and a half in gold, which this man acknowledged to be his.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to know before that, what his circumstances were from him? - He had frequently complained of poverty in my hearing, a fortnight or three weeks before; Mr. Topham keeps the cash, and pays the wages, he can speak to that; he acknowledged having but one guinea in the world; there were a variety of goods which he had in the chest, which are our property; he was asked how he came by them, and he said he bought them of different people in the street; in consequence of some further information, I went to an officer, Mr. Creach, in Sunmond's-street, Wapping, and found the remains of a piece of tambour muslin, with our private mark upon it, nothing else, and a duplicate; that muslin was produced before the Lord Mayor, but I do not recollect he said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. No other person has any secret interest in your business, but what you have mentioned? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to be a married man? - No, single, the other partners are all single; I have not the principal care of the house.</p>
               <p>Does either of the partners pay the whole rent of the house? - No, the expences of the house are paid out of the trade.</p>

               <p>I am a shopman to these gentlemen; on the 8th of September, we took account of some muslins; I laid them promiscuously about the warehouse; I did not watch them afterwards; I searched the cellar, there I found two pieces of muslin in some rubbish under the cellar stairs; they are here; they have been in my possession ever since; they were found in about an hour after dinner time; immediately as I came down from dinner, I went into the muslin warehouse, and counted the papers; I missed two pieces, one out of each paper; all the pieces had our private mark on them but one, which I saw Mr. Sowdon mark with a pencil before he went to dinner; this is the same piece. (That piece marked with a pencil, produced and deposed to.) They were wrapped up in nothing, laying among the dirt; they were small pencil marks in characters.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say from this, that this was one of the pieces so marked, and left in the paper before you went to dinner? - I am, because we had never another piece marked; this is the private shop mark, a very small mark.</p>
               <p>What is the prime cost value of these two pieces? - One of them is sixty shillings, the other thirty shillings, or thirty-one; they were both in the warehouse when I went up to dinner, and both missing when I came down; I was present at one Nevil's, in Golden-lane; I was present at Molloy's, there we found several shawls.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know how long these muslins had been in your master's warehouse? - One I suppose two or three months; it was a particular kind of goods; we had only one piece of it.</p>
               <p>They were dirty when you found them? - They were in the dirt.</p>
               <p>You went to Molly's, and found a great number of things? - I heard the prisoner say that some part of them belonged to himself, that he had bought them in the street of different people, whom he named.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe this to be my property, and to be stolen from me.</p>
               <p>Lavender. I matched the two pieces of that silk with the piece from which it was cut-off, and they match like an indenture; I have the money, but I was afraid to bring it.</p>

               <p>A short time after I was taken, I was informed that they had taken my box, which contained, belonging to my sister<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120125"></xptr>and me, one hundred and thirteen guineas and a half, which was remitted to me as a legacy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to prosecutor. You have had this muslin some time? - I suppose two or three months.</p>
               <p>Does it not appear that there has been lately a considerable fall in these goods? - I do not know of any particular fall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are not these two pieces valued at a great deal more than forty shillings? - Them two pieces cost us five pounds.</p>

               <p>I live in Westminster; I am a wine-merchant; the prisoner lodged with me in December, 1785; I always took him to be a very sober, honest man, and as such, very lately, I wished to take him again.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called another witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

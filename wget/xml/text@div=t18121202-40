On the 9th of November I was in company with the prisoner at the Red Lion, Petticoat-lane for three or four hours. Briant was with me. I was to see the prisoner again on the 16th of November. I went to the Red Lion, Petticoat-lane. I saw the prisoner there again. I went about half past one. Briant asked him if he had got any papers, meaning banknotes; he said, no, he had got some shillings. He pulled one out of his breeches pocket and shewed us for a sample. I told him I would have a pound's worth for ten shillings. He said he would fetch them me; but, said he, I must have the money first, which I paid him before the witness, Briant. I paid him ten shillings. He went away for about ten minutes. He came in and beckoned me out of the parlour. He gave me seventeen shillings, and six sixpences; and at the same time he put his hand into his breeches pocket and took out a three-shilling token, for which I gave him one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the seventeen shillings - A. I put them into a private pocket, where there was no more money. They have never been out of my sight, only while Mr. Powell sealed them up.</p>
               <p>ODDY. I am an officer of Bow street office. On the 9th of November I saw the prisoner, Briant, and Dickens at the Red Lion public house, Petticoat-lane. I have seen the prisoner two or three times about the Red Lion public-house. On the 25th I apprehended the prisoner. Dickens brought him to me; he said, here is Bullock. I took him in custody, and searched him. I found on him nineteen shillings in good money, and a bad bank token.</p>

            . Q. You are an assistant to the solicitor of the mint - A. Yes. Dickens brought me seventeen shillings and six sixpences. I sealed them up and delivered them to him again. These are the seventeen shillings and six sixpences. They are all counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a voluntary act of Dickens, or was it under your direction - A. It was under my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Powell, I put the two three-shilling tokens into your hand - A. The three-shilling tokens are both counterfeits.</p>

The prisoner is my son; about a month ago I missed some boots and shoes from my shop - I heard my son had been taken to the watch-house, in a state of intoxication - I went there and charged him with taking my property, and he acknowledged it; he had lived with me, about four months before, but he had been in the Hospital, and we took him in again, at some inconvenience to ourselves - I had tried to bring him up to my own business; he was Inclined for other trades - I tried him with a grocer, butcher, carpenter, and other trades, but he did not settle to any thing; he had epileptic fits for four years, which prevented his setting.</p>

               <p>CHARLES WILLINGALE. These are mine. I never allowed him to take any thing from my shop; he was taken up for breaking glass, in a state of intoxication.</p>

               <p>CHARLES WILLINGALE. I knew he was out of employ, and I was not in a situation to allow him any thing, I believe his faculties have been impaired by these fits, and he lost his place in consequence of the fits, about six months ago.</p>

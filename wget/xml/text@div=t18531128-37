                  </hi>. I am a journeyman copper plate printer. Some months ago I was employed in that trade, in the service of Mr. Tallis, of No. 100, St. John-street, Smith field—I was in his employment for some months—I left him on 10th Sept., on account of the slackness of work—on 13th Sept. I applied for employ to Mr. Jackson, of Angel-street, St. Martin le-Grand—he is a publisher—Mr. Jones is the manager of the copper plate department—I made an engagement with him for that week, and perhaps the next, but that week certain—generally speaking, the week terminates on the Saturday, but at Mr. Jackson's it terminates on the Friday—you write your bill up to Thursday night, and the week terminates on the Friday—I did the work I was employed upon, and on Friday, 16th, I was paid for my work; I had only been there three days then—the termination of the week was not specified to me when I was engaged; I understood it would be on Saturday—I did not expect the week to be seven following days—Mr. Jones paid me for what I had done—I asked him for more work—he declined to give me work—he did not pay me till after I had this conversation with him—before he paid me, I asked him why I was not to get any more work, and he referred me to Francis Friend; Francis Friend was the oldest workman on the establishment at that time—I saw him, in consequence of what Jones said—on the day before, the 15th, I had observed what is technically termed in the trade the calling of a <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi> by the men—that was before dinner; it was attended by the whole of the defendants, and one besides, but he has been excluded from the prosecution—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi>; I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you mean thatyouwere in the shop, but not at the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was excluded from the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi> is a congregation of the workmen altogether to discuss a certain subject—that was held in the same room where I was—I saw the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi> called; I could not hear what they said—I did not ask to be a party to it; they did not call me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were they conferring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be impossible to say how long, except by guess; it might be three, or four, or five, or six minutes; I could not say positively; it was a short time—they assembled at the opposite end of the shop to that at which I stood—after dinner I observed another assemblage of the men of the same kind the same persons attended it; I was at the same place as before, at the press—that was all that took place on the Thursday—before I applied to Jones on the Friday for more work, I saw Francis Friend, and said to him, "Mr. Friend, do you consider that the <hi rend="italic">chapels</hi> held yesterday had any reference to myself?"—he said that he certainly did; it was concerning my being at Tallis's—I then expostulated with him upon the injustice of such proceedings, and cited the case of one George Shaw, who had been discharged from Mr. Tallis's and had been taken into the employment of Mr. M'Queen, the copper plate printer, of Tottenham-court-road, and that the men had not refused to work with him there—I also referred him to the case of Pyall, who had been employed by Mr. Bacon, and the men were working with him—Pyall had been in Mr. Tallis's employment—I mentioned several other cases; to all of which he said that he knew nothing about it; he did not trouble himself with trade affairs, and he could say nothing to it—nothing further passed on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280036"></xptr>
               <p>that occasion—it was after that that I applied to Jones for more work—he referred me to Friend, and I went to him—the whole of the defendants were in the room at the time—Brind was sufficiently near to hear what passed between us; he was not more than fifteen or eighteen inches distant; the others were at their respective presses, at their work; it would be a matter of uncertainty whether they heard what passed—I asked Friend the reason why the men would not work with me—he said he thought I had a job to go on with (not a job at another place, but another job for Mr. Jones), and he was not prepared with an answer then; he had forgotten the reason; and if I would come after dinner he would be prepared with an answer—I think this conversation took place about 25 minutes to 1 o'clock—I then left the shop, and returned about half past 2 o'clock—I found Friend and the other defendants there; they were all at work—I spoke to Francis Friend, and told him I had come for the reason why they declined to work with me—he said there were two reasons; the first was my having gone to work for Mr. Tallis, which was a house they disacknowledged; and the second was my belonging to a third society, which they also disacknowledged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by a third society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are two societies in the trade; one is enrolled, and one is not; and this is a third society—there are two societies that they do acknowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you then say anything to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I reasoned with him on the injustice of this proceeding towards myself, and repeated the arguments I had made use of respecting the men, and finally asked him Whether this persecution was to continue against me always, or whether because I had worked at Mr. Tallis's house, I was never to get into any respectable house again, and why I was selected as a victim—to the first question he replied, that he could not give me an answer; and respecting My being a victim, he said I was not selected as a victim, or the only one, but it extended to the whole of the men employed in Mr. Tallis's house—I do not recollect anything more that passed—I then left the employment—I was requested to call at 6 o'clock in the evening to receive my money, which I did—there had been a difference between the employer and the workmen at Mr. Tallis's house before I went there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are in employment now, are you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am, and have been ever since I left Mr. Jackson's, with the exception of a few days—there are other workmen there—it is not a permanent engagement, I am liable to be dismissed at any moment; it is at Mr. Tomlinson's, of Queen's-head passage, Newgate-street—there are six or seven workmen there—I was not aware of that engagement when I left the other house, I did not know that I was going there—I went to Mr. Tomlinson's direct, immediately after my dismissal—J was not hired at once, I was hired the following week—I am the prosecutor of this indictment, I am supplying the funds for the prosecution; I have received a little assistance indirectly, but not from my society, from various individuals; any one who feels interested in giving me a trifle I accept it, they are friends of my own—Mr. Tallis is not at all engaged in this prosecution, neither directly or indirectly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman and manager of the copperplate department, in the service of Mr. Peter Jackson—it is part of my duty to engage workmen in that department, and to discharge them—on 13th Sept. Spence applied for work at our house—I gave him work; the defendants were all working in the shop at that time—Spence worked there</p>

               <p>on the Wednesday and the Thursday—on Friday, 16th, he applied to me for more work—I declined to give it him—before he applied to me for more work, a communication was made to me by Harper and Robinson, I cannot say whether that was on the Thursday or Friday—Harper asked if I knew anything of the man Spence—I said, No; I do not"—he said he was a party that he should not like to work with—he mentioned about his working at Tallis's—that was all that Harper said.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did either of them say what they would do, or what they would not do, if Spence was allowed to continue to work there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nothing at all was said about that—Spence applied to me on the Friday after for more work—I did not employ him for two reasons; the first was that I knew that the party wanted him where he was going to; that was at Mr. Tomlinson's—I did not give him that as a reason—I said nothing to him) about it—when he came to me, he asked, was there any objection to him, for he had seen that the men had come in to me—he said that the men had been in to me, and did they say anything about him, or was there any objection to him? and I said I did not know—he said, Can I ask the men about it?"

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Harper and Robinson had not made that communication to you, should you have discharged him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I engaged him for a very short time—the three days that I engaged him for were completed when I discharged him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why did you not re-employ him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I knew if he left us, he could go to Mr. Tomlinson, where he had been employed for a long time; and he expressed a wish to me to employ him again; and if he called on the Monday, he would do so—I thought several times in the course of the morning whether I should discharge him or not; and as this communication had been made to me by the men, I thought he was a person perhaps that would not be comfortable while he stopped there, that he might be sent to Coventry by them; so I thought, taking all things into consideration, as there was a place for the man to go to, that I had better discharge him—I thought he would be more comfortable in a place where he had been working than with parties who would not consider him as an associate.</p>

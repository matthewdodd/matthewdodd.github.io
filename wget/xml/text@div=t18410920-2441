                  </hi>. I am a law-agent, and live at No. 12, Hill-street, Brompton, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster—my two sisters live in the house with me. On Friday night, the 3rd of September, about half-past nine o'clock, one of my sisters was ill in bed, in the second-floor front room—about that time I heard a loud call from her room—I was in the parlour on the ground-floor—I ran up stairs and found her bed-room door open—she gave me information, in consequence of which I searched her room and the next one, which is the hack room—in the back room I found the table drawer open, and also one of the top drawers of a chest of drawers—the things in the drawer appeared in con<lb></lb>fusion—I went up into the attic, found the window open, and a table placed under it—there was some wet foot marks on the table and a short piece of tallow candle, which appeared as if it had been trod upon—I went down and got the assistance of a policeman, who came up stairs with me—he got out of the attic window and went along the leads—I waited a minute or two, and heard him springing his rattle—I ran down into the street and found several persons collected round the end house in the street, which was unfinished—I saw two men get over the front door of that house into the street—I then went back to my house to get a light, and in a few minutes I saw the prisoner brought out in custody of the police from the unfinished house, which is six houses from mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's sister, and live with him. On the 3rd of September, about half-past nine o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, I was in the parlour and heard my sister up stairs cry out—I im<lb></lb>mediately went up to her room—she told me something—I went into the back room, which is my room, found my dressing-table drawer open, and missed a box from it, containing a gold brooch, two gold rings, one and amethyst, and a diamond slide, and from the dressing-table I missed a coral necklace—I also found one drawer of a chest of drawers open, and missed from it a metal chain with a seal attached to it, and a glass locket set round with emeralds and pearls, and also a blue glass necklace—I had seen all these things the afternoon before—inside a drawer of the chest I saw two drops of tallow, and on the floor near the drawers, I found a lucifer-match which had been ignited, and a piece of greasy paper, and on the carpet was some snuff of a candle—I saw the clothes in the drawer all pushed to the back of the drawer—I had seen all the drawers shut between seven and eight that evening, but not locked—I saw the marks of a chisel or screw-driver on two of the drawers which had been attempted to be forced—one drawer was locked, and had the mark of a chisel or something, but it had not succeeded, and another drawer which was not locked had marks of a chisel on it—I saw the marks on those drawers compared with a chisel produced by a policeman next morning, and they corresponded exactly—I had closed the attic window between five and six that evening—there is a screw to fasten it, but I did not put that in, I merely closed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About half-past nine o'clock on the evening of the 3rd of September I was called by the prosecutor—I went to the attic, found the window open, and a table just in front—I observed a wet mark on the table and on the window-cill—I heard a noise of some<lb></lb>body on the roof, and went out on the leads—it was dark—I followed the noise till I came to No. 18, the unfinished house; and just as I got to the attic window there, I observed a wet foot-mark on the window-cill—I looked into the window, and heard somebody pitch from the attic floor into the second floor—there was no staircase—I called out over into the street for assistance, and to bring me a light, and to look out at the bottom—the witness Cox brought me up a light—I could not get down from the attic to the second floor without Cox's assistance—I turned round into the front room, second floor, and saw the prisoner standing in the corner, quite up-right—I took him, and asked what he was there for—he gave me no answer—I observed his shoes—they were quite wet—it had been a very heavy rain that evening previous to that—there were some shavings near where he stood—I did not examine them that night, but next morning I went, in company with the sergeant, examined them, and found the property which was lost, and which I now produce, just covered over with shavings, where he had been standing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 101.) On the 4th of April I was in Broad-street, St. Giles's, about nine o'clock at nighf, I saw the prisoner car-rying this lead under his arm, in this handkerchief, as a bundle—I asked where he got it, he said he bought it, but he should not tell where, it was not my business—I took him to the station, and weighed it—here is 561bs. of it—I received information, and went on the 7th of April to No. 32, King-street, Holborn—I fitted this lead on the head of the back dormer, and found it exactly corresponded with the mortar, the tiles, and the paint—here is paint on the lead, and there was on the dormer.</p>

I was at work at the house, No. 32, King-street, it was under repair—I left at half-past five o'clock on the 4th of April—the lead was all safe on the dormer then—I went the next morning, and the lead was gone from the dormer—I was present when this lead was laid on the dormer—it exactly fits it as far as it goes—one piece of it is lost.</p>

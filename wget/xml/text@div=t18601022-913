                  </hi>. I live at Norwood—On the night of 15th September, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was coming along High-street, in the Borough—I had a breast-pin in my neckerchief, and a watch and chain in my waist<lb></lb>coat pocket—Ragan came up to me and took hold of me—I spushed her away—she came again and took hold of me rudely—I pushed her away—she came a third time and I pushed her away, and in pushing her away she got the pin out of my stock, and started to run away—I tried to run after her and I was knocked down in a moment—I did not see the man—I know it was a man—I got up—I did not miss my watch and chain at the moment—I did in about a quarter of an hour, and I missed about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the policeman came up immediately I was knocked down, and he caught the man who knocked me down.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 259). I was on duty in High-street, on 15th September, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning—I heard a cry of stop thief, right opposite St George's Church—I saw the last witness struggling with the female—I did not take any notice—I saw the female make away—he went to make after the female and the prisoner Harty struck him a blow which knocked him down—I don't know who the female was, but I ran across the road and took Harty six or eight yards from where the prosecutor was—he was running away—I took him and went to the prosecutor—I found the nature of the case and I sprang my rattle, and I asked the prosecutor the way the female had gone—he followed in that direction, and Ragan was stopped by another constable—she went to the station, and the prosecutor charged them with stealing his watch and chain, and pin, and a purse containing about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money.</p>

               <p>of Mr. Buston, a tobacco-pipe maker—I was a journeyman after had I served my seven years—there was a man of the name of Gosling—Mr. Buston did not charge me with stealing some pigeons belonging to himself or to Gosling—I did not leave in a moment—it is utterly untrue—I posi<lb></lb>tively deny anything of the sort which reflects on my character before I was a policeman—I did not search Harty on the spot—I searched him when I got to the station—I did not find anything—I searched the neighbourhood and the churchyard—I did not find anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas David Grounds, a chemist, of 28, Chard Place, Hackney—on the evening of 16th November I went with a friend to the railway-station at Forest Hill after 12 o'clock—she wanted to catch the last train—my husband would not leave the house—when the train had gone I mistook the prisoner for my friend, and said "You have lost the train"—she was dressed like my friend—we left the station, and she said "I want to go in here"—that was into Mr. Johnson's, a public-house—she asked me to drink, and said "Don't be stuck up, drink something"—I asked her to take me to St. Germain's Road—she said "Will you give me a shilling?"—T said "I cannot, I have given my purse to my friend"—she said "I will have your ring," and put my hand in her mouth and bit my finger—she took the ring and said "I will have your wedding-ring"—I said "You will not"—she pulled me back and pulled my bonnet off and went away—I went to two or three houses and then met Tyneham, a policeman—this bonnet and this ring are mine.</p>

             called for brandy and water; I said that is a very good house of your's Mr. Forbes, you seemed pretty busy; yes it is, says he, I have been sitting up the skittle-ground; I asked him if he had not better send his wife word that he should not be at home all night to prevent her being uneasy, and offered him a sheet of paper for that purpose; his answer was he could not write; Grace offered to write for him, which he did; Grace read to him what he wrote, and went with it; Plenty of brandy and water was drank; two or three ladies came to see him, and he was very liberal with his brandy and water, but paid nothing; the next morning several came to see him, one a younger brother, and a person of the name of Crawley, and several others; from circumstances which appeared to me suspicious, no bail being offered, I sent for Mr. Wyatt, the attorney for the plaintiff, to send somebody to identify the person; his clerk came over, and from him I understood that I had not got the right person; I then did not know what to do; I went in and asked him if his name was not John Forbes, and he said that was no matter; I cannot exactly say; when he was let out, for he was let out when I was not at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. And after you had been informed by the clerk of the attorney that he was not the man, still you ran the risk of keeping him? - A. The clerk said it was not the man, but if they were in the habit of personating one another he could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect the name of the plaintiff? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you do not recollect the name of the plaintiff, for whom you served that writ? - A. Really for the moment I cannot; if you will give me leave to look at the warrant, I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it happen to you every day that you have actions against you for a mistake? - A. Once besides this since.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to say you do not recollect the name of the plaintiff? - A. In the other instance, I have an execution for the money now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you consulted Mr. Chester about trying that gentleman for a conspiracy? - A. No, because he behaved like a gentleman; Mr. Forbes never said he was not the man, and that gentleman did immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that either you or Mr, Chester explained the warrant to him? - A. He read the warrant to him but not loud.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you standing when Mr. Chester read the warrant? - A. In the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. And you heard him read every word of it? - A. I do not know that he read every word, but he explained it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he read and explained it to him? - A. I do not mean to say he read every word; but he told him he must go with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that it was explained to him that it was a writ against John, and not against Richard Forbes? - A. It was explained that

               <p>Q.Will you swear that you saw him take any money of any one customer whatever? - A. He was standing at the bar in the act of taking money; I saw the money.</p>

               <p>Q. The two defendants are just of the same height, I think? - A. No; but I had not seen either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time Mr. Chester was not an attorney, but a bailiff's follower, is that so? - A. No; but that I might have a sufficient witness from the character I had heard of them, I asked the favour of Mr. Chester to go with me; Mr. chester and I have been intimate fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not your assistant with you? - A. Yes; but I asked Mr. Chester to go to be a witness, whether he was the landlord or not.</p>

               <p>Q.Not Mr. Chester? - A.

               <p>Q. You were never told that this man did not owe a farthing in the world? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That you mean to swear? - A. I never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire the clerk to the attorney to attend you in this caption? - A. No, we had rather be without the clerks, for they very often spoil the business, especially if we have shy people to deal with.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard a great deal about the persecution you have endured, in this prosecution being brought against you; did he not offer to make it up if you would give a bottle and a bird, or a treat? - A. No; I had

               <p>Q. For what purpose was it that Mr. Chester, the attorney, went? - A. Because there were a great many Irishmen used the house, and Irishmen are very fond of taking one another's parts.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were you ever in a lock-up house before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a shoemaker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What else? - A. Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever assist in a thing of this sort before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known Purkis long? - A. About two years; I came to know him by his arresting a man that Mr. Chester sued out a writ for.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you known Mr. Chester? - A. Between three and four years; he is my attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you meet with this worthy gentleman? - A. Somewhere about five or six o'clock in the evening; I went to Mr. Chester's, and he was not at home; I then went to Mr. Purkis's to see for him, as I had some business to settle with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that Purkis gave Mr. Chester the warrant? - A. In the lock-up house, before we went out, and he was in the act of reading it to the man in the bar when Purkis came in; Purkis requested me to pay particular attention to the whole of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you particularly attended to the reading of this warrant? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Grace attend particularly to the reading of it? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Grace? - A. He came in with his master from the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that Grace was not in the tap-room at the time that Mr. Chester held this conversation with him? - A. I think he was not, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the tap-room door? - A. About two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see them come in? - A. They might be in and I not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. You pitied that poor woman very much? - A. I am never without the feelings of humanity.</p>
               <p>Q. She cried very much, did not she? - A. She seemed very much intimidated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not cry? - A. I did not see any tears flow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not that strike you as a little remarkable? - A. I thought her eyes were dryer than women's eyes in general are that are in trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you said some soothing words to her? - A. I never spoke to her.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you might, as you felt for her so much, and being so very humane a man? - A. I might, but I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Richard said to her, my dear, do not be alarmed, it will soon be over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect, as well as you can, the very words that Richard used, when he was speaking to her? - A. Do not be alarmed, my dear, I shall be back soon.</p>
               <p>Q. The warrant had been read to him? - A. Yes; in her hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. And, therefore, she could not but be acquainted that the arrest had taken place upon his person? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wife seem to recover her spirits, and appear less agitated, after that? - A. No, I think not; he then asked her for some money, and said, do not let me go without any money; she happened to be in the bar at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first came in, Mrs. Forbes was in the bar? - A. When I called for a pint of beer, I saw the defendant, Richard, in the tap-room, standing by the fire, and this lady in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at the lady, and be sure that that is the lady? - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think Purkis expressed himself with as much concern and good nature? - A. He is used to things of that sort, and his feelings, of course, must be more callous.</p>
               <p>Q. How close was she to Purkis at the time the warrant was reading? - A. I suppose two or three yards; I was paying attention to the warrant being read.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman say any thing to Purkis? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040057"></xptr>Q. Do you recollect any chat between them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They were some time in chat together, were they not? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Purkis from the man at the time he asked the wife for the money, and said, do not let me go without some money? - A. He was either in the passage or the tap-room; Purkis was in the passage when the warrant was reading.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Grace when this man asked the wife for some money? - A. With his master.</p>
               <p>Q. The wife had seen all this, you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came any body to be foolish enough to suggest, that a note should be written to let the wife know where he was? - A. Mr. Purkis sent Grace in with a piece of paper, and a pen and ink, for him to write to her.</p>
               <p>Q. The man began to write, but afterwards would not go on with it? - A. I think not, I think be said he could not write.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go back to the lock-up house? - A. I went to smoke my pipe; I thought I might as well go there as any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. And you having to go to Jermyn-street? - A. That was all in my way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand that this conversation, between the wife and the husband, took place at the Falcon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wife go with the husband to the lockup house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till after they got to the lock-up house that the paper was produced for him to write? - A. No.</p>

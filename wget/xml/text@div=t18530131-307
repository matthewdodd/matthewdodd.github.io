                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, and live at No. 4, Greyhound-court, Strand. The prisoner was in my service from March till the 13th Sept, when I discharged him—after that time he was employed by me merely as a friend—he came in occasionally to see how I was getting on—at various times he assisted me, and I gave him a small remuneration for his services, as circumstances would admit—I sent him occasionally to the Blind School at St. John's Wood with work, and I trusted him with the check book—the check was filled at the time with the amount for the work</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310094"></xptr>
               <p>he carried in, and the schoolmaster there signed the account of the work delivered—I have been accustomed to work for Mr. Watts, of Crown-court, Temple Bar, and he paid me every week—that work consisted of sundry office work; nothing connected with the Blind School—I worked for Mr. Watts since 1843—the work for the Blind School was binding books; nothing else—it was my custom to send the work, when complete, to the school, and the schoolmaster signed the check which had been written by me for the amount of the work which I delivered—when the prisoner had got the check he brought it to me—when he came out I said, "Have you got Mr. Wood's signature?"—he opened the book, and showed me that it was signed—I saw the signature, and he put it in his pocket, and it was delivered to Mr. Watts—I saw no more of it—on the 2nd Oct. I sent home by the prisoner fourteen copies of the Epistles to the Corinthians—the charge for binding them was 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot say whether, when the prisoner returned from the Blind School on that occasion, he showed me the check, for I never had any suspicion of him, and did not take any notice—after he came from the Blind School I told him to take the check to Mr. Watts or Mr. Stevenson, and bring me the amount—I think he brought me back the full amount—this is the bill, the receipt, and the check, No. 28, which I gave the prisoner on that occasion—the bill was for fourteen copies Corinthians, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., less 5 per cent discount, for Mr. Watts—it is now 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and for twenty-five copies—the prisoner paid me the sum of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. only—sometimes I gave the prisoner a shilling for going to the Blind School, sometimes half-a-crown, according as my pocket would allow.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you tore two leaves out of a book, was there anything in the part you gave away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a single thing—it was a new book—he wanted one, and I gave it him—they were pulling down the adjoining premises, and this friend said to me, "Here is a parcel of old stuff, will you have it?" I said, "Being in humble circumstances, I will thank you for it;" and I went up stairs and brought down this book—he was in want of a pocket book, and I gave it him—having refreshed my memory by this leaf I can say that what I sent on that occasion was fourteen copies, and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Watts, of Crown-court, On 2nd Oct. I saw the prisoner—he came to Mr. Watts' office to receive money, according to his usual custom—this is the bill and check which he presented—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the exact sum I paid—the amount on the bill is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the discount reduced it to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I drew the attention of the prisoner to the erasure in this bill—I asked him how it was that the alteration was made—he said that they had accomplished more work than they thought they should be able to do—it was customary for them to come on Friday, and tell me the probable amount that their bill would be, that I might be prepared for the check—I cannot tax my memory whether he had been on that Friday, but when I found there were alterations he said they had been able to get home more work than they thought of being able to accomplish.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You paid this money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it is on account of work done for the Blind School—the prisoner used to receive it for about ten months—it was on the strength of Mr. Wood's signature that I paid the money—I never would pay a bill without Mr. Wood's signature—the bill and Mr. Griffiths' receipt were always brought together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had such a thing ever occurred before as an alteration in the bill by their having done more work than they thought for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was an alteration once by adding to, not by scratching out—an 0 had been turned into a 9—that was correct—our time for paying money is from 6 till 8 o'clock on Saturday evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the Blind School, in Avenue-road, St. John's Wood. This check was presented to me most likely on the Friday—if Oct. the 2nd was on Saturday, it was presented to me on the 1st of Oct. by the prisoner—I have a duplicate of the entry—when it came it had the delivery paper with it, and my paper had Mr. Griffiths' signature to it, showing that I had that number of books—here is on it "fourteen copies of Corinthians"—this I received with the books, and after having examined it I gave the check—the entry on the check was "fourteen Corinthians," the same as this duplicate is—it is now "twenty-five Corinthians"—the books the prisoner left corresponded with the number on the bill and check.</p>

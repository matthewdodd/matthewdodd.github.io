On the 26th of March, about nine o'clock, I was coming from Somerset-house, where I had been attending a lady; I met the prisoner and another; an observation passed, which induced me to look at them -I went into my shop, told my young man there were some slippery chaps about, and the window would very likely be cut - I had but just put down my hat, and gone to the fire, when my lad went out, and found the prisoner with his hand in the window; I believe the window had been cut before, though I had not noticed it.</p>
               <p>JAMES TIMSON. I live with the prosecutor. About a quarter or twenty minutes past nine o'clock he came in, and said there were two suspicious looking chaps about the window - I looked, and saw the prisoner with his back to the window; I went into the shop, and saw him draw his hand from the window - I went out after him, and as he was walking away, I went after him, and brought him back - I saw the hole cut in the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was it likely I could see you? A. Yes; you had your head turned, and could see me, or else you would not have walked away at the instant - there was no one else at the window.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is there any case inside? A. Yes, it is inclosed with a glass sliding sash; there is a gas-light close to the window - I have no doubt the prisoner is the person; we missed six combs, and have never found them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at Bow-street that there were two persons at the window, and I ran away.</p>

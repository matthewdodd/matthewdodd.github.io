            . I am foreman to Messrs. Rivingtons; their names are Francis, Charles, and John.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you accuse these prisoners of - A. On the 19th of July, we had six books come from the binders, and on the 20th or 21st following, one of these books were missing; which circumstance I mentioned to Mr. Rivington. I was desired to attend Hatton Garden office; where I saw the book that was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man and woman prisoners - A. The man was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to the shop for some little articles; he was porter to Mr. Smith, one of our bookbinders. He used to come to our house with the books. I know nothing of the woman.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ILEBURY. I am foreman to Mr. Bird, bookbinder. We bound these books, and sent them home to Mr. Rivingtons on the 19th of July last. I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THISSELTON. I am an officer. I received private information that the female prisoner had pledged a quantity of books that she had received from her husband. I went to Mr. Hill's, the pawnbroker; there I found some new printed books, Bibles, and religious books. I at last, found the man prisoner worked at Mr. Smith's, in Albious-buildings; he is a bookbinder; he works for Messrs. Rivington. I went into the house, and apprehended the man prisoner. The woman was waiting in Albions-buildings; I apprehended her. I afterwards found that the book mentioned in the indictment was bound at Mr. Bird's, in Hatton Garden. I discovered there were thirty pledges at Mr. Hill's; all new books. Out of these, several were claimed by Mr. Rule, as the property of Messrs. Rivingtons. The prisoner acknowledged that he had done it through distress. I asked him how he had done it; he said, he took home the work between boards, when he delivered his work he used to purloin books, and put them between the boards; he told his master so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a false thing his saying I took them between boards and brought them away.</p>
               <p>Thisselton. He did most positively say, he took them away between boards. He told me his wife used to pawn them. He said before the magistrate, he did it through want.</p>

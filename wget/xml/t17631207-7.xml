He used sometimes to come to shave himself, and clean his shoes. He came last Monday was a week, about half an hour after seven in the morning; after he had brushed his shoes, I saw him take a shaving-cloth, and put it into his left side coat pocket, in the inside his coat; he was suspected before, so we had an eye upon him. I went for a constable, and he was taken into custody; after which I saw him drop the cloth by the side of a table. When he was in the coach going to Newgate, he said, he never wronged any body but my master, and that he was a fool for wronging of him, who had been so good a friend to him.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. I did not see the prisoner take the cloth, but when my master was giving the constable charge of him, I saw him drop it. When I was in Newgate, to see him afterwards, he said, As I knew we in the house had a suspicion of him, why did I not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070009"></xptr> tell him? then he never would have wronged my master any more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allison. I have known the prisoner 2 years and about 6 weeks; he work'd with me a year and a fortnight, and behaved very well during that time. I never did suspect him before Nov. the 6th, when he was seen to take a cloth out of my cupboard; then I gave directions to watch him. I saw this cloth now in question fall from him; he begg'd of me to let him go to the East Indies.</p>

               <p>Mr. Stauton. The prisoner worked with me 3 years, and behaved with a great deal of honesty.</p>

               <p>What did you know it by? - There was a cypher on the outside case, that was G. B. and the number of the watch was 9004, I told him so before I looked at the watch, I can swear to it safely; I do not know how my watch came into the possession of that man, his name is Isaacs, the prisoner was then in custody.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>How did you come by this watch? - Last Monday night, at the house of one Mr. Estol, in White-yard, Rosemary-lane, his son said he had a watch that his father was going to buy for him, he shewed me the watch, and I shewed it to Isaacs.</p>
               <p>- ELSTOL sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Proudfoot came into my father's house last Sunday morning, I have known him ever since I can remember; my father keeps a tallow-chandler's shop, and Mr. Proudfoot came in for some things that my father sells, and while I was serving him, he said he had a watch to sell, and asked me if I would buy it; I asked him how much he asked for it, he said a guinea and a half; I asked him how long he had had it; he said, to the best of my knowledge, eight or nine weeks; I told him to shew it to my father, he asked my father a guinea and a half for it; my father said he believed that was rather too much; he took the watch again and went home, after I had served him, and I went after him, and told him if he would let me have the watch upon trial, I would give him half a guinea earnest, and I did so, and he let me have the watch.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - Right facing my father's, in White-yard, Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He stands at Mr. Johnson's door, a slopman in Rosemary-lane; my father was present when he gave me the watch, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. How long have you known Proudfoot? - Nine or ten years; he has lived there ever since I knew him first, as a servant to Mr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>After he delivered the watch to you, as you say, he still continued the same trade? - I was not present at the apprehension, I attended at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>What account did the man that had lost the watch give there? - Isaacs said he sold the watch to the prosecutor about six or seven weeks ago; the prisoner was committed by the Justice for receiving the watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not your father, or somebody who saw the watch given you by the prisoner, come here? - He did not think it necessary.</p>
               <p>Isaacs. It is a very particular watch; I never saw the prisoner before, I know nothing of him.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>You do not know that he was on board your ship that night? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were there any strangers on board that night, except your own crew? - No, not one that I know of, I went on shore about an hour, then I returned and went to bed.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was in my master's employ, whom I have lived with eighteen years, and a seaman went by decently dressed, I asked him if he wanted any clothing, he said no, he had got a watch to sell; he shewed me this watch, I thought to buy it for my own wearing, and shewed it to a friend that was going by, who is a Jew, I gave one pound eight shillings for it; he advised me to part with it, and I says to my eldest son, who is now in this Court, the watch is not what I thought it was, says he, father, Mr. Elstol's son told me he wanted a watch, shew it to him; on the Sunday morning I went and asked him to buy it; and he said shew it to my father, I did so, and he sent his son for it, I let him have it till Wednesday upon trial; when I was taken up, I told the magistrate I should know the seaman again, if I was at liberty.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you desire to be taken on board the ship? - Yes, I did, I said so to those very people, and before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor and Isaacs. What do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200096"></xptr> you say to that? - When the prisoner was in custody, he begged we would let him go out, we said, if he would allow an officer to go with him, but these people would be paid, and he said he would be damned if he did, we brought out one seaman, and he said it was not the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. What was he committed for? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Jury to Verrier. Had any of your crew been on shore between the time you lost your watch and the time the prisoner was taken up? - Yes, I had several times, and several of them.</p>

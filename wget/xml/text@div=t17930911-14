               <p>I am a constable; I was in Chancery-lane that morning about ten o'clock, I and my brother officer observed the prisoners standing at the corner of Chancery-lane, in Fleet-street, I observed Mackay to turn the corner into Chancery-lane very sharp, I says to my brother officer, it is my belief that chap is at somebody's pocket; I followed him, and I saw in Fetter-lane the prisoner Wightman close to Mr. Sharp, and I watched them, and Mr. Sharp then crossed the way, and Wightman and Mackay both crossed the way together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe them talking together? - I don't know that I did; they were close together; I then observed Mackay close to Mr. Sharp; I then lost sight of them, because of a coach passing, directly as the coach passed, Wightman ran across the way, and I saw him with the handkerchief in his hand, the other got into the middle of the highway; Wightman he ran as hard as ever he could; I ran after Wightman, and as I ran I past Mackay; Mackay he saw me, he halloos out brush; I immediately ran after the prisoner Wightman; I overtook him about half up Chancery-lane; he threw the handkerchief from him, and it very near went down an area; but I just catched it; I have kept it ever since; when I had him by the collar I crossed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110019"></xptr>over the way, and asked Mr. Sharp if he had lost an handkerchief? he said at first he did not know he had, and then he put his hand into his pocket, and he missed it, he said if it was his there was G.

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Gissard; on the 22d of March, near eight o'clock in the evening</p>
               <p>Q. Were the candles lit? - A. Yes; I was sitting by the shop fire, and saw the prisoner open the door, and take the cloth out of the shop, it was in several remnants, I ran out directly, there was a light in the shop; when he saw me coming, I saw him throw the cloths down; I ran after him, and left the cloths lying, I was within a yard of him the whole time, I never lost sight of him; when he had run about one hundred yards, he fell, and a person took hold of him, and I came up and took hold of him too, and brought him back to the shop; he had thrown them down about half way in the door, and half way out, and the shopman picked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; but I came to speak to them, they are here, I took them to Bow-street myself, my master has had the care of them ever since that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon them? - A. Not particular; but they have been kept separate from the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise when he came in? - A. No; I felt the wind come, and I turned round, and saw him come in; I had been at the door just before, and it was then shut.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear the latch listed up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these cloths? - A. About 10l. I believe they are worth more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The first thing was, you felt the wind? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's is a good accuistorned shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have left this door, though close, perhaps not actually shut? - A. No, it was shut; there was nobody had come in or gone out after I had left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear that? - A. Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the door yourself? - A. I did not try it.</p>
               <p>Q. It often happens, you know, that a door will stick, without the latch being exactly closed in? - A. I did not try it.</p>

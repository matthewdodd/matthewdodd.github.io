               <p>I am a constable: On Friday the 23d of Sept. I was going along near the five mile stone at <placeName id="t17961026-8-crimeloc51">Highgate</placeName>

I did not examine the field afterwards; when I took him, he said, he hoped I would not take him before Mr. Cox, he would beg Mr. Cox's pardon, and hoped he would not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been with a load of coals to Hampstead brewhouse, my master told me to take a sack of chaff into the stable, I went with it, and Mr. Dutton came and told me I had stole the potatoes; I don't know how the potatoes came there, I did not take them, I told him I did not know any thing about them.</p>

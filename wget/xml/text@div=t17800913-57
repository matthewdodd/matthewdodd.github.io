             is likewise clerk to them; he is a quaker by profession. On the 1st of August the prisoner Danford came to me in Smith, Wright, and Gray's compting-house; he said he had a bill which was nearly due, and he wished to pay it into our house, to the account of Hodges, Carr, and Company, at Leicester, that he himself was going out of town, and therefore could not receive it. I told him he might receive the money of Hodges, Carr, and Company, as soon as the bill was paid. He brought a bill for thirty-seven pounds five shillings, drawn upon Lancaster by Atkins; he was to pay it to us for their account, and he was to receive the money of them on his return from his journey, which he said would be in about a month. It is common to pay money in on account of country customers, and to take the money on their return. He said he would step to the inn and fetch it. He went away; he came back in a little time and paid it to another of the clerks, as I since understand, but I was not present; the clerk brought the bill to me in the compting house.</p>

               <p>Near the house Number 21? - Opposite.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular on the 5th of August? - On Saturday morning the 5th of August at about nine o'clock I saw the two prisoners go into the empty house No. 21.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether any body let them in or they let themselves in? - They let themselves in with a key; then they opened one of the parlour window shutters next the door; I was sitting at breakfast when they went into the house. In about three quarters of an hour after I saw a young man knock at the door; he was let in by somebody; when he had been in the house about a minute I heard a very dismal cry, and I heard the cry of murder! two or three times. I ran over and looked through the key-hole of the door and perceived three men struggling in the passage. I looked through some time. I asked some dustmen to break the door open; they would not. I went to the window and found the sash was fast; I gave it a sudden jerk, and some thing that it was fastened with on the inside broke, and it went up. Then they were opposite the parlour door, in the passage almost opposite the window.</p>


               <p>In what situation were the three men? - Danford had got. Watts by the collar with his right-hand, the other prisoner was behind him, and was pulling him into the house. I saw Newton have hold of the end of a letter-case, and pull it from under the banker's clerk's arm, from out of a pocket on the inside of his coat, he had got his left arm under Mr. Watts's left arm; I asked them what they were doing, if they were going to kill the man? I asked if nobody would get in at the window? I said, if no one would get in; I would. I got my knee upon the edge of the window, to get up; when Newton perceived that, he dropped the book out of his left hand into the passage, and made to the door; I heard the door unbolt; I got from the window. Newton rushed out, and as he rushed out I catched at him, but he ran under my arm. I called out stop thief! A carman was coming up with a load of coals; he stopped him, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stopped? - I did, he never was out of my sight. Then Danford rushed out; I catched him by the collar; Watts had hold of a part of his coat. When I catched hold of him he begged of me to let him go. The carman brought Newton back and gave him to me, and I then had hold of them both. The prisoners are the two men.</p>
               <p>Where was the pocket-book found? - As soon as the pocket-book was dropped the young man (Watts) made a scuffle to get the book again. When he came out with Danford I asked him who he was? He could not tell me; he could not speak. Then I saw he was almost choaked.</p>
               <p>Where was the pocket-book found afterwards? - In the passage; I saw it lying there, and saw Watts take it up.</p>
               <p>When the pocket book was taken up from the ground had you it in your hand? - Watts could not tell me who he belonged to, but I read the name in gold letters on the pocket-book, it was

               <p>Does not this passage run the depth of the house? - It does; the street is very narrow and the houses are three stories high.</p>
               <p>What you have been speaking of is as to what you discerned through the key-hole? - I observed most when I had the w indow open.</p>
               <p>With respect to the time when you said Newton took the book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not know the reason of taking the book I take for granted? - I did not.</p>
               <p>At the time of taking the book where were the persons who were struggling? - Danford was next the street door, I suppose not half a yard from it, and he had Watts by the collar. The parlour door and the street door partly join together.</p>
               <p>Whether the passage was not very dark at the moment when you saw Newton take the book? - It was not very dark; there is a window over the back door that throws a light into the passage, and there was likewise a light over the street door, the passage was not so dark but I could perceive every thing in it.</p>
               <p>You are sure upon your oath you could distinguish what passed in the passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have not you said the passage was very dark? - Not so dark but I could perceive every body there, and could perceive what they were doing. I had the best part of my body in at the window when I saw them take the book.</p>
               <p>Did you give no signal that you was at the door at the time you was there? - I knocked very loud several times.</p>
               <p>And was the book taken after the knocking? - It was.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Then you not only had the light of the windows over the back and the fore door, but the light of the window you was at? - The parlour door was wide open and the window was wide open which I was at.</p>
               <p>Danford. As she is upon her oath I beg to ask her whether she has not had a promise of being rewarded in case we were convicted? - No, I have never seen the gentlemen belonging to either of the bankers except Mr. Smith and another gentleman at the banking house; I have never seen them since.</p>
               <p>Danford. But any other person? - No, from no person.</p>

The first man who appeared was Newton running as hard as he could; I held up the but-end of my whip to him and told him if he did not stop I would knock him down. I seised him with my right hand by the left wrist. He said for God's sake don't stop me, it is only the bailiffs after me. I said bailiffs or devils I will have you back again. I put my left hand round his neck and took him back to Mrs. Boucher's; there the other prisoner was and there I left him; she said that was the same man who ran out of the house before Danford.</p>

               <p>You are rent gatherer, I believe, to Mrs. Brown whose house is No. 2 Water-lane, Black-Friars? - The house is her property.</p>
               <p>Did any body apply to you for the key of it? - A man applied to me on the 28th of July, he went by the name of Coats.</p>
               <p>Was it either of the prisoners? - I cannot take upon me to say that it was either of them; I am not positive to them. He asked what kind of an house we had to let? I told him. He asked to look at it? I said the key was at Mr. Lardner's, the next door; that he might have it to look at the premisses.</p>
               <p>You have seen the house since? - I have.</p>
               <p>Did you find it in the same situation as when he had the key? - He came on the 28th; he was to give me an answer; he did not come till the Monday following, which was the 31st of July; then he had the key; he was desired to leave the key at Mr. Lardner's again, where he had it from; what he had the key for was, as he said, to have a woman in the house to clean it down.</p>
               <p>Had he taken the house? - No, not positively, but he had left half-a-guinea as earnest for taking it; between that and Monday he was to give a positive answer whether he would absolutely take it or not. I told him the rent was twenty pounds a year and all taxes; he agreed to give the rent.</p>
               <p>Then what remained unsettled? - He said the house was for a friend in Sheffield, to make a hardware warehouse of, who did business for a person on Ludgate-hill, and he thought it would be convenient for him.</p>
               <p>If the agreement was not settled how came he to leave half-a-guinea? - He said, that the woman who cleaned the house was to leave the key at Mr. Lardner's again; this was the Monday; on the Thursday following I went down and found the key was not left with Mr. Lardner. I went to the door and found he had taken the bill off the window. I knocked at the door, not knowing but there might be somebody in the house; there was nobody there; I have been down the cellar stairs several times since.</p>
               <p>Was there a free passage to the cellar at the latter end of July? - Yes; when the person had the key, it was quite clear. I went there upon the 5th of August; then I found there was a door barricadoed on the cellar stairs, to prevent a person going down into the cellar, there had not been any such thing before. I went down to the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Could you go into the cellar on the 5th of August? - Yes, but that was after the prisoners were taken; the door was then broke open which had been put upon the cellar stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether there had been a fastening at the bottom of the cellar stairs different from any which were there when you let the house? - Yes; at the top of the cellar stairs the door was made much more secure than ever it had been before, and there was a large door on the stairs, it might be two or three steps down; there was a sort of a little landing place under another stairs which went up, and this was about two stairs below that.</p>
               <p>So that when you passed the first door you could not get down stairs? - No, because of the other door.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are speaking of alterations which have been made after you had taken the half-guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was made whilst they had the key? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the passage from the street door, was it dark when the door was shut? - It was a long passage, not very light; but there is a light over the street door, and from the back yard directly across, so that you might see from one window to the other.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. Then it is light enough to see into it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever had the key again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you get it? - I had the key from Mrs. Lardner on the Saturday after these men were taken.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter. I went to examine the cellar stair-case of this house, No. 21, in Water-lane.</p>
               <p>Describe it? - The door opens into a passage, which leads straight through into the yard; there is a light over the yard door and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130066"></xptr> a light over the front door. The stair-case is about the middle of the building on the left hand, there was an open stair-case, and there is a door which opens to the cellar stairs which is under the stairs which lead up to the dining-room, and about half way down the cellar stairs, it was enclosed with a strong door fixed up about five steps or half way down, and the door opening to the cellar stairs was strengthened by a batten nailed up the inside of the door; a whole staple was driven into the left-hand post, and an half staple into the right-hand post, and a wooden bar of the parlour window shutters was cut in two in order to make a bar to fix into these staples; one end to go into the whole staple, and the other into the half staple, the top door was weak, and so they had strengthened it with a piece of wood.</p>
               <p>If any person was enclosed between these two doors could they be heard by any person? - It must be some time first, for it is just in the centre of the building. It is a dismal place if they had shut him in there, for there was no light at all when the door was shut.</p>

               <p>Where does this house stand? - In Water-lane Black Friars.</p>

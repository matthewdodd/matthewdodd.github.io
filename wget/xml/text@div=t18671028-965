                  </hi> I reside at 21, Lawford Road—in August last the prisoner was in my service as general servant, and had been so for three months and a fortnight—when she had been with me about a month she wig ill one evening, and after she had gone to bed I went up to her, and told her I was afraid she was in trouble, and if she would confide in me I would be a friend to her through it—she assured me it was not so, and said all her family were very peculiar figures in that way—I said this to her inconsequence of what I had observed about her figure—on Tuesday, 13th August, at half-past eleven at night, I heard her coming down stairs, and I went out to ask her what the matter was—she said she had the diarrhoea—about two o'clock the same morning my sister, who slept in the same room, came and made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went out of my room and met the prisoner coming down stairs—I said, "What is the matter? "—she said she was suffering great pain in her chest—she went down stairs—I waited until she came up, and I asked her again what made her ill—she said she had eaten too plentifully of some Orleans plum pudding that we had had for dinner—she seemed much about the same at that time—I went to her about a quarter of an hour afterwards to ask her how she was—she said she was very much better, and that she should not require me to order anything for her then—about three o'clock I heard her go down stairs again, and I went down and saw her coming out of the scullery—I then noticed that her hands and arms and the front of her dress were covered with blood—I again asked her what the matter was—she said she had been violently sick, and had brought up the blood—I then told her to go up and lie down on the bed, and I went out of the house to look for a policeman—about half an hour afterwards I sent for Dr. Woolley—he came about half-past four.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. On 14th August I was sent for to 21, Law<lb></lb>ford Road, Kentish Town, about a quarter-past four in the morning—I went there and saw the prisoner in the first-floor back room—she was called of from the kitchen—I asked her if she had been ill—she said she had, she had been suffering from diarrhoea and sickness, and had suffered great pain—I ordered her to be put to bed—I then examined her, and was convinced that she had been recently delivered of a child—I said to her, "You hare had a child, have you not? "—she said, "Yes"—I asked where it was—she said, "In the coal-cellar"—I asked her if it cried—she said, "No"—I then went into the coal-cellar and found a baby in the corner, covered up with coal-dust—it was an ordinary coal-cellar, about ten feet square, under the area steps—after cleaning away the coal-dust I examined the body of the child—I judged that it had been dead a few hours, possibly two or three hours—I have no doubt but it had breathed—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination the same evening—there was no bruise or anything tobe seen externally; on the left side of the neck was a large wound extending through the skin, the muscles, and the blood vessels; it cut through all the parts except a little skin and muscle on the right side—the body weighed six pounds and five ounces, and measured twenty and a half inches, is length—the umbilical cord was torn about five inches from the body, not tied—the body had not been washed—I made an internal examination, and found a bruise on the top of the head, and below the scalp a portion of effused blood—the general appearance of the head and the whole body ill healthy—in my opinion the wound in the neck was the cause of death—it would produce immediate death by the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there much coal in the cellar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, a very small quantity—the body was covered over with coal-dust, perhaps a few hatfuls, such a quantity as might be raised in a shovel, a hatful, Mt perhaps more—I believe the child had breathed—I have every reason to believe it was born alive; the lungs were inflated—it is quite possible that a child may breathe before it is separated from the body of the mother; that would account for the inflation of the lungs, but when wholly separated from the mother it might not have been alive—if the gash on the throat was inflicted immediately after death I suppose blood would still flow, although I have no experience in such cases—the blood would not flow a. the same way from a dead child as from a living one; if it was dead only a few moments, the blood would flow quite differently—I have had a good deal of experience in these matters—I believe this was the prisoner's first child, but I do not know—women do not always calculate the time they are about to be delivered, and when the pains come on they sometimes mistake them for a desire to go to the closet—I have read of cases of delivery in the watercloset—I have not bad such a case, but I have had cases where ladies have been delivered in the room while standing, and the child has fallen to the ground; sometimes the head of the child might be slightly damaged—if the child fell in that way the cord would usually be torn—cannot imagine that this wound on the neck was one cut—the head was nearly severed from the body—my impression of the prisoner was that she was of weak intellect—it is within my experience that coincident with the pains of labour there is certain mental disturbance—in the case of</p>

"—I said, "I am; this is a bad job"—she said, "Yes, I did not know what to do with it"—I found this knife in the knife-drawer in consequence of what Mrs. Scholefield said tome—I examined the prisoner's boxes and found this dress smothered in blood—I found no baby linen.</p>

                  </hi> I am surgeon of Newgate—I have been in the habit of seeing the prisoner since she has been in the prison—I visited her daily, and examined her—she is very deaf, and has been so I believe from birth—I feel sure she has not heard anything that has been going on—I am of opinion that she is of weak intellect; her knowledge of language is extremely limited—if I was to address her as I should anyone it ordinary conversation, she would not understand me; I should have to adapt my language to her capacity—she would answer questions within for range, rationally; but she would be incompetent to answer many questions put to her that would require reasoning or knowledge; for instance, she has read her Bible, but she does not know the names of any of the books—she could not tell me that two and two would make four, or that a quarter of a thing would be the fourth of it—I had some conversation with her about the case—my opinion decidedly is, that she is below the average of mind—there is a sympathetic connection between the uterine organs and the brain—during conception and child-bearing, and afterwards, when giving milk, women 'are more susceptible of mental disturbance than at other periods—I think there is a great tendency to mental disturbance during delivery, and in the case of a person of weak intellect I think it might be increased; there would be less power of mental control and less appreciation of facts.</p>

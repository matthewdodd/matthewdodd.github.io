The morning that I was taken into custody I did not like to have her any longer. I saw her not sufficient for my use. I was rather dubious. I told her to go about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. What prison was you taken to? - A. To Cold-bath fields, about eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When the constable took you from your house how did you leave your house? - A. I secured both the windows, and locked the door, and the key I put in my pocket, and came away with the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get out of prison? - A. On the 14th.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you leave in your house? - A. One hundred and three guineas in one draw, and two pound odd in another.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that hundred and three guineas packed? - A. Ninety-three guineas were packed in the leg of a stocking, and ten guineas were loose in the same drawer, and the two pounds were in another drawer, and I am confident that I lost more than eight hats, but I will only say eight. I will make them as low as I can.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned you found your gold safe in your stocking? - A. No, on the eleventh of the month,

               <p>Q. Did not Camplin tell you that she lived there, and that she wanted to get in that night? - A. She did not say any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say about this hat, speak the truth? - A. She said no more than I told you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say that she sold the hat by permission of Kallyn? - A. No, she told me that she sold one hat before for fifteen shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not they say it was very near eight o'clock? - A. It must be very near nine, because she was with him in the lock-up place at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you do not know what time of night this was that they robbed the house? - A. Upon my word I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Camplin say that on the night she was let in the house by Fordham, that she slept in the house that night? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this you went to Kallyn, did you? - A. Yes. On the eleventh I went to him in prison, he told me to take the key of his drawers and of his door, and deliver up what property there was to Mr. Pedder. Mr. Pedder went with me to Mr. Kallyn's house. I found in a drawer, that was broken open, ninety guineas, which I delivered up to Mr. Pedder. Mr. Pedder and I were only present when the money was found in a stocking, in the drawer. Mr. Dodd came in when Mr. Pedder was counting the money.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the house you did not find any of the hats in disorder? - A. The hats were in the shop as usual, and none of the furniture was hurt, as I perceived.</p>

I heard a noise as if some one was breaking a lock about ten minutes to eight o'clock; I went out round to the meadow at the back—I stopped there till a quarter past eight, and heard some one in a garden—I got over into Mr. Vann's garden, and found this roll of paper hanging on the seat of an arbour where I had been before, and it was not there—I secreted myself, and in a few minutes I saw the prisoner put his head out of a green-house—I ran and collared him—he said it was all right—I secured him, and he begged me to let him go—he then begged me not to take him to Mr. Gee's, as he knew him—I took him to the watch-house, and found this cord and a knife on him—I went to the place with his shoes, which I took off, and found the marks in the snow, and then I found a door had been broken open—I went to Mrs. Vann's garden, and found some shells and a pair of gloves.</p>

On the 4th of February I went to my summer-house, and found the door broken open, and this roll of paper, three shells, a pair of thick leather gloves, and a piece of rope gone—this cord found on the prisoner is mine.</p>

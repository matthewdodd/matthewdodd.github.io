I am foreman to Mr. John Keen, my uncle, who assists Mr. Henry Founes in the manufacture of gloves, which were kept in the counting-house, in Falcon-lane, Battersea—the prisoner worked for Mr. Founes, at his own house at Battersea. On the 19th of October I was in the shop, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and saw him put one hand into each coat pocket with something in them—there were pieces of leather for gloves near him—he appeared to be putting some into his</p>

I was applied to by Mr. Founes the next day, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and went into a piece of pound called Latchmore, behind the manufactory, which is let out in tene<lb></lb>ments—I found the prisoner there at work—Keen, the foreman, who was with me, informed him that gloves were missing, and he was suspected—he slid, "I do not know why you suspect me"—I said, "You are my prisoner"—he was digging up potatoes—I took him home to his house, and when within a short distance of the house I saw his wife and daughter standing near the house—the moment the wife saw me coming she ran into the house—I followed quickly, and saw her carrying something away through the kitchen—I knocked at the door—she came and opened it, and among some foul linen lying in a chair wrapped up—I found thirty pairs of unfinished gloves—I cautioned the prisoner not to speak, but he said, "There are no more in the house, I took them last night—I had had my work complained of, and I took these of a man's to compare with mine, to see if there was any fault to be found with mine."</p>

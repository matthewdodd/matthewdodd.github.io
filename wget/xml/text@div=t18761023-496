                  </hi>. I live at West Barnet—on 16th September at 10 p.m, I was in the New Road; the prisoner came across to me and hallooaed to me to stand something to drink—I said "No <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> not to-night, I will another day;</p>

               <p>he said "Are you going to your Lodge?"—I said "Yes"—foe said "I will show you a nearer way come along"—he took me down a lane, knocked me down into a hedge and two more men came and got on top of me—I do not how who they were—the prisoner got on top of me and robbed me of five half-crown and a tobacco box which were in a bag in my trousers pocket—they cut my pocket off and left me—I am sure the prisoner is one of the men; I gave information to the police next morning and the prisoner was taken.</p>

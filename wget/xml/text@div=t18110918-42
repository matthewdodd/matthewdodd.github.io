            . Q. You served the prisoner. - A. Yes, she looked out a number of shawls, she ordered them to be laid of one side, they were to be sent to a neighbour for inspection, and afterwards she looked at some prints, upon which she made great confusion on the counter and took one piece which I missed, I shewed it to her, and that print I found upon her, it was a piece of printed cambric, about seven yards, when I missed the print, I asked Mr. Thomas if he had removed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop her. - A. Mr. Thomas said he suspected that she had got what was not her own, she unfolded the napkin, and produced the print that I had missed.</p>
               <p>Q. She bought nothing of you then. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that print your master's. - A, Yes it was, I had shewn it her with the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make any difficulty in shewing it. - A<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180019"></xptr>No, after a little hesitation she opened the napkin and produced the print.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your Lordship and gentlemen of the Jury, situated as I now stand at this criminal bar, my tongue is unable of utterance, I humbly submit these few lines to your humane consideration that I was formerly a servant, through illness and an unfortunate companion I lost my character, since then I have been in a state of mental derangement, and till this unfortunate affair I never had a stain in my character. I trust for a just and merciful verdict.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutor). What is the prime cost of this. - A. Three shillings and four pence a yard, there are seven yards.</p>

Mr. Spencer came to my house that day and told me he had some brass that he had stopped, brought by my maid; he brought it to me; there were two pounds and a quarter of it. I asked the prisoner how she came to do so; she said she was very sorry for it, and begged I'd forgive her, saying, she was sometimes out of her senses.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been your servant?</p>
               <p>Midwinter. About three weeks. The brass produced in court; the prosecutor deposed to part of it.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Spencer's at the Seven Stars, Fleet Ditch, he is a brasier. Mr. Midwinter lives in Shoe-lane at the Five Bells. The prisoner came three times to my master's shop with brass; the second time my master saw it, and said he suspected she did not come honestly by the brass; the third time I told my master the same woman was come again. He is shewn the brass, and deposes it is what he bought of the prisoner. I cannot tell the day she brought it; I believe it is about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she say it belonged to?</p>
               <p>Garret. She said it was her own.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give per pound?</p>
               <p>Garret. I gave her after the rate of sixpence per pound. I was with her before the alderman; the brass was laid upon the table before her; she owned she took it, and that she was out of her senses at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem to be out of her senses?</p>
               <p>Garret. No, my lord, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner at the bar you bought the brass of?</p>
               <p>Garret. I went to Mr. Midwinter's house to see if I knew her; she was melting butter; she ran her head up the chimney because I should not see her face; she knew me, and I knew her.</p>

               <p>"You are my prisoner;" he had two bundles of foul linen with him - I desired my young man to open them, and enclosed in one of them I found the same six yards of printed muslin, and two shawl handkerchiefs. I went to the place where the muslin had been concealed, and it was gone. I had never sold him anything of the sort, and am sure that they then formed part of my stock. The female prisoner was searched by the officer, who found several duplicates, one was for some silk, which had been stolen prior to this time.</p>

I found it on the piece in the kitchen - when I saw it in the bundle I saw the same mark. I had no more of that pattern. He lived in my house; he occupied a room with another young man.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Pincott's. On the 20th of April the carpenters were there at work; they had occasion to go down to the kitchen for some wood, and in consequence of something they said I went down, and saw the print under some boards in the back kitchen. I gave information to Mr. Pincott immediately; he came down and saw it there - he desired us all to be silent, and placed me to see who came for it. In about an hour the prisoner came to the place, and staid about a minute - he then went up stairs; I went immediately to the place, and the muslin was gone. I had seen the handkerchiefs in the shop which I found in the bundle of dirty linen. The prisoner was near me, and saw the bundle opened; he said nothing at the time. The private mark is on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When had your master taken stock - A. In August or September last. When goods are sold the private mark is generally cut off. Any of the workmen might have gone into the room. I saw the prisoner come down and go to the place, but I did not see him take anything. I could not get out of the kitchen in time to stop him, but I followed him up stairs.</p>

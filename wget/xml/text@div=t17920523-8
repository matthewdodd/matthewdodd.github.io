               <p>Prisoner Cropper. Which way did they get into the cellar? - I suppose through the door.</p>
               <p>Have you any servants that sleep in the house? - To be sure, in a room adjoining the shop; it is a long way from where they lay to where the persons got in.</p>
               <p>Court. Could this disturbance have been made in the shop, without their hearing? - I think I should have heard it; but as they went to bed late, they might not hear it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How high was the archway? - Not so high as this sounding-board.</p>
               <p>Do you think it possible that a person in my situation (being lame) could get into such a place? - The Jury must judge of that.</p>
               <p>Can you positively swear to the things that were taken out of my wife's pocket? - I can, and have, with the exception of the table-spoon.</p>

               <p>I was one of the headboroughs of Whitechapel. I went to Cropper's house before five in the morning, before Mr. Bateman went; when I came to Cropper's house, I clapped my back against the window, and heard a nicking; I stood there, and called to a publican for something to drink; his name is Moody; Cropper came by from Petticoat-lane; he spoke to me; I was at a little distance from Cropper's, about five yards off, on the same side of the way; he passed Moody's house, and then came up to me; he passed me, coming from Petticoat-lane, to go to his own house; in the doing which, he must pass me; I was calling to Moody for something to drink; Cropper said, Moody will not be up this hour and a half; I said he must get up; Cropper was alone, and went past me to his own house; it was quite day-light; as Cropper passed me, his right shoulder was dirty with dry mortar, apparently from a broken wall, as though he had squeezed through a broken brick wall; I took particular notice of that, and that his countenance fell a little; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230012"></xptr>Cropper was in, Messer passed me with his handkerchief under his coat, and something in it, of the size of a hat-crown; he knocked at Cropper's door, and a voice within, Who is there? Messer said, It is me; the door was opened, and in he went; he returned out the same way in about two minutes; in about five minutes after, the prisoner Potts came out from Cropper's with a common corn-sack, and something in it; I followed him; when I came near to Petticoat-lane, I took it off his shoulders; I asked him what he had? he said, a few things he was going to take to market; they appeared to be such as Mr. Bateman said he had lost; they were plated goods, and some small articles in silver; I asked him where he had them, he said from Mr. Cropper; I asked him who Mr. Cropper was? he said he lived in Wentworth-street, and kept an old iron-shop; that was the house from whence he came out; I lodged him in the watch-house, and passed Cropper's, and went into Moody's; Cropper came in presently, and asked Moody for change for a 20 l. note? this might be about half past six; Moody said he could not; then he asked for change for a 10 l. note? Moody said he could not: Cropper went away, and his wife came for a kettle of water; then Mr. Bateman and two runners came to me with a warrant; and in the front parlour, by the fire, we found Mrs. Cropper, Mercer, and two men that were discharged; we handcuffed the men: Mrs. Cropper went up stairs; Cooke searched her in my presence, and found on her several silver articles: we found nothing in the house; but in the privy I found a quantity of tongues and chapes of buckles: Cohen was then taken; and in searching Mrs. Cohen, Cooke found in my presence, in her pocket, some other silver articles; they were committed the next day: Cohen delivered up the plate, and gave an account of the transaction: the things I found on Potts, I have kept ever since, sealed up: (produced and deposed to): and those that were found in the privy; a tortoiseshell tea-caddy, a plated candlestick, a plated mustard-pot, one plated salt-cellar, a plated bottle-stand, and three rims of plated buckles, with the chapes out, and a plated coffee-pot; that is all I found on Potts; these I found in the privy; I have not counted them; I think there is about three dozen; these are the buckles which Cooke took; I cannot say where he got them; he delivered them to me; they are all the rims of silver buckles; they are all broke, but all new.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cropper Will he take upon him to say he found those things in my necessary? - I cannot say it was his: another house opened into the same yard.</p>
               <p>Cropper. My Lord, it was open to five houses.</p>
               <p>Edge. I saw only two; there might be more.</p>
               <p>How did I behave when you and Mr. Bateman came? - With as much civility as a man could do.</p>
               <p>What sort of dirt did you see on my shoulder? - It appeared to be dry mortar, by rubbing against some place, with pressure on his right shoulder.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take me into custody? - I do not believe he had any thing about him; nothing appeared to me, and I did not think it prudent.</p>

               <p>I am one of the headboroughs. I went to Cropper's house with Mr. Bateman, on the 19th of April last, between five and six in the morning, with Bateman, Edge, and West: there were three men in the house; Messer was one; the other two were discharged: on Mrs. Cropper I found this property; six silver tea-spoons, new, tied together, one pair of silver sugar-tongs, two odd silver shoe-buckles, new; I took them to Justice Staples; but before that, in came Cropper, and I asked him if he had any thing about him? he said he had only a 25 l. bank note, and three or four guineas in gold; this was the bank note; I left it in the care of the magistrate, and took the No. 3997, in two places; this is my memorandum of the number; then I took them to a public house near; Cropper, his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230013"></xptr>wife and others; I searched further at Cropper's, and found nothing: I went to Cohen's, and in Mr. Cohen's pocket I found six silver tea spoons, new; I saw them sealed up and left in the care of the magistrate; I am certain they are the same: the prosecutor, Mr. Edge, and some other gentlemen, were present; I found nothing else: Cohen gave in this parcel in the afternoon of that day, which has been with the magistrate ever since; here is my writing on it: these are table spoons, tea spoons, several sugar tongs, a boatswain's whistle, all new, and the other bundle which I gave to Edge, containing rims of silver buckles; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cropper. What sort of dirt had I on my waistcoat and coat, which the justice asked me about, a kind of spots? - I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember a day before that I was white-washing and yellow-ochring my room a day or two before? - Yes I do.</p>

               <p>Did not I take both you and Mr. Bateman and Mr. Edgehall about the house, and shew you the loft? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At the time he was white washing his room was he in his coat or his waistcoat? - I believe he was in his waistcoat, but I cannot recollect; I had no business with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cropper, Do not you remember saying to me, why do not you strip and employ your man? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Edge. Had the appearance of the right shoulder of his coat, when he passed you, the appearance which could be occasioned by wet mortar from the brush of a white washer, or what you described before? - It had not the appearance of wet mortar, but of dry mortar rubbed on; I did not observe the spots on the waistcoat.</p>

            . I live in Wentworth-street, No. 126, some doors from him; he came and brought me that silver, and said Mr. Cohen, I must have thirty pounds; so I just looked in; I saw there were buckles and spoons; and I went up stairs and took the plate, and brought him down a twenty-five pounds bank note, and five guineas in gold; I said to him, Mr. Cropper, does this come to thirty pounds? he said, whether it comes to thirty pounds or not I shall bring you some more goods, and then we will settle; before he went away I asked him how long he would be before he brought the other goods? he said he would not be long; then in half an hour or three quarters, Mr. Cropper did not come, and I went to his house; I knocked at the door, which was shut; the window was half shut; some girl said, you cannot come in; I went away, and Mr. Bateman came after me and took me; then I went to Mr. Bateman's house; and when I came to the justice I told him I desired to be sworn in, and I delivered them up; the silver found on my wife she took out of the number; I was angry with her for taking them, because we had not settled; there was some red ink writing on the bank note, and my name in Hebrew characters; I had bought goods very often before of Mr. Cropper, all sorts of goods; I am a pretty general dealer; they were only fit for the melting pot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cropper. In what manner do you buy silver? - I gave him always four shillings and sixpence an ounce before: there was no bargain about this: I saw nobody besides him: he brought it and said, here is some silver, and I must have thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>How long is it ago since you was tried at this bar? - About four years and a half.</p>
               <p>What was you tried for? - For stealing of pots: I was never in goal: I was indicted and surrendered.</p>
               <p>Your wife was convicted. Was you ever an evidence against a man and his wife at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230014"></xptr>Hicks's Hall? - Yes: so was you: I bought some bandanas for smuggled: I was a witness for the crown; I was the informer.</p>
               <p>What did you swear you gave for the two pieces of Bandana handkerchiefs you produced on the first examination? - I cannot say above two pounds.</p>
               <p>What was the number of the note he says I gave him? - I cannot read English, and do not know: Mr. Cropper said he would give twenty pounds to any body that gets me into trouble; and a woman who was tried yesterday said I had bought some things of her; and it was a false charge. (The note deposed to.) I am positive it is the note I gave him.</p>

               <p>I am a Jewess. I live in Wentworth-street. I know Mr. Cropper: I heard him come to my husband: I did not see him: I knew his voice: my husband bought some silver of him: I was just getting up: he brought it up stairs and put it on the table.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you the curiosity (women they say seldom have) to look into it? - Yes; and I took six tea-spoons: my husband was angry because he had not settled with Mr. Cropper: I did not see what he gave for them: I took no notice of any thing but of the half dozen tea-spoons.</p>
               <p>In the God's speed came Mr. Cooke and took them out of your pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cropper. How many bank notes did I give your husband? - I did not see one.</p>
               <p>Did not somebody bring your husband a twenty-five pounds bank note that morning? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you pull out your pocket book and say you had twenty-five bank notes in your pocket? - No, Sir; I did not see one at all.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am son of Mr. Cohen. I was at home when Mr. Cropper came: I came in between six and seven and found Cropper in the kitchen; says I, Mr. Cropper, what are you by yourself? he said, yes, your father is gone up stairs; then my father came down, and he said, Mr. Cropper, here is a twenty-five pounds bank note and five guineas in cash: Mr. Cropper said, I shall be here presently again, and settle for every thing; I did not know for what: I saw my father give him a note and some money, but I did not know what note, only what my father said: I was taken into custody when I went after my father.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cropper. What passed between you and me at the publick-house near the magistrates? - I said my father was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.) First the property produced here by Cooke, part of that which Cohen bought; here are some buckle-rims without private marks, R. U.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to that were found on Potts.) There is some blood on the rims of the buckles: next those tongues and chapes found in the privy appearing to belong to those rims in size, and number, and shape: some of them are marked with our mark: here is not the whole of the chapes: here is a black stone knee-buckle set in base metal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is of no meltable value? - No. Here is one chape amongst them with my private mark; I have no doubt but they are my property: next the things found in Mrs. Cropper's pocket; on the sugar tongs our private mark, and on the tea spoons, and on one of the buckles, and I remember the other buckle; next the things found in Mrs. Cohen's pocket; and the bundle produced before the Justice by Mr. Cohen, consisting of salt spoons and all manner of articles; this is one salt-cellar we have sometimes used in the house and marked with a D. a great many are marked with our private mark; upon the whole I believe these to be all my property: I suppose these things are not worth thirty pounds in the state they are in; they are fairly worth more than twenty-five pounds as silver: my house is a quarter of a mile from Cropper's house</p>

               <p>You understand that the house that I live in is let out to casualty lodgers; and in the morning this was done two men who were apprehended were in my shed; they lodged in my house; these two men I did hear sold the property to Mr. Cohen; and the two men that were in the shed asked this man, Potts, to take these things on his back to London bridge, and if any body should ask him who gave them to him, to say that it was me that gave them to him: the chief witness that is coming in is a woman that was servant to me, that will swear I was in bed: a woman that I kept to do about the place, she has been taken sick and forced to go into the hospital, St. Thomas's hospital, that knows I was not out of my habitation till a quarter after five in the morning: it was a thing impossible for a person in the situation I am to do such a thing as that was; I am scarce able to stand or walk without crutches or a stick.</p>

               <p>Please you, my lord, he told me to carry these things.</p>
               <p>Cropper. My lord, he says two men gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Who hired you to carry them? - Cropper.</p>
               <p>Cropper. I did not think it necessary to call any witnesses.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Potts called one witness who gave him a very good character.</p>

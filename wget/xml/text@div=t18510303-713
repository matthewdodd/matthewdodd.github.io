                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live in Porter-street, Soho. I have known the prisoner a little more than eighteen months—on 22nd Jan. he came to me, not to lodge, but he came occasionally, and slept there several nights—he slept there on the night of 30th Jan.—on the morning of the 31st I went out to market, at a few minutes past ten o'clock—I left the prisoner in the room, and a boy in the shop—I returned in about twenty minutes—it was a wet morning—I missed my boots, and missed the prisoner—I missed a pair of trowsers and a waistcoat, which had been hanging on the door—I opened a drawer which was locked, and missed a watch and guard-chain, three breast-pins, five studs, a gold ring, a locket, four tea-spoons, a half-sovereign, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of copper—I gave information to the police—I had seen my property safe about two minutes before I went out—I had taken money out of the drawer for what I was going to have—this waistcoat is mine—these studs, this knife, and this pin, are mine—the value of all I lost was about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of police, at Leicester. In conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I took the prisoner there, on Monday evening, 3rd Feb.—he was wearing this waistcoat—the studs were in his shirt, and these pins were in this box—after a desperate struggle, we came to the ground together, and he pulled out this box, and threw it on the floor—I took him at Mrs. Bally's, his aunt's—I asked him his name; he said, "Johnson," and he came from Loughborough—from the information I had received, I asked to look for marks on his hands—he showed me his right-hand, which was clear—I asked him to let me look at his other hand; he would not—we had a desperate struggle, and broke the furni<lb></lb>ture, and came to the ground—I called for assistance.</p>

I produce a certificate of of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(<hi rend="italic">read—Convicted Nov.</hi>, 1847, <hi rend="italic">and confined six months</hi>)—the prisoner is the person—he was in the Coldstream Guards—I have heard he bought his discharge—he has a mark on his left-hand.</p>

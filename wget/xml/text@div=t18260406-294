On Saturday last I had two live ducks, which slept under the stairs at night, and they run out in the morning - I saw them safe at half-past six o'clock in the morning; I received information, and about one o'clock in the day I saw the prisoners eating some pastry, and supposed they had sold the ducks, and got the money to buy it; I asked George Clarke about them, and he said he had not seen them - he was a neighbour; I looked into his basket, and saw the dung of the duck - he had seen me before I came up to him, and told James Clarke to run away; James afterwards told me he had sold them to a Mr. Clarke, in Montague-street; I went there and got them - I know them to be mine.</p>

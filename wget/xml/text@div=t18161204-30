            . My partner resides in the house in which the business is carried on, I occasionally live there. Our private cash is kept in a box, a key of which Mr. Hewitt, and myself, only have. The box was deposited in an iron-safe, and the key kept in a drower in the office, which was not locked; I know the prisoner, he had lived servant to Mr. Hewitt, who keeps the house; he was also employed as porter to the office. He was acquainted with the office, and knew of the safe as well as I did myself. The box contained one 50l. note and one 20l. note(which he had received from Mr. Stone, whose name he wrote on the side), a 30l., a 10l., a 5l., and two 2l. notes, and some silver; there were also one bill for 50l. and another for 27l. with a variety of other things. I am the cashier, I put them in the box about twelve o'clock; I was out from twelve until near four; I shortly after left the office for the day.</p>

            . I am the partner of the last witness. The prisoner lived with me about three or four years, as a house-servant and porter. I saw the cash-box on the 19th of November, in the morning. I locked the safe about four o'clock-the box was there then. The prisoner left me the beginning of July last; he had been at the office several times between that time and the 19th of November. I had paid Mr. Bourdillion two notes, on the same morning which I received them from Mr. Stone. The prisoner had been to my office sometime before, to consult about some property which he thought was coming to him from his family.</p>

            . I live with Messrs. Bourdillion and Hewitt; I know the prisoner, he left their service about June; since that time he has been to the office two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him what he was doing after he had left - 
               <persName id="t18161204-30-person278">A. </persName>
            He did not state to me what he was doing. In consequence of what I had heard. I applied to him for two orders for the boxes, as I heard he belonged to the Play.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to the office on the 19th of November-A. Yes; at a quarter before nine in the evening. The office in which I write leads into Mr. Bourdillion's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon his coming in, what did he say - A. One of the clerks asked him if he wanted to see Mr. Hewitt? He said, is he at home? I said, John, do you remember you promised me some tickets; he went backwards into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040018"></xptr>yard; I was standing in the passage, and he said, go into the office, and I will bring them to you. He then came in, pulled out his pocket-book, and said, he would write me one. I said, I thought that would not do; he said, he had got a friend just by, and he would go and get me two. He said, he had got a pain in his stomach, and went into the yard again, he did not take a light at that time. He returned again through Mr. Bourdillion's office, asked for a light, and said, he must go again. He went again, through Mr. Bourdillion's room, and returned, pretending to be buttoning-up his cloaths, said, he must go again; he went again, banging Mr. Bourdillion's door after him. This rather excited my suspicion. I rested a little while, then went to the clerk's desk and listened, but heard nothing. Presently I heard the glass-door bang and some person go out. The prisoner did not return through the office as usual. He went out to the privy four times in all. He returned about ten minutes after nine; he put his head in at the door, and said, I have not got the tickets, I am coming here to-morrow morning to Mr. Hewitt. After he had quite gone away, I took my light, thinking that he might have taken some papers. I went to look into Mr. Bourdillion's closet, and I saw the iron-safe half open, and the cash-box gone. I had not been into the room before to see if the safe was open or not. The prisoner did not come the next morning.</p>
               <p>ANN IRELAND. I first became acquainted with the prisoner about six months ago; I then resided with my father at Case-Orton, I afterwards came to London with the prisoner, on a Monday, it was near a fortnight before this circumstance took place; we first lodged with Mrs. Baines, in Shepherd's-market; the prisoner said, he was a player at Drury-lane. While we were with Mrs. Baines we wanted money, we had only a few shillings. Mrs. Baines applied to the prisoner to pay his rent; she kept a public-house; we had no money to pay her.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect Tuesday, the 19th of November-A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18161204-30-person279">Q. </persName>
            Did the prisoner say any thing to you about going out with him-A. Yes: after tea, it was after seven o'clock. I went out with him, he said, he was going to see two or three friends, mentioning Mr. Hewitt's name; he left me at a public-house. I do not know what direction we took when we came out of Shepherd's-market; I have no acquaintance with town. When we were in the public-house he called for a pint of ale, and left me there; he came back again in about half an hour.</p>

                  <persName id="t18161204-30-person280">Q. </persName>
            When he came back did he bring any thing with him - A. Yes; he brought something tied in a handkerchief; we left the public-house shortly afterwards; as we were going home, I asked him what he had got; he said, a box. When we got home he undid the handkerchief, and I saw a tin box (a box produced); it was not so big as that (another produced), it was about the size of that; he opened it with a knife; he opened the lid of it at the hinges. I saw him take bank notes out of it; as well as I can tell there was a 50l., a 30l., a 20l., a 10l., a 5l., a 1l, and some silver; there were other papers; he made me get a candle and they were burned. I asked him where he got them; he said at Mr. Hewitt's. After he had opened the box he took me out; he left me at Mrs. Barne's; he returned and told me that he had thrown the box into some water; he paid Mrs. Barnes her bill with a 5l. note; this was on Tuesday; he remained at home the next morning; he was in the public house all the afternoon, and in the evening he went out of town, to my father's; he said he would go and fetch my clothes; he returned on the Thursday morning, my father and my uncle came with him; he came to my room door when I was getting up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he had done with the notes-A. He told me he had hid the notes, in my father's privy, between some boards.</p>

            , Jun. I am the son of James Ireland, Sen. and brother to the last witness. I know the prisoner; I remember his coming down to my father's on the wednesday evening. He spoke to my mother and she went out. He then went down to the privy, which is in the back-yard; it is no great distancefrom the house; he stopped there about ten minutes; he took a light with him; he returned in about ten minutes for another candle, as his own was burnt out. He got another, and went to the privy again, and remained there about ten minutes longer. His stopping there so long excited my attention; I was playing with a dog at the pig-sty, which is about ten yards from the privy. He had got his back turned towards the door, standing up-right in the privy; I could not see what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Harmer coming down - A. Yes; they searched the same privy, in which I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BISHOP. I am an officer of Bow-street. I went with Mr. Harmer, on the 23rd of November, to search the privy; we found the following notes:-one 50l.; one 30l.; one 20l.; and one 10l.; they were between the boards of the seat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Jackson. He is a greeen-grocer, and lives at No. 7, Heatham-place, Dover-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington, Surrey—we keep the house, and have two lodgers—on Tuesday evening, the 9th of February, my husband went out about half-past eight o'clock—he came home between one and two o'clock—I did not sit up for him—I went to bed—I left the side-door open for him without a lock—there is no latch to it—I merely put it too—shortly after I got up stairs the clock struck eleven—the shop was safe when I went to bed—the shop and dwelling-house are all one building—the street-door leads into a passage which leads into the yard—there is a parlour behind the shop, and that room has a window looking into the back yard—a person by going along the passage, which I left open, could get to the back window—when I went to bed that window was shut down, but not fastened—there is no fastening to it—there is a shutter, but we never shut it—I am sure the window was quite shut down when I went to bed—I locked the parlour door when I went to bed, and took the key up stairs with me—I had left the cash-box on the side-board in the back room—it had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—there was one sovereign, one half-crown, and the rest in shillings and sixpences, except 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was in copper—I had counted it before I went to bed—I was called by the policeman between one and two o'clock in the morning—there is a door from the passage into the yard which the window looks into—I fastened that door with a bolt, but the bolt was on the side which any person coming in from the street, or the people down stairs, could undo it—when I came down, I found that bolt undone, and the door was open, and the window was open wide enough for a man to get in, I should think—I went up stairs for the key of the parlour, and missed the money-box—I know the box—I saw it again at Union Hall the next day—there is a compass on the lid of it—I had locked that box before I went to bed—I know the prisoner—he</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 32.) I was on duty in Heatham-place, Kent-street, on the day in question—about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Jackson's dwelling-house with something bulky under his arm—I followed him with Manning my brother officer—as soon as the prisoner saw he was so closely pursued, he hove down this box from under his arm, down on the ground—Manning picked it up—I went after the prisoner—he run for about ten minutes—I overtook him and took him to the station-house—he was searched, but nothing was found on him—I went back to Mr. Jackson's house—I went in, and found the yard-door open, and the window as far up as it could go—a person might get in there with ease—I called up the family.</p>

I went with the last witness in pursuit of the prisoner—he had passed me with something under his arm, which at the time I thought was a parcel—we followed him some distance—he found we were closing on him—he threw it down on the ground, and at the time I heard some money jingle—I took up the box and found on the spot 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and about 12<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 13<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I examined the box, which he had thrown down, at the station, and found it was broken open—when we came back, I searched the place, and found one farthing by the light of a lantern, and the next morning at day-light, I found another farthing.</p>

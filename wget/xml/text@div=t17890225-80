               <p>I am an officer; coming from Stepney I saw the prisoner and two more by Alderman Shakespeare's Causeway, about fifty yards up the causeway, I saw them come out of Brook-street and run; they were all dressed alike.</p>
               <p>How far is Brook-street from Whitecross-street? - I look upon it where I took the prisoner was about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's house; it was between nine and ten on Friday the 13th of September; I saw them all divide themselves, and the prisoner walked up first, I did not hear them converse together, I was too far off from them, they were all together; as they turned up the street, after one turned up the street, another made a sham to stop; and as the prisoner walked past me, I thought he had something under his coat, and I took hold of him; he said he had been of an errand for his mother, but he could not tell where; I found this bundle just as it is now wrapped up in this apron; the apron was not tied round him; they appeared to me to be all gentlemen's sons at first, I took them to be all brothers, being dressed so genteel; he had the bundle under his great coat, the property was sealed up, and I left it in the prosecutor's possession, that they might not be rumpled; I sealed it, and left it till I went to the magistrate's, then I put my seal on, and gave them to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hurley. I brought it here.</p>
               <p>Forrester. This is the seal I put upon it; (produced and deposed to) he said they were his mother's in the street; I took him to the public-house and tied his hands; the other two flew like lightning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach, Prisoner's Counsel. At the time you found the property, did it appear as if it had been in the dirt? - There is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250105"></xptr>one of them appears to have a little dirt; it was not a dry morning, he told me afterwards that he found them on a dunghill; I do not know there is any reward in this case; Mr. Berry, the clerk of the indictments examined the gentlewoman whether her door was fast; and she said yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Hurley. Did you see the door fast yourself? - Yes, I saw it fastened when I went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Who opened the door in the morning? - The apprentice; I did not see him open it, I came down a little before nine, and went into the shop.</p>
               <p>How did you find the door when you came down a little before nine? - I found the door shut.</p>
               <p>Did you go out at that time? - I went out about five minutes into the kitchen, and I left the door fast, and when I came in again I found the door was open, and I missed the things.</p>
               <p>Did you see the apprentice fasten it? - No; if the door had not been shut, I must have seen it was open.</p>
               <p>It is possible that it might be very near shut? - I am sensible it was shut.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that you observed it so, as to know it was shut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you made this observation upon it, was it before you went down into the kitchen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not try it? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was you in the kitchen? - I imagine it might be five minutes, it might be more, but I do not think it was; when I returned I found the door was wide open, and the things were gone; when I came back it was after nine, nothing was broke.</p>
               <p>Have you any of your servants here, or that apprentice, to speak about the state of the house? - No; I can speak with certainty to all the cloaks to be mine; one of them I took the lace off myself, and some of them have our marks; some is not marked, but I am very sure they are our property; I did not know directly the number I had missed at that time.</p>
               <p>Have you at any time examined your shop? - I thought I missed about eight or nine, but I did not know I had lost ten; I was not sure to the number.</p>
               <p>The things deposed to above the value of 40 s.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

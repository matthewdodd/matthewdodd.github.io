On Friday night, the 19th of December, I put eleven sovereigns in my drawers in my front parlour, where I slept; he slept in the back parlour. On Sunday morning, the 21st, I missed three sovereigns; I found the drawer locked as usual, and had the key in my pocket; I missed another on Tuesday morning. On Christmas-eve the prisoner came into the room - we were having a pint of beer; I asked him to drink. (We always locked the room-door when we went out, and took the key). He paid me for three weeks' lodging which he owed, and for a week forward, which was 10 s., and when he came in at night we quarrelled - my friends threatened to turn him out. He said he should go when he liked, as he had paid his week's lodging. My wife threw down 2 s., and said</p>
               <p>"Take your money." I said we had lost a good deal; he swore he knew nothing about it. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why you took a razor out of my top drawer" - he said that was in his box, but he knew nothing of the sovereigns. On the morning of the 21st, I found a pair of men's gloves behind my drawers, I immediately called him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Webb, these belong to you, I believe" - he said, no, they did not. I have since given them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I alone in your room on Tuesday morning - A. I cannot say; he always breakfasted with us.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On Saturday evening I left my little girl alone in bed in the room for twenty minutes, about nine o'clock (she is five years old), and when I returned the prisoner pushed by me in the passage. (I had the key in my pocket, and the door was locked;) he came either from my room or his own. I found the door still locked; I said,</p>
               <p>"Is that Mr. Webb?" he made no answer, and did not come home till late that night. I saw my husband find the gloves next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been into your room that morning before they were found - A. Yes, my Lord; he just came in before breakfast, and before the gloves were found, but did not stop a minute.</p>

            . I lodge with Archer, in the same room with the prisoner, and left on the Sunday before Christmas. I saw the prisoner put these gloves on once, and know them to be his.</p>
               <p>CHARLES STAPLES. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Christmas-day; he gave me his key; I found a razor in his box; he said he had frequently shaved the prosecutor with it, and thought it no harm to have it in his box. Archer said he had shaved him with it. I found nothing else. I charged him with stealing sovereigns, which he denied, and said he had received some sovereigns, and two of them were in the hands of Mr. Branch, a baker; that he had just received a legacy of 8 l. 18 s. from somebody in Broad-street, who he named, and put two sovereigns into Branch's hands. He produced two letters from the country, with the post-mark upon them, which stated that he was to receive a legacy; he said he never had any gloves, and never wore any - I produce a pair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer; both the prisoners were in my employ. On 1st May, I gave them orders to go on the following day to Harmondsworth with two loads of straw—they were to go with two loads of straw—they were to go with two horses—I allowed them half a truss of hay for each horse—on 2nd May, about three o'clock in the morning, I was called up by the police-sergeant—I went to the station at Stan well, where I found some hay—I saw it weighed—it was 147 lbs. over and above what was allowed for the horses—it was the same sort of hay as mine—Collins had been in my service about half a year, and the boy Haddock, perhaps, two years—this is the first thing I heard against him.</p>

On 2nd May, about one o'clock in the morning, I saw Haddock in the village of Stanmore, going towards Mr. Parrott'a farm-yard—he had one horse—he went with it to the rick-yard, and brought out two loads of straw on one cart—he took it to the farm-yard gate, and I saw Haddock come out with another horse which he put to the same cart'—he got on the cart, and Collins went into the yard and, brought out three bundles of hay at three different times—he gave it up to. Haddock, who placed it on the cart—they then shut the farm-yard gates and. went off—Collins was on the top, and Haddock drove—I met my sergeant and told him, and we went and stopped the prisoners—we took the hay that was on the top of the cart to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-serjeant, T</hi> 26). Between two and three o'clock that morning, in consequence of what the last witness said to me, I stopped Mr. Parrott's team—the cart was loaded with two loads of straw—I got on the top and saw Collins coveting himself over—I found four bundles of hay on the top—I took it to the itation, and there was 147lbs. over the weight that his master allowed him to take—some of the hay is here, and Mr. Parrott has seen it.</p>

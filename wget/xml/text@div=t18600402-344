B. Seymour"—it is often paid in that way, but some might object to it—I gave the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he endorsed the bill—I do not know whether he endorsed it then, or whether he wrote his name on a piece of paper so that I might see it was his right signature—the first time he brought the bill it was not endorsed by him; it purported to be endorsed by Mr. Read the first time—I asked the prisoner the first day how he got the bill, and he said he got it from a man who bought a watch of him for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and he gave him the balance of the money out—he said it was a man of the name of Read—he could not describe to me how he looked—he said it was the man who had endorsed his name—I am sure he said that it was the man who bought the watch of him that endorsed the bill.</p>

               <p>many—there were different samples—as much as a country dealer generally has—I have seen the prisoner write sometimes—the writing on this bill "For me, to A. R. Seymour, Richard J. H Read" is his—I have no doubt of it—these three letters are also his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer in the City-police—on 24th February last I went to the prisoner's house at Beaumaris—he had a little parlour, or shop you may term it—they lived in the same room—there were about six watches there; they appeared to me to be there for repair, and two new clocks—the prisoner was not in when I went—I sent for him, and he came—I told him I had come down from London from the bankers, to make inquiries about these letters—he said, "Yes, I know"—I said, "Who was it that you had this transaction with?"—he said, "A respectable sea<lb></lb>faring man, dressed like the mate of a ship"—I said, "What did you sell him?"—he said, "A gold watch and chain for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I made a clear 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by, and I also gave him 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money"—I said, "In what way"—he said, "In gold"—I said, "You must be a very foolish man, I think, to sell your things in this way to a person you never saw before nor since"—he then said he thought it was a bank note at that time—I don't think he said "at first"—I was examined before the Magistrate—perhaps he did say he thought at first it was a bank note, I could not positively say—I said, "Do you keep any books?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Will you shew me the entry"—he said, "Yes," and he showed me this book—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) he said, "There, that is the entry of the transaction"—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:) "31st Oc<lb></lb>tober, gold patent lever watch and chain, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Read—foreign note of exchange, No. 2710 2710 2710"—I can scarcely read it, it is not in very good English—I read the entry and saw that the No. 2710 was repeated three times, and I asked him what those numbers were—he said, "The number of the three bills"—I said, "Just now you told me you thought it was a Bank of England note"—he said, "Yes, but I have since ascertained they were bills of exchange"—I then asked him if he was not at Liverpool on 5th November—he said yes, he was, and he went to Mr. Rees, of No. 12, Lord-street—I said, "And did he discount this bill for you?"—he said, "He let me have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance, aud stopped 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his trouble"—I then took the bill out of my pocket, and asked him if that was the bill—he said, "Yes; that is the bill"—I said, "Now, if there is any writing of yours on the back of this bill, show me which it is"—he pointed to the back of the bill, and said, "I wrote that," the three words "Augustus Robert Seymour"—he said, "Mr. Rees wrote the other," meaning Mr. Rees' own name at the back—I then asked him who wrote the first endorsement there, and pointed to it—he said, "The man who I had the transaction with; he wrote it on the bench, with my pen and ink"—I asked him who was present—he said only the man and himself—I had asked him before who the man was, and he said a man that he had never seen before or since—I took possession of the book with the entry in it—he said, "Don't take my book away, tear the page out"—I said, "No, I must take the book"—I then left—afterwards, on 17th March, I took the prisoner into custody; he would not go, and made a desperate struggle—I was obliged to get the assistance of another officer</p>

                  </hi>. I am the solicitor conducting this prosecution—I have examined the book produced—it is partly in German and partly in English—it purports to contain the prisoner's receipts and payments for several months prior to 31st October—it begins on 25th August—a great part is in pencil and rubbed out—he has balanced the book on the day before 31st October—it appears that up to that day, he had received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. so that there was a balance of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his favour on that day—he enters his receipts and payments regularly on each of the book, and he has made a casting on Sunday, 30th October, which shows that to be the state of the account—the receipts are for things in his trade, "a clock, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>" "an accordian," and so on; and the other side are his expenses for lodging and living—there is no casting after 30th October—the entries go on to 5th November—the time of his going to Liverpool.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he received the bill in question on 31st October, from a person from thirty-four to thirty-six years of age, dressed like a first mate of a ship, of very prepossessing manners, in pay<lb></lb>ment of a gold watch and chain which he sold him for</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">that he asked him to endorse the bill, which he did, left the shop, and he had never seen him since. The prisoner also entered at some length into the nature of his transaction with Mr. Rees, who discounted the bill: and as to the evidence of his handwriting, he asserted it was given by witnesses who entertained feelings of animosity against him.</hi>

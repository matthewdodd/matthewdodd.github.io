I am the wife of Thomas Allen, of 23, Stanley-terrace, Stanley-road, Brompton—the prisoner, and Munns, the deceased, had been lodging at my house as man and wife for about a fortnight before this, by the name of Mr. and Mrs. waters—on Wednesday morning, 9th July, the prisoner asked me to go with her to the warehouse in Great Dover-road, to see for her husband, who, she said, had not been home all night,</p>

I fear I have done for you"—that was a moment or so after she struck the blow—she seemed very much excited after the beer was thrown in her face, and screamed very much both before and after she had struck him—I got up to pass, and Munns said, "Don't go, Mrs. Allen, stay"—afterwards he walked out gently into the warehouse where I heard him fall, and make a groan—the prisoner followed him crying all the time, and I then beard her say, "Oh! my dear <hi rend="italic">Jem,</hi> I think you are dying "—she requested me to go for a doctor, and I went for one as quick as I could—the doctor came—when the man threw the beer in the prisoner's face, he said, "Go to hell"—that was when she was going for the steak—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife she took up—it was lying on the table close by.</p>

Q.</hi> After the beer was thrown, and before the blow, did she not seem in a very great state of excitement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she was excited because he would not say where he had been—she seemed extremely excited after the beer was thrown, and the offensive expression used—the prisoner had only been lodging in our house a fortnight, and during that time she had shown herself extremely kind and affectionate, and seemed warmly attached to him—I thought they were very fond of each other—I never heard, until at Dover street, that they were shortly to be married—I did not know but what they were man and wife—after she said, "Why did you provoke me so?" she seemed very much affected, so that we could hardly keep her up—she showed all the anxious solicitude and affection that an affectionate wife could to her husband.</p>

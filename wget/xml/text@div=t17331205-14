            . Going home from Leaden-Hall, about 12 at Night, the Prisoner met me in <placeName id="t17331205-14-crimeloc69">Goodman's-Fields</placeName>

Thieves! and Help, for the Lord's sake! Mr. Matthews came to my Assistance, and took him. I said, Thank you kindly, Sir, you have saved my Life, and my Money too. I did not know then, that my Money was lost, for I had wrapt it in a Paper, and put it in my Bosom to another Paper that had Tea-dust in it, and while the Prisoner struggl'd with me, I took one of the Paper; out of my Bosom, and thought, in the Fright I was in, that it had been my Money; but when I was a little recover'd, I found my Mistake, for it was the Paper of Tea-dust.</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. I keep a Coffee-house, in Goodman's-Fields. About twelve at Night, as I was shutting my Door, I heard a sad cry of Murder, and Thieves. I run down an Alley near at Hand, but found no Body there, and all was silent for two or three Minutes; but turning the Corner of that Alley, I heard the Shrieking again. The Sound led me to another Alley, where I found the Woman lying upon the Ground, with her Arms extended, and the Prisoner endeavouring to get her Hands open. They were not in any unseemly Posture, I secur'd the Man, and call'd the Watch. The Woman said, God bless you, Sir, you have sav'd my Life, and my Money too. I ask'd her where her Money was? She said, in her Hand. But presently finding her Mistake , O Lord! says she, this is my Paper of Tea-dust !</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I desire to be search'd when I was in the Watch-house?</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. Yes; but I thought it would then be in vain, because in his Way thither he had opportunity enough to make away with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She had another with her before I came near.</p>
               <p>Matthews. Man but the Prisoner</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I heard her cry out in a bar barous Manner, and meeting a Man in the Alley, I ask'd, what was the Matter ? He said, No harm; and so he went away, and I went to her, and she gave me her Hand to help her up, for she was very drunk, and then Mr. Matthews came and took him.</p>
               <p>Matthews. The Woman a in a great Surprize, but I did not perceive she was drunk.</p>
               <p>The Jury found him guilty to the We of 10 d.</p>
               <p>The Court (before the Verdict was Recorded ) inform'd them, that in a Robbery, the Value was not material, and therefore they had nothing to consider, but whether the Prisoner robb'd the Woman or not.</p>
               <p>The Jury said, they believed he robb'd her of some Money; but were doubtful of how much.</p>
               <p>The Court again, told them, they were not to regard the Sum, but if upon the Evidence given, it appear'd to them, that he robb'd her, they ought to find him Guilty, or otherwise to Acquit him.</p>
               <p>Then the Jury <rs id="t17331205-14-verdict70" type="verdictDescription">
                     <interp inst="t17331205-14-verdict70" type="verdictCategory" value="notGuilty"></interp>
               acquitted
            </rs> him.</p>

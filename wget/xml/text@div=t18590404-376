                  </hi>. I am an engineer—on 3d March I was in Aldgate about 5 o'clock—the prisoner came to me and asked me to give him small change for half-a-crown—I said he had better go in a small shop and get the change there—he replied he had been in several small shops, and they refused to give it him without he bought something—I said I would, and I took out my purse to give him small change for half-a-crown—he snatched my purse out of my hand and went away between a run and a sharp walk—I followed him in hopes to meet an officer—he got as far as Aldgate Church, and there handed the purse over to a woman, and said, "Take care of that for me"—I said to the woman "That is mine"—she said she did not know whether it was or not—the prisoner was there at the time—the woman then handed the purse to another man, and I went back after the prisoner—he went across the road—I never lost sight of him till he was apprehended at the corner of the Minories—I called out, "Stop thief," and he was taken—he was in a fit in the station or pretended to be, and threw himself down on the ground—my purse contained 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have never seen it since—he made a grasp at my watch and broke the guard, but I put up my hand and saved my watch.</p>

I am assistant to a draper—on that evening I saw the prisoner put his hand to a gentleman's pocket, and take something out which I thought was a pocket-book, but it turned out to be a handkerchief or scarf—the prisoner went on, and I went after him, and took him—he bit me on the aim and on the shoulder—we struggled, and he got away, and was taken by a policeman—I saw him in two or three minutes, when he</p>

I lost a tea-chest, three silver spoons, five small pieces of money, some halfpence, some tea in a cannister, and a tea-board, and the other things mentioned in the indictment. The prisoner worked with me as a carpenter: I had not seen him since he left me, which was last Michaelmas; the pawnbroker stopt the things and advertised them: my wife and I went and found them to be our property. I took the prisoner up; and, before the justices at White-chapel, he owned he took all these things.</p>

            . I live in Rosemary-lane. The prisoner brought a tea-chest, tea-board, and two cardinals: I asked him how he came by them? he said, he kept a girl in the town, and they were her property, and he took them from her. I found something rattle in the tea-box; and, after he was gone, I borrowed a key, and found three silver tea-spoons, and some pieces of money in it; then I advertised it. He came back in the evening, and said, I had given him 6 s. 9 d. instead of half a guinea; then I stopped him, and took him up.</p>

               <p>I am not guilty: I bought these things of a strange person in the street: I took them to Mr. Clark's to make a penny of them if I could: he is a salesman: he gave me 19 s. for them. I have no friend in the world. I did belong to the first regiment of guards, and was abroad in Germany in the second battalion.</p>

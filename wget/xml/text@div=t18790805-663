                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 1, Furnival's Inn; I and my wife are interested in the premises of 17, Upper Montague Street—the late Mrs. Elizabeth Whitfield Alexander was the tenant under a lease from 1873 up to September 1878—she bought the lease about that time and remained so; the old lease was surrendered, and the lease of September 27th, 1878, was granted by me and my wife, and Mrs. Alexander signed a counterpart, I have it here—I delivered the lease personally to her—it was a lease for 17 years to Michaelmas, 1895, at a rent of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—at the Christmas quarter 1878 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due for rent; that was brought into my office in my absence—on 13th January I received this letter from the prisoner. "Sir,—Please send receipt to me as executor of the late Mrs. Alexander, and ask Mr. Sampson to pay enclosed, and make allowance. Mrs. Alex<lb></lb>ander on 14th November assigned to me by deed of assignment the lease of this house to save further trouble of rent, so I must pay you in future." On 17th January some correspondence occurred with regard to the fire insurance not being made by Mrs. Alexander according to covenant—on 20th January, 1873, I received this letter from him: "Mrs. Alexander being in want of money, executed to me the assignment for valuable consideration; the money was borrowed and secured by a bill of sale on the furniture, and was raised for the repairs of the house; it is being rapidly cleared off by me. I am willing to surrender the lease upon your granting a new one." I wrote to him on the 23rd January requesting him to furnish me with a verbatim copy of the assignment by Mrs. Alexander to him, and to produce the original for inspection; in answer to that I received this letter of the 24th: "The verbatim copy of the assignment will be in your hands on Monday, and I hope the original." I afterwards received this copy of the assignment, it was left at my chambers by some one; I don't know by whom. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Taylor</hi>: "This copy was made in my establishment, for Mr. Kershaw, a solicitor in Gray's Inn.") This letter of 8th February I received from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that a copy of the assignment had been duly sent, and as soon as he could put his hand on the original he would send it; it also stated that the Sheriff had put a man in possession, and proposed, as suggested by Mr. Furber his solicitor, that the prisoner should lodge with the witness the Christmas rent which he had received, and put a man in possession to oust the Sheriff.</hi>) I replied to that letter on 10th February, expressing my sur<lb></lb>prise that such a dishonest and unprofessional proposition should come from a barrister or solicitor, and that I should consider whether it was not my duty to bring it before the Incorporated Law Society—I received this reply of 11th February. (<hi rend="italic">This denied the imputation of anything dishonourable in the proposition, and explained that Mr. Furber's suggestion was merely made in a jocular conversation.</hi>) Since the prisoner's committal I have had to pay 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for repairing the house; the prisoner may have done some re<lb></lb>pairs, but they must have been very trifling—the last letters were his on 10th and mine on 11th March—in all the letters he refers to an assignment of 23rd October—I first saw the alleged forged assignment of 3rd December at the Clerkenwell Police-court, when I attended as a witness, after he had been tried at the Middlesex Sessions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not present at that trial, I was present when he was brought up for judgment—I heard Mr. Barker give evidence as to the prisoner's position—something was said about his being interested in a sum of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he had recently received a legacy of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from his sister-in-law—I have known the prisoner about two years—I do not know what the relations were between him and Mrs. Alexander—he did not call on me in her company, except when she signed the new lease—he wrote and asked me to grant a renewal of the lease—I offered a renewal of it to him or Mrs. Alexander; he did not to my knowledge pay the rent of the house during Mrs. Alexander's lifetime—I did not enter into negotiation with him as to his paying the rent—I will explain how it arose: when the proposed surrender of the old lease was made I told him and Mrs. Alexander that as to the rent due at Michaelmas, I had no power to distrain under the new lease, and therefore, as I had no desire to be paid beforehand, he and she must sign a promissory note for thai quarter's rent—I believed that the prisoner was the assignee of this lease after Mrs. Alexander's death—he wrote and told me so; I had no other reason for believing it—I do not not know Mr. Benham, I have heard of him—in one of the prisoner's letters he gives the name of Mr. Benham, as one of the witnesses to the assignment—I received that letter after Mrs. Alexander's death—I never saw the mutilated assignment, exeept at the Clerkenwell Police-court; I never heard a word about it till after Mrs. Alexander's death—I sent a clerk to Mr. Benham after receiving the draft assignment—I have never seen Mr. Benham—I believe he is a solicitor of Furnival's Inn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I received a letter on 11th September from the prisoner, asking me to renew the lease to him or Mrs. Alexander for 7, 14, or 21 years—that was the only way in which his name was proposed; in 1878 the lease had about four years to run—it was afterwards arranged with Mrs. Alexander that the new lease was to be in her name, and not in his; and it was so executed—I wrote this letter to him on 25th September, enclosing draft surrender of the old lease for perusal and approval, and on that he and Mrs. Alexander became jointly liable for a quarter's rent—the property referred to by Mr. Barker was his wife's trust money, and was nearly entirely encumbered.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). Among the documects impounded I produce the letters of administration to the estate and effects of Mrs. Alexander, dated 20th February, 1879, in favour of Mr. William Richard Furber—I also produce the mutilated deed, that was one of the documents impounded. (<hi rend="italic">This was in the name of Henry Bulwer Lytton.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard Mr. Kershaw called before the Magistrate—he is here, sitting beneath you—I was present at the Middlesex Sessions during part of the trial, it lasted two days—I don't think I heard a Mr. Benham examined as a witness—I believe he was examined, I can't say for certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the prisoner was acquitted the trial was for pledging the deceased's goods—I believe the defence was that the goods were covered by the bill of sale, and the general relations between the prisoner and Mrs. Alexander.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, at No. 34, Lower-marsh, Lambeth; I manage the business for my mother. On Friday, 15th June last, the prisoner came a little after 10 o'clock at night and called for a pint of porter, I served him, he drank some of it and then tendered a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and asked me to change it—I held it up to the light, and looked at it—I said, I did not like the appearance of it—I asked him who it was for—he said, "It is all right, it is for Mr. Barnard"—I know Mr. Barnard, he is a rag merchant in Gibson-street, and I knew the prisoner as bis servant—upon that I gave him change for the note, and wrote on it the name of Mr. Barnard, No. 5, Oakley-street, and my initials—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I fancied at the time that Mr. Barnard lived in Oakley-street, Gibson-street runs into Oakley-street—I gave the prisoner four sove<lb></lb>reigns 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—he finished his porter, and went away—I put the note in my cash box—on Tuesday, 19th June, I paid it away to Mr. Fox—he returned it to me on the 22nd marked forged, and I gave him five sovereigns for it—I know Mr. Booth, a fishmonger, who lives opposite me—the prisoner was employed by him, as well as by Mr. Bar<lb></lb>nard—I went over to Mr. Booth to see if the prisoner was there, and then went up to my mother's house in the Westminster-bridge-road to tell her about it—I did not tell Mr. Booth where I was going to—about a quarter of an hour after, the prisoner came to my mother's house, it was a little after 1 o'clock in the day—he said to me, "How about this note?"—I said, "Who told you about the note?"—he said, "Mr. Booth told me"—I said, "I told Mr. Booth not to say anything at all about it to you"—he said, he had it from his brother—he said that voluntarily, without any question from me—he said if I would not prosecute, he would pay it back at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I said, I could not make any promise—he then went away—some time after I went with my mother to Mr. Booth's house, where I expected to find the prisoner—he was not there—they sent for him—I went over to my house, and shortly after Mr. Booth came to me with Draper the policeman, and the prisoner—they went into the parlour with me, and there the prisoner again said, "I will pay it back at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, if my master will be surety for me?"—Mr. Booth did not agree to that, nor did I, and he was handed over to the police.</p>

               <p>the prisoner and said, "<hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>. you went to Griffiths for change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I shall not think of employing you any more unless you tell me where you got it from"—at first he hesitated, and said it came from a friend of his, but at last he said that his brother gave it him—he said he did not know how his brother came by it—I had always heard that his brother was a very bad character, and I told him it was very foolish of him to have anything to do with him—he said his brother made him do it, and threatened he would stick a knife into him, or something to that effect, if he did not get it changed, and he said his brother had called him a—b fool for not saying it was mine at Griffiths's, then they would have changed it for him.</p>

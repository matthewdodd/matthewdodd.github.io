               <p>JAMES MONKS. I am a bricklayer. I was at work in a passage near <placeName id="t18290409-307-crimeloc1740">Red Lion-market</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not intoxicated? A. She was rather tipsy - this was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

Monks called me - I found the prisoner; I asked what she had got; she said, "Nothing of ours;" I said, "Let me look under your cloak," and found this kettle and flat-iron; the kettle had been taken from under the dresser in the front-kitchen, and the iron from the mantel-piece.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

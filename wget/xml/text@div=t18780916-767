I live at the Old Ship Tavern, Chichester Rents—on August 10, about 6.30, I served the prisoner with a pint of stout—he ten<lb></lb>dered a florin—I took it to my sister in the next bar; the prisoner could see me and hear what I said—she said it was bad, and another man who was in the bar ran away—the prisoner ran directly afterwards without waiting for his change—I made a communication to Mr. Duff, who went out, and shortly afterwards the prisoner was brought back by two constables—I charged him and gave the florin to the constable—one of the constables, Badger, was in plain clothes, and I mistook him for a moment for the prisoner's accomplice, being rather confused.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>. "I was drinking with a man very like Badger. I was with him in Holborn, and we got talking. I was rather the worse for liquor. We went to the Old Ship, and he said, 'Call for a pint of stout and mild, I'll pay for it' I said, 'No, I have some coppers, I'll pay for it.' He said 'Never mind.' He took out a florin, put it on the counter, and said, 'Pay for it,' putting it to me, and he asked me to call for a cigar. While I asked for it he ran out. The barmaid said the coin was bad, and I said 'I'll fetch him back.' I ran to fetch him back, and believe I ran in the same direction as him. I saw a man turn up a street, but when I saw he was not there I stopped, intending to go back to the public-house. When Mr. Duff came up, he said, 'I must take you back to the public-house. I said,' There's no need, I'm going there. 'Badger then came back, and they took me to the public-house. The barmaid then said,' He is an accomplice, I shall accuse him as well, 'meaning Badger. Some one behind said' Yes, he was in here, drinking with him.' Badger wanted to search me; I objected, as the barmaid said he was an accomplice, and as I believed he was the man who was with me, and do now believe he was the man. Badger took some money out of my pocket in the house, and at the station he searched me, and I gave him a correct name and address, and where I worked."<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner produced a written defence, repeating the above statement, and maintaining that Badger was the man who drank with him, and passed the florin to him</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">

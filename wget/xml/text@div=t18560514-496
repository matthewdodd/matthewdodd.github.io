I am the daughter of Mrs. Eagle, who is a cow keeper, at Hackney—Crampton was her foreman—his duty was to receive grains, and tread them in—I paid the money to Neale—sometimes Crampton came and sometimes Neale, and said that the grains were come—they were paid for one week under the other—on 14th March three quarters were charged to me by a written memorandum, which was brought to me by Neale—I paid on 19th for those delivered on 14th—he ought to have brought the memorandum from Mr. Strong—I took it from Neale, and paid him the money—this is it, "3 quarters of grains, draw from Mr. Strong, 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—Crampton was in the yard at the time they were delivered—I asked him bow many grains there were—he said, "Three quarters"—I thought there were not so many—I said there was a very short three quarters, and I asked him how many the cart would hold—he said six quarters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Three Colts, in Grove-street, Hackney, close by Mrs. Eagle's. I saw Mr. Strong's cart on 19th March, and Neale with it—he asked me if I had seen Crampton—I said, "Yes"—he told me to tell him he wanted to see him—I went and delivered the message to Crampton—he said he could not come down, he had better see the old lady—he gave me this ticket to give to Neale—I gave it to Neale—the cart was at that time at the public house with grains in it—after I gave Neale the ticket, he took the cart down to the yard, and delivered the grains—after that Neale came back with the cart which had some grains in it, and he told me to take a pot of beer round to Crampton, which I did—I did not take it the usual way, but another way, a back way, because of Mr. O'Brien—Crampton told me that when his gave me the ticket—that was on the 19th, the time before the last that the cart came—I saw Neale with the cart, and he and Crampton came into the tap room after the grains had been delivered—that was four or five days before the 19th—they used to settle for the beer: they had—sometimes it would, be St.;, Neale paid for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and reside in Amherst Road, Hackney. I have a place of business in the city. On 2nd Feb., I was re<lb></lb>turning from my place of business to the neighbourhood of my own residence—it was about half-past 7 o'clock—there were lamps lighted, and it was a very light night in consequence of the great fall of snow—Amherst Road is a very wide road, and winds round with a gradual curve—I saw the prisoner coming—I should say I saw him 150 yards off—I was near a turn when the prisoner came parallel with me—he was on the same footpath with me, and within a yard of me, and he turned and fired a pistol at me, as he was in the act of passing me—I felt my jaw struck, and three of my teeth were knocked out—I had never seen the prisoner before—I put my hand to my face, and the prisoner stood there while I did so—I cried "Police!" and the prisoner ran away, and I pursued him—he did not stop to assist me—he was taken by a policeman very shortly afterwards—I am sure the prisoner turned slightly towards me when he fired—I had not spoken to him—nothing had passed between us—we had not knocked against one another—I do not think any one was by at the time—I cannot say that I saw the pistol—the prisoner never uttered a word—when I found I was shot, I called "Police!" and he ran away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 432). I was on duty in Amherst Road, I heard the discharge of a pistol—I was proceeding in that direction, and met the prisoner running, pursued by Mr. French—I stopped the prisoner, and Mr. French came up and charged him with shooting him—I took the prisoner to the station, and Mr. French came and made the charge—I was about to go back, as Mr. French told me he saw him throw something away, but the prisoner put his hand into his left trousers pocket, took out this pistol, and said, "Here it is; there is nothing thrown away"—I cautioned the prisoner that any thing he might say would be taken down in writing, and might be used in evidence against him—he said he was only trying the pistol—I found</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Medina Villas. On 2nd Feb., a little before 8 o'clock the prosecutor was brought to me—I examined him; he was bleeding profusely from the lower lip and jaw; after washing his face, I found the marks of seventeen shots on the right side of the lower jaw and cheek; some of them had lodged in his face, one or more had perforated his jaw, three teeth had been broken short off in the lower jaw, one shot had separated the gum from the jaw, and had lodged in the opposite side—the shots produced are of the same size as the one I extracted—the wound was a severe one—I saw the marks of powder on the right side of his cheek and nose—they were very much marked with powder—I think the pistol must have been fired off very close to him, still the contents of the pistol were scattered about wide—in all probability the injury had been inflicted by a pistol like this—I did not apprehend that the prosecutor was in danger, he was in very great pain—there was very great loss of blood—if erysipelas comes on it may be dangerous.</p>

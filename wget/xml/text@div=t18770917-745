               <p>Blackfriars—I produce an agreement for the hire of some household furniture—the prisoner signed it; it contains a list of the articles. (<hi rend="italic">This agreement was dated 27th February</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">and was for the hire of some furniture by On prisoner from the prosecutor, at the rate of </hi>15<hi rend="italic">s. a week, payable quarterly the prisoner to have the option of purchasing within</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">months, the prosecutor in default of payment to take possession of the goods</hi>). I have since seen the goods at different pawnbrokers, and identified them—there are seven or eight articles such as looking glasses, and lamps, and other things—I know nothing about a bill of sale on them.</p>

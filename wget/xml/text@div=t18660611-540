                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Angle, 1, Tyndale place, Islington, hackney-cab proprietor—on 26th May, at twenty-five minutes to 11—I left my cab on the stand near St. Clement's Church, to go and get some refreshment—I was away about five minutes—when I came it was gone—it was No. 10784—I then got on another cab with the coach-man, and went and told my master—I then came back with Inchley the under-foreman in a chaise-cart, and went about to look for my cab—about a quarter past 12 in the morning, I saw my cab coming down Fleet-street towards St. Paul's—the prisoner was driving, and there was a lady and gentleman inside—we turned round and followed the cab—he went up Ludgate-hill—Hinchley got out of the cart as I was driving along, and went and stopped the horse, and I saw the prisoner get down off the cab and run—Hinchley ran after him, and stopped him—I gave him into custody, and charged him with stealing the cab and horse—he did not say anything at the time—when he was taken to the station, he said he did not take it; it was the man inside who was the driver of it; he was inside with a woman—I don't know what became of the man and woman—I can't say that I had seen the prisoner before.</p>

I am a cabman—about half-past 11 on Saturday evening, 26th May, I was with my cab on the stand by St. Clement's church—I saw the last witness and two others go and have a glass of something to drink at the George and Dragon—the prisoner was standing smoking a pipe at the corner—he makes across the road to the horse's head and leans on the shaft, and faces me—directly I turned my back to my own horse, the cab was gone—the last witness came out of the public-house, and said, "Where is my cab?"—I said, "There it is, through Temple-bar, with the man with a light coat on"—I am sure this is the man.</p>

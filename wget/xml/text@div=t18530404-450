                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 269). On 18th March, about a quarter before 12 o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Mitchell's yard with a cart loaded with vegetables, drawn by two horses—there was no one with him; he walked by the side of the horses—I followed him 200 or 800 yards—I stopped him, and asked what he bad got on the copse of the cart—he said, "A little parsley"—I went on the top, and pulled down two sacks; each of them had got some parsley in it—I searched him, and found on him a key—I told him I should lock him up—he said he hoped not—I asked bin what key that was—he said, the key of his corn bin—Bridger, who was with me, took him to the station—I went behind, and carried the parsley—the next morning I went to Mr. Mitchell's—I went with him to the stable, and with the key I had taken from the prisoner I unlocked the corn bin, and under some sacks and rubbish I found these two baskets, containing parsley seed, covered over with empty sacks—the stable was locked with a padlock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a market gardener at South-street, Ponder's-end. For some reason I bad a communication with the police—I think that was on the 18th—on the following day Stevens came to me—I went with him to the stable where the horses are which the prisoner drives—I saw the com bin unlocked—he keeps the key of it—no one has any right there but himself—under some sacks I found these two sieves of parsley seed—the prisoner had no business with it at all—I have compared it with my other parsley seed, it is exactly the same sort—the sieves are mine—the prisoner was not authorised to take any parsley to market—I believe he had been six or seven years in my service.</p>

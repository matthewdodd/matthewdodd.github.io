                  </hi>. I live with my father, John Cocks, in Frederick-place, Stepney. On the 12th of March my parents were out—I went out at seven o'clock that evening, and returned a little after nine—the prisoner was in my father's service—about twenty minutes to twelve that night he came down.</p>

               <p>and said she heard an alarm, and that there were thieves in the house—I was playing at cards, waiting for my father and mother to come home—we went up stairs, and, on a chest near the staircase-window, I saw a bundle—the window was open seven or eight inches—I then went into the chamber, and saw a bundle there—we went up stairs, and found the drawer the money was contained in was locked, the other drawer adjoining it was open—I could not get my key into the lock—I came down again—the policeman was with me—he said the sergeant would be round in an hour—when he came we went up, and he got the escutcheon off the lock, and we got it open—there had been 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the drawer—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank note—I had seen it safe about eleven in the day—they were all gone in the evening, except two sovereigns and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note gone, two sovereigns, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—there did not appear to have been any force used—I found no thieves in the house—some money has been found in the fire by my sister—nothing has been missed but the money.</p>

On Tuesday, the 12th of March, the prisoner asked leave to go out to get some rushlights—there was no person in the house but our own family—my brother was out, and my father and mother dined out—a little before twelve o'clock that night the prisoner came and beckoned me out, and said she heard a noise in my mother's bed-room, as though a chair or a bar from the window had fallen down—I was much alarmed, and went into the parlour to my brother—he went up, and did not discover anything, but when the second policeman came, a gown and other things were missed from a top room—on the Saturday night I emptied the waste-paper out of the candle-box—my sister lighted the fire on Sunday morning, and about twenty minutes after she stirred the fire, that lighted the paper, and the money was discovered—she ran out with the hot money in her hand—I took the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the fire—I discovered four different sorts of paper burning—one was very thin, as if it were the embers of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note.</p>

            . I was the constable that took the prisoner up, by Mr. King's order. I searched the house where she lodg'd in Worcester-street, Old-Gravel-lane; we took her before justice Scott, she would not own any thing there, but afterwards going to the Watch-house, she owned to the taking it. She said she would bring us to the house where she had left it, for a small trifle of money. We went to that house, but could not find the woman of the house; the back door was open, and the print of a woman's feet going out at it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>

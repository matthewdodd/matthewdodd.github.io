            . I am twelve years old. I used to mind the bar in the morning - Stapleton made an application to me - after that the prisoner came to me in the bar, and said he knew all that had passed between me, Stapleton, and other boys; that I had robbed my father, and he would have money as well as the rest - he said he would have 1s. or 1s. 6d., and I gave it him through fear that he should tell my father; I took it from the till - he was near enough to see where I took it from; I saw him several hours after, and he had a good deal more money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long ago is this? A. About Easter twelve months; I had been in the habit of robbing my father for nine months before, and continued to do so for about three months, as near as I can recollect - I have taken above 60l.; a boy named Dean wrote to my father about it, and I then charged Dean with setting me on to steal - my father usually came down between seven and eight o'clock, sometimes later; the boys drank beer, ale, and milk at the house.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.What did you do with the money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080091"></xptr>you took? A. I gave it to the prisoner and the other boys; I think the prisoner might have about 2l. 10s. -Dean received above 15l.; he applied to me to allow him 4l. a week; I refused, and then he wrote to my father - the prisoner asked me for the first shilling about February.</p>

            . I sell milk, and have frequented this public-house for thirty years. I have seen the prisoner there of a morning about seven o'clock - he used the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is he? A. A bricklayer -I believe he went for refreshment; I told Pink that boys were drinking there in the morning, and he ought not to trust his son.</p>

            PINK. The letter came to me the latter end of May - I showed it to my son, and he immediately acknowledged what he had done; he gave me the account he has to-day - he wrote down the particulars to the amount of above 60l.</p>

            . I am now a prisoner in Newgate. I never induced James Pink, by persuasion or other means, to rob his father - I never told the prisoner that he had robbed his father; I had money from Pink to buy him a box of paints, a knife, and two or three seals - I only bought them for him, and had no interest in it; I never had any money to myself - 4s. or 5s. is the utmost I laid out for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see where he got the money from? A. No; it was not in the morning - he gave it me generally in the street; I am seventeen years old.</p>

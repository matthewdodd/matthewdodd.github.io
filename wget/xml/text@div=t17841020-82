             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a bailiff to Mr. Bond, at Hendon; on Sunday the 10th of this month, the last witness came to me for me assistance, saying there were thieves breaking into the great house, I went across the yard, and I heard a very large piece of wall fall on the floor, I looked round and did not see anything; I went up to the house, and I saw this man without his shoes and no stockings, he laid upon his belly between the rasters and the cieling of the room where this woman slept;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200129"></xptr> I took him two or three taps with a fork; he said he did not come with intention to rob the house, that he denied positively; he said the reason of his coming there was to go to the young woman; he broke a hole, and finding he could not get through there, he broke another large hole, big enough for a man to get through; he had worked there before: I took him into custody.</p>

               <p>Court. In what part of the house was he when you found him? - He was over the cieling of the maid's room.</p>
               <p>Is that within the dwelling house, or is it part of the stables; is it a garret? - No, he was between the tiles and the cieling; I never saw that place before, though I have been there nine years.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say to you? - He said he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>The place where you found him was over the cieling of the maid's room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How could he have got through to the maid's room, could he have got through the cieling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Panton. Had you desired this man to come to you? - No, I never spoke twenty words to him in my life.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I worked for Mr. Bond three weeks, and I slept in that same room four nights, and Mr. Bond gave me three shillings; I went to the house and spent eighteen pence, I had some bread and cheese, and the bailiff came up and asked me if I meant to sleep there, and he said he would never let me sleep there no more; so I told him, no Sir, I will not; I went into the barn and pulled off my shoes, and one of the people asked me where I was going to, I told him I was going to ease myself, I would not tell him where I was going to, I was going after this woman, I was very much in liquor; I went to the stable door and it was open, and the room where she slept in was over it, the door was latched, I could not open it, there was a loose board, and I pulled that off; I could not get in at the door, and I went up in the stable loft to the cieling, and I caught hold of the rafters, and it fell in the room; I went away from that, I set myself down upon a truss of hay, in a little while I saw a candle come, and one of my feet hung down from the loft, the man asked me what I was doing there, I told him, I want to come at this woman, and he told me to come down, and I came down; I did not mean to rob the house.</p>
               <p>Court to the Bailiff. Was he drunk or sober? - He was as sober as I am now</p>
               <p>Did the publican say what he had had? - He lost some money out of his purse, he confessed the night he was taken, and some halfpence he owed me, and he had about eighteen or twenty pence in his pocket out of three shillings.</p>
               <p>Then how much do you rocken he had drank? - I do not know, he was drinking with three of his comrades that lay in the barn with him.</p>
               <p>Did you call up his comrades? - No.</p>
               <p>That is pretty extraordinary; did you enquire of them whether they were sober at the public house? - They said that he was fuddled.</p>
               <p>What did you think of his story about the maid? - I asked him if he had any connections with her, he answered he had not; says he, I would not value killing her any more than I would to stick a pig, and if I should get my liberty again won he to her.</p>
               <p>Court. I fancy he was not sober then.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. These articler of furniture are not portable, or objects for a housebreaker? - There are counterpanes and blankets, and pewter and a coopers,and a great number of things; I sleep there in hay-making time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is the character of the woman? - I never heard anything bad of the woman, I had an opinion of her, she was not my hired servant; she worked for me.</p>

            Where was this money lodged? - In the middle of a bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday morning was there any property of any other kind missing? - Yes, a set of china. On that occasion the prisoner advised my wife to go out; we had a woman occasionally came to us, my wife's own sister, and she missed coming that day, and my wife went out to see the reason she did not come, and to enquire about the china; he told me that my wife had better go and see after her sister, perhaps she knew something of the china; I told her she had better go then; and as we had no servant, he said, he would assist me in drawing beer; and I returned him thanks, as I was very poorly. She went a little after two in the day; she came home about five minutes before five.</p>
               <p>Q. What past, when she was away, between you and the prisoner? Did the prisoner assist you as he had promised? - Yes, he did; and he told me he had two friends of his coming to tea, and begged I would make tea for three, and let them have it a quarter after four; and in the mean time he went several times up and down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this when your wife was absent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him afterwards? - He came down again, and sat down with his friend; one of his friends came and the other did not, he was a stranger, whom he had got some clothes to mend for, and they sat and had a pot of beer. In about a quarter before four he told me and his friend that he would go out about a little way, and in about a quarter after four he came back again; he was out about twenty or twenty-five minutes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him then? - In the mean time I got the tea ready for three, then he came home, and came to our house, and they drank tea together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stay at home till your wife came home? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing before he went out? - When they had tea he said to his friend and his wife, (a woman that lived with him as his wife) that he had a little way to go, and he would meet them about the end of Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he was going? - No, not that I could observe.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose wife was that woman? - A woman that visited the prisoner, who went under the denomination of a servant, but was another man's wife. She came and drank tea with him in the time of my wife's absence, in the back parlour, down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his friend ever up stairs with him? - No, neither of them; nobody went up stairs but himself all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he accustomed to stay out at night? - Never, only one night, and he apprised us of it before hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Eight persons in the whole lodge in your house. Were any of them at home at the time you were making tea, or during the time that your wife was gone out? - Only one of the mens wives, Mary Williams; and she was very poorly in her own room, a two pair of stairs back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been up stairs after your wife went and before you sent your wife up for the half guinea? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the persons that lodged with you come home during that time? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the woman was the only one in the house. Did she come down stairs during that time? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the persons that lodged with you come home during the time? - She did not; I did not see her; she did not come down till nine o'clock at night. She was very much indisposed and big with child, and ill.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner at the bar lived with you? - Nearly four months.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been very regular in his being at home of a night except this time that he had apprised you of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, one guinea you should know you say, it had the appearance of being a plugged one; have you ever had a plugged guinea before? - I have seen them before, but I don't know that ever I had one.</p>

            Did the prisoner at the bar say any thing to you on that occasion? - I spoke to my husband first, and then to him; says I, Mullet, I have lost a set of china; and he says, O dear, Mrs. Hallewell, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010114"></xptr>are robbed again, Betty has not been here to day; no, says I, she has not, and sometimes she does not come; (she used to come to assist me because I had no servant) says he, Mrs. Hallewell, if I were you I would go after her, most likely as she has not come she has got the china; and he asked me several times, and asked my husband why I did not go after her. I believe he did not think, at that time, that she was my sister. I said, perhaps after dinner, I will take a walk and ask her when she remembers seeing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go? - I did, about a quarter or half an hour after that at the far theft. Before I went out I went into the bed room to put my hat and cloak on, and my husband gave me half -.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your bed room? - The one pair of stairs forwards.</p>

            Was it usually kept locked? - Always kept locked. I took a wooden box that I kept the money in, and put this half guinea in, and a guinea that I had in my pocket; and I counted the money out, and there were sixteen guineas and a half, with the money that was in the box before. There was one that was an old guinea, as I supposed it to be a plugged guinea, and I made a mark on it to shew it to my husband, I made a mark something resembling a T, to the best of my knowledge, there was a little black spot in the neck of it that appeared to be a plug.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other piece of money remarkable? - A new bright guinea that I thought was a counterfeit from something that I read in the newspaper, I scratched that on the back of the king's head with two or three scratches, and a little scratch on the nose, I think it is a cross; one of these guineas was dated 77 and the other 88.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your husband in health? - He was but middling in health. This Mullet offered to stop and draw a little beer for him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put the money into this little box, what did you do with it? - I put the box into a little well with a door in the bureau, where there were four pounds worth of halfpence in five shilling parcels, and I put two or three five shilling parcels on the top of the box, and locked my bureau, and locked the bed room door, and put the key in my pocket and came down stairs.</p>

            How long did you stay in Mr. Hallewell's house? - From ten o'clock at night till near four in the morning. The prisoner did not come home.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him after that? - About nine o'clock on Tuesday morning, I had been to put the supposed wife into the compter; they had been both to the play together the night before. When we had lodged her in the compter, I got out of the compter gate, and I see the prisoner across the way, and took him; I observed that he wished to put his hand into his right hand waistcoat pocket, he got his hand in, I got my hand on his wrist, and took him in that situation into the compter lodge, and had him booked; I observed that he wanted to make a shift, he seemed to be of a bustle, as if he was going to make a snatch out of his waistcoat pocket; I said, my good fellow, give me leave to search you, he asked me if I wanted to rob him? I told him I wanted to find Mr. Hallewell's property, and I put my hand into his pocket, and out of his right hand waistcoat pocket I pulled this purse out, I immediately put it into my own pocket, and put my hand into his coat pocket, and pulled out sixpence, and three penny worth of halfpence, a knife, and two small keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the purse now the same contents as when you took it? - All the same, except the sixpence and three penny worth of halfpence, which I have put to the sixteen guineas, it had but the sixteen guineas in it when I took it out of his pocket, when I took the watch out of his pocket he made some reply, was he brought there to be robbed. After I had put the man in the compter I went back to Mr. Hallewell's house, and went up to Mr. Hallewell's bed room, and tried this strait warded key, one of the small keys on Mr. Hallewell's bureau; I believe there are five locks, and this key opened every lock, I began at the top and went down to the bottom; I unlocked them and locked them again with the same key, and left them locked. The over night I thought that Mr. Mullet<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010117"></xptr>had I left the key; Mullet's door was locked, I looked about to see if I could find the key, coming down stairs I observed on a ledge, a flat tin candlestick, which I supposed Mr. Mullet had put there, the candlestick was taken up, and this key.(Produced) I found there, I immediately applied that key to Mr. Mullet's room door; I had free access to the room, it opened it, I locked it again, I came down to Mr. Hallewell's room door, Mr. Hallewell and Mrs. Hallewell were with me, we came down together, and I tried Mr. Hallewell's room, I had free admission there with this said key, and according to my judgment I rather suppose it is not as strait as it should be.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any use of the other key? - Yes, to open a trunk in Mr. Mullet's room, with the mark of I. M. on it; the fluted warded key opened that trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any things in that trunk? - Yes, a number of duplicates.(one produced on a waistcoat for five shillings and sixpence, on the first of June.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So, this said key you have had in your custody ever since, and the wards of the key are a little distended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

            Other wise it is a very common key? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you used to see keys? are you in the smith's line at all? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see keys that have been used for a great number of years, distended like that? - Yes, I may.</p>
               <p>Q. That appears to be very little distended, if it is at all. Now with respect to the little key; did you ever see a fluted key before? - Yes, but that was not the key.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to be extremely forward? - Not forward at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place is the key that opened Mr. Hallewell's bureau, a plain warded or fluted one? - It is a strait key, not a fluted warded key.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing uncommon in that plain warded key different from any other plain warded key? - .</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you observe the key before you put it to the lock, whether it was strained or no? - I did not</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Has that key ever been out of your house since you took it from him? - It has not, except under my lock and key.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Hallewell. Pick out the two guineas that were marked? - This is the one that I thought was a plugged one.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take your oath that that is one that you marked, and was in the bureau? - Yes, I will take my oath of it; I put the mark on it to shew it my husband when he came home, whether it was a good one or no, and he said could not I remember a guinea without marking it? and I said if it is a good one it is no harm; and the new guinea I made a mark on it, for fear it should be counterfeit.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

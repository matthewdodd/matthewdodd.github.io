                  </hi>. On Wednesday, the 27th of August, I lived at No. 16, Snow's-fields, In the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey. I saw my house fastened on that night—the back window of the second-floor room, and all the windows were down at usual—I saw them all down, and all the doors fastened—I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock—I had seen every thing fattened not more than five minutes before I went to bed—it was after dark—Mrs. Vining, who lodges wish me, was the last person up—I was the last up except her—I was not disturbed in the night—as soon as I got in my bed-room I wound up my watch, and put it on the table by my bed-side, as I always do—I had one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and a half-crown in my trowsers pocket—I hung my trowsers on a brass nob near the window, with the money in the pocket—I am certain of that—Mrs. Vining did not disturb me in the night—I slept very soundly till between five and six o'clock in the morning—I slept parti<lb></lb>cularly sound that night, which I am not accustomed to do—in the morn<lb></lb>ing, not hearing the clock, I wished to know the time—I got up and went to look for my watch—I missed it—I examined my trowsers, and found my money missing out of the pocket—I was almost paralyzed—I went down stairs, and all was fast—I could not tell how I was robbed—I called out to Mrs. Vining, who lodges in the room below, and said, "I am robbed"—she immediately went up to her daughters and told them—I ob<lb></lb>served the window, which I had seen fast, was open—it is at the back of</p>

               <p>the house, but there is a small passage which leads to my school-room—the window is in my house wall—that was open sufficiently for a person to get in and out—it was light at this time—I found another window open in the lower floor, which leads into my kitchen—that communicates with a passage which leads up to my school-room—that window is also in the wall of the house—I caused the prisoner to be apprehended on the 29th—I think it was Friday—he was examined before a magistrate, and in about a week he was discharged—my watch has since been shown to me by one of the officers—I think Waters—the prisoner had been a pupil of mine about four years ago, and lived in my house for about two years, being a fatherless child.</p>

I lodged in Mr. Lesingham's house on the 27th of August—in the course of that night, I was awoke by my room door opening between one and two o'clock in the morning, and I observed a male figure at the bottom of my bed—the moon was rising—there is no shutter to my window, and only a small curtain—the gas light reflects on the mantel-piece—it was dark all but the moon light and the gas—I could see the figure had trowsers and a jacket on, and no cap or hat—he appeared to go down stairs without any shoes on—his dress was not very light, nor very dark—I had gone to bed after Mr. Lesingham—I was the last person up, and observed that every thing was fast, as usual—I have heard Mr. Les<lb></lb>ingham's evidence as to the state of the two windows in the morning—it is correct—I saw them myself.</p>

On the 29th of August, at half-past five o'clock in the morning, I saw Mr. Lesingham with the prisoner by his side—he gave me a signal to follow him—I followed him to his own house, and took him into custody, and brought him to the station-house—Mr. Lesingham gave him in charge—I searched him, and found a sovereign, wrapped in a piece of paper, in his stocking, which was on his leg, just above his ankle—I took this new silk handkerchief off his neck—it was not hemmed—he had a new pair of shoes on his feet—I only found a halfpenny in his pocket—he said nothing about the sovereign—I asked him as we went to the station-house, if he had any money—he said "No"—I asked him where he got his shoes—he said he bought them—I asked him where he got his shut—it was a new chequed one—he said he bought that in High-street, Borough, and gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I went and found that was correct—he gave no account of the new handkerchief—I did not ask him where he got the shoes—he put the shoes on his feet again—he was taken before a magistrate, and afterwards discharged.</p>

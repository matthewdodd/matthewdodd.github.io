            . I am an officer. I also searched the room, and found a pocket-comb in the prisoners waistcoat pocket; not knowing that any combs had been lost, I put it back into his waistcoat pocket; but in a few minutes hearing some were stolen, I searched him again, and found the same comb again in his fob, under his watch, he made no remark about it.

            . I know these combs. I had cleaned my window on the Monday, and saw them. I know them to be mine, one in particular is marked in a particular spot. I had not another marked like it. I will not speak to the oil, as the cover is off it; it was in bottles like these when I lost it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. All the 3 s. 6 d. bottles are like that - A. Yes, the combs I lost were new. I lost six or eight pocket combs; the one I speak to is made out of the top of the horn, and is a new one; I can tell by the teeth that it has never been used in any head of hair; there is dirt in it, but it is not from the human hair; the dirt from hair would be more at the end of the comb.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took these combs of a man who lives in Charles-street, about a month ago, for a debt of 3 s. 6 d. I had them three weeks before they came to my house; the man is a comb maker. I told the officers where I bought the oil.</p>

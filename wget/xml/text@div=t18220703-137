On the 1st of June, my spectacles and money were in a tea-caddy, on the mantle-piece over the fire-place. I was standing at my door - the prisoner came and asked me to let him the lodging; he said he did not wish to go to a public-house, and wanted some beer - and asked if he might drink his beer in my room; I gave him leave - he sent me out for the beer; when I returned he was going out. I asked if he was not going to drink the beer; he said he was in a hurry, and went out. I missed my spectacles and money from the caddy. I ran out, but could not find him. I saw him again next morning, and am sure of him; I gave him in charge; a duplicate was found on him, which he had taken from my caddy.</p>

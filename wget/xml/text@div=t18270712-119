               <p>COURT. Q. Where was he in the crowd? A. He stood just on my left-hand - he stood very quiet for a minnute, then came and stood in front of me, with his back towards me, bent himself and pushed me into the road - I could not move or stir; I had an umbrella; and his back was towards me. He pushed me intentionally; there was no occasion for it; I felt my watch go at the moment he pushed against me, he then turned round - I caught hold of his tail as he crossed the road, and a waggon came by.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was looking at the band. I heard the prosecutor cry, "My watch!" he had hold of the prisoner's coat-tail. I ran up and collared him - he had a large handkerchief flying in his hand; I took him, but found nothing on him - he said he had lived many years with Mr. Solomon, about Petticoat-lane, and had been to Peerless-pool to bathe - we were some time at Worship-street; another witness there, stated that she had seen him take the watch and give it to another person - but she says she will not come here till the prosecutor pays her expences. I summoned her; she afterwards said it was only hearsay. The prosecutor said the prisoner had offered him 5s. a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You say in your deposition, "The prosecutor stated to me part of what he has now said, but did not mention the 5s. a week?" A. I said it because he had not said so the first time, he had stated it when I was examined - he mentioned it to me before he went in to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I had my back to him, how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120051"></xptr>could I take the watch from him. I am no relation to Ikey Solomon and trust my name will not prejudice me.</p>

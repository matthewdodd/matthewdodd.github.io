In consequence of the death of Mr. Blades, a gentleman was looking into the accounts, and found that 15l., which had been applied for to the Ironmongers' Company, had not been entered; I know from the prisoner himself that it had been applied for, for the use of the school - I inquired of the prisoner about it, and asked if he had discovered any thing further respecting it; he said he had not, but that he had received an order from Mr. Blades, who was the treasurer, to obtain the money from the Ironmongers' Company - he said the order was in writing, and he went and received the cheques from Mr. Pellatt, the clerk, on Messrs. Hankey's; that he brought it to the school in Dorset-street, and locked it in his desk on the Saturday till the Monday morning, and then went and received the money, which he took with him to Peckham, where he resided, brought it back on the Tuesday, put it in an an envelope, and delivered it at Mr. Blades' house, to Mr. Crook, his cashier, in the presence of Mr. Jones; I inquired of the prisoner two days afterwards whether he had been to Mr. Blades' to inquire about it, and he said he had not, at which I expressed my surprise - I think the day after he said Mr. Crook and Mr. Jones recollected that he had been there, but he did not say they recollected his giving the money; I afterwards found the number of the notes, and made inquiries - in consequence of what I heard I sent for the prisoner, and gave him in charge; I told him what I had discovered, but said I did not wish him to say any thing to me about it - as he was going out he stepped back, and asked if it could not some how be settled; I told him to say nothing more - I did not at all agree to settle the matter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. The prisoner was parish-schoolmaster? A. Yes, and as such his duty was merely to instruct the boys - there is a collector of the subscriptions to the school; Mr. Blades was treasurer, and used to pay the bills for the school, by order from the committee of superintendence - this gift was called Betton's gift; I believe it could not have been got without the intervention of Mr. Blades - I believe the prisoner had been schoolmaster a year and a half, or two years; I believe Mr. Blades himself received it the year before; Mr. Blades was at this time afflicted with paralysis, and I have heard was afflicted so as to be deprived of the power of speech; there is a collector, but if I had been treasurer I would not have sent him, because he has a per centage, and the schoolmaster has not - I have never received it myself: the prisoner was merely sent to receive it on account of the illness of Mr. Blades; the schoolmaster has a regular salary - there had been a gratuity made to the former schoolmaster by the committee of superintendence, but not to the prisoner; the former schoolmaster must have had an order to go to Mr. Blades for it - he had been in the situation a number of years, and had only had it at particular times; by no means every year - the prisoner had not the least right to expect it; he had not conducted himself well - the notes the prisoner received have been traced, and are here; I supposed the prisoner had made inquiry between the first time of my asking him and the second, and upon the second occasion he stated that Mr. Crook and Mr. Jones had recollected his being there - the prisoner said he had directed the letter as he was accustomed to direct them, for "
               <persName id="t18300415-350-person2885">J. </persName>
            Blades, Esq., Treasurer;" he said the money was inclosed in it, and it was left with Mr. Crook - he said he had left the money, but did not say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150147"></xptr>it was the identical notes he had received from Hankeys - I understood they were the same notes, but I might be wrong; he might have other notes and have left them -Mr. Brooks, of New-street-square has succeeded Mr. Blades, as Treasurer; this circumstance happened in July, and Mr. Blades died quite at the end of the year.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the person whom he succeeded always rewarded with a gratuity to the same amount? A. No, my Lord, he had it but once to my remembrance, and I think it was 10l.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Blades; I know the prisoner perfectly well - I certainly never received any money from him, or any thing stated by him to contain money from the Ironmongers' Company; he was not at all employed by Mr. Blades in his general service - I never had any conversation with him respecting any money received from the Ironmongers' Company till before his examination had taken place; he came down to ask if I did not recollect receiving the money - I said I did not; there was a Mr. Jones in Mr. Blades' service - I think the prisoner said he paid it about July; I can say with perfect recollection, and with perfect truth, that he never paid any money over to me - I was in the habit of opening all notes at that time, both private and public; I had a special power of attorney to transact any business on Mr. Blades' account, and in his name; if any money had come I ought to have known it, but Mr. Jones sometimes opened letters; I know Mr. Blades' gave the prisoner authority to go and receive the money at the proper time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you say of your own knowledge that Mr. Jones opened all notes and letters which you did not? A. That I cannot say; Mr. Blades was in such a state that no notes relative to business certainly, and I believe no private notes were delivered to him; when Mr. Blades received money it first passed through the cashier's books, but this money never did in the business accounts - I had a good deal to do with his private accounts while he was indisposed; if I had received this money I should have entered it in the public books; the year before they did not usually come into my hands - the prisoner was not in the habit of calling on Mr. Blades; I should think he did not call for six month's together - he never left letters to my knowledge since I had authority to open them, and I should think not previous to that, because Mr. Blades was much out of town; I had many letters that he never saw.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Mr. Blades in a state in which letters would not have been received by him at this time? A. Yes, certainly.</p>

            . I was in the employ of the late Mr. Blades - I occasionally opened letters that came to him; I certainly did not receive any letter from the prisoner containing notes or money at that time, or any account that he had received money; he came to me and asked whether I recollected his bringing a note to Mr. Blades, directed "

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not open all letters? A. I did not; but, generally speaking, I knew the contents of all letters, at least ninety-nine out of a hundred. I am in the shop from eight o'clock till eight - there are eight or ten persons in the shop, and sixteen or eighteen persons altogether; the prisoner might have come in during my absence, and have left a letter, without its coming to my hands.</p>

            . Q. Had you known the prisoner? A. Yes, but did not know his name- he was in the habit of coming to our house; I often change notes for other persons, and occasionally for persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150148"></xptr>I do not know - if it was for a man six feet high I should put "Tall gentleman."</p>

            . ESQ. I am the present treasurer of the school. I have seen the prisoner write frequently - this is his writing on the note, I am satisfied.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You, I believe, charged the prisoner with this offence? A. Yes, and I wrote him a note, to state in writing what he knew of this transaction; I am not certain whether he answered the first note, or whether I wrote a second; I have not his answer, but the tenor of it was that he had received the cheque from the clerk of the Ironmongers' Company, got it cashed at Hankeys, and took the notes home with him, brought them to town the next day, and enclosed them in an envelope, took it to Mr. Blades, and left it with Mr. Crook and Mr. Jones, who were sitting at the desk together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I should have had some friends in the evening, but they were not aware of the trial; they could have witnessed my having received the order of Mr. Blades - I have been at the school since June, 1828, I was sent for by Mr. Blades, in June, 1829, and had not been twelve months at the school, and had received no money - he gave me an order to receive this money from Mr. Pellatt, and hold it till he saw me again; I presented the order at the Hall, and was told it was not in a course of payment; and before it could be paid, I must have a list of the subscribers to the school, and the number of children; I applied at Mr. Blades' for them - Mr. Crook told me he would speak to Mr. Brooks, and send them to me; I waited several days and called several times; Mr. Crook and Mr. Jones know that I have called, and left several letters there, the contents of which they did not know; I have no one to prove that I paid the money - I was engaged by Mr. Brook's as schoolmaster, and by no other person.</p>

               <p>MR. BROOKS. I sent the prisoner to the school; he came from a public establishment; and I had confidence in him.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. DEVEY. Q. Who paid the prisoner? A. He was paid by an order from the committee of superintendence on the treasurer.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 40.</p>
               <p>Recommended to Mercy by Mr. Devey, having a wife and six children.</p>

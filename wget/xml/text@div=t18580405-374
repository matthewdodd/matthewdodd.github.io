                  </hi>. I carry on business with my father and brother as drapers, in Whitechapel. The prisoner has been in our service as shopman about five months—it was his duty, on receiving money from a customer, to make out two bills, to take them to the cashier with the money he had re<lb></lb>ceived—thecashier would stamp one and retain the other—the stamped one he would give back to the prisoner, whose duty it would be to deliver it to the customer—in consequence of suspicions I entertained, I watched the prisoner on 19th Feb.—I saw him serving Mrs. Rutledge—I did not see what amount she paid him—I saw him go to the cashier and return to the customer—Icannot say that I saw him do anything between his going to the cashier and returning to the customer—he gave Mrs. Rutledge the bill; there was no change to give—I went up to him and said, "You have stolen 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked him where the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was, or something to that effect—I cannot say the exact words I used—I think I said both, "Where are the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and "You have stolen the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he stooped down and took them from somewhere, I sup<lb></lb>pose under the counter, but I did not see, and said, "Here they are," and presented them—the counter was between him and me—I said to him, "We watched you yesterday, and you did the same thing yesterday"—he said it was the first time he had ever done it; and he would do anything for me if I would let him off this time—I gave him into custody.</p>

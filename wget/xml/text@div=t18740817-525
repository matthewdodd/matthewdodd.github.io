                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 259). On Saturday night, 25th July, about 11.20, I was in Prince's Street, Notting Hill, with 393 <hi rend="italic">X</hi>, Jesse Couchman—the prisoner came up and said to him "Jesse, what the b----y hell have you been talking about me for?"—Couchman said "I have not been talking about you"—the prisoner then made a strike at him—he endeavoured to ward the blow off, and another person who was with the prisoner struck Couchman in the face, and went down St. Catherine's Road, pursued by Couchman—the prisoner followed me and tripped me up in the road, knelt on my chest, and stabbed me two or three times in the head—I saw something white in his hand similar to a penknife—he also cut me across the nose and kicked me on the ear—I called out "He has stabbed me" and other constables came up who pulled him off me and took him—I had never seen him before—I was examined by the Divisional Surgeon the same night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 303). I was with Barber, and a young woman, who I have since found out to be the prisoner's sister, called out across the read "Halloa, Jesse," and came across and spoke to me. I knew her by sight—it was after that that the prisoner came up and said "Jesse, what the b----y hell are you talking about me for?"—I knew him—I said that I had not been talking about him—he put up his fist and attempted to strike me in the face, but I pushed him away—another man struck me on the side of my head and ran down St. Catherine's Road—I ran after him, and Barber followed—the man went into a house—I did not go in, but I heard Barber say, "Come on, Jesse, I am stabbed"—I found him on his back in the road and the prisoner on top of him with his knees on Barber's chest and his left hand on his shoulder and his right hand up as if he was going to strike him—blood was streaming from Barber's face—I pulled the prisoner off him with another constable's assistance—there were, I should think 1,000 people there—I did not see any knife, it was impossible from the crowd.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon of Police, of 53, Notting Hill Square—I examined Barber at the station at 11.45 p.m., and found two punctured wounds on his right temple, dividing an artery which was spout<lb></lb>ing with blood, and a long superficial wound extending from one" of those punctures across his eyebrow, also a wound about an inch long at the side of his nose—he had lost a good deal of blood—the injuries I saw could not be done by a stone, they were done by some sharp instrument—he was off duty twelve days—the wounds were not of a serious character, they appeared to have been done by a penknife and were down to the bone, but only the breadth of the knife.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Nicholas-lane, Lombard-street, I am a shoe-maker and leather-seller, the prisoner lived with me as servant, she has lived with us twice: On Sunday, the 27th of May, Miss Sheppard informed me that she had missed some lace and other articles from her box; the prisoner left our service on the Saturday preceding, about eight o'clock in the evening. On the Tuesday following, I obtained a warrant to search her lodgings, and in her box, concealed in some pieces of linen, we found the lace; the five yards of printed linen was in a room below in a closet.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she quit your service for? - A. Mrs. Walter was dissatisfied with her conduct, we did not know she was dishonest before; she informed us she was going to a place on the Saturday evening she left us; we applied to that place, and, finding she was not there, I discovered that she was at her brother's in Moor-square, Moor-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. I have, his name is John-Fanner Gresham; Miss Sheppard was on a visit to Mrs. Walter, she is a general shop-keeper in linen drapery, and came to London to buy goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your partner in the house with you? - A. He does not sleep in the house, he pays half the rent, and taxes, he takes his breakfast there; at present the house is under repair.</p>

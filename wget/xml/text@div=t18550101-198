                  </hi>. I am a basket maker. On 5th Dec. I was at the King's Arms, Market-hill, Shadwell—the prisoner was there, and two women with him, drinking—one of the women gave me some gin and water—a mate of mine then gave some ale that went round—we were all good friends up to that time—the prisoner went out, and brought in a mate of his—I do not know that man's name—I then paid for two more pots of ale—I put down my pot behind me, and when I looked for it it was gone—I thought somebody had taken it—the prisoner afterwards came with a glass of ale to offer me as a recompense—I said, "You may keep it," and tried to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it over him—I believe some of it did go over him—he had a comforter on—he took it off—I expected he was offended with me, and he wanted to fight—his mate came and caught hold of me right round the arm, and I was quite helpless—I sang out for help, and his mate let me go when two men came out of the tap room—I went towards the prisoner, and made a hit at him—I had my fists up in a fighting attitude—I struck him on the top of the nose, and as I struck him he ran a knife into my belly, right in the lower part of the groin—I did not see the knife in his hand when I went towards him, I did afterwards—the potman caught hold of me round the back, and would not let me go towards him any more—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there three weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the King's Arms. I saw the prisoner and prosecutor drinking there—Bailey went out and brought in a shipmate, and they had some more drink—they were drinking there from about 9 o'clock till 11 at night—the shipmate called for a pot of ale—Knubley said that was his pot, and there was a wrangle between him and the prisoner about it—I saw Knubley throw it over the prisoner's face, and strike him on the nose, close alongside the beer engine—the prisoner went back, and</p>

               <p>Knubley followed him up to the front door, and struck him once or twice more—the prisoner then drew his knife, and stabbed him in the lower part of the belly—it was a spring back knife—they were fresh in liquor—they had been drinking all the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the London Hospital when Knubley was brought in, on 5th Dec., between 11 and 12 o'clock at night—I found a wound in the lower part of the abdomen; it had evidently been inflicted by a sharp instrument, about one-third of an inch in breadth; the depth could not be ascertained, it had gone through the walls of the abdo<lb></lb>men—it was just over the seat of the bladder, in a dangerous place—he was under my care about three weeks—the bowels were not punctured; he had acute inflammation come on next day, and he was in a dangerous con<lb></lb>dition for a week—we despaired of his life for a time; he was very drunk indeed when he came in—that would be very likely to assist in bringing on inflammation.</p>

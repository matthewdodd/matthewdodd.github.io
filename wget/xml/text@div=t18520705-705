                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the service of the St. Katherine's Dock Company, and was occupied as such on 8th May—the Prisoner was employed there by the Customs—on that day I was engaged in examin<lb></lb>ing some baggage in the examining shed B—my duty is to unpack and repack the baggage—I had opened a trunk belonging to Colonel Armytage, for the purpose of having it examined by the proper officers—the prisoner was on duty at shed B—his duty was to take charge of the goods that came into the shed, and then to write them out again when they were outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by "writing them out?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When they are out of the charge of the Customs, writing them in a book—as packages come in they are written into a book, and are taken into the charge of the landing surveyor—shed B is one of the sheds belonging to the Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What o'clock was it when you were examining this trunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From half past 10 to 11—whilst it was going on I saw the prisoner take his handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it up to his face—he was then at the corner of the trunk—he put his hand down and picked up something white from the trunk, and put it into his pocket—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to Mr. Simpson—I saw the prisoner again that day, about half past 3—I was at the further end of the shed when I saw him there again—Mr. Simpson was going away, and I told him to see where the "charges" was again—we called the prisoner the "charges" because he was in charge—my attention was particularly drawn to him at half past 3—I also drew Mr. Simpson's attention to him—I saw the prisoner stoop down again and pick up some<lb></lb>thing and put it into his pocket—in the morning he put it into his coat pocket, and at half past 3 he put it into his trowsers pocket—what he took was from the corner of the trunk—I am quite sure he took it from the trunk—it was the same trunk I have spoken of before as belonging to Colonel Armytage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then was that same trunk under examination from half past 11 to half past 3 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, we have to wait till the surveyor comes round.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the nature of your duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To unpack the things, and see whether there is anything for duty in the packages that are put into the shed—there was only one more labourer in the shed besides me—the prisoner was in the shed—it was his duty to be there—the foreman, the landing waiter, the landing clerk, two men, the charges, and the weigher, were in the shed—the prisoner is the charges—there was only one charges and one weigher—I call myself a labourer—I was one of the two men—we call the prisoner the charges, because he writes all the packages into a book—I was at the back of the shed at the time I saw this, about six or seven yards from the prisoner—the shed is much larger than this Court, I should say pretty well double the size—at the time I saw the prisoner at the trunk I was looking for another package, along with Mr. Simpson—I was not examining anything, only looking for a package to examine—my attention was attracted by the prisoner standing there and looking about—I turned towards him to see what he was doing—he was not examining the trunk, it had been examined, and was lying there open—he had nothing at all to do with it then—he was standing at the corner of it—it had been examined by me and the weigher about half an hour before—the other man, whose name is Musgrave, was there when I was examining it—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185207050011"></xptr>
               <p>he is not here—he had assisted me in examining the trunk—it was not the prisoner's duty to enter the contents of any of the trunks, only to enter the cases as they come into the shed into a large hook, the marks and numbers of all the packages—he has got a kind of desk there—he had nothing to do with examining the contents of any of the packages, that was my duty—his duty was only to examine the outsides of them, and to enter them in the book—I do not know that he was in the habit of afterwards examining them and comparing them with his book to see whether he had entered them correctly—I believe it was his duty to do so, but I have nothing to do with his book—it was certainly his duty to make his entry as correct as possible—I saw him take his handkerchief out and put it up to his face—I clearly saw him put something white into his pocket—he did not put it into his handkerchief, but into his pocket—he had his handkerchief in the same hand—he did not cover it with his handkerchief, or I could not have seen that it was white—I have never said that he put it into his handkerchief—it was not covered, I could see it—it was about a quarter past 11 in the day, it might be a few minutes more or less—Mr. Simpson was near me at the time I saw him do this—I drew his attention to it immediately—it was about twenty minutes or half past 3 that I saw him the second time—my course of duty led me into the shed at that time, and the prisoner also—I have been in the employment of the Dock Company about thirteen years—I have never been charged with any offence, nor ever discharged and taken back again—I cannot tell how long the prisoner has been in the employ of the Customs, I think he was in this shed about eight days—they change every month.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are the servant of the Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have been regularly employed there for thirteen years, and pretty well always in that department—the trunk was left open from about a quarter past 11 to half past 3 o'clock waiting for the surveyor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that a common thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, if the surveyor has got much to do he cannot get round till late in the afternoon; sometimes, when they are rather slack, he would be in three or four times in the course of the day, and it would be done up directly, but we must leave it till he comes in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then who is responsible for the property during this long interval? who is there to look after it, and see that nobody takes it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a foreman of labourers there, and clerks—Mr. Shult was the foreman—the charges did not remain at his desk all this day—it was his duty to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. McCracken, shipping agents, Old Jewry—I had charge of some baggage on 8th May belonging to a Colonel Armytage, which had arrived at St. Katherine's Docks, it was landed from a ship alongside—there were some labels on the baggage—I have not got them here—I was employed to attend to the clearing of the luggage, and for that purpose went to the B shed—among the luggage was a trunk—I saw it after it had been opened by the officers to be examined—I saw the witness Blinkhorn there, and also the prisoner—in consequence of something said to me, I watched the conduct of the prisoner—I saw him by the trunk in a very suspicious manner—I knew he had no occasion there—he was stooping down once or twice—as I was booking other things in the course of the day I saw him a great many times about the trunk, turning the things over—and my attention was drawn to him by Blinkhorn—it was no part of his duty to turn the things over—I went to him once while he was stooping down—he got up from the trunk with something in his hand, pulled out his handkerehief, and put something in his. pocket, but what I cannot say—I had not seen his handkerchief before that—on observing that, I went up and said, "What is</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor of the Customs, in the port of London. On 8th May, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was on duty at the St. Katherine's Dock—in consequence of some information which I received, I took the prisoner from the shed to the private room attached to my office—I searched him, and found in his coat pocket four stockings, two in each pocket—two of them are pairs, and the others not, although they were folded together as pairs—I produce them—they are marked CA 1, and CA 2; and the other two are marked CA 4—I also produce a pair which I took from the trunk in his presence, and in the presence of other parties connected with it, bearing the same initials, with another number—when the stockings were found in the prisoner's coat, he said he had not placed them there, some other person must have done it as a <hi rend="italic">lark.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of George William Turner, a grocer, of 215, Whitecross-street. I was instructed by him to watch the con<lb></lb>duct of the other persons in his employ. On Sunday, 10th Sept., I was in the shop; the piisoner was there—it was his duty to serve customers—a woman came in for some tea and sugar—the prisoner served her—she gave him half-a-crown; he gave her the change, which he took from the till—he put the half-crown into his left-hand waistcoat-pocket—I was on the opposite side of the counter, and had a distinct opportunity of seeing what he did—next Sunday, 17th Sept., he was there—a woman came in and asked pri<lb></lb>soner for some goods—he served her—she paid him a shilling—he gave her some change, which he took from the till, and put the shilling into his left</p>

I have not robbed you."</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Turner. On 17th Sept. a woman came in for goods—the prisoner served her—they came to 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave him a shilling, which he placed in his left-hand waistcoat-pocket, with his right hand—I was by his side, about half a yard from him—he did not know that I was watching him—he gave her change from the till by my side—she left—I called to Filling, and said, "He has taken one more shilling," and he said, "Go and tell your master"—I did so—my master came out, and was informed that the prisoner had been robbing him—the prisoner said, "I hare not been robbing you, Mr. Turner; for God's sake, forgive me; I have not been robbing you"—he was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of Whitecross-street. The prisoner was in my employ in Sept., as an occasional assistant on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings—I gave him half-a-crown on Sunday mornings—I did not think he was robbing me, but he is a bad accountant, and I told Filling to stand near him and watch him—on 17th Sept., about half-past nine o'clock, Truman spoke to me—I sent for a policeman, and said, "Take this man in charge"—the prisoner said, "For God's sake, forgive me; I have not robbed you"—I said, "I know all about it"—I saw thirteen separate shillings taken from his left-hand pocket, and one or two half-crowns—I let him go, as his little brother, who was coming to London, perhaps would have been lost—I have never had any cause to impeach the character of either of my other shopmen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Do you know his brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the prisoner asked me not to tell Mr. Hardy, a friend of his, but to let him tell him first—I saw Mr. Hardy, and I told him to arrange with the prisoner to call on me that night—I did not know till I saw Mr. Hardy whether I should have the prisoner taken or not—the prisoner has been on bail since—Mr. Hardy was his bail in the first instance—I think I have known the prisoner about eighteen months—he used to sleep in the house on Saturday nights—there was not money enough taken that morning to account for what was found on him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. His master had let him go, and all the moneys, was given back to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was other money in his other waistcoat-pocket, and a sovereign and some silver in one of his trowsers pockets and some silver in the other—it was all given back to him.</p>

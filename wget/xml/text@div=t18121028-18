               <p>Q. Was any one else serving in the shop - A. None. She asked me if I could charge a ring that she had, she produced the ring. I then shewed her some rings out of the window. She looked over the rings, and then produced hers, and asked me the price of a ring which laid in the tray, I told her, two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any seals in that tray - A. None. She did not particularly approve of any of the rings that were there; and I in noticing her ring, seeing it so new, gave me suspicion that she had stolen it. She then asked to see an amethyst seal. I put the rings away, but became very suspicious of her, and watched her very narrowly. I shewed her the seals. She looked them over, but did not approve of any of them; and yet, from the tumbled appearance of the tray, I suspected that she had stolen one. She was going away. I stopped her, and told her I suspected she had stolen a seal, and if she would not produce it, I would send for an officer. I directed the boy to go for the constable. She then produced a seal from out of her bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that was one of the seals that was in the tray - A. I am positive of the seal, it had the shop mark on it itself; she begged that I would let her go. I refused letting her go. I said, as she had deceived my eyes so far, I would not let her go. The watchman came and took her in custody. When the watchman laid hold of her, a ring and a seal dropped from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these to be yours - A. I did, they had my shop mark upon them.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the worth of these - A. They cost me about 4 l. from the manufacturer.</p>

We took her below, and searched her pockets, but all we found were a few things of no value, which I had in my pockets before they were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they?</p>
               <p>B. Bourne. A sciatica bone, a little thimble of my child's, a bit of sealing wax, and a bit of allum.

            . I am a lodger in this house; I was in bed betwixt-eleven and twelve o'clock last Saturday night, about which time it was rumoured in the house that my landlady had been robbed; upon which I immediately put on my breeches and went down stairs; then suspecting the prisoner, I desired she might be searched, which was accordingly done twice, but found nothing upon her; the watchman insisted upon carrying her to the watch-house; I happened to bob my hand against her belly, and feeling something hard, asked her what it was; she replied, it is only my two bones; said another man, if you are going to feel, we are all married men; I took out of a private place under her petticoats all the things, viz. the buckles, stock buckle, a guinea and half in gold, and a piece of touch gold.</p>

            . I lay there on Saturday night with Mr. Burch, and saw the prisoner at the bar as I came in at the door; about ten minutes after that the prosecutrix said she had been robbed; Mr. Burch went up with her and searched the room; I staid below stairs to see who went out; I saw the prisoner searched and the goods found upon her as mentioned in the indictment; I held her by the arm while Mr. Draper and the prosecutrix seized the things.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutrix. Are you sure these things were in your pockets at the time you say you was going to bed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am sure they were.</p>

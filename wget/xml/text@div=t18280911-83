            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's son; I know the prisoner - he lives next door to us. On the 4th of September, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was down stairs, and saw one of the pigeons fly out; I then went up to the garret, and the prisoner was there - he ran away with the pigeons: he could see me - he took four, but one flew away; he carried away three out of the window; I knew him before - he is a silver-polisher: we got one pigeon back.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to Seacoal-lane; they showed me the garret window; I came down, and the prisoner was standing at the door of the next house, where he lives - he denied the charge; I said there were fifteen missing, and he must give an account of them; in a few minutes he said, "I know nothing of fifteen, I only know of three;" I asked what he had done with them; he said he had sold them to a man in Turnmill-street, and took me to the shop - here is one of them; the other has flown away.</p>

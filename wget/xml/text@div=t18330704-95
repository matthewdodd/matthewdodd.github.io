             who died on the 14th of November last; he kept donkeys, and supplied my Lord Goderich's family with asses' milk as I heard, but I was not at home at that time - this receipt for £13. 7s. 6d. is not my father's writing nor mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know anything of the accounts between your father and the prisoner? A. No, not till I came home about three weeks after my father's death, and saw this account in the book, which is not here- I should not think my father had authorised the prisoner to give receipts in his name, but I cannot say what took place in my absence.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you demanded the money of my Lord Ripon since then? A. Yes; it appears in our books as unpaid; this receipt is not my father's writing nor mine.(Receipt read. See Indictment.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. With regard to Brown's receipt, I went purposely to Wimbledon to pay it on the day I was deputed; I cannot say when it was - he was not at home; I left part of the money with a landlady there - I met Brown some time after that and authorised him to call on me, which he did, and I paid him the balance - I believe he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040079"></xptr>could not write, and he authorised me to sign the receipt.</p>

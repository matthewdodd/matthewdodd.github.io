I had last seen it on the 18th of September; he was turned out about six o'clock that evening; I know it of my own knowledge. On the following morning I missed him I sent my boy for him about seven o'clock, he was not to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually turn him out upon this Common - A. Yes, on an evening, and fetch him up again in Summer time; he was an iron grey gelding with two broken knees about fourteen hands high.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoners - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see this gelding again - A. On the 15th of October I saw the gelding at Bath in Somersetshire, it was in the possession of the High Constable</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in custody then - A. No, they had been discharged they were taken up about an hour after I arrived at Bath, I swore to my horse at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of this gelding - A. Five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310047"></xptr>pound and upwards. The gelding now is at the New Inn in the Old Bailey, that is the gelding that I lost. I have not the smallest doubt of it being my horse.</p>

            . I live at Entry Hill, near Bath, I am in the butchering and farmering line.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners - A. Yes, they came on the 24th of September, they were both in company together, they had two horses with them at the time I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was one of them an iron-grey horse - A. I really do not know, I saw them with two horses; Luke Calverwell asked me if I could take them in to keep, he said their backs were bad, he wanted me to take them both in for a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand that they had been galled by the saddle - A. Yes; the other prisoner stood out in the road with the two horses, I told him I would take them in, he asked me what I would charge, I said my husband was not at home, he would not overcharge them; I asked him what name I should put these horses down in, they gave me the name of Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Creswell in hearing at this time - A. He was; Creswell then asked me where he was to take them to, I told him to go down the road to a large pair of blue gates, and I would send my servant to him, I called my servant and told him to take out the key and let these horses in.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the man again - A. On the 19th of October at the Magistrate's at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they under the accusation of having stolen the horses - A. Yes, they were waiting to have my evidence on the occasion. Mr. Giles was there, they were committed upon my evidence; I recollected the persons of both of them, and gave the same account as I have given now; Mr. Scuddimore came up to my house on the Thursday following Mr. Barret delivered up the horse to him.</p>

            . Look at the prisoners, do you know their persons - A. I do; I was servant to Mr. Barret at that time, I am quite sure of their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and them on the 24th of September - A. I went down and unlocked the gates by my mistress's order for the prisoner, there was only Creswell at the gate; I only saw Creswell, they went out at the back door, they went down the road; I received two horses from Creswell, and put them into my master's meadow, they were in my master's field from Monday the 24th of September, till the Thursday following, and then they were delivered to Mr. Scuddimore.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Barrett. When was the horse parted with to Mr. Scuddimere - A. On the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. to Webb. What did Creswell say when you put these horses into the field - A. He said he was going to put these horses in the field for a week till their backs got better, their backs were very bad when I took them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the iron-grey horse in the stable in the Old Bailey - A. Yes; that is one of the horses that I took in of Creswell. I saw the horse when Mr. Scuddimore had it in his possession; I then knew that it was one of the horses that Creswell brought to me. I saw it on the Thursday afternoon, the prisoners were then in custody on suspicion of having stolen them. I recollected Creswell's person then; I told the same story before the magistrate as I have now; the prisoners were then discharged, there was nobody could identify the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the horse that is now in the stable in the Old Bailey; the same horse that you saw at Bath when they were under suspicion of having stolen the horses - A. Yes, it is an iron-grey horse, with two broken knees near fourteen hands high.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the horse when they were taken up the second time - A. I saw the horse, I swore to the horse, and to Creswell's person.</p>
               <p>Creswell's Defence. I was going to the pit with my horses on Monday morning of Kingsdown fair. I met a man with these two horses, the man asked me whether I had any place to keep them for three or four day, or whether I could tell him of any place, I said very likely he might have it at Mr. Barret's, at the butchers, or at the Cross Keys; the man said he would satisfy me very well if I would put them in one of the places, and keeping them three or four days, or a week; he went and fetched three or four pots of beer for us, at a public house; about a mile and a half from Bath, he said he wanted to go to Bristol for something particular, he said he would satisfy me for it. I did not want any more than the three pots of beer, the man paid for the beer, and I had these horses to put into the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this person - A. I cannot tell, he was a stranger to me; he left me, and said he was going to Bristol; I never saw the man before nor since Calverwell was with me.</p>
               <p>Calverwell's Defence the same.</p>

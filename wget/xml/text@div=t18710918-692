                  </hi>. I am the landlady of 40, Bermondsey Square—the prisoners lodged there from October, 1865, until 12th August, last year—a child was born on 28th February, 1870—it was a very beautiful baby—I never saw such a remarkably fine child—it continued exceedingly healthy and strong up to the tenth or eleventh month; then it began to fall off—it was weaned between the twelfth and thirteenth month—I told the mother if she had not sufficient milk for the child, to feed it; it was too long to go on nursing it, the milk was of no benefit to it—after it was weaned I saw it three or four times a day—up to fifteen or sixteen weeks ago, the mother had gone out to day work at a firm in Bermondsey Street, furring—before that she was at home—she did not go regularly to work she did not take the child with her—at times, for a short time, it was taken out for a few hours, and there Was a girl had for a week to attend to it, but she did not do so as she ought—the mother frequently left the child; I have known it to be left from 10 o'clock or 10.30 in the morning until 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening, with no one to attend to it, except I have gone in and out, or perhaps one of my lodgers—sometimes there would be a little bit of dry bread left for it, and on many occasions nothing at all, except what I or my lodgers have taken—I have many times given it food, it has taken it very ravenously—I have repeatedly told both the father and mother that I was satisfied the child had not sufficient food given to it—I repeatedly spoke to her about it up to the time of her being takes into custody, and about the child being so neglected—I have repeatedly told him of her being so drunk as she has been, and the child being so neglected—he said he was out at his work, and he did not know what was going on at home, and she has told me to mind my own business—she would be drunk for three or four days at a time—I have seen her in that state when she has come back at 5.30 in the evening—her husband knew that she was an habitual drunkard—I have known them on many occasions sit down to meals, and the child lying on the bed crying—if anything was given to it, it would cease crying, when it was hungry—it was more often crying than not, both before and after it was weaned—when I have spoken to her about it, she has said "It is such a hungry little hog I can't satisfy it, give it what I will"—I always considered her to be an extremely dirty, neglectful, and cruel mother to it, in every respect—I have heard her say she had no love towards the child, and she wished it was dead—on the morning of 12th August, she told me that she was then going into the workhouse, and when the child was dead and buried she should come out again, for it would save a wonderful deal of trouble and bother in my house—the husband left about 5.30 or 6 o'clock in the morning, to go to work; sometimes it would be 8 o'clock before he went out, and he would return in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Medical Officer of Bermondsey Workhouse—on Saturday, 12th August I was called to see the prisoners child, at 40, Bermondsey Square—it was lying up some dirty bedding, on a broken-down bedstead, looking very dirty and pale; the eyes and cheeks sunk, the surface of the body cold, the pulse indistinct, and the skin had a shiny appearance, as though it had not been washed for some time—there was rather laboured breathing, and inanition; the abdomen was collapsed, quite soft—the body generally was very much emaciated—it weighed 131/2 lbs. with its clothes on; it ought to have weighed about 24lbs.—it was a large child, with a bony outline—I asked the woman what food she had given the child</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187109180082"></xptr>
               <p>that day—she said "A pennyworth of milk, half a pint"—this was between 2 and 3 o'clock in the day—I asked her if she had ever given him food on any day—she said she had given only a halfpennyworth on a certain day—she was partially intoxicated, and I thought it unnecessary to question her more—the child was then removed to the workhouse, where I at<lb></lb>tended it till it died the next day, on Sunday, the 13th, about 4 o'clock—everything was done for it; it had food every two hours—I could not detect any disease—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination fifteen hours after death, and came to the conclusion that there was no disease, but that it died of starvation.</p>

Christy's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, she has not been at work there recently—she was not drunk when she went there in the morning the first thing—she has, on several occasions, complained to me about Mrs. Brown—I should say I have seen her drunk some ten, twelve, or thirteen times—I have known her five, six, seven, or eight months—I have seen her drunk, and under the influence of liquor, both, in that time.</p>

Elizabeth Knight:</hi> "I did all that lay in my power for the child." <hi rend="italic">George Knight:</hi> "I have always acted as a man to my wife, and a good father to the children. I have always looked for work, and brought the money home, and it was distributed in for the rent. I gave my wife all the rest."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">George Knight's Defence.</hi> I should like you to understand that it was not my practice to deduct 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. if I earned but a shilling or two; I never went to that extreme unless I was pretty sure of making a full day's work; that would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I had to purchase a breakfast and dinner, and then I waited till I got home. My breakfast would be a pint of coffee and three slices of bread and butter; sometimes for dinner, bread and coffee, or bread and cheese, and at other times I might have a small meat pudding. I have never seen my wife ill treat the child. There were various com<lb></lb>plaints made to me from time to time; in fact it was a burden to me to come into the place; but I could never find there was any truth in the complaints. With respect to the eldest child, she was very fond of it. In spite of the mystery concerning her character, she did not neglect religion, and never allowed the child to sit at table without thanking God for pro<lb></lb>viding for it and her, and how could I judge her of wilfully starving the other child.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth Knight's Defence.</hi> My husband gave me the money, and I used to lay it out as well as I could in the house. I did my best for the baby; any accident I could not help.</p>

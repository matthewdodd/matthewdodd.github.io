               <p>Q. When was it? - A. About nine o'clock in the afternoon of Monday the 11th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body attack you? - A. Yes, a single person; I was in the act of getting under a stile; I heard a voice say stop, stop; I went on, I turned round, and saw him run; I did not at the first moment observe he had a pistol holding out towards me; knowing it was a gentleman I had before seen in the fields I did not think his intentions were to rob me, I turned about and went on a little bit; the man said, stop, d-n you stop, or I will blow your brains out; I said, what do you want with me; he said, all that you have got about you, d-n you stop and give it me or I will blow your brains out, or something to that effect; he came up to the stile with the pistol in his hand; I then stopped and gave him what I had, a metal watch, with a black shagreen case, two shillings, and two sixpences; he said, d-n you don't look at me, I am not to be looked at.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a good deal alarmed? - A. I was a great deal alarmed; he said, don't look which way I go; he went away and I went to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to your wife? - A. He asked her for what she had got about her; what she said I don't know, but I afterwards heard him say I won't take that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, upon the whole, was he with you? - A. Not above two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take particular notice of him? - A. Not at that time; I had seen the man that robbed me twice before in the fields within the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had an opportunity of seeing him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see him at the Justice's? - A. I saw him on the Friday following at Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you positive of his person before the Justice? - A. I believed he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you positive at that time? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it now makes you less positive? - A. I cannot justly say; I have some doubts as to the identify of the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very positive at that time, how came these doubts to arise in your mind? - A. It is a very serious thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care what you swear; do you or not, upon consideration, believe that is the man, for if you screen him from justice you are guilty of perjury? - A. I have my doubts.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence do your doubts arise, what makes you doubt now when you were so certain before the Justice, is there any thing you did not observe at that time in his person? (Hesitates.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him, is there any thing about his person that you, did not see at that time and that you do see now? - A. I have my doubts.</p>

               <p>Q. At his lodgings? - A. No, in the public road: On Monday, the 18th of October, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; I took him to the Marquis of Granby, and searched him; I found nothing upon him but two shillings and a few halfpence in his pocket; no duplicates of any kind whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him his place of abode, and did he not tell you? - A. No, he refused to tell me; he said he lived in the neighbourhood of Brompton, but he would not tell me where he lived, though I asked him several times; he told me if I would treat him like a gentleman, he would go quietly with me to Bow-street; I took him there, and the prosecutors both seemed to be very positive to his person.</p>

            . I am an officer. Last Saturday, between seven and eight o'clock, Mr. Harrison, the pawnbroker, sent for me - I found Walsh there, who had offered a pair of shoes in pawn - I took him in charge; the Magistrate admitted him a witness - I found a duplicate of another pair of shoes in his watch pocket; and from his information I went to Mr. Thomas, who claimed them - Kelsey came in, and I took him - on the way to the watch-house he gave me information of a boy, whom he called Thy, but said his real name was Williams; he said I could find him at the Cock public-house - I went there, and found a pair of shoes in his pocket, which Thomas claimed; Cocklan was with Williams, and also had a pair of shoes - I took them all to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a stay-maker, and have known Williams six or eight weeks. On Saturday evening he gave me a pair of shoes to pawn at Holdsworth's; I gave him the 2s. and put the duplicate into my fob - he and Cocklan were together at the Cock public-house, Tottenham-court-road, and told me they were going to receive shoes from Kelsey, who was to steal them from Thomas - I know I did wrong - I never did it before - I pawned another pair at Harrison's (which Cocklan, gave me) and was stopped - Williams said they were to wait about the door, and Kelsey was to bring the shoes out - I told the officer where to find them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not confused? A. Yes; because I knew it was not honest - I was to have the duplicate; I intended to take them out to sell; the Magistrate said if I told the truth I should be forgiven.</p>

            . I work for a plasterer in King-street, Bloomsbury; Walsh and I had a pint of beer at the Cock - Williams came in and said, "Is it time to go and see about the shoes?" I said I did not care; and he went with me to the shop; he whistled, and Kelsey came out and gave us each a pair of shoes in Russell-street - we went there again; Williams whistled, Kelsey came out, went down George-street, and gave Williams another pair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you tell this to save yourselves? A. I was put on my oath; I expect to be saved by it; I did not put Kelsey up to it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

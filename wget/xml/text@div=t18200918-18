               <p>"If you have got money to spare here is a bargain." He took me to a public-house in Oxford-street, where two men had the clock. He asked me to pledge it - I said I would have nothing to do with it. He said,</p>
               <p>"It belongs to me, and if you pledge it for 4 l. 10 s. you shall have the ticket." He staid outside while I went in. They would only give me 4 l., I went out and told him. I went there again in about an hour; Cundle was there then, and had opened the clock for the shopman.</p>

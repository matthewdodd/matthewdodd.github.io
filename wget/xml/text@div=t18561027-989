                  </hi>. I was twenty-one years of age last birthday; I am now in business on my own account, as a timber mercant. My father was in partnership with the defendant Fossey—they failed in Dec., 1855—they were bankrupts in Jan. of the present year—the partnership had lasted twelve months—before that, I had been clerk to Fessey, when he was in business alone, from 1852 down to the time of his partnership with my father—in the years 1858 and 1854 Mr. Walker was a customer of Fossey's—during those years large quantities of timber were supplied from Fossey's premises to the premises of Mr. Walker, I should think, at least, to the amount of 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Walker's factory was at Millwall, and his counting-house in Arthur-street West, near London-bridge—I was acting in the management of Fossey's business in Sept., 1853—when timber was sent from Fossey's to Walker's, delivery orders were sent with it—they were in the form of these notes (<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—this is one of them, "Ferry-road, Millwall, Poplar, Sept 21, 1853. Deliver to John Walker" certain deals. "For George Fossey, Thomas J. Steel"—this is in my handwriting—this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—I Wrote it by Mr. Fossey's direction—it purports to be an account of goods delivered from Mr. Fossey to Mr. Walker, in the month of Sept., 1853—the total amount of it is 884<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after that account was made out, Mr. Fossey desired me to go to settle the account with Mr. Walker; that is to go and ascertain that the items were correct, and then get paid—I told Fossey that I should not like to go, or I would not go; I said there were certain discre<lb></lb>pancies in the account, and I should not like to go; I would sooner have him go himself—I do dot think anything was said at the time about what those discrepancies were; Mr. Fossey knew that there were certain over-charges in the account—he said he would go himself if I would not—I do I not remember making any observation at the time as regards the items; I think nothing more passed about the particulars—Mr. Fossey and I had frequently talked over the overcharges to Mr. Walker—he told me that to anticipated that Mr. Walker would stop payment, and he thought it right or advisable to charge extra, to make up for any deficiency hereafter; some<lb></lb>thing to that purpose—he took the account from me, and I understood he would go himself—soon after this conversation he showed me this bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said, "I have got this bill of Mr. Walker"—this is Mr. Walker's acceptance; it is for 865<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated Oct. 13, 1853, payable it four months—I think Fossey showed me this bill the same evening that we had the conversation abotrt taking the account to Mr. Walker—I expressed my surprise that he had got the bill for that amount—the first item in this account is, Sept. 1, 8,570 feet of yellow boards—they were not sent on 1st Sept—I had been a party to the settling of the Aug. account—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the last item in this account is 3,570 feet of boards, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is a deduction of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the Aug. account, for discount, at 5 per cent.—I had settled that account, allowing that discount—when I returned home, I told Fossey I had settled the account—he said it was an unusually large discount to allow—Neary was not present on that occasion, he was afterwards; either the same day, or a few days afterwards, at Fossey's house—Fossey said to him that it was a large discount, and how could it be made up—(this was in the beginning of Sept.—we generally settled Mr. Walker's account on the 13th or 14th of the following month, as we sent in the account in the previous month)—Neary</p>

               <p>proposed to charge extra for timber, to make up for the discount which was allowed to Mr. Walker on the previous month's account—it was agreed that that should be done—Fossey said, "Be it so"—there was a note made for the 87 three-quarter boards on the following month; it was agreed that 87 yellow boards should be charged again in the Sept account; those boards that were not sent—on 1st Sept. 87 three-quarter white boards were sent—there were no boards sent corresponding with the entry in the Aug. account—I find in the Sept. account 40 inch and a quarter yellow boards, 660 feet, on 20th—I do not find any delivery note corre<lb></lb>sponding with that item—I know that there was a lot of inch and a quarter boards charged in Sept. which were not delivered—there are two parcels of 180 boards charged here—one of the parcels of 180 was not delivered; I do not remember which of them—on 21st Sept here is 22 feet of yellow battens 1100, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 26th there is 30 boards, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believe those boards were not delivered—I cannot swear that they were not, but I believe not, I think not—on 28th Sept here is a charge of 100 boards at 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were not sent—I find here a delivery note for those 100 boards on 28th Sept., I remember writing it in Fossey's counting house—Fossey and Neary were there at the time it was written—I think Fossey was then; he was either in the counting house, or in his own house—Neary came down in the course of the evening to see Fossey about it—there was a delivery note for a certain quantity of timber, which had not got this 100 fourteen feet deals—that note was destroyed at that time—Neary brought it, I saw it contained sundry pieces of ash, and other things, which had been sent—it was proposed that that note should be destroyed—I do not remember who spoke first—Neary said to me, "I have brought down this note for these goods, for you to insert the items," or something to that effect—it was proposed that there should be 100 fourteen foot deals charged in another delivery note—that was proposed by Fossey, by Fossey and Neary together—they were together—I do not remember which it was that spoke; it was proposed that there should be a fresh delivery note made out, the old one destroyed, and 100 fourteen foot deals inserted in the fresh note—this note was then written by me, by Fossey's desire—it contained the 100 fourteen foot deals that were not delivered—the paper was to be made to appear an old note—I do not remember who suggested that—it was made a dirty note, some dirt was put on it to make it appear an old note; I am sorry to say that was done by myself—all that I have stated occurred in the evening when Fossey and Neary were present—the note was then handed to Neary, and he took it away with him—the boards sent from Fossey's to Mr. Walker varied in width—the extreme width was eleven inches—the extreme width of flooring boards was nine inches; there were some narrower than that, none wider; that is, all that I saw delivered—I saw most of them—the delivery note of Sept 6, 1853, is for 3164 feet—that represents running feet—I cannot say that I was present when those boards were sent out, I might have been—I lived with Fossey, and boarded with him—I have often seen Neary there, always of an evening—I do not know where he lived at that time, I believe somewhere at Peckham, or the Old Kent-road way—he used to go with Fossey to the public houses about, occasionally, the City Arms for one place; I have seen them there together.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell your father that you had, during the whole of the month of Sept., 1853, day after day, been entering in Fossey's books accounts which you knew to be false, for the purpose of cheating Mr. Walker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect—I kept the books at Fossey's—I believe the false entries, to which I have spoken to-day, are in my writing—this is the journal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is not the book in which the delivery notes are copied, it is the book from which the account is made—the delivery notes would be copied from the day book—I believe there is a day book—I have not got it here—I do not know anything about it—this book is in my writing—I do not know that the whole of it is, these entries of Mr. Walker's are—this was copied from the day book—a portion of the day book was in my writing, and a portion, I should think, in Mr. Fossey's—I say that I have occasionally spoken of this to my father, but he was not aware that it was to such a large extent at the time he put—the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in—he objected to it, but I strongly recommended him to establish me in the business with Mr. Fossey—my father did not know of the frauds—I have occasionally told him that Mr. Fossey was in the habit of charging extra or charging over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell your father that in the single month of Sept you assisted Fossey to rob Walker of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know that I did; I do not remember—I do not remember that I told him that Fossey had charged Walker 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. extra—I do not remember telling him anything about it—I do not know that I did not, and I do not know that I did—my father and I have talked over the matter of his investing his 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and my becoming a partner; but you must consider my age was only seventeen then—I told my father that I thought Fossey was a very good man for me to go into partnership with—I told him it was a good opening; my father did not think so, he always objected to it—I led him to believe it was a good business, and I thought I should do well—he strongly objected to it—I knew at that time that Fossey was in the habit of doing this kind of thing, but I did not put the construction on it that he was a swindler and a thief—I knew it was wrong, and I feel now too grieved—I told my father of it; I told him Mr. Fossey was in the habit of charging extra goods to Mr. Walker—I do not know that I told him that Fossey made me enter false items in the account—my father has remonstrated with Mr. Fossey for sticking it on—he did so before he went into partnership with him—I was present, and heard him.</p>

Linklater's office—I first toid Mr. Walker about these frauds either on the 12th or 13th Aug., in the year—I had been in business for myself since Feb.—Neary used to come to Fossey's of as evening—those evening visits commenced in 1853, I cannot say in what month—I do not remember—I cannot remember whether they took place in Sept.—I saw him there a number, of times—I cannot swear to the number of times, I should say quite fifty times; it was alter btrioett hours, when, the office was shut, and the yard gates shut there were, two galles; the foreman had charge of the key of the large gate, and I had the key of the smaller gate—Neary used not to come through either gate, only as the time when he came from Fossey's house into the counting house—if he happened to go there, he used to go through the smaller gate—I used always to let him hire in if he went with me—there were other servants about at that time—there was Bacon, he is here, and there, was a boy named <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—I have not seen him here—I do pot know of any one else—they used to stay till 5 or 6 o'clock, it depended on circumstances—if we were busy, they would stay longer, if it was daylight—in the summer time we have not doted the yard till 8 or 9 o'clock sometime?—Fossey's house was some way from the count<lb></lb>ing house—these interviews took place at his private, house—he had two servants at his house—the 3570 yellow boards is, I believe, charged twice; the last item in the Aug. account, and the first in the Sept. account—the 1 Aug. account was settled, I think, about 14th Sept.—the goodb sent out were entered at the time in the day book—they were noil entered in the ledger for six or nine months afterwards—they were then entered from the day book, I think—I do not know where the day book is—there were three books, the ledger, the day book, and the delivery note book.</p>

               <p>they were kept in an iron safe in the counting house, to which I had access and Mr. Fossey—the key was there, my father could, I suppose, come in and see them if he chose—the entries in the ledger were copied from this book—I call this a journal; this book was copied from the day book; I am quite sure of that—the items of Sept. 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th, in this account, are not correct entries of goods actually sent out—the item of 5th Sept is 200 planed boards, measuring 3,154 feet; they are charged here as 3,154 square feet—there were 200 white planed boards sent out on that day, and on the 7th 150 planed white boards were sent out, and on 9th and 10th articles were sent out corresponding to what is in the account, excepting one of these eighty inch and a quarter boards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say they were incorrectly measured; but, without reference to the measurement, these articles were sent out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge; at least, I cannot say they were sent out, I presume they were—it was my duty to enter them in the delivery note book; that is a book with a counterfoil, from which you tear out a note, on which is entered the timber sent out—I should copy from the delivery note book into the day book, then into the journal; it was then posted into the ledger—I did not do it regularly—I do not think I posted the journal into the ledger for sisx months—I did not regularly post the day book into the journal—I posted them before I sent in the accounts—the accounts between Fossey and Walker went in every month; then they were posted up into the journal—I should not post them in the day book shortly after the goods were sent out—we were in the habit of doing it in this way: taking the delivery note book, and perhaps taking one man's account only, Mr. Walker's, and entering that in the day book; posting up Mr. Walker's account, but leaving other accounts not posted up—I am not aware that it sometimes happened that goods were sent out to Mr. Walker without any delivery note—I will swear it never happened, not to my knowledge—at the time I was with Fossey, there was only one person employed to measure the timber; that wan Wilson—Bacon's duty was to see that the timber was correctly taken on the cart, and he used to come into the counting house and tell either Mr. Fossey, or I, or the other clerk, who was present, to make out the notes—I was never pre<lb></lb>sent at calculations made by Walker, or anybody in his employment with Fossey, as to the quantity of timber that would be required for the par<lb></lb>ticular orders that he had, except in this late contract, in which therein dispute with the assignees; I do not remember it previous to that—I now that these boards are used for the flooring of houses—it is requisite to ascertain how many square feet is required for the flooring of a house before an order is given for the timber, but it was not the case in Mr. Walker's establishment at that time—I should think if he had one house he had almost 300 being erected—they are houses for exportation to Australia and other places—I should imagine that he would enter into contracts for the supply of a certain number of the same size, but I was not in his service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know enough of the business to know, that in order to ascertain how much timber he would want, it would be necessary to take the square feet of every floor in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not done in that way—Mr. Jackson, who is the clerk to Mr. Walker, was in the habit of coming up, and saying, "Well, Mr. Fossey, how much flooring have you by you?"—"Oh, 40 or 50 square"—"Well, send it down;" and as fast as it was used up he would send for more—in order to ascertain that we had got 40 or 50 square feet, it would be necessary to multiply the length by the breadth, and then divide by twelve—that was not done by person in</p>

               <p>Fossey's employment—the running feet were charged as twelve in some instances—the linear feet was reduced into square feet by that process, to other customers, you must understand—I should think it was easy to ascer<lb></lb>tain the squares that would be wanted for any particular home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corrugated iron merchant, and a contractor, of Mill wall and Arthur-street West. I was so during 1853 and 1854—during that period Neary was a clerk in my employment—during that year I had extensive dealings with Fossey; I should say I had paid him 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during that year—towards the close of 1854 I was obliged to call my creditors together, and compound with them at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, up to that time I had paid Fossey many thousands; I cannot recollect the amount—it was Neary's duty to keep the bought book and the ledger at the office—I was wholly engaged during the day in the contracts that I was making for different persons—in Sept., 1853, I had a large contract to send out wooden houses to Australia, for which I was dealing with Fossey—the wood was usually ordered verbally from my factory by my managing man, Mr. Jackson—it was not known at the time the order was given what quantity would be wanted—it was ordered upon an expectation of what would be required for the different works—upon its being sent, it was cus<lb></lb>omary that a delivery order should be sent with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, Stainsbury-terrace, Poplar. In the years 1852 and 1853 I was the general manager of Mr. Walker's factory at Millwall—the receiving book was kept there, under my control—it was my duty to see that the proper entries were made in the receiving book by the persons who were there—during Sept, 1853, I was in the habit of receiving timber from Mr. Fossey's—these produced are delivery notes, such as were sent with the goods—I have looked through them—they were linear measurement, according to these—I cannot say whether I was present when any of the lots came in to which these delivery notes apply—I saw the flooring boards that came in Sept—none of them were wider than nine inches—I never saw any delivered wider than that—it would be the duty of the receiving clerk, Holt, to enter them in the receiving book—I have been present very often when the timbers have come—sometimes I went in the morning to order the goods—when they came in they were checked by the receiving clerk at the gate—the measurement of the boards was taken, the length and breadth, and the number—the receiving note was seen at the time—next morning the receiving book and the delivery note were sent up to Neary—I never saw the bought book or the ledger—I might have seen them when I went to Mr. Neary's, but I had no control over them—I have had my attention called to the entries in the bought book applicable to some of the timbers that were sent in Sept.—in book A, fol. 137, I find, under the date of 5th Sept., "200 one-inch flooring white boards, 3, 164 feet"—I should suppose they were linear feet by this—this is the bought book—I take it to be linear measurement—it is priced out as square; the price is 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is no other entry of this 200—on 7th Sept. I find an entry of "120 one-inch planed boards, 1812;" it is put down here as "linear," but it is carried out in the money column as "square"—I have likewise had my attention called to this item on the 8th, of 100 one-inch planed white beards, 1873—I should say that the delivery notes are for linear measurement—the account would be taken as of linear measurement—it was the clerk's duty to measure it when it came in—I was there from morning to night—I lived on the premises—there is a public house in the neighbourhood called the City Arms—Neary lived in the neighbourhood of the Old Kent-road—I think I have seen him at the City Arms, I cannot say as to any particular time—I have not seen him with any one in particular—I used to frequent the house, and Mr. Fossey, and several other persons belonging to the neighbourhood—I think I have seen Neary there of an evening in company with Fossey.</p>

I was so in Sept, 1853—my duty was at the factory, at Millwall—these are the two receiving books, in which ought to be entered all the timber and goods received at Millwall—they were used on alternate days; one was in use while the other was at Arthur-street—I kept this book, all the entries in it are in my writ<lb></lb>ing—I have entered the timbers received in Sept., 1853—I cannot say that I took an account of them—I do not find any entry in book B, on 20th Sept., of forty inch and a quarter yellow boards, received from Mr. Fossey's; there is no such entry—there is no entry of 180 inch and a quarter yellow boards on the same day—I find no entry in book A, of fifty 22 feet yellow battens, on 21st Sept, nor of 3,017 feet 2 1/2 inch yellow battens, on 26th—I find an entry on 28th of 100 14 feet spruce deals, 3 inches by 9 inches—I do not find any entry of a second 100 on the same day—there is no entry of 270 inch white planed boards, on the 29th—I do not know what was the width of the flooring boards that were brought, I cannot recollect so far back—they were about 9 inches usually; I do not know what they were that month—I do not know what was the extreme width of the flooring boards that came while I was there, they were generally about 9 inches, I never measured the widths—if the goods to which I have been referred had come on the days named, I should have entered them in these books, if I had been at my post—I generally went on duty between 6 and 7 o'clock; I have been 8, and I have been 9 o'clock; Strand had a duty similar to mine—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the West India Docks. In 1853, I was a clerk in the employment of Fossey—it was part of my duty to arrange the sending out of timber that was sent to Mr. Walker's—Mr. Fossey has told me on several occasions, "Don't be particular to a few feet, as Mr. Walker will not pay the cartage"—it was my duty to measure or count what was going out—if there was 300 or 400 feet of boards on the carriage, I came in and told Mr. Fossey the number, and he has said, "Oh, put down 500," and so on—that was often done—it was about one-fourth generally—the width of the flooring boards sent to Mr. Walker's was six, seven, and nine inches—it was never beyond that width—I wrote most of the delivery notes when I was in the way—none of those produced are in my writing—I used to count the number of boards as they were loaded to go to Mr. Walker's—the number of boards was accurate in the delivery notes, the excess was in the measurement—I was speaking of boards when I said that Fossey desired one-fourth to be added, not flooring boards, some rough boards, and some flooring boards.</p>

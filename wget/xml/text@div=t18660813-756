                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer, in the London Road, Southwark—about August, 1864, I was recommended to Cross as an attorney—I employed him to collect a debt of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd due to me from a Mr. Romsey—he collected that, but never paid it over to me—I did not see him from the 14th September until about a month ago, when I gave him in charge—I never gave him authority to sign my name to any document—the signature "A. Raphael" on the back of this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you always carried on business on the Surrey side of the Thames? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I carried on business in Middlesex twenty-six years—I did not know the prisoner then—it was a pawnbroker's business—I had a licence—before that I had a <hi rend="italic">leaving</hi> shop—I did not state at the police-court that I had employed the prisoner to collect several debts—my depositions were read over to me, and I signed them as being correct—I called on Mr. Binns two or three months afterwards—the prisoner did not call upon me in company with one of Mr. Binns's clerks—I never received any letters from him on the subject of this debt—when I called on Mr. Binns I saw his managing clerk, Mr. Hincklin—I did not give him the prisoner's address—I said he was living in different places—I did give him an address—the prisoner did not call upon me after that—from September, 1864, until the day I gave the prisoner into custody I did not give any information to the police—I do not know whether it was at 47 1/2, Lincoln's Inn Fields, I found the prisoner—the constable took him out of an office whilst he was writing—a man of the name of Levite was with me—Mr. Cooper is my attorney in this case—Mr. Levite is Cooper's clerk—Mr. Cooper has not acted as my solicitor before, but Mr. Binns has—Mr. Levite has not offered to conduct this prosecution free of expense—I have paid 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether to Mr. Cooper—he has not undertaken to repay me that sum—the second time I was before the magistrate I expressed a desire to withdraw from the prosecution, but I heard that the prisoner was going to proceed against me for false imprisonment, so I said I would go on with the case—I did receive an undertaking from him that he would bring no such action—I was offered 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to withdraw by the prisoner's attorney, but I told him I would not take 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never said that I do not recollect whether or not I gave him authority to sign my name—I was wanted to say that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Binns, solicitor, of Trinity Street, Southwark—this cheque, which has been produced, I gave to the prisoner on the 14th of September, 1864—it is, "On demand pay Mr. A. Raphael, or order, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and it is crossed—when I gave it there was nothing whatever on the back—it was given to the prisoner on Mr. Raphael's account.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In this transaction I believe you knew no person but the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he gave me the name of the plaintiff and the defendant, and the amount I had to collect—afterwards I saw Mr. Raphael—that would be about six weeks after—he gave me the prisoner's address, and I sent a clerk there—the prisoner came to me—I told him he had better go to Mr. Raphael's, and settle the thing at once—I have seen Raphael on several occasions since, and he told me he had not got his money.</p>

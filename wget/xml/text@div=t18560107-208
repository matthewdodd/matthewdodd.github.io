                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Sands, of No. 13, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey-street. The prisoners came to lodge at our house on 12th Dec., as near as I can say—they occupied the back parlour and the shop, and carried on a stationer's and newspaper office business—they had three children—the deceased child was named Emma Waldon Butler, and was I believe two years and nine months old—she was very well indeed when she came, in my opinion; she had a very pretty little colour—she was very cold when she came, and I took her into my room and warmed her, and she seemed very cheerful—the husband was at home all day, he generally went out late in the evening, and I have known him return at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing; I think he is a musician—the female prisoner was very harsh to the child at times—I have heard her beat it. but have not seen it, and I have frequently told her that I considered kind treatment would go further than such harsh beating to such a little girl—I have heard her beat her five or</p>

               <p>six times prior to 21st Dec., and on one occasion I spoke to her, and she said that she was very stubborn, and very dirty, and would not do by fair means—the child appeared a pretty behaved and a well spoken child—she died on Friday, 21st Dec.; and about a week before that, I was in my room, which is on the first floor, over theirs, and heard the child crying dreadfully, and I heard as if her head was being knocked on the wainscoting—I heard her distinctly say, "Oh, mother, I will be a good girl!"—that was between 9 and 10 o'clock in the day, and I believe the father was out—I told the mother a day or two afterwards that she really made my flesh creep, to hear the child cry, and to hear its head knocked against the wainscoting—she said that it was her little brother who knocked her head—the little brother will be five years old in March—there were several knocks, and they must have been violent for me to have heard them so distinctly—I can almost be positive that the father was out, but one morning before that) the children were both walking up and down the passage crying dreadfully, and I took the little girl by the hand and said to the father, who was in the shop, "Father, let this little girl come to the fire, she will be good now"—he took her kindly, and the little boy was then turned into the wash house by the mother—that was the only time I knew the father to be present—I did not see the mother beat the child, but I heard her; she slapped it—that was in the parlour—there is a communication between the parlour and the shop both ways—on Friday morning, 21st Deo, about 12 o'clock, I was in the wash house, and the prisoners were in the back room—the father brought me a pan which belonged to me, and said, "I thought we should have lost the little girl in the night"—I said, "What a pity you did not call me"—he said, "I wanted to call you, but my wife would not let me"—I asked how the child was—he said, "We have not looked at her this morning"—I had not seen either of the prisoners that morning till the male prisoner came with the pan—the wife was not present then—(they were in the habit of getting up between 11 and 12 o'clock)—I then heard a knocking at their parlour window, which looks into the wash house, but saw no one—that was when he was there, and he then went and opened the parlour shutters, which open from the outside—I saw his wife beckoning, and I went into the parlour after him, and saw the little girl lying on two pillows which were on two chairs, right opposite the fireplace—there was not a bit of fire in the grate, and there could not have been any for many hours—the child had on a man's old flannel shirt, but I could not see of what length, as it had some dark covering over it, which I think was old moreen curtains, and they appeared to be doubled over the child, but her chest and arms were quite naked—it was very severe weather—by the side of the child's head lay a pool of wet blood and matter, or blood and water, as large as my hand—I did not see where it was coming from, and thought she had been sick—I said, "Dear me, this is enough to kill the child to be laid in this cold place, right in the draught of the fireplace"—the father said, "We left a fire when we went to bed, and we thought it would be the warmest place," and that they had put it in a warm bath over night—I took hold of it's hand and said, "The child is quite dead"—I told the father that he ought to have called in a medical man—I then went up stairs to give my husband his dinner—I had been there a minute or two when the husband came up, and said, "Mrs. Sands, if you have got a kettle of water, we will put the child in another warm bath, as I think she is still alive"—I got some water, made it hot, took it down to them, and the mother put it into a pan, and put the child into it, but it had no effect on it—the husband went for Dr. Challis—the</p>

               <p>prisoners slept in the same room as the child—there was a bed and bedstead in which they slept, and the baby slept with them—there was no other bed in the room, and I do not know where the little boy slept—they had fund<lb></lb>ture of their own, and the shop was very prettily stocked—I do not think they had sufficient food, and I am sure the children bad not at all times—I never saw them at their meals—I do not know whether this child took its meals with them.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. M. D. I reside at Bermondsey. On Friday morn<lb></lb>ing, 21st Dec., just after 12 o'clock, I was at my dispensary, in Crucifix-lane, the male prisoner came and said that he wished me to see a chad of his that was very ill; he said that he thought it was suffering from cold—I asked him how long it had been ill—he said, the night before—I told him to place it in a hot bath, and I would come in a few minutes—it is about 200 yards from my house—I went in about ten minutes, and found the child in a pan of water; it was dead, and from the temperature of we room my impression is, that it had been dead more than an hour; the hands were getting cold, and the features set—I examined the body; for being informed that it was very ill, I was surprised to find it dead—it was rather emaciated, but not excessively so—I saw a bruise on it's head, several on it's forehead, and about two table spoonsfhll of bloody serum on the pillow, oozing, appa<lb></lb>rently, from the child's ear; that quantity would make a considerable stain on the pillow—the prisoners were both in the room—I said, "There has been an oozing of blood and matter from the ear"—the female said that the child was accustomed to pick her ears a great deal—it had come from the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070112"></xptr>
               <p>internal part of the ear; there was no sore behind the ear—I asked how the bruise came over the left eye, on which the male prisoner asked the female if the child had not had a fall from the bed; she replied that it had, and my impression is, that she said that it was the night before, and by the swelling I judged that it might have been—I did not notice other bruises so minutely then; I discovered them more particularly afterwards—that bruise might have been from a blow or a fall—the child was quite naked—I lifted it out of the pan, and placed it on a chair—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exa<lb></lb>mination three or four days afterwards—the external appearance was rather emaciated, but not more than many children of that age are—there was a bruise on the left leg, and one on the forehead—there were six or seven dis<lb></lb>tinct bruises—there was another violent bruise over the right eye, not the one to which my attention had been called—that over the left eye was not severe in comparison with the other, but the integuments were completely darkened down to the bone—the brain was healthy, there were no marks of concussion—the chest was perfectly healthy, with the exception of a alight congestion of the lungs, which in all probability arose from cold—the in<lb></lb>ternal organs were, generally speaking, those of a healthy child—the stomach and intestines were healthy, and all the organs—there was no ap<lb></lb>pearance of any organic disease—there was about a table spoonful of a greenish fluid in the stomach; I did not expose it to the microscope, as I detected a husk of wheat, so that it appeared to be vegetable matter—I should say, from the appearance of the body, that the child had not had suf<lb></lb>ficient food—it must have suffered from the bruises—I do not think the bruises alone would have caused death, but looking at the condition of the body, that it was not extremely emaciated, the death could not have been occasioned from absolute want of food, neither from the slight congestion of the lungs, or from absolute exposure to cold; but I consider that injuries such as it must have received, upon a weakened frame, and that frame ex<lb></lb>posed to a very low temperature, such as the night of 20th Dec. was, those combined causes are quite sufficient to account for the child's death—the place where it was placed on the chairs was the coldest part of the room, close to a large old fashioned fireplace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You believe that the cold that may have been experienced by that child in the night, supervening on a weakened constitution, caused the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was no other cause—I should imagine that the blow just above the forehead, on the right side, although it was not trans<lb></lb>ferred to the brain to show any permanent result, yet it must have nearly stunned the child, as in a child in that condition the vitality is very slight, and I believe that it was by those injuries made more liable to succumb, more likely to be killed by cold; life would be half knocked out of it, and it would be pretty much the same with respect to food—if it had been well fed, it would have been less likely to be affected by cold, but probably the in<lb></lb>juries would have had a worse effect on it if it had been well fed—the prisoners seemed poor—there were marks of poverty, but not of extreme distress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have told us that the bloody serum proceeded from the interior of the ear; are not children frequently in the habit of picking their ears and causing a flow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and there is then an ex<lb></lb>udation of bloody serum from the interior of the ear—I am quite unable to say whether the bruises were occasioned by a blow or a fall, but children do not generally pitch head foremost, without protecting themselves with their hands—there was nothing like congestion of the brain—my impres<lb></lb>sion is, that not one of these causes singly was the proximate cause of death,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070113"></xptr>
               <p>but it was the combined causes—I do not think the stomach being in a healthy state would negative the impression that the child had been starved—in cages of children who have died from starvation, the stomach is un usually red, from the gastric juice feeding upon it, but that was not the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CAARTEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the picking of the ear; would you expect to find two table spoonsful! of matter from it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw so much—a blow on the head, or the side of the ear, would be very likely to cause a swelling inside, which would occasion a discharge—I mean a blow struck, or a blow received by a fall—any injury to the head would be likely to cause it—an injury such as I saw would.</p>

               <p>heard, and the reason of my examining his children, and that my opinion was, that they were suffering from want of sufficient food—he said that he was a poor man and was out of work, and the children fared as he and his wife did; that they had animal food once or twice a week, and in the intervals lived chiefly on bread and butter—I told him he should provide more food for his children—he said that he could not afford more, and I directed him to apply to the workhouse for relief—he told me that he would, but on my next visit, on the following day, I found he had not, and asked him why; he replied that he thought he should be asked too many questions—I immediately went home, being early in the morning, and wrote to the relieving officer, stating the case, and he came down and brought food with him for the family—they only received food that once—he subsequently told me that he had been down, and had been examined by the parish authorities, who questioned him about his mother; that they wished him to write to his mother, who lived at Chatham or Rochester, who was very well off; keeping a bookseller's shop, I think it was in Chat<lb></lb>ham—he said that he would write to her, and would not receive relief from them, for he had no doubt that his mother would supply him with what was necessary for his family, and he afterwards called on me with a letter which he said that he had received from his mother that morning, and that she promised to supply them with whatever they needed—I saw the outside of the letter, but not the contents—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I have heard the evidence of Dr. Challis, and my opinion is, that the shock of the blow on the head, to have produced such effects, must have produced concussion of the brain for a time, and that the concussion, after a few hours, would leave no trace behind it; the effects would be entirely evanescent, and I think that the shock to a system already reduced by in<lb></lb>sufficient food rendered it so far susceptible to the influence of cold, that the cold would produce death.</p>

Q.</hi> You saw that the whole family were in a very reduced state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and they were very poor—I know that the male prisoner went to the union—I am not aware that they told him that he should have nothing out of the house, but that if he liked to come there with his family he might—he did not tell me so—it may have been so—I believe that this night in Dec. was the very coldest we have had this winter.</p>

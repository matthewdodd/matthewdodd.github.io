                  </hi>. I am a chair-maker, and live in New Montague-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner has worked for me. On the 30th of July, he said a private customer wanted a set of chairs—I trusted the pri<lb></lb>soner with one—he returned, and said the person wanted to see the arm-chairs—I let him take one—he came back, and said he had sold the set for five guineas, and wanted to know when they would be ready—I told him—he came at the time appointed to take them—he said he would take them himself—I said I would not trust him with them—he went away with the understanding to bring back my two chairs—I saw no more of him till I took him.</p>

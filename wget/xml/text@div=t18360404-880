On the 20th of March, I was at the Benbow public-house, in Golden-lane—when went in, it was near upon twenty minutes after twelve o'clock at night—I called for a point of beerit waa served, and I paid for it—I drank it at the side of the counter, by the bar—the prisoners William and Richard Absolam stood at the side of the bar toge<lb></lb>ther—they were drinking—William Absolam had a pint pot in his hand, and asked me to drink—I told him no, I had got beer of my own—he asked if I would let him drink out of my pot—I told him no, and told him to keep his own company and I would keep my own—he asked me if he might drink out of my pot—I did not choose to make acquaintance in that way—no sooner had I spoken, than William pushed me down, and fell on the top of me—he pout his knees into my belly, and the other, which was Richard, fell on the top of me as well—I had not spoken to him—one of them kicked me in the side, which it was I can't say—and then they ran one of their hands into my left-hand breeches pocket—cried, "Murder," and a police-officer came up and took them off me—he took William and Richard off me—I did not see Bishop while this was going on—as soon as I got up, I told them I was robbed of my money, 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was four half-crowns, nine shillings, and one sixpence—I missed my money—it had been in a little fustian purse, in my left-hand breeches pocket—no money was found there—there was the same pocket as the hand had been introduced into—I had my money in my hand. and my hand in my pocket, before I paid for the beer—I paid three-halfpence out of it for my beer—the Absolams saw me pay for the beer—they stood before me at the time—I had received 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that night from my master. Henry Dodd—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver before I received that—I had laid no more out—only three-halfpence—my master gives me a ticket every night for a pot of beer, and I only laid out the three-halfpence—I was quite sober—I had not done work till nearly half-past nine o'clock, and I went over opposite master's yard, and had the pot of beer, and stopped there till nearly ten minutes before twelve o'clock-two of us drank three pints of beer—that included the three-halfpenny-worth—I dare say I drank half the three pints, but I did not drink half the pint which I paid for before I was pushed down—when I paid for the three-halfpenny-worth of beer my money was safe—there was another person pressing upon me, when I was pushed down, but I can't swear to more than two—there was more than two or three persons had me down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Benbow public-house, Golden-lane—I was barman there. On the 20th of March, the prosecutor came to the public-house from twenty minutes to half-past twelve o'clock—we shut up about half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night—he asked for a pint of beer—I served him with the porter—I saw the prisoner, Wm. Absolam—he asked Prior whether he would drink—Prior said he had beer of his own—then William Absolam said, "Will you give us a drop of yours?'—it was not said jeeringly at all—Prior said, "No, keep your own company"—he did not say that very sharply—then William Absolam pushed him down with his two hands violently, as if in resentment, not in play at all, but angrily, and Richard rolled on the top of him—he had not spoken to him—he fell right down on the top of him with force, so as to keep him down—the hands of both were directed towards the prosecutor's pocket; and when he got up, he said, "I have lost my money"—that was when the police<lb></lb>man had taken the prisoner off to the station-house&amp;—; directly he rose from the ground he said, "I have lost my money."</p>

               <p>I live in Upper-street, Islington, facing the church: on Tuesday, the 29th of December, in the evening, I was at <placeName id="t17900113-15-crimeloc78">Canonbury-place</placeName>

I told him I had; he then said, d - n your eyes, you b - r go along; and he let go of my hat; I run towards home, about thirty yards, as fast as I could; the moon shone very bright; and I turned round to look at them, to see which way they went; they turned to the left, from the way I was coming; and they made over the bridge, towards the Thatched-house, in the Lower-street, which is a bad swampy way, in this weather; I ran into Cross-street, thinking to meet them; I came round, and in Thatched-house-row I met them both again; there was nobody in the street to call to for assistance; there was nobody but a poor old woman just behind them; I stopped and looked at them both full in the face; I was quite close to them; one of them (but which I cannot say) said as they passed me, d - n my eyes, that is the b - r we have done; they then crossed the road, and ran down the Elder walk; I never saw the prisoner again, till he was taken, which was last Tuesday night (January the 12th) I was sitting at home with my family, about seven, or a quarter after; when this witness, Browne, came to my house, and produced two cutlasses and a pistol, and laid them down, and said, how do you do; do you know these? I took up the cutlasses, and said, I did not know them; I took up the pistol, and saw the notch, and told him if I was dying, that was the pistol that was held to my breast the night I was robbed; I went to the Mitre with the patrol, and there I saw the prisoner: I was very much flurried at seeing the pistol again: I walked into the room; there might be fourteen or fifteen people in the room; there were some that I knew, and a many strangers; I pointed to the prisoner, and said, how do you do, young man? he said, he did not know me; I told him, I knew him perfectly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130025"></xptr>well; I then told these people, that he was the man that pulled the hat over my face, and held the cutlass to my head, while I was robbed; I saw no more of him till I went to Bow-street, the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. Look now at the prisoner; at this time are you positive that that is the man who stopped you, who pulled the hat over your face, and held the cutlass to your head? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Have you the least sort of doubt about it? - Not the least in the world; I gave that description of him at the office the next day after the robbery.</p>
               <p>What description did you give of the prisoner, at Bow-street, the day after the robbery? - I told them he was a young man, of five feet eight inches high, rather slender made, with a round hat, and drab coloured coat, with a short tail; it was not a long coat; and that the other who held the pistol, I thought, was about five feet four inches high, he had on a round hat, and a drab coloured coat, and was a stout made man for his heighth.</p>
               <p>And can you swear that you had an opportunity of taking so much notice of the prisoner, as to be able to give that description of him? - Yes; for when he first came out I was as much as fourteen or fifteen yards from the trees; the tree stands about four or five yards from the posts; I took particular notice of him, for he came all the way with the cutlass in this manner (over his head) which made me take the more notice of him; and of his dress also: the moon shone as bright as it could shine: a very fine clear evening it was then: he advanced towards me as fast as he could walk; he did not make a run of it.</p>

               <p>But you had no further opportunity of making any observation of his person, after he had pulled the hat over your eyes, till the robbery was over; did you see his face after the robbery was over, when he told you to go away? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then the observation you made upon him was, as he advanced to you, and when you met him again at the Thatched house? - Yes; and it was so light that I could swear to the coat and waistcoat that he had on; the waistcoat is the same now; and I believe the coat is that in which he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Had you a full opportunity to observe them when you met them again? - Yes, I had a full opportunity.</p>
               <p>Had you mentioned any thing about the notch in the pistol to any body, before the pistol was produced? - I had mentioned it to two or three people that I knew, and particularly to a gentleman's servant, that lives with Mr. Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>When you went to the Mitre, on Tuesday last, was the prisoner pointed out to you by any body? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be as much at large as any of the other persons that were in the room? - Yes; I saw no difference; he was leaning against the dresser when I came in.</p>
               <p>He was not in irons, or any thing of that kind? - No; I saw no irons, or any thing else.</p>
               <p>How long were they robbing you? - A minute and a half, I believe, or two minutes; they were a considerable time robbing me, and keeping my hat down in that manner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was picked out, was not my hands tied with a handkerchief? - Not that I observed; I looked at their faces, and not at their hands.</p>

            , on duty as patrol: about seven in the evening, going betwixt Cross-street, Islington, and Canonbury-place, I saw the prisoner behind a large elm tree, and advancing towards him, I seized hold of him; there were two more behind the tree, close to him, near the footpath; at the same time I heard something fall; and the other two ran off; I cannot be positive who they fell from; I then delivered the prisoner to Mr. Whaley, and ran after the other two; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130026"></xptr>the night coming very dark, I could not see to overtake them; I returned to Whaley and Jennings, who were on the same spot; and I looked on the spot where I heard the cutlasses drop, and found them both lying there; I picked up nothing else but the two cutlasses; the prisoner was brought to a lamp, and searching him, I found this pistol in his coat pocket, Jennings and Whaley being present.</p>
               <p>Was it loaded? - No; the prisoner was taken to the Mitre, in Islington, to be further searched; I was sitting down at the Mitre when Hodgson came, for I was not well.</p>
               <p>Did any body point out the prisoner to Hodgson, at the Mitre? - No, I am sure of that; there might be fifteen or twenty people in the room; Hodgson picked out the prisoner directly; Hodgson had seen the pistols and the cutlasses before we went to the Mitre; his shop was in the way to the Mitre: he observed there was a notch in the stock of the pistol; and said that was the pistol that was held to his breast; and I believe he said his right breast.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I swear positively to this being the pistol that was put to my breast, the night I was robbed: I took notice of this notch or mark: the moon was on the left side of me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the pistol loaded? - I could not see.</p>
               <p>Browne. It was the tree highest to the footpath, on the left hand, on the road to Canonbury; and the prosecutor shewed me the tree, which was the same tree he came from, when he was apprehended.</p>

The prisoner came and had a glass of porter in the parlour, which he paid for. There is a large cupboard in the parlour, with a quantity of glass in it. My servant was going along the passage, and gave an alarm. I went and missed some glasses, and ran after him, calling Stop Thief! and from under each arm, he pulled out a glass, and threw them down. He was pursued and taken in Shepherd's-fields, and a boy brought me four glasses. The cupboard door was not locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Did you see him come in - A. No; but I saw him go out, and pursued him. I might not have looked in the cupboard for six months.</p>

He asked for the newspaper and had it; and in about twenty minutes I saw him go out of the parlour with the glasses under his arm. I called my master, and followed him, and saw him throw two glasses down against the wall.</p>

He was taken to the watch-house and in the evening I took him some bread and cheese. He told me he took six glasses, that he threw two down, and four in a ditch. He only had a halfpenny on him. I have learned that he was in great distress.</p>

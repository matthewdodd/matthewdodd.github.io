            . The prisoner came into my shop and asked to see some camlets; we differed about the price, and he did not buy any. I was at first much engaged with some customers, and afterwards removed to the back part of the shop, where the prisoner was, and then the prisoner was in the act of taking up his wrapper, which he had laid on the Compter, and was about to put it under his arm; I thought I saw something concealed under the wrapper; I jumped over the Compter, and said, what are you going to do with these things? He answered, Lord bless me, Sir, what things? I missed some sattins off the compter that I had shewn to a lady that afternoon: he said, he had nothing belonging to me; I opened his wrapper and found these sattins (producing them) in it and a coat.</p>

               <p>I had nothing but the coat and wrapper under my arm; the prosecutor collared me, and said, you dog, I will knock your brains out: and tore my cloaths he found nothing upon me; when he searched me I was very drunk.</p>
               <p>Hunt. I believe he was as sober as I am. I did tear his coat and waistcoat in endeavouring to find out my goods, as we were surrounded by, I believe twenty people, I was afraid of a rescue.</p>

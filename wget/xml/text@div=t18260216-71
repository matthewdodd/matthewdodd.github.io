On the 15th of January I went to the canal, about one o'clock - I saw the prisoner, who was a porter in our employ, in Mr. Snell's warehouse - he saw me, and stooped down behind some crates of earthenware; I went up to him, and asked what he wanted there - he said he was to watch - I told him he could not, and as he was going away, I saw something out of his coat-pocket, and asked what it was - he said, "A bottle;" I said I would see what sort of a bottle it was - he went to go on, and I took hold of his coat - he threw his arms back, and left his coat in my hands; he then ran towards the gate - I ran after him, turned the key, and called the watch, and then went through the house to get an officer;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160050"></xptr>as I was coming out, I heard a noise as if the gates were opening; I saw them opened - the prisoner ran out, and went down Macclesfield-street - I pursued him, and took him into the King's Arms, as I could not get an officer; I returned in about an hour and a half to get the jacket - it appeared in the same state as when I left it - it was taken by the officer in my presence - and several brass-cocks were found in it; we found on the prisoner three brasscocks - one was in his breeches, near his knees.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prisoner appear tipsy? A. Yes - and said at the watch-house, that Harrison had taken these things, and had given him some to take back - and he told me if I would promise he should be forgiven, he would tell me of a long string of robberies. Harrison ran away afterwards, but I believe he has now made his appearance - he is not here, nor is the watchman.</p>

            . I was in the employ of Mr. Snell. On the 17th of January I saw the prisoner taken by Mr. Hunt - he threw back his arms, and left his coat in Mr. Hunt's hands - when Mr. Hunt went through the house, he told me to keep the prisoner, but he opened the great gates, and got out - I saw him hold up his fist to Mr. Hunt, and appear as if he was going to knock him down; he had been in Mr. Snell's employ, and so had Harrison - but I had not seen him that day.</p>

I happened to be going up the City-road, and Harrison (who had been in the warehouse) - one of the porters, and a boatman, were drinking gin; they called me in to have some porter, which I did - I then went to a public-house - the watchman stood at the gate, and asked me what they had better do - I said, if the cocks were re-placed, it would be better - and they asked me if I would take them - I being in liquor, took them, and that moment I was taken by Mr. Hunt; I had no notion of stealing them.</p>

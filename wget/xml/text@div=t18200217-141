            . I was in the house when the prosecutor was robbed. I went out for a necessary purpose, Roach was outside the house; he said the two men had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170052"></xptr>watch, and he would have it from them. Welch was afterwards given in charge for stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell this story - A. Not till nine days after. I told Welch's servant of it, and she told his brother. After Welch was taken to the watch-house the prisoner and I walked home together. He took the watch out of his pocket, shewed it to me, and said it was the watch he took from the two men - I made no answer. He went to the bar for some tobacco while the prosecutor was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Welch here - A. No. I lodged with him nine months ago. I was in the house when he was charged with stealing it, but said nothing for nine days after.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say to Welch's servant,</p>
               <p>"If your master is questioned about it I will say Roach did it" - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never said a word of the kind. I understood I was charged with stealing it, and went to the office, where I saw Welch's brother, and told him to send for an officer.</p>

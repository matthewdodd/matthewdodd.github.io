Row, Tickleborough, per Reeve, Blue Boar"—I gave this book to the porter, and directed him to take it to the Blue Boar and get the book signed—this paper bag which is before me I believe is one that the tea was sent in—this bag was made by me—the tea was sent in bags made by me, and of a similar description to this.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor; the prisoner lodged at my house; she said she was going to a lawyer, and desired me to lend her some cloaths. While we were going out of the room, I saw her take a handkerchief from a round tea-table, and put it into her pocket. She and I, and her husband, went all out together: as I had lent her other things, I thought she might take the handkerchief by mistake, so I did not mention it to her; but as we were going along, I asked her to lend me a handkerchief: she said she had ne'er a one. I said, yes, you have one you took from the table, and put in your pocket. She d - d her eyes, and said she had ne'er a one. When I came home, I told her husband of it; he desired me to make myself easy, saying, it would be a great detriment to him, was it known. After that, I was obliged to get the things I lent her from pawn, she had pawned them; after that, I not prosecuting her, she came to my house, and called for a pint of beer, she being fuddled, I would not let her have any; but somebody drew her a pint, she drank some of it, I went and took the rest away; then she swore I was a bitter b - h, and she would prosecute me for concealing a felony; then on the Monday, I went and got a warrant for stealing the handkerchief, upon which she was taken up.</p>

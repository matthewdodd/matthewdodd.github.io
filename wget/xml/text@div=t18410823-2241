                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable A</hi> 146.) On Saturday afternoon, the 7th of August, I saw the two prisoners, in company with two others, near Westminster-Bridge—there was a rowing-match—I saw them walk<lb></lb>ing at the back of different people, up and down the bridge—after watch<lb></lb>ing them some minutes, I saw one, not in custody, put his hand over, and take something from a gentleman's breast, which was immediately handed to Hughes, who was standing on the other side of the way—Brown was covering the man who took the pin—Hughes put something into his pocket—I immediately went over to him, took hold of his arm, and took this pin from his trowsers' pocket—the same pocket he had put the pin into—he had not got his hand out—at the same time another officer came up—I gave Hughes to him, and took Brown—I am sure he was covering the other man—my brother constable and I went to the spot where the pin was stolen from—I held it up, and asked what gentleman in the crowd had lost a pin—one gentleman turned round, and said, "This is my pro<lb></lb>perty, drawn from my breast"—there were the marks of the pin in his stock—we asked him to accompany us to the station, but in going we missed him, or he missed us—we have heard nothing of him since.</p>

               <p>and two others walking behind the persons who were looking through the balustrades—I saw Jackson cross and take Hughes, and take the pin from the lining of his pocket—I took him, and heard the gentleman say it was his pin—I had seen the prisoners in company before this.</p>

            . On the 3d of August I was in the Worcester stage-coach, going from London; just on this side <placeName id="t17621208-4-crimeloc22">Shepherd's-bush</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was it moon-light or dark?</p>
               <p>M. Brook. It was a moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>
               <p>M. Brook. He had a blue great coat on; he put his pistol into the coach, and said, give me your money directly - make haste, and do not let me use worse means; he was a middle-size man, with his hair tied behind, and dark eyes; I cannot tell directly how much money I gave him, I know it was more than 10 shillings; it was loose, not in a purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come on that side you sat on, or the other?</p>
               <p>M. Brook. He came on the opposite side to me; there were three passengers in the coach besides me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe the colour of his horse?</p>
               <p>M. Brook. It was a dark colour'd horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar; do you know him?</p>
               <p>M. Brook. I cannot positively sware that is the man; he had a very small white hand.</p>

We told him, it was about a horse left in Tyburn-road. He made answer, No, I suppose it is for robbing the Worcester stage, or Worcester machine, I suppose. We searched him, and found a little key he had in his pocket. He had lodged there some little time. Then we went up and searched his box; there was nothing there. The next morning we went and searched the box again, and found a purse with three bullets in it.</p>

            . On Tuesday night, the 3d of August, a quarter after 12 at night, a gentleman came on horseback into the inn yard, at the George in Tyburn-road, as I was driving my coach into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Cockerton. I am a hackney coachman. The Gentleman desired I would take his horse in, he stood just behind my hind wheel; he said he would give me a shilling, if I would take him in. I said I could in no wise do it. He still desired I would. So I did take him in. He dismounted by the coach side, and turned his horse loose into the yard, and flung this great coat upon the door of my coach, and went away. I never saw his face. (The coat produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse warm, as if he had been rode hard, or not?</p>
               <p>Cockerton. I did not feel of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was he?</p>
               <p>Cockerton. He was a brown horse with a switch tail. He was there till the Monday following, when Mr. Pettifer took him away. He is master of the yard; I drive for him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The man is here that owns him. I acknowledge myself to be the man that put up the horse there. Pray. Friend, had I not a silver laced hat on, and a silver laced coat.</p>
               <p>Cockerton. I can say nothing to that; I never looked at the man; he flung his coat on the coach door, and away he went.</p>

               <p>My case is something hard and singular. I have laid in prison 20 weeks. Last sessions I was admitted to bail, and my father being a clergyman and desiring I should not come to an ignominious death, thought proper to keep me here till he can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080007"></xptr> send me to sea. [He was continued in gaol for a debt.] I lay some time in New Prison for all the coachmen that had been robbed to look at me, and was marched up to the Blakeney's head by Mr. Fielding, backwards and forwards, with thousands of people to look at me. My father is worth 500 l. a year. I have lately had above a 100 guineas of him. I was at Stanmore with a young woman that I courted at that time, I did not chuse to subpoena her, as my friends did not chuse I should have her. I met a Gentleman at Marybone that night; I asked him what time it was? he said about 4 minutes before 4 o'clock. I came through the turnpike, and missed my road, and came into Oxford-road again, and put my horse up. I made no resistance to my box being searched. My character has been very much scandalized on this unhappy affair. The attorney came with my prosecutrix to New Prison, and got out of me all he could, and then pointed me out to the woman, and Justice Fielding's people took 6 d. a piece for showing of me, as I walked up and down Bow-street. I had a Commission which was taken away, and I have nothing now to trust to, but my seamanship. Please to call Mr. Allen.</p>

            . I live in Princes-street, Red-lion-square.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Allen. I am a brushmaker. I have known the prisoner a great while; I never saw any thing by him, but that of an honest just young man; I have received money divers times from his father for him.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether Cavinhaugh has not gone by, and said, There lives a highwayman?</p>
               <p>Allen. Yes, he has, and he has said, The brushmaker is as bad as he.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This man can prove, my father is worth above 500 l. a year, and I have had a great deal of money of him; I had no need to go upon the highway.</p>

            . I live at the Blue Lion, Gray's Inn passage. I have known the prisoner but a very little time. He has come with another customer of mine; he always behaved extremely well. He was at my house about two nights as a lodger; but I cannot recollect the nights; it was about 3 or 4 days before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Thacker. It may be 6 weeks or 2 months.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether I spent my money extravagantly?</p>
               <p>Thacker. I can't say he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, and live at No. 5, Tinley-court, Old-street. Last Monday fortnight, about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I went into the Merry Carpenters, in Old-street, and saw the prisoner there, whom I had known when I used to work at the cowkeeper's, in White-yard, Whitecross-street—he did not live there, but he lived in the same yard, and used to knock me about with a stick twice or three times a day—that was five or six years ago, when I was not able to take my own part—I have grown since then; I am now between twenty-three and twenty-four years old, and am bigger and stronger—I said to him, "Are not you the man who used to knock me about with an ash stick, when I used to work at the cowkeeper's?"—he said, "I will do it again"—I then went outside, and finding that he was quite as inclined to fight as I was, I pulled off my coat, to fight—we set to directly, and had two rounds, and at the second round we both went to the ground, and I felt him run some instrument into my arm, just below my shoulder; it cut through my shirt, and my flannel shirt—I said, "He has broken my arm"—there were a goodish many people round; I do not know whether I got up, or was picked up, as I was senseless with pain—I was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and examined by a sur<lb></lb>geon—I still feel the wound, and my arm is in a sling by the surgeon's directions—I was in the hospital a fortnight last Monday, and am an out patient now—I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I five at No. 10, York-court, Hall-street, Finsbury. I and Joshua Dale were standing at the corner of the court, and saw the prisoner pass into the public house; Joshua Dale followed him, and said, "Are not you the man that used to <hi rend="italic">whack</hi> me with an ash stick?"—the prisoner said, "Yes;" and Dale challenged him out to fight—the prisoner spoke to some friend of his, and then got up, put his hands in his pockets, and said, "God strike me dead, I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> do it;" his friend said, "Do not be such a fool as to do it," and he said it again—they fought, and both fell—when Dale got up he said, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, I have <hi rend="italic">broke</hi> my arm"—I did not notice that the prisoner was in liquor; he walked out well enough into the road; he did not fall from being drunk.</p>

Yes; my son, William Bedford, is my partner: On the 29th of March, I was sitting in the accompting-house; there is a glazed partition between the warehouse and the accompting-house; and, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a man go past the door, and Hayman, my porter, who has absconded, go hastily, and speak to him for a short time; then the prisoner came in, and put a sheet, or wrapper, which he had under his arm, upon the corner of the counter; and Hayman came hastily to about the middle of the warehouse, and caught up two pieces of calico from a pile; then he came a little further, and took another piece; he doubled them all together, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280087"></xptr>gave them to the prisoner, who helped to put them in the wrapper, and went out, taking them with him; I pursued him; and, before he got to Cheapside, I got sight of him; he turned towards St. Paul's; I followed him, for he was walking gently, and took him by the arm, saying, where are you going; he said, to the New Inn, in the Old Bailey; I asked him where he got those goods; he said, he got them from a person in a street near; I told him they were my property, and he must go back with me, which he did; and, when I got back, I found my warehouse open, and Hayman gone; I asked the prisoner who he was, and where he lived; he said he was a jobbing-porter; a ticketporter came by, who knew him, and said he believed he lived with Mr. Mawson, which he did; I examined the property, and found it to be three pieces of printed calico, consisting of twenty-four yards each piece; there is our private mark, and they cost us more than nine pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not know the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your servants knew your accompting-house had that commanding view? - A. I don't think Hayman knew I was there; the light is such, that two or three people might be sitting in the accompting-house, without the people in the warehouse seeing them.</p>
               <p>Q. It was by invitation from Hayman, your servant, that the prisoner came into the shop? - A. Yes, I should imagine it must be from what he said to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in, every thing that was done was by your servant, who has absconded? -- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner being a porter to Mr. Mawson, it was nothing uncommon for him to have a wrapper? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you first he was a jobbing-porter, and you have found out that he had been but very little time in that service? - A. Yes, and he came back directly, and gave up the property; he said he was going to the New Inn, where, he supposed, somebody would be to take them from him; I asked him who; he said he did not know; perhaps it might be my porter.</p>

The prisoner lodged there - my mother and I occupy two rooms; my room was in front. I went down to my ship at Blackwall about eleven o'clock in the forenoon of the 15th of September, and left my trowsers in my room - there was 10 s., in the pocket. I cannot say whether it was in shillings or not. I returned home about six o'clock, and the trowsers were gone - I have never seen them since; the prisoner was at home when I returned, and in about aquarter of an hour afterwards my mother asked me if I had been at home before; I said No, - she replied,</p>

            . I live in the same house, on the second floor. Between three and four o'clock on that day I thought I heard a knock at the street door; I went down but saw no person there; I staid a few minutes, and heard something falling backwards - I went backwards and saw the shelf which had held the garden pots at Baxter's window, had fallen down, and the prisoner was putting it up again - the window was open; a person could get in by the assistance of the water butt. I did not see him with anything at that time - I asked him how it came to fall - he said he did not know.</p>

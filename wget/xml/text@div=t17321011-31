I look'd betwixt their Heads. Says the Prisoner to me, 'Tis a very hand on Burying. I wonder whether 'tis a Maid or a Batchelor. Those are fine Srutcheous ; do but look, Madam! I look'd as long as I car'd for, and then turning about to go away, I perceived that the Prisoner, with his Hands behind him, had got hold of my Pocket. He had a Penknife in his Hand, and my Pocket was cut; and with his Fingers in the Slit, he was pulling out my Snuff-box. I actually saw him take it. You Rogue, says I, you have got my Box! Damn your Eyes, you Bitch, says he, speak such another Word, and I'll sacrifice you? I took hold of his Arm; he struck me several Times on the Stomach. I still held him. He threw something over my Head, and said, Damn you, you Bitch, there's your Box, Some of the People cry'd, that's none of it. I look'd, and saw it still in his Hand. It was the Penknife that he threw away, for it self in a Puddle, and a little Girl pick'd it up. Then he let the Box fall,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173210110017"></xptr> and twisting himself about, he got from me, and ran cross the Way into a Court; telling the People he was pursu'd by the Bailiff's, and begging them to hide him. He was taken and carry'd into Mr. Cave's, the Constable's House; I follow'd, and sitting down at a Table opposite to him, he begun to use better Language. It was not Bitch now, but Madam; Madam, says he, I beg you would not take my Life away.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any Body else hear him say these Words?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Collet. I question whether they did or no, for when he said so, he leaned over the Table, and whisper'd to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you first took hold of me, and looked in my Face, did you not say, that you was mistaken, and I was the wrong Person?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Collet. No, I said no such thing. I charged you with it, and you damned my Eyes for a Bitch.</p>

            . As I was standing at the Nag's-Head Gate, to see a Funeral that was coming from Bromley; the Prisoner pass'd by me, and said, it's a very fine Burying, if you do but view it well. Mrs. Collet was standing against an Oyl-Shop, and he went and stood close before her. I saw him put his Left-hand into his Pocket, and take out this Clasp-pen-knife, and look on it thus; and then he put his Hands behind him. Mrs. Collet presently took hold of his Arm, and said, he had got her Snuff-Box. Damn your Eyes, you Bitch, says he, speak such a Word again, and I'll make a Sacrifice of you. Then he threw away the Knife; it fell in a Puddle of Water, and a Girl took it up. The People said, that's not the Box, and with that he threw the Box down, and as Mrs. Collet was stooping to take it up, he got from her, and went a-cross the Way, into a Court that had no Thorow-fare, and there he was stopt. I follow'd and heard him say to Mrs. Collet, You do it to take my Life away; but pray, Madam, don't say that I am the Man, for I live in repute.</p>

            . As the Prisoner stood before Mrs. Collet, I saw her fly at him, and catch hold of his Collar; he threw the Knife over her into a Puddle of Water 2 or 3 Yards off, and a Girl took it up. Mrs. Collet stoop'd to take up her Box, and he sprung away from her, and got into Elephant and Castle-Alley, which being no thorow-fare, he was taken and carry'd into Mr. Cave's House.</p>

Being seiz'd in such a manner, it put me into such a fright, that I occasion to ease my self, upon which I went over the Way into a Yard, and ask'd a Woman, who was standing there with a Child in her Arms, if she knew of any necessary House thereabouts? Before she had answer'd me, the Prosecutor, and a Mob with her, came up and seiz'd me; and they said, I belong'd to the Bailiffs, and they would make me kiss the Shitten Brick-bat in Harrow-Alley.</p>

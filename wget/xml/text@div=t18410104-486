On Monday, the 14th of December, I missed a silver spoon, and asked if she knew where it was—she said she did not know—next morning, when I came down stairs, I found she had gone away without the least notice—the spoon now produced is mine, and the one I missed.</p>

                  </hi>. From information I received I went to James-street, Kensington, and found the prisoner there—I said I felt almost convinced that she must have taken the spoon and other property from the house—she denied every kind of knowledge of it a dozen times—ultimately I said, "Can you tell me where this spoon, or any other part of the property, is?"—after considerable hesitation she said the spoon was in a pawnbroker's shop in King's-road—I said it was rather a long street, but she gave me no other information.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He said if I would tell him where it was be would go im<lb></lb>mediately, and get it, and would be very sorry to hurt my character; he would sooner give me a present; he said he would not do it for the world, and being a gentleman, I expected to take his word, not only about that, but many things he promised roe before, in his house. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not say so—I certainly said I had much rather have a candid confession, and signs of reformation, than punish, but I held out no promise.</p>

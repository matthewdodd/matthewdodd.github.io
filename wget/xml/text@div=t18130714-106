            . I am a Bow-street officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 16th of June, near twelve at night; he was in company with another. I knew the other very well. I first saw them at the corner of <placeName id="t18130714-106-crimeloc612">Bow-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130714-106-crimeloc612" type="placeName" value="Bow-street"></interp>

They then both followed two gentlemen into <placeName id="t18130714-106-crimeloc613">Bridges-street, opposite of Drury-lane</placeName>

They both returned back to Bow-street again. I saw them both attempting there to pick pockets. They left there, and went under the Piazza's; two gentlemen came from the play-house door into King-street; I saw the prisoner try at a pocket once or twice before he got the handkerchief out, and as they were walking along I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out in <placeName id="t18130714-106-crimeloc614">King-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130714-106-crimeloc614" type="placeName" value="King-street"></interp>

I called out to the gentleman, and told him that he had lost his handkerchief; he said, yes, I have. I told him I was an officer of Bow-street. He said he would attend in the morning; he never did attend. The gentlemen were both strangers to me. As soon as I apprehended the prisoner his companion took to his heels, took a handkerchief out of his hat, and threw it away. I have both the handkerchiefs. This is the handkerchief the prisoner took; I think it is worth five shillings; the other handkerchief is worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down King-street; a strange boy was walking by the side of me; as soon as I was laid hold of he threw something away, what it was I do not know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

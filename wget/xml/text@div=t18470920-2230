                  </hi> I live in High-street, Borough, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. About eleven o'clock, on the 1st of Sept., I went to bed—I fastened up my premises—the shop-door was bolted and locked—about one o'clock I was awoke by the door-bell ringing—I dressed, went down, and found two constable with the prisoner in custody—I looked round my pre<lb></lb>mises with one of them, and found the first floor back-room window open—there is a court by the side of the house—the window goes out on the leads—the shop extends beyond the house—there is a skylight with leads, and whoever got into the house must have climbed up the water-spout, got on the leads, and then lifted up the back-room window—that could have been done—I found foot-marks on the leads, as if a person had had nails in his boots—it was a scraping on the leads—I had a very large stock—nothing was taken—a pair of steps had been placed against the shop-door at night—I found them two yards from the door, placed against the shutter-box—the window had been shut quite down, but not fastened—I saw the officer pick up a dark lantern in the shop—it was not on my premises before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policemen, M</hi> 246.) On this night I was passing along the Borough, and tried Mr. Gilpin's door to see if it was safe—it opened, and the prisoner rushed out of the shop into the street, and turned to the right toward Union-street—I ran after him—I saw him stopped just as he turned Union-street—I am quite sure the man that was stopped was the man I was in pur<lb></lb>suit of, and I am quite sure the prisoner is the man who came out of the house—I produced a black bag, which I got from Apthorp.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> I am clerk to an attorney, and live in Prince's-road, Ken<lb></lb>nington-cross. About one o'clock on the night in question. I was going along the Borough, and heard a rattle spring—I saw the prisoner running, pursued by the policeman—I did not stop him, but I saw him secured, and am sure he is the man—when he came up to me I stepped off the path, and attempted to stop him, but seeing his arm raised, I had an idea that he had a weapon—I stepped off the path, intending to attack him sideways—he struck at me, and I at him—he passed me, turned the corner, then turned with his face to the wall, and walked back again, as if going towards St. George's church—I did not lose sight of him, and am certain he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

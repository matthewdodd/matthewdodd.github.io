            </rs> The Prosecutor pretended, that going out of Town the 7th. of September, 1692. he returned the next day, which was sooner than he expected, and then found the said N. S. in his House, who told him, he came there by Order of the said J. B. That the Prosecutor missed at the same time several Spirits, which he believed the said N. S. had taken away, but could not say positively that he did. Whereas it appeared to the Court, that the said Losvelt being indebted to the said J. B. and others in a great Sum of Money, he gave them a Bill of Sale of all his Stills, Spirits, Malt, Molossoes, and all other things belonging to the Stilling Trade about the House. And the said N. S. was put in by the said J. B. and Partners, to keep Possession for them by the consent of the said Losvelt, and was in Possession a great while. And the Bill of Sale being read, and the Partner, in whose Name the Bill of Sale was made, owning that the said N. S. was put in by his Order, it appeared to the Court to be a most villanous and malicious Prosecution, whereupon they were <rs id="t16991011-20-verdict106" type="verdictDescription">

               acquitted
            </rs>. But the Prosecutor and his Sollicitor were kept in Court till the Court rose, and then being severely reprimanded by the Court, the Court ordered that the said Losvelt's Sollicitor should never more come into that Court. And the Court ordered that the said J. B. should have a Copy of the Indictment, in order to Prosecute the said Losvelt for his Damages.</p>

I had the prisoner taken before my Lord Mayor: upon his examination he fully acknowledged that he and his partner went into my field, killed a weather sheep there, and carried away the mutton; he mentioned who his partner was. In consequence of that we went and searched that man's house; there we found great part of another side of a sheep, a leg, shoulder and neck tied up in a basket, and hid under the bed; the prisoner said he had put the sack into a pond; we searched the pond but could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the confession you speak of made by him in consequence of any promise of favour?</p>

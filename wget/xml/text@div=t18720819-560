                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Prince of Wales public-house, Engine Street, Piccadilly—previous to Saturday, 6th July, the prisoner lodged there almost three months—he was employed by Mr. East, of Curzon</p>

               <p>Street—on 6th July he owed a bill of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in payment of that bill he gave me what I supposed was a sovereign—this is the coin, it was brighter than it is now—I detected it, and saw that it was not a sovereign—I gave it to my mistress—she said she felt herself justified in giving him into custody—on the Monday previous the prisoner owed a bill, and gave me what I thought was a sovereign—I gave him change—I placed the coin on the mantel-shelf, behind the door, with the other gold—there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some of that was in half-sovereigns—my mistress found it the next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He lodged in the house some three or four months—I know his father by sight—I don't know his connections at all; he has always paid his bills regularly at the end of the week without any difficulty—I don't test gold always when I take it—I did not think of his giving us a bad sovereign—I generally jink gold down on the counter—I could not have done it on the 6th July—I did not do it—the sovereign passed on the Monday was found out by my mistress the day after—the prisoner was in the house several times between the time the first Hanover medal was passed and the second—no communication was made to him—I don't re<lb></lb>member that he ordered a glass of whiskey on the second occasion—I took the second medal to my mistress at once—she said he was a good-for-nothing fellow; and she felt herself justified in giving him in charge for imposing upon her in that way; and she sent for the police—I had no means of knowing that the prisoner had passed the first one until I found out the second—he said he would take it to the place where he came from and get it changed—Mr. East is a job-master in Curzon Street—he did not have an opportunity of going there—he was detained until the constable came.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Prince of Wales—I put all the gold into the cash-box at night—on Tuesday, 2nd July, I had occasion to go to the cash-box to give change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I found a Hanover medal, and called my barmaid's attention to it—I can't say which of these two it was I found—on 6th July the prisoner was in front of the bar—he asked me for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of whiskey; some one called for something else and I ordered my barmaid to serve him, he gave her one of these pieces of money and she passed it to me—I said "You good-for-nothing fellow," or "bad man, how dare you come to take advantage of me; you have passed one before"—he said "If you will give it back to me I will go to my father and take it where I got it from"—I said I should be justified in locking him up—he lodged with me three months—I gave the medals to the constable.</p>

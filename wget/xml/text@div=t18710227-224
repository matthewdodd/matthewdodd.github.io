                  </hi>. I live at 4, Honeysuckle Square, Milton Street, and am a cabinet-maker—on Saturday, 28th January, about 10.45, I saw the prisoner and another man come through the square—the prisoner asked me if I knew a man of the name of Alick, who worked at Simmons'—' I told him I knew no one at Simmons', and I waited to see what they did—directly after he spoke to me he turned round, pushed the door open and went into Simmons'—he brought out two reams of paper, put them on a barrow, and wheeled them away—the barrow was just round the corner, under the arch, in Honeysuckle Square—I made a communication to a constable and he stopped the prisoner.</p>

They said it was to go to Old Street, City Road. I went to Mr. Wells' for the barrow, and the barrow being outside I took it. The men brought out the two bundles and put them on the barrow, and I was going up Bunhill Row with them when the constable stopped me.</p>

I have a room on the second-floor in Mr. Abbott's house; he does not live in it - it is let out in tenements. On the 11th of October I locked my room, and left it about five o'clock in the evening, and went into it again about nine o'clock, to drink tea with Hall. I left nobody in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. It was daylight when you left your room - A. Yes. I left my trunk in the room, also a kitten; between seven and eight o'clock the kitten came up stairs. I then came down, and found my room-door open, and a false key in the door, which I could not get out - it was dark. I missed my trunk, containing the articles stated in the indictment, and 3 l. or 4 l. in copper and silver - there were five or six half-crowns. I have recovered my trunk, a hat, two or three bags, a pair of gaiters, and a key. I did not know the prisoner.</p>

            . I am eleven years of age; I know the prosecutor's lodgings. On Tuesday night, the 12th of October, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw six men standing by my mother's shutters, opposite the prosecutor's - Nightingale was one, and the prisoner another; I do not know the others. The prisoner came up to me and said,</p>
               <p>"Come, come! where is my staff?" I knew him before - they crossed over; the lamplighter came by. The prisoner said to Nightgale and another one,</p>
               <p>"Now is the time." They went and looked in at the prosecutor's street-door, which was open, and then went into the corner. I was looking at the others a little while, and then saw Nightingale lift something on his shoulder - they were between the two doors.</p>
               <p>Q. What two doors - A. The prosecutor's door and the next house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he lift on his shoulder - A. It was like a post, only thicker - I thought it was something for a bonfire; it was like a trunk, about a yard long. I followed them to the alley; he went down the alley with it on his shoulder, and whistled. The prisoner and four others went with him - the others went round the street, and all met together in the alley. Next day I saw the prisoner coming out of the

            . I am an officer. I went with Franks and the boy, who pointed the prisoner out - several of them were playing at cards; the prisoner was looking at them. I took him to the office, then searched him, and found five half-crowns and 12 s. in silver, on him - he said he had saved it up by working overtime at winding quills. I believe the other five persons have been out of the way ever since - they were not in the house with him. I took the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Drury-lane; I am single. I was in Drury-lane about a quarter before one o'clock on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 5th Sept.—there was a man and woman quarrelling—I stopped to look—there were a great many persons looking—the prisoners were there; I knew them before—while I was looking, they both rushed on me, and began beating me with great violence on the head and face—I saw something in Fitzgerald's hand; I could not see whether it was a knife or scissors—she beat me with that on the head and face—a gentleman and Margaret Barrett dragged me away—a great deal of blood came from my head and face—I had not given either of the prisoners any provocation—I had had a few words with Fitzgerald a few nights before, but I thought it was all over—I felt Riley beating me on the head with a key—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there a month.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Taylor, and saw the prisoners there—they rushed upon Taylor, and beat her most shamefully—Fitzgerald was digging something into her head, and I saw the blood coming out of her head; Riley had a key in her hand, and was beating her at the back of her head with it—I and a gentleman pulled Taylor away, she was covered with blood—she had not given the prisoners any provocation that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at King's College Hospital; Taylor was brought there on the morning of the 5th Sept., with her clothes covered with blood; she had a deep wound on her cheek, and two long thin cuts on the forehead, made with some sharp instrument, I suspect with a knife, and the other with a blunt instrument—she was for some time in danger of her life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald's Defence</hi>. She was coming along with a young man; I crossed over; there were two women fighting: Taylor struck me; I had no weapon in my hand whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Riley's Defence</hi>. This woman said a few words to this girl about the man that she lives with, and she said she would have her revenge; the prose<lb></lb>cutrix then struck her in her face, and they began to fight—I went up, and the prosecutrix bit my thumb, and tore my hair; we had no keys at all; I had no intention of striking anybody, but it was the provocation.</p>

I suppose at that time he put the Wig into his Breeches. He soon came back and stood talking in the Shop about a Quarter of an Hour, and then went away. I mist<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173210110003"></xptr> the Wig in a few Minutes after it was gone, and went directly to Middle-Row in Holbour, and at the 3d Wig-shop I came to I found it. Mr. Horn who keeps that Shop had it in his Hand when I came in, and he said it was not 5 Minutes since he bought it.</p>
               <p>- Horn. I bought the Wig of the Prisoner on the 11th of September, towards the Evening; he said, he had it to sell for a Gentleman's Servant. He ask'd a Guinea and a half, I bid him 25 s. and a Shilling for himself; he said he would have half a Pint of Winethen, and so we agreed. I did not mistrust him, because I had known him a pretty while. He gets his Bread by making up Wigs, and I have bought a great many of him, and took him to be a very honest Man. So that when Mr. Major's Man came in and said the Wig was stolen, you must needs think I was very much surpriz'd, and wonder'd how the Devil came to put it into the Prisoner's Head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, at Richmond; the prisoner was in my employ, as a labourer, for six or seven months. On 30th April I went to my workshop a little after five o'clock—the prisoner was there—I sent him to the nail-warehouse, to clean a pair of boots for me—I went there shortly afterwards, and saw the prisoner at the nail-shelves—I passed through into the yard, called him, and asked what he was doing at the nail-shelves—I do not remember that he said anything, but I took hold of his jacket, and found this parcel of nails under his jacket—here is my writing on it—the prisoner had no authority to take them—I gave him into custody.</p>

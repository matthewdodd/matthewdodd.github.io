                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). My Lord,—In my defence, I humbly beg permission to state the cause of my now standing before this tribunal charged with so serious a crime. It is in consequence of the unjust treatment I have received on board of the <hi rend="italic">Justitia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">York</hi> hulks. From the month of July,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270116"></xptr>
               <p>1847, being the month in which I was given over by the military into the hands of the civil power, at Maidstone, in the county of Kent, until the month of June, 1851, I received punishment three times, as follows: in the month of February, 1849, I committed an offence upon shore; I was taken on board the ship; I never saw the governor or deputy-governor, but was put by the same warders that took me on board, into separate confinement, where I remained from Saturday morning until Monday morning, when I was brought upon deck. The grating was rigged in a private place; I was ordered to strip by the only two warders present, and by them I was tied up. After the space of ten minutes the governor and doctor came. The governor said, "Give him three dozen," which I received without any examination, or even so much as reading the report that was against me. That was the only punishment I received on board of the <hi rend="italic">Justitia</hi> in ten months; still the char<lb></lb>acter given is bad. I was removed along with a great number of prisoners to the <hi rend="italic">York,</hi> whither the same warder had been previously removed, for whom I was so unjustly punished, and whose hatred I soon felt again, not only from him but from others, whose mind he had prejudiced against me. The conse<lb></lb>quence was, I resolved I would be removed under any circumstances, rather than suffer such treatment. Shortly after, having received great provocation from a fellow-prisoner, I took the law in my own hand by resenting the insult. The consequence was, I was reported, and kept for the disposal of Captain Vowles, the superintendent; but by the time he came, there was an additional report against me, namely, outrageous and insubordinate conduct (that is, for shouting and making a noise while in separate confinement). I humbly beg leave to state here, that, let a report be ever so serious, or the punishment intended to be inflicted ever so severe, the warder is never put upon oath; so that let him say what he will, it is taken for truth. But to proceed;—when the superintendent came, the report was laid against me in the most exaggerated manner possible; but in consequence of a recommenda<lb></lb>tion previously given in favour of me, by a gentleman, to Captain Vowles, it was not his wish, he said, to remove me. I then laid before him the unjust punishment I had received, and the character given me on board the <hi rend="italic">Justitia.</hi> In answer to which, he replied, "The report made against you was sent to me, and I did not consider it necessary for any examination, I ordered the punishment you received." I then said I did not think it just to be judged, condemned, and punished without being permitted to defend myself. He then said it was not what I thought, but that it was he that was the best judge. I then begged that he would remove me away from the ship to separate confinement. I then stated my reasons more fully, upon which he said, "Upon those grounds I will remove you." I was removed to Penton<lb></lb>ville prison, as incorrigible. I remained there nine months and ten days without a report. At the end of that period I was sent back to the <hi rend="italic">York</hi> hulk, with a badge of distinction upon my arm. The moment I was on board, the governor, Captain Barrow, called me, along with three others, and addressing himself to us, said, "I do not think it right that you should have been sent back to this ship; but as I think it is a mistake, if you do not think you will be able to conduct yourself, or if you think any of the officers will take advantage of you, I will get you transferred to another ship, but, as you have regained your character, the past shall not be brought against you. And as you have done, or nearly so, your probation, I will send you that have done your time in the first free ticket ship that comes; and the others shall go as they finish their probation." True to his promise, he sent all away but me. In about a month after, he also promised me that he would send</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270117"></xptr>
               <p>my name up to the Home-office as soon as possible, which promise was made for eight successive months; during which time he sent letters to and from my friends, in which he saw how I built upon his promises. But I had some misgivings, which caused me to go to him and volunteer to go out of the country as a prisoner. But he positively refused me, saying, "No, I will not send you as a prisoner after the character I have received of you, but I will tell you what I will do, I will send you away with a free ticket the first opportunity." The principal warder being present, said he should not like to see me sent as a prisoner after doing so long a time, and giving such proofs of reformation; and begged I would leave it to the governor, and rely upon his promise; upon which I thanked him, and retired. But about five or six weeks previous to the ship coming, I made a complaint against one of the senior warders; it was committed to writing, and given to the deputy-governor, who was in charge. The substance was made known to the warder next morning by him. The governor being from home, it was three or four days before I was called upon to confirm my statement. The governor told me he would inquire into it, he did so, in the following manner: he asked the warder if he knew so-and-so, he also asked two prisoners of the guilty party if they had done so-and-so, which it was natural for them to deny; he then said he would bring it to the notice of the inspector; but the inspector came and went away, and there was nothing about the statement made by me. But, previous to his coming, there was a draft of prisoners to go abroad, among whom was one that I considered my chief witness; I went to Captain Barrow and told him, and begged he would take his evidence in writing before he went away; he took a note of it, and said he would see the man, but did not; though I had not been permitted to attempt to prove my statement, or any further inquiry being made, or my committing myself in any way. Captain Barrow, not with<lb></lb>standing all his promises, erased my name from among those that were to go abroad, and thus deprived me of my ticket of leave; neither was I made aware of it until the men were called up and told they were going. My name not being upon the list, I applied to see the governor, and reminded him of his promise, but he instantly denied having promised to send me in the first ship, and said that he could not send me on account of my being sent back to separate confinement eighteen months previous. I then said I thought I was unjustly dealt by, for I was the only one out of four that he refused, and one of those had been twice seat back, and still received his ticket; another, also, who was scarcely out of trouble, and had been flogged for attempting to escape, sent back to prison, and still was sent abroad six months before his probation expired. But he would not listen to anything I could say, but told me I could not go, this threw me into despair. In about an hour after I was required to go to chapel; this was upon Thursday night; when the warder asked me what I was in the service, I made no reply; he asked me again; I answered, a prisoner. He flew in a passion, and said, was that the way to speak to him. I made no reply. He asked me if I was going to chapel. I said no. He asked me if I had got leave to stay away. I said, no. He asked me if I would not obey his order. I answered, I wonder you are not afraid to put your head in a place of worship. He then locked me up, went and made his report. I was taken that same night before the governor (who seemed to be in a greater passion than myself). I asked him if I had not given him every proof that man could give of my wishing to do well. He answered, "Yes, you have." I asked why I was deprived of my liberty. He said, that was no reason for me to throw myself into trouble. He made several excuses, but there was no regard to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270118"></xptr>
               <p>truth or honour. He then said he thought I had been brought before Captain Vowles at his last visit. I had not. He then ordered me to be locked up in solitary, saying, he would see me in the morning. In the morning he came to me and told me that though he had prevented me from going in the first ship, he intended to send me in the next; but as I had thrown myself into trouble he would not dispose of me, but keep me for Captain Vowles; and that the complaint should also be brought before him. He then asked me the men's names I wished to call upon to confirm what I had stated. I told him the names. I asked him if he had took the evidence of James White, as he promised, but he did not answer. I asked if I should be allowed to hear what my witnesses said when called upon. He answered he was there to see justice done me, and that I should certainly hear them. After I had been in solitary about three weeks, Captain Vowles; came; I was brought before him. He said to me, "Before I proceed with the report that is against you, I will say a few words in regard to the complaint you have made; but I tell you, plainly, though you should be able to prove fully what you say, I shall not give you any credit for so doing, neither does my duty compel me to make any inquiry into it; yet I will, to satisfy you, go through the form" (a mock inquiry began). The governor, deputy-governor, chaplain, and Captain Vowles, himself, not only baffled me all they could, but put words in the warder's mouth. I was then ordered to my cell, while they took lunch. Upon being brought in again, the statement was laid aside, and the report made by the warder, without being put upon oath, received. Captain Vowles said, "Though I have so often advised you, and encouraged you with hopes, you have, because you were disappointed in going abroad, thrown yourself into trouble. And I now tell you, plainly, that had your name been sent to the Home-office, and I had seen it, I would have taken it off, for, as I have told you before, you show signs of insanity, and a person bordering upon insanity is not fit to be set at large; and now, for this one report alone, yes, for this one, I will send you to a penal settlement; but here is another, more serious, just brought against you, it is for making a false charge against your superior." I said, "I hope you have not condemned me without permitting me to call upon and hear those men give their evidence, whose names I gave to the governor, who promised that I should have every just opportunity of proving my statement." Captain Vowles replied, "It is not necessary that you should either see or hear what they said—take the prisoner away." With that I was removed to my cell, where I remained until the 19th of April, when I was conveyed to the Millbank Prison. About the beginning of June I applied to the visiting-inspector, Captain O'Brien, to have the sentence carried into effect, at the same time stating my reasons. The answer he gave me was, "Some people have strange fancies; I will register your wish. I cannot give you any answer." In a few days after I was brought before him for the purpose of inquiring into an offence I had committed; he referred to the books for my character, and finding that I was sent back twice as incor<lb></lb>rigible, he awarded punishment according, which was thirty-six lashes. In the month of August I applied to him again, and told him that I considered I had been most unjustly condemned, punished, and sent back, and I earnestly begged that he would permit me to relate to him the whole circum<lb></lb>stance, for I felt convinced he would see I was not deserving of the treatment and character given me; but he refused, saying, his duty was to investigate into my conduct while here, and not to inquire into anything previous. I again begged that he would send me to a penal colony the first opportunity, or at least give me some hope of a removal. This he also denied me. I then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270119"></xptr>
               <p>said, if he refused me in all my applications, and would not listen to reason, it would be better to be out of the world, and the only thing I could do was to force myself into a court of justice, in order to make known the kind of justice that was administered in the convict service. Thus all application to the authorities to obtain justice or hearing failing, drove me to desperation. And now, after being in confinement from the 25th of September, 1846, undergoing the greatest suffering, I am, through the treatment above described, sunk deeper into misery and crime. I humbly beg, my Lord, you will condescend to consider the above. Throwing myself upon the mercy of the Court, I earnestly implore that mercy may be extended to me.</p>

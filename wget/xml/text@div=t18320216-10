               <p>Q. Was he the only person who came out of the cart? A. I cannot say whether two or one came, for I was nearly blind with the blood; I am sure he is the person who took my purse and money - I felt his hand in my pocket; he was taken in less than half an hour - I ran for a constable; he struck me with his fist - I was struck by somebody with a whip, but not by him - it was one of the people who came out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull off your coat? A. I left my coat in his hand, and thought to run away from him, but could not - it was not to defend myself against him that I pulled it off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you told exactly the facts, as you stated them at the last Session? A. I think so; this happened in the high-road - nobody passed till it was over; the prisoner walked on before the cart to Uxbridge as quick as possible - my comrade never lost sight of him; he ran into Uxbridge, and we ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he ran after he got up to the cart? A. Yes; I am sure of it, for we were up with the cart, and he was a good bit before us - the cart kept going on; Donoghue said his oranges were 1d. each, upon which the prisoner took two - he offered to pay for one; he said he would give 1d. for the three - Donoghue said he must have 1d. for each; we did not say after he had taken them that we must have 3d. a piece for them - I did not demand 3d.; Donoghue demanded 3d. for the three.</p>
               <p>Q. After he got into the cart, was there not a few words between him and your companion? A. I cannot tell, for I was a few yards before; I saw no knife in any body's hand - I did not draw a knife, for I had none; nobody had hold of me in the ditch but the prisoner - the prisoner held me, and I could not see, but there might be one or two others near me; I cannot say whether they were within reach of me - I am sure the prisoner had one hand on my neck, and the other in my pocket; I could see his hand in my pocket - the purse could not have fallen from my pocket; I have often been at the Chequers with Donoghue, and seen

            . I deal in oranges. I had been out with Diegnan; a cart came up to us about half a mile from Uxbridge; there were four men in it - there were words between the prisoner and me about some oranges; he struck Diegnan, and knocked him into the ditch - the prisoner was down on him in the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person who came from the cart at the ditch at the time? A. There was young Beach and Clarkson in the road - neither of them touched him; I saw them getting towards him. and I walked away - when the prisoner left Diegnan, he came along the road; he walked - he got into the cart when he got into town; he did not pass the cart till he got into the town; I and Diegnan also walked all the way from the ditch into the town - we did not run till we got into the town; Diegnan complained of being robbed of 10s. 3d. when he overtook me in the road - I had only walked on a few yards; I did not stand by him - we were then more than a quarter of a mile from town; I did not see Diegnan with his coat off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see a knife drawn? A. No, nor did I see the prosecutor strike the prisoner; I demanded 3d. for all the oranges, not for one - he took two from me at first. and then one.</p>

            . I was in the cart with three others, Beach, Littleboy, and Clark; I am not in any business - it was Beach's cart - two Irishmen were going along with oranges; the prisoner asked the price of them - Littleboy got out; he took one orange, and got into the cart again; he got out again, and I cannot say whether he took one or two oranges - he struck Diegnan several times, and knocked him into a ditch; he was not on him in the ditch, and I do not think any body was within reach of him to be able to pick his pocket; I do not think the prisoner was near enough - he complained of having had his pocket picked; we were about a quarter of a mile from Uxbridge - the prisoner walked there, and so did the witnesses; I did not see the prosecutor's coat off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor or witness demand 3d. for the first orange? A. I do not know - there was a regular fight between the prisoner and prosecutor;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160009"></xptr>I heard the prisoner say before they fought, "You demanded 1d. for the orange, now you want 3d."

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor and witness were coming along; he pulled off his coat, waistcoat, and hat, and challenged me to fight - I got out of the cart; they both pitched into me - I knocked Diegnan down, and then the other; they insulted me, or I should not have thought of hitting them at all.</p>

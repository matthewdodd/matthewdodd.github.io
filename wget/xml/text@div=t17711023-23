He immediately ran down, naked as he was, and brought her back, and found the loaves in apron.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am wife to Leppenwell. I went to his master's shop for a couple of loaves; I had some loaves, but I was not out of the shop. He was indebted to my husband thirteen shillings. My first husband's name was John Hall; after he died I married Leppenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you owe this Leppenwell two weeks wages?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No; he was paid every Saturday. He lost a great quantity of bread the Saturday before, and therefore I did not pay him; I paid him the preceding Saturday. She is not the wife of Leppenwell.</p>

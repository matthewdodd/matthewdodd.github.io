               <p>5 o'clock in the evening—I was watching in a position where I could com<lb></lb>mand a view of the sorting office, but could not be seen myself—the prisoner was in the office sorting letters—he commenced sorting about twenty minutes past 5 at the dividing table, and whilst so doing I saw him examine several letters with his fingers, evidently to ascertain whether they contained coin—the letters that he so examined he placed in a particular place on the table with other letters—when he had finished sorting, he took the letters that he had so placed there, to the north-eastern division—he then sat down on his seat at the north-eastern division, and looked the letters through that he had just placed on the table, and while doing so I saw him take two or three letters from that parcel, and place them on his right hand side, close to his body, on the table—after he had finished looking them through, he shoved those letters that were in front of him further up the table—he then took his pocket handkerchief from his left breast pocket, and appeared to use it to his nose—he then shook his handkerchief out, and dropped it down on the letters that laid on his right hand side—he then crumpled his handkerchief up, and placed it in his right side coat pocket, and the letters were gone too, with the handkerchief—he dropped the handkerchief intentionally—he dropped it down, and his band went with it—Mr. Gardner was with me at that time—the prisoner then rose from his seat and went and collected another handful of letters, which he took and placed on the same table—he then went to another part of the office, where I lost sight of him—shortly after that I went into the comptroller's room, and saw the prisoner there, in the presence of Mr. Gardner—he handed me three letters which I produce—this is the handker<lb></lb>chief that I spoke of (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was handed to me at the same time by Mr. Gardner—I searched the prisoner, and found in his pocket 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more on searching his lodgings—I took him into custody, at the time the letters were given me—Mr. Gardner first came to me about twenty minutes to 6, just at the time the prisoner left the sorting table, and went to the north-eastern road—he was with me at the time the handker<lb></lb>chief was dropped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks in the general Post-office—On 24th March, I had some instructions with regard to the prisoner, and I watched him—he was in the sorting office—I went there for the purpose of watching him—when I first saw him, he was looking through some letters at the north-eastern division—he is a letter carrier and sorter—his duties on this evening were to assist in what we term the general sorting in the first instance; that consists of sorting into the ten districts for London—he would go to the dividing table for the purpose of sorting, and having got his letters for a par<lb></lb>ticular district, he would take them to the north-eastern table for the purpose of arranging—first of all the letters for the north-eastern district would be all put together on the sorting or dividing table—when the letters from the north-eastern district have been separated and placed on the sorting table, the prisoner's duty is to collect them and take them to the north-eastern division table—he would then look through all the letters that had been sorted up at the north-eastern division, for the purpose of seeing that they were all for that district, to see if they had been correctly sorted—then his next duty was to have them tied up and placed in a bag for the district—I do not know that he would have to tie them up himself—they would he tied up—if he found any mis-sorts and letters which ought to have gone to another district, among the north-eastern, his duty would be to put them to their proper districts, or to hand them to some other person for that purpose—the prisoner was at the north-eastern table when I first saw him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020032"></xptr>
               <p>with the letters—he had letters before him—I saw him take his pocket handkerchief from his left hand breast pocket—he appeared to use it to his nose, shook it out, and dropped it over two or three letters lying just at his right hand side—those two or three letters were lying apart from the other letters—he dropped the handkerchief over purposely; that, was apparent—he then crumpled the letters up in the handkerchief, and put them into his right side, coat pocket—when he took the handkerchief up, the letters were gone—I afterwards went round into the sorting office and met the prisoner there—that was about a couple of minutes after I had seen him put the letters into his coat pocket—I took him into the comptroller's room, and said, "You have some letters in your pocket"—he made no answer—he moved his hand towards his right side coat pocket—I at once inserted my hand into the pocket, took from it the pocket handkerchief, shook it on the desk, and from it fell the three letters produced—I said to the prisoner, "Why, here are three letters in your pocket, how did they get there?"—he said, "I don't know, I suppose they got there by accident"—I said, "Oh no, they did not get there by accident; I saw you take them up in your handkerchief, and place them there"—he made no reply—Smee the officer then came into the room—I gave him the three letters, and the pocket handkerchief—the letters have since been opened—at the time I shook them out of his handkerchief they were fastened—two were fastened with adhesive gum, and one with a wax seal—they were opened by myself in the presence of the Magistrate—after I had given Smee the letters, he left the room, and I told the prisoner that I was very sorry to see him in his present position; the more so, as the deputy comptroller had entertained a good opinion of him, and he might have got on; he must have known when committing depreda<lb></lb>tions of this kind that they would be eventually detected—the prisoner said, "This is the first time, sir"—I said, "Oh, no, it is no use telling me that, for I know better"—he did not say anything to that—one of the three letters is addressed to Mrs. A. Adams, 1, Langham-street, Langham-place, Regent-street, with the letter W. on it—that would go to the western district—when that letter was opened, it contained 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a penny postage stamp—another letter is addressed to a Mr. W. A. Nicholls, Aldine-charabers, Paternoster-row, E.C.; that is the eastern central district—that would have to go to a different table in the post-office, from the western or from the north-eastern—it would be sorted at a different division—that letter contained 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a penny postage stamp—the third letter is addressed to Mrs. Meyer, 10, Lacey's-lane, Bolton-lodge, off Merrion-street, Dublin; that contained 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—all the letters had been stamped with the stamp of the chief office—they are stamped as soon as they come in, and before they are sorted—it is the stamp of the evening of 24th March, showing that they came in that evening—it is the 6 o'clock stamp—that would be for the 6 o'clock delivery—6 o'clock had not arrived—they are collected at 5, and stamped at 6—they would have gone out for the 6 o'clock delivery, two of them, the one for Dublin would have gone away that evening.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence (written</hi>). "I take my trial for having in my possession three post letters while on duty at the General Post Office. I am led to believe I have broken the laws of my country by so doing: I shall endeavour to prove to your satisfaction I was performing my duty and nothing more. Among the many regulations and rules in the Poat Office the following is among the number: (<hi rend="italic">Rule</hi>) "It is the duty of all sorters and 'despatching officers' to prevent letters passing through the Post Office with out paying the proper fee; and they are requested to weigh all letters which are 'suspicious' and tax them accordingly." On the 24th day of March last I resumed duties at 4 P.M.; I was called upon by my superiors to 'despatch' the North Eastern Branch; I did so up to the 6 o'clock; there was a very large number of letters at this hour, the chief part of them were circulars, weighing about a quarter of an ounce; among them were those three letters in question, all of them missorts, and seemed to be over the weight. It was my duty as a despatching officer to turn those letters out and have them weighed and taxed accordingly. I did so, and placed them by my right hand with the intention of doing so when I had despatched. When I had what letters I had before me examined some one called out to clear the remainder of the North Eastern letters; I obeyed the call, and brought those three letters in question with me in case my assistant would tie them up with those that were examined, as there are very strict rules against sending down missorts, unexcusable missorts as these were. The duty was heavy, and in the impulse of the moment I put those letters in my pocket before several of the men, and they were quite visible from my pocket. I have done so before: carried letters in my pocket when my hands would be engaged by other articles; I was never told to the contrary. My superior officers have no doubt seen me many times, with others, carry letters to and fro in our Pockets. I was never informed in what precise manner we should carry letters; had I been informed I should not have broken the regulation. You perceive I am tried for breaking a law which did not exist. The letters were in no way tampered with: if plunder was my object I should not have placed them in a pocket quite visible to a passer by, and before so many."</p>

            I am a hair dresser, I live at No. 2, Vine street; the prisoner lodged in the same room with me, there were three beds in the room; about half after two o'clock in the morning on Sunday July 17, I heard somebody come up stairs and the door open; the prisoner rolled against the bedstead, I asked who are you, he said it is Day; he proceeded towards the window with a bundle in his hand, he drew the curtain of one side, I then could see; the handkerchief in his land appeared to have something tied up in it; I asked him what made him there at so early an hour, he said he had been to the washerwoman's for his shirt, stockings, and handkerchiefs, and he should put them in the bed; he went down stairs, I did not see him afterwards till he was in confinement. On the Monday a young man that slept in the same bed produced the bundle from between the bedstead and the wall. I saw what was in the bundle, I advised him to put it where he found it; he did.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Day came past me between two and three o'clock on Sunday morning, he had something under his watch coat. I watched him to his lodgings, No. 2, Vine street.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At half past twelve o'clock, as I was returning to my box, that gentleman sat against Rose's door in Leather lane; I asked him where he was bound for, he replied that he lodged at the King of Prussia, and they were gone to bed; he asked me to let him sit in my box, he did, he sat in my box till two in the morning; I found myself dry, I went and had a drink of water, the weather being hot; I turned sick, I knew I had a quartern of gin at home; at half after two o'clock I went home and drank the gin, if I had not drank the gin I must have died; I came down and stood against the Griffin door, Hatton Wall. At half after three o'clock I roused that gentleman, he told me he lost his parcel out of the box. Where I lodge in Vine street the door is never fastened, and as for Heredit's, although he is a watchman, he has been to my box at different hours of the night. I have been in several engagements with lord Nelson, I was with him at the battle of Trafalgar. I leave it all to your mercy. I am innocent of the fact.</p>

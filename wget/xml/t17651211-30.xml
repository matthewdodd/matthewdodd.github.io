I was called up on the 17th a little before 7, and told my cellar window was broke open; I came down and found the bolt and staple were wrenched off; I found the tap-room door between that and the cellar broke open also; I found the tea chest removed from the dresser to the counter, where I serve my liquor, open, and the 5 spoons, strainer and tongs were taken out. My daughter looked round and missed several pair of stockings; I missed halfpence and farthings to the amount, I believe, of 3 or 4 l. but I can safely say there were 50 s. worth missing. I found two burners in the cellar which they had taken from some lamps. I advertised the things on the 18th, and the same evening Mr. Clark came to my house, and asked me what I had lost; I told him, and that the spoons were marked C, R, W. Said he I have got four of the spoons, and had not an opportunity of reading the paper in the morning as usual, so had not stopped the person that brought them, but should know the person if he saw her, and that he had been after her but could not find her, she not living at the place she had told him: he took her on the 20th, and brought her to me; it was the prisoner English. I asked her several questions; she answered me but few: I said tell me how I may come at these persons that have used me in this manner. At last she said he will come about noon to her house. Mr. Clark, Mr. Chapman the headborough, and I, waited the opportunity, and the prisoner, Pritchard, came much about that time; but I having English in my care, I was not at the taking him: he and Hughes were both brought together to me at the Black Horse in George-street, near my house. I asked them several questions; Pritchard told me he was in my house. I desired him to tell me where my tongs and strainer were; he said he could not tell, but

Hughes acknowledged he was in my house with Pritchard, but did not know where the things were sold; before the Justice, he asked them if they were in the house, Pritchard said yes.

The pewter tea pot and two pair of stockings were found at Pritchard's mother's lodgings, (where he also lodges) by my daughter.

I asked her if she knew Mrs. White's christian name, she said Rachel; I said, then you must know that they are Mrs. White's spoons; she said the could not read. I asked her how she came to know the C and W; she said she knew them two letters; then I took her to Mr. White, then she described Pritchard, and said that he was to come to her house about 12; we thought proper to watch till he came.

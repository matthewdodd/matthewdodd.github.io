At twelve o'clock at night, on the 17th of July, when my lodgers came home, I fastened all the doors of my house, and also fastened my own room door, and went to bed. I waked at four o'clock in the morning; it was then day-light. I found my room door open, and the door into the road open. My breeches were pulled from under my pillow, and lay in the middle of the floor. The key of the bureau was taken out of my pocket. I missed a purse from my bureau, with nineteen or twenty guineas in it; and from another drawer I lost about 8 l. By the advice of my neighbours, I lay still, and did not stir in it for a week. Janes and his wife continued still to lodge with me. They had gone out that morning before I waked; but that was not usual. They came home that night, and continued to lodge with me. Mason had been on liking to me, as my servant, about a week, and went away about a fortnight after the robbery. About ten days after, on the information of a person not present, I had Mason taken up. There was a petticoat and handkerchief found upon her, belonging to my sister. Upon her information, I had the two other prisoners taken up, but nothing was found upon them.</p>

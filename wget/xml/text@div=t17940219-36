             and another man came into my shop about five o'clock in the afternoon, on the 12th of February, I was in the shop at the time; the other man offered me a pair of stockings to sell, speckled worsted stockings; in the mean while I was examining the stockings, this

             got behind the other man towards the window, I saw him do that, I did not see him take the four pair of stockings, but the four pair of stockings were missed out of the window, and two pair of shoes, I heard a rattling with the shoes in the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing before they went out of the shop? - Immediately I thought he was stealing something, and I looked at the shoes, and I saw two pair of shoes in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Two pair in one pocket? - Yes, and I took hold of him, and took the two pair of shoes from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other man in the shop then? - Yes. I fetched him a slap of the face, and he pushed me against the door, and ran away; the man went away at the same time; I did not miss the stockings till after he was gone; I missed the stockings directly as he was gone out; I did not know where he was gone to. About two hours after there came another young man in, and I told him of it; about ten minutes after, this young man came in again and said, I believe the man is in the other clothes-shop; I went into Mr. Wright's, the other clothes shop down the street, I found him there; my husband and I went down to see, my husband was come home then; my husband asked me whether that was the man? I said, yes, I am sure it was the same man; we brought him up to our shop, and he said he never was in it; but he pulled out a pair of speckled stockings out of his pocket, which was the other stockings that the other man offered to sell, and a pair that was our own, a cotton pair, one that was missed from the window; the other three pair I don't know what became of them, he had not them about him. The things are here.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoner was taken in the other shop; as soon as he came into our shop he pulled out the two pair of stockings; I took hold of him in the other shop, and brought him back to my shop; he said at first that he had got no stockings, only a pair of worsted ones; when I brought him back he takes and pulls out a pair of worsted ones, and a pair of white cotton stockings that were mine.

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier at the Western District-Office—on the morning of 7th December, I was sorting newspapers and packets there—there were some letters being sorted at that time in a different part of the office—I was only sorting newspapers and packets; the prisoner was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186012170022"></xptr>
               <p>sorting at the same table—it was about five minutes past 10 in the morning—the prisoner was not next to me, but second on my right—there were three of us sorting at the table; myself, a man of the name of Thomas, on the Old Bond-street walk on my right, and the prisoner next to him on his right—the sorting was done on the table before us—there are on the table different boxes for the different walks—when we found a newspaper or packet for Wardour-street, we should throw it into the box where it was intended for, the Wardour-Street box—I saw the prisoner while he was sorting, pick up some newspapers and likewise a packet; after sorting the newspapers, when he came to the packet, instead of throwing it off into the box where it should have been thrown, he held it in his hand, balanced it, and shook it, and took particular notice of the address—I could see the address while it was in his hand—it was "Mr. Davis, 55, Wardour-street, Oxford-street, London"—the prisoner then picked up some more newspapers, and sorted them to the different places—the packet was still in his hand—after looking at it again, and handling it and so on, he threw it into the Wardour-street box, the place where it was intended for—I saw it put in, and I saw the address afterwards when it was in the box—I continued sorting newspapers a very short time after the prisoner had put the packet into the box—he had put something more into the box before I went away—I went and gathered up the letters, and commenced arranging them for my walk for delivery—I got them from another table—there was a sorting of letters going on at another table in the office at the same time—I should deliver the newspapers on my walk at the same time as the letters—my walk that morning was Regent-street—I do not know whether the prisoner had any walk that morning—when I had set up my letters, I came back to the table where the newspapers were sorted—the prisoner was still standing at the table when I came back—I looked in the Wardour-street box, where I had seen the prisoner put the packet; the packet was then in the box—I then went to my seat and commenced arranging my other letters for delivery—I did not go back to the table where the newspapers had been—I went to the letter-carrier's seat, where I expected to find the packets, or where I should have found them—at that time, the different packets and newspapers had been taken away from the newspaper table to the different letter-carriers—Hayes was the letter-carrier who had to deliver on the Wardour-street walk that morning—I went to the table where Hayes had his letters—he had some newspapers with his letters, and other packets for delivery at that time—this packet for the Wardour-street walk was not among his letters and newspapers—I called'his attention to the newspapers and letters he had for delivery, and he looked through them—after that I gave information to some other persons in the office—the prisoner was still there, but when I called Hayes's attention to his letters, I looked round the office, but could not see He prisoner—I saw him afterwards—information was given to the comptroller—I told him what I had seen—I mentioned that I had seen the address on the packet, when I was asked the question.</p>

               <p>sorting was over—I went and collected my letters up for my own walk and left the prisoner in the same place—he would throw the packet into the Wardour-street box, it would then have to be collected along with other letters and taken to the table for the Wardour-street carrier—I saw the packet safe in the box, and subsequently looked at the table of the carrier and missed it—about a quarter-of-an-hour elapsed from the time I saw it safe in the box and my missing it at the table—after that not a minute elapsed before I made a communication to Hayes—I should not think more than two or three minutes elapsed between the time of my making a com<lb></lb>munication to Hayes and the introducing of the prisoner to Mr. Tull in his room—I was inside the comptroller's room at the time the prisoner was called in—it would not be the prisoner's duty to go out of the room in which he was sorting, into any other room, while the duty was on—he might have gone out for a moment if he pleased—I was present when Mr. Toll made inquiry of him—he asked him if he knew anything about a missing packet, and he said, "No, nothing at all"—Mr. Tull then said the better way would be for him to empty his pockets; and on that the prisoner immediately did empty his pockets, and he exclaimed, "Why, there is something here"—he had on the same coat he has on now—it had a pocket to it inside (<hi rend="italic">pointing out its position</hi>)—I have no such pocket myself—some coats have and some have not; it is just as the men like when they have their coats made—I saw the pocket when it was turned out—it was a large pocket, and there was a small place torn at the mouth of it—when he turned the packet out of his pocket, and Mr. Tull asked him how he could account for it, he said, "For the life of me, I can't tell how it got there"—after the I boxes into which the letters are sorted are emptied, there are baskets provided for the purpose of collecting the letters from the sorting-boxes and taking them to the different tables—the usual way is for the letter-carriers to place the newspapers on their arm, and the letters on the top, and carry them in their arms in the best way they can; sometimes they may have large bundles to carry, and sometimes not so large, it all depends on the walk</p>

               <p>consequence of which I looked at the letters I had, and found no packet at all—in order to make sure, I went and looked in the box—I could not find any packet there, and I then went to the inspector and told him there was such a packet, and that it could not be found—one part of the office is used for sorting letters, and another for sorting papers—sometimes by accident letters will get amongst the papers—I got my letters from the usual place that morning—I took them myself from the Wardour-street box.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am superintending sorter at the western office—a communication was made to me by Hayes, on the morning of 7th December, in consequence of which I went straight to his box to satisfy myself that there was no packet in any corner of it—I then turned my eye round and missed the prisoner—I had placed him to do that duty, to see that nothing was left in the boxes; if there had been any it would have been it duty to take them round to the different letter carriers, to save their time and facilitate their duties—not finding the prisoner in the office, I went and looked for him in the letter carriers' department, and met him coming up the stairs from the kitchen, he was coming towards the office with his hat In his hand, as if about to leave—I asked him if he had seen a man named Tucker, merely as an excuse—he said, "No"—I then brought him into Mr. Tail's, the comptroller's office.</p>

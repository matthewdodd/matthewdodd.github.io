            . I live at No. 9. Charles-street, Hampstead road. I lived there when the affair happened.</p>
               <p>Q. You had your pocket picked I suppose. - A. Yes, it was on the 4th of July, I was coming from St. Ann's parish, across <placeName id="t18070916-64-crimeloc328">Fox-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking. - A. I had one pint of beer, no more.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be out so late at night. - A. I had been out upon business, and a friend of mine detained me some time. The prisoner at the bar accosted me; she spoke to me, or I to her, I am not certain; I believe she spoke first. We walked on together; when she told me she had been seduced by a gentleman who brought her from the country. We walked on a bit till we came to a yard, we walked down there, I there gave her a shilling, she saw me take the money out of my pocket, out of a small bit of newspaper. I put the remainder into my pocket and hearing a noise in the house, we stopped to hear what it was about, and during that time she took my money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You felt her hand in your pocket. - A. I did not. I never saw my money after I put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you miss it. - A. A very few minutes after; the watchman came up; and as soon as the watchman came up she said it was her uncle, and if he saw her with any body he would not speak to her again, and her aunt would turn her out of doors, and she a poor girl out of the country what could she do; she begged me to leave her; it was Hanover-yard we were in. I considered with myself what was the best to do; I was determined to go with her. I was for turning to the right hand, where I saw a watchman at the corner of Rathbone-place; she saw him as well as me, and refused to go. I immediately accused her of the crime; she said she knew nothing of it. I told her she had picked my pocket and insisted upon her returning it immediately, or I would give her into the charge of the watchman; she walked on about the midway to the box, at the corner of Rathbone-place, Tottenham-court-road, when a woman came towards her; she held her hand out towards her to give her something; I held her hand and would not let her. We were going on a little way farther, then she said she insisted upon going home; this I refused, and immediately called the watchman. The watchman came, and the sergeant of the night; when she saw them coming she dropt the two guineas behind her; the watchman was just soon enough to see her drop the two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them fall. - A. No. she stooped very low; the ground was dirty, you could not very well hear; the sergeant of the night picked it up; said he, it is two guineas. I said to the watchman it is my money. He asked her what property she had of mine; she gave up a shilling, two sixpences, and five pennyworth of halfpence from her hand; he then took her to the watchouse. There she denied any knowledge of the two guineas. The constable of the night told her to turn out her pockets, which she did; on her pockets being turned out there was a hazel nut, which I had in my pocket for a year and a half, and likewise the splinter of a pencil; the pencil had come undone in my pocket. The constable of the night asked me if it was mine, and when I turned out my pocket, I found the splinter that matched it, and likewise the pencil. This is the pencil, and the constable has the two remaining pieces; one that came out of my pocket and that which came out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you suppose that she throwed the two guineas away. - A. I had hold of her, because she should not make her escape, and I saw her stoop.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose. - A. I lost two guineas, a shilling, two sixpences, and five pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER M'DONALD. I am sergeant of the night in Marylebone. I saw her stoop down, and I picked up the two guineas.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The splinters of the pencil matches; I have no doubt of it being mine.</p>

            . Q. Did you search the prisoner. - A. Yes. I found six shillings in her pocket, a splinter of a pencil, and a large hazel nut. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked me would I take any thing, I said no; then he asked me if I would have something to eat. I declined his offer; he put his hand in his pocket and gave me a shilling and two sixpences and some halfpence, and some nuts came with it; I did not wish to accept the money, I was wishing him a good night; he stopped me, he said if I would go with him he would get a bed for him and me for half a crown or three shillings; he insisted upon my going with him. I would not he took very indecent liberty with me in the street, I begged him not to behave so rude to me; he made use of very improper expressions and asked me for what purpose did I think he gave me the money.</p>

I was at the public house about ten minutes or a quarter before six; I went to the back door to ease myself, coming round a dark passage I kicked this kettle before me, I looked round to see what it was, and it was this kettle; I took it up, and this gentleman came and apprehended me; I never was guilty of any crime in all my infancy.</p>

               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS sworn. - I found two coats at Mr. Sowerby's, in Brick-lane, I took them to the office, and they were delivered back to the young man that took them in pledge.</p>
               <p>- MARTIN sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker; I took in these two coats of the prisoner for 6s. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take such articles from a woman of the appearance of the prisoner? - A. She uses our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, upon your oath, that you thought she came honestly by them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Remember, you are upon your oath? - A. Yes, I really thought so.</p>
               <p>Crispin. These are my coats.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I live with the prosecutor's son; the old man turned me out of the house last Friday night, and I could not get a lodging, we did not agree at all.</p>
               <p>Crispin. She and I had had a great many words, she had affronted me several times, and I said she should not sleep there, and she shook hands with my son, and said, good by, I shall not see you any more.</p>
               <p>Crispin. I do not think the poor wretch intended to defraud me, I believe she meant to have restored them again. <rs id="t17980704-44-verdict211" type="verdictDescription">

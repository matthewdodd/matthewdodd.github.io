            . I live servant with the prosecutor. The prisoner was in our taphouse, and after he was gone I missed a silver pepper box out of our kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner go into the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Suredge. He did, sat down in a chair, and staid there about five or six minutes. I pursued after him, and took him about two rod from my master's door. I brought him back and charged him with taking it, he denied it; we sat him down on a bench in the taphouse, and found the pepper box behind him. Produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going home and met with a gentleman, who ordered me to be at the Dolphin Inn, Whitechapel (the prosecutor's house) about four o'clock in the afternoon. I called accordingly, and asked the landlady if such a man was in the house; she said she did not remember every one's name that came into her house. I staid there above half an hour, and it being a cold day she asked me to go to the fire in the kitchen. The gentleman not coming, I was obliged to go home. I said, if the gentleman should call, to tell him one Mr.

             was here waiting for him a long time. Then I went, and had not got a great way, before the drawer follow'd me, and charged me with taking a silver pepper box. I said, you may search me; then he took me back again, and he and another man searched me; many people were by at the time, they found nothing, and one said let him go, as you find nothing upon him. They pushed me about, and would not let me go; presently somebody in the house found a pepper box, and when I heard it was found, I desired them to let me go. They then said I put it there. I told them I was an embroiderer, I lived well, and never was guilty of such things.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know that she had that child - A. No; she hired herself to me as a single woman; she came to me on the 14th of February. At a late hour in the night on the 23rd of March, I had occasion to go into a room that nobody had any business to go into but me and the prisoner. On turning up the bed I found two papers of halfpence. They were my papers of halfpence, I can swear. They had both been opened. I had put five shillings in each paper, part of them had been taken out. I then went to my own bed room to see whether the money was right which was for the brewer, which had been sixteen pounds; there was exactly eleven pounds taken away, and five pounds left. I had no other woman servant in the house.</p>

            How lately before had you counted that money in the bed-room - A. Nine days before and no person had been up stairs that day but me and my husband. I sent for an officer, and than I questioned the prisoner. The officer searched her and found a key upon her that would open my bed-room door. The prisoner said that was the key that she got into my bed-room with and all that she took was three shillings and ten-pence halfpenny.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 23rd of March, I took charge of the prisoner. This is the key I found upon her; it opened her; mistress's bed-room door. She denied knowing any thing of the halfpence. In the room in which the prisoner slept, I found these halfpence.</p>

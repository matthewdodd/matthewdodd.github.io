                  </hi>. I am an inmate of the workhouse, at Barking. I knew Scruby, the deceased—he was about seventy-seven years old—he laid in the next bed to me, in the sick ward—I had been there about two months—the prisoner was nurse of the ward—on the morning the 30th of October, I remember the doctor coming into the ward, between eleven and twelve o'clock—scruby asked the doctor for some ointment, to anoint his head; which was granted—the prisoner was standing at the sink, near enough to hear it—a few minutes after the doctorwas gone, she said, "Scruby, I can't think what you want with ointment to rub your head, and make such a mess"—he said, "What is that to you? And in a short time she said, "Scruby, you must be a very bad man; you have led a bad life all your time, and you must be rotten"-Scruby said, "Don't call me rotten; not so rotten as you"—he was at that time sitting a chair, by the side of a table—the prisoner said, "D—you do you call me rotten? I will let you know whether I am rotten"—she ran to the chair where he sat; came on his right sie; and began to punch him, with both hands, round his necl, at the back of his neck; it was done with her open hands—she kept hittig him, to that degree, that he slipped out of the chair, and fell on the floor—she directly ran round his feet, as he laid on the floor; and she was down by the side of him, on her knees, hitting him—she kept hitting him, but in what part I could not see; but she was hitting him, while he was on the ground; and after that, she came round, towards me, by the fire-place—I put my arms round her, persuading her to be quiet, and let the man alone—I held her for a short time, and then let her loose; and she began to kick at him—he was on the ground still—I saw her kick him once on the legs, and on the foot—he being a tallish man, he kicked out, as he laid on his back, to prevent her coming near—after she had been kicking him, she went up to the sink, at the further end of the room. and did not remain there long—In the mean time, Scruby was put into the chair; but who put him in, I cannot say; and the came from the sink—Scruby was sitting on her right hand; and as she came from the sink—Scruby was sitting on her right hand; and as she passed him, she struck him with her right hand, on the top of his head, with her open hand—his head being bald, the blow seemed to make a</p>

               <p>report—It was like slapping with her hand—she went up to the fire-place, and said there a little time—he remained in the chair about a quarter of an hour after that, while we had our dinner; and while he sat in the chair, I saw his face bleeding—there was a mark on his chin, another on the nose, and several scratches on his cheek—the prisoner kept talking to him, and he to her, as well as he could—he did the best he could to abuse her; but his mouth was swollen; and she abused him—his countenance altered—an hour afterwards—the prisoner assisted a man to undress him—she offered to give him some gruel, between two and three o'clock in the in it—he died about five o'clock that afternoon.</p>

I told her I would not marry her, without she had a letter produced from Bristol, giving an account of it. There was a letter she produced, with the post mark upon it: so I married her, for the sake of doing well in the world, as all other people would. This letter was to let me know there was such a house there. and every thing as she had mentioned to me. I saw Nicholas Bedgood this morning alive and well.

            . I knew the prisoner a girl at Bristol; she was married, by report, to that Bedgood; but, after she was with child, there came an old woman and claimed him as her husband; she shewed her certificate to me, and I read it; and I really believe she was his lawful wife.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago, since you saw that woman.</p>
               <p>Brent. This is 8 years ago, I believe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Bedgood was married to that woman before I was born.</p>

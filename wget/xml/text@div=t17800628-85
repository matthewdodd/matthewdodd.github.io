               <p>On the 12th of June, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner come up Turnmill-street with two iron bars in a bag on his shoulder. Isaacs and Redgrave, two other constables were with me; we stopped him and asked where he got these bars? He said he found them near Smithfield, but could not tell directly the place. I secured him. He laid in gaol till the 15th when the magistrate sat at the Artillery Ground; he was then examined and committed for further examination; when we came to Bridewell in the evening, he desired Redgrave and I would call upon him in the morning; we did. He asked if we could be of any service to him? I said it was out of our power to promise him any thing whatever. He said, he had some more iron at home at his lodging in Long-lane, Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Did he say where he got the iron from? - He said some men and he got it from Newgate. We went to his lodging and found these other eight bars across the bedstead under the bolster and pillow of the bed where his wife lay.</p>

               <p>Seven of these bars belong to the transom windows, which give light into Newgate. I know them by the size and length, and the mark where they go through; two of the bars belong to the steps of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Do you know when these bars were taken from Newgate? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not see whether the bars were left standing after the rioters were there? - No; a great many were destroyed and a great many were standing.</p>
               <p>What was the value of these bars? - When they were new between two and three guineas.</p>
               <p>Were they put up at the expence of the City of London? - They were.</p>

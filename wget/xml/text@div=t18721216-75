                  </hi>. I am the superintendent of the Gaslight and Coke Company, at Beckton Station, Kent; that is their largest place of manufacture of gas—our Company supply the whole of the City and the greater portion of the West End—our power of storeage at Beckton is very limited, not more than a third of a day's make—it is quite necessary that the manufacture should go on continuously, night and day—for that pur<lb></lb>pose we employ about 500 workmen, and divide them into two gangs, the night and the day gang; that is in the retort houses alone, where the fires are attended to, and the gas made—the night gang goes on about 6 in the evening, and they work until about 5:30 the following morning—they are obliged to be on the premises during the whole of that time, the actual time they are at work is about five hours—the change from the night to the day gang takes place between 6 and 7; some go at 6 and some at 6.30, and some at 7, for different portions of the process—with some of the 500 workmen we had written contracts, signed contracts; the others were under a weekly engagement; an advertisement to that effect was posted up at the pay place, to give and take a week's notice—about 22nd November a matter was reported to me with reference to Dilley, who had been, and then was, a servant—I did not speak to him myself, but I gave directions for his discharge—nothing further was brought to my knowledge with reference to the matter until Monday, 2nd December—Collier, a foreman, came to me about 6.45 that morning, and in consequence of what he told me I went to one of the four retort houses on the works—I there saw the night and the day gangs—the night gang should have left the premises by 6 o'clock—before the gangs begin their work they usually change their clothing—none of the day gang that I could see had changed their clothing—I noticed Jones and Wilson standing close to me—I also noticed Webb there—I asked them what they wanted to see me about—they said they wanted to see me about Dilley's case—Webb was the first spokesman—I called for the day gang, because it was their duty to have gone to work—Jones said they were all there—I said "Why do you not go to work?"—Jones said "We have decided not to go to work until Dilley is reinstated"—Wilson spoke to the same effect, and Webb also—I told him as he belonged to the night gang it was not his business; he should have left the works, it was then past 7 o'clock, and I said "The time has now elapsed at which the whole of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187212160042"></xptr>
               <p>you should have gone to your work; the Company have always behaved liberally towards you, they have conceded all that you have asked from time to time, and I call upon all those of you who are well disposed towards them to go on with your work"—Jones said "Yes, ask them that"—not a man stirred or separated himself from the rest—I asked those who were well disposed to separate themselves from the rest—I said both to Jones and Wilson "Am I to understand that you refuse to go on with your work until Dilley is reinstated?"—they said "Yes"—they said Dilley's discharge and the Fulham matter had been put into one—I said I had nothing to do with the affairs at Fulham—this was said loud enough for the other workmen to hear—they made no sign, they all stood together—I told them that I should give them ten minutes for consideration—I left them, and went into the stokers lobby; I saw some men there; I spoke to one of them, a fireman, named Simmonds, and then went back to the body of men, and, in consequence of what Simmonds had said to me, I asked for Bunn and Ray, and put the same question to them: "Am I to understand that you refuse to go on with your work until Dilley is reinstated?"—they said "Yes"—I said "You know you are acting illegally, that you cannot leave your work; some of you are under a monthly agreement, and some under a weekly, and you must not leave your work without giving us proper notice; I will give you ten minutes more to consider of this, and then you will let me know the result"—Jones said "We may as well tell you at once, we have made up our minds"—I said "No; I will let you have the ten minutes for reflection"—I then went away, and in about ten minutes' time returned—Jones, Bunn, Ray, and Webb were there—I won't be sure as to Wilson—the gang were still there, but there were not so many men there—this took place outside the retort house—Jones said they were still of the same opinion—I said "Very, well, then, I will reinstate Dilley, but I reinstate him under protest; now go on with your work"—Webb said "They do not understand what you mean by protest"—I said "Do you?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Then, perhaps, you will explain it to them"—he said to the men "The governor means to punish you," and he said to me "Will you withdraw that word"—I said "How can I? you insist upon Dilley being reinstated, and I rein<lb></lb>state him, but under protest," and I said to them again "Now go on with your work"—Webb said "We may as well tell you we can't go on with our work until the men at Fulham are let in"—I said "That is a matter with which I have nothing whatever to do, end I can do nothing further in it"—Webb said they could not go to work until they received orders from their delegate meeting—I then left them, and consulted with my assistants and foremen—that was the end of the matter—the day and night gangs walked off in a body—I saw Dilley walking away with the men—while the men were there I saw this written notice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the lobby door, close to the retort house—it is a large dining-room where the men take off their clothes—it was pasted on the outside of the door—the defendants belonged to the day gang—the lobby I speak of is where some of the men would go to change their clothes—we have four lobbies all the same size—this was the lobby connected with the retort house where the meeting took place between me and the men—there were two of these notices—there were two pairs of lobbies, with the doors opposite one another, and there was another notice, similar to this, on one of the other lobby doors—ia the ordinary course of things both the men coming on duty and those going from duty would pass those lobby doors—they could get into the</p>

               <p>retort house without going into the lobby, but they would go into the lobby in order to prepare themselves for their work—they would not necessarily pass the lobby in going to the retort house—the night gang could go to the lobby to change their clothes—they could not avoid going there—all the night gang that were there that went away had changed their clothes at the time of our conversation—he notices were in a position where persons could road them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of the door of the lobby close to the retort house where we had the interview; it has been cut out with the notice on it.

That was not any notice of mine—my attention was called to it by one of the day gang that morning, after the first conversation—the others were not there—it was before they had spoken to me about their delegate meeting—the men would not, according to any business of ours, be bound to answer to their names at 6 o'clock.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th October</hi>, 1871, <hi rend="italic">and was an agreement between the witness as agent for the Company and the defendant Bunn, to be determined by a month's notice on either side, and contained the conditions of the employment and the amount of wages, viz.</hi>: 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">for first class stokers</hi>; 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for second class; and</hi> 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">for third class; coke spreaders</hi>, 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">and labourers</hi>, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per day.</hi>) When a man enters our employ we hold him responsible to fulfil any of the duties included in that agreement—he may be called upon to work either as a labourer, or a stoker of either class, or to do piece work—these forms have been in use ever since the date of that, about 1871—during 1871, Bunn was employed in the retort house, either as a first, second, or third class stoker—as far as I know he was engaged in one of those three classes—I believe he never was removed from the retort house—the first class men look after the furnaces, the second and third class stokers charge the retort with coal; the coke spreaders tread the coke back—after the coke is drawn from the retort, it is stored by the coke spreader—the labourers would have to make themselves generally useful—stokers as well as labourers would be called upon to do piece work, only by mutual agree<lb></lb>ment; the mutual agreement only refers to piece work; labourers would be liable to stokers' work if they could do it—that was to a certain extent the practice of the works—Dilley was in the service from the date of his agree<lb></lb>ment, about eighteen months—I don't know that he came after an eight years' service with the Imperial Gaslight and Coke Company—my conversation with</p>

               <p>the men on 2nd December took place between a few minutes before 7 o'clock and 7.30; the whole thing was covered by about three quarters of an hour—there was no violence of demeanour or threatening of any sort on the part of any of the men in my presence—what led me to reinstate Dilley was my anxiety to get the work performed—I understood from the verbal state<lb></lb>ments of the others that the men would not work unless I did—Dilley before his discharge was what is called a pipe jumper, that is included in the third class pay—pipe jumpers are not set down in this table, they would go under the class of third class stokers—he would be liable to do other work besides pipe jumping—pipe jumping is keeping the ascension pipe from the retort clear—there has been an increase of wages since those agreements—his wages now would have been 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—since the agree<lb></lb>ment made with Bunn his rate of wages has been altered—the gangs change every week; the men are paid on the increased rate of wages, 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the rate for seven days work; if they only made six days, of course there would be a corresponding diminution—I have not known a man come to the works in the morning and be told that he was not wanted for that day, only as far as a casual labourer is concerned, not a person who has signed an agreement—Dilley left the employ on Saturday, 30th November—the men leave their working clothes at the works in their lockers; each man has a locker.</p>

I was foreman of stokers on the morning of 2nd December—I got to the works about 5.50—I found a great many of the day gang already there, standing in the retort house and in the lobbies—I waited for some time to see if they would begin work—some observations were made to me, in consequence of which I went and fetched Mr. Trewby—I heard the conversation between him and the men, that which he has described—on 22nd November, I ordered Dilley to do some work—he refused to do it; he said "No, I can't do it, it is <hi rend="italic">again</hi> my rules and my Society"—he did not explain why—the work was charging some retorts—there were two other men employed in the same place—I don't know whether they were union men or not.</p>

               <p>(Violence, &amp;c.) Act, 1871" (34 and 35 Vic, c. 32). <hi rend="italic">The combination of workmen was now legalised, and all offences under the last-mentioned Act must be prosecuted under the provisions of the</hi> "Summary Jurisdiction Acts." <hi rend="italic">The first section defined the meaning of molestation and obstruction, and the meaning of threats and intimidation, and provided "that no person shall be liable to any punishment for doing or conspiring to do any act on the ground that such act restrains or tends to restrain the free course of trade, unless such act is one of the acts hereinbefore specified in this section, and is done with the object of coercing, as hereinbefore mentioned." There were two classes of Counts in the indictment, some alleging a conspiracy at common law, by means of intimi<lb></lb>dation and molestation, to induce the master to alter his mode of carrying on business, and others alleging also a conspiracy at common law to injure the Gas Company by the defendants and their fellow-workmen agreeing to break existing contracts at one and the same time. With reference to the first class of Counts, the proviso applied, and proceedings could only be taken before a Magistrate. With reference to the second class of Counts, the servant must be a person, and the contract must be a contract, within the meaning of the previous statutes, which gave a master power to punish a servant for not fulfilling his contract; and the defendants were not such servants, and had not made such a contract.

The allegation was that the defendants conspired to extort and force the Manager of the Company to promise to do something which otherwise he would not have agreed to do. The</hi> "Criminal Law Amendment Act" <hi rend="italic">did not apply to this case; it was not intended to repeal the common law of the land, and any conspiracy to interfere with the free will of others by an illegal act, such as the breaking of contracts, was a conspiracy at common law; he would not, however, press the special Counts, which had reference to isolated threats and violence towards individual men.</hi>

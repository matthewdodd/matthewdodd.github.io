I know Young—he has been about my premises at times—he was employed by me one day seven or eight days before the 14th of May—he showed me some red glass buttons on cards about that time, either that day or the day after—Hussey is a stranger—on the morning of the 14th of May I went to bed between one and two o'clock—every thing was safe in my bar at that time, and the doors bolted—I was called up about seven next morning, went to the bar and missed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of silver off the stove, about a pound and a half of cigars, a coat, hat, some tea<lb></lb>spoons, spoons, a pair of shoes, and some shells—I have since seen the hat, three and two shells—these are them—two of the spoons are old fashioned and of different patterns—I have some at home which match them—the new one is marked with my initials, and I have others to match—I know the hat by the shape of it, by its fitting me, by the maker's name inside, and by having worn it.</p>

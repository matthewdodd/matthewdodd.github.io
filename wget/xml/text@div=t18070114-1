Yes, a one pound bank note; she went out and got something to drink, and brought me part of the change; she brought some silver, and kept all the copper, I suppose to the amount of three or four shillings. I gave her some silver to get something to eat; it was getting late, and both she and Phillips persuaded me to lay down till towards the morning; accordingly I did, I soon went to sleep, and I awoke in the course of a little time; I found the prisoner was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was your property at the time you laid down. - A. I undressed myself and put my property in my left hand breeches pocket, and put them under my pillow; the bills and the notes were wrapped up together.</p>

On Thursday, 24th March, I was on duty in Greenwich-road, and saw the three prisoners together—Cummings went into a pawnbroker's shop in the Broadway, came out and nodded her head to the other two, who were standing on the other side; she then went into the shop of Mr. Tigh, a pawnbroker: not into the pawning box, but into the shop—she came out in a few minutes, and they all went down High-street, Deptford, to Mr. Harris's—Cummings went in, came out again; and they went to Mr. Patty's, in the Lower-road, Deptford—at each place the others waited outside for her—I noticed that she had her hands under her apron—I got assistance from the Dockyard, and took them all into custody—I searched William White, and in his jacket pocket found this shirt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Cummings had a basket with her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, in the employ of Mr. McNamara, con<lb></lb>tractor—on the morning of 17th March I was on Tower Hill with a van<lb></lb>load load of fish—I had come from the Great Eastern Railway—I saw Kitchener, he is also a carman of Mr. McNamara's—he came up and asked me if there</p>

               <p>was a chance of a pad of fish this morning—I said, "No, not off my van, if you want a pad of fish, you had better have it off your own van"—after that I saw Pepelow and Seager, they stood on the hill, just above where the van was—Kitchener beckoned for them, and they came up from off the hill—Seager took a pad off the van and put it on his head, and took it up the hill—Pepelow walked down away with him; they had come up to the van together—Pepelow saw what Seager did—Kitchener was not at the van at the time, he was just below it, about a yard further down, towards the tail of the van—he could see very plainly what was being done—I then left my van in charge of another carman, and told Mr. Bullock, the foreman, what I had seen, and the prisoners were given in custody.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. McNamara—Hyatt made a com<lb></lb>munication to me, and pointed out Seager and Pepelow, and I gave them in custody—they said they had just come down, and knew nothing of it—they had nothing with them—Kitchener was afterwards brought to the station by Hyatt—I said to him, "Have you lost a pad of fish?"—he said, "No"—I told him to go down and count his load—he did so, and returned, and said, "No, I have not lost any"—an account is taken when the van is loaded at the station, and the carman signs for the quantity—I have the carman's note here—he should have had sixty-three packages—it is not signed by Kitchener—he would get it from our office.</p>

On the 19th of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, when I opened the shop window, I missed a liquor frame, worth 30 s., and two decanters, worth 1 l. I know nothing of the prisoners. I missed several more things; they must have been taken by the inside sash being drawn aside - I saw them safe at four o'clock the day before. I went round to the pawnbrokers, and on returning, about twelve o'clock, I found the officer in my shop, with them. I had cut one of the liquor bottles myself. I know them all by the workmanship, and have others to match them. I have had the frame eight or nine years. I made it for a gentleman who is gone to Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Would they sell for more than 1 l.? A. Yes. The frame is plated with silver; it ought to fetch me the interest of my money. I have two quart and four pint decanters of the same pattern. I was out after eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your windows have sliding sashes? A. Yes, inside; the shutters were not broken.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Harrison, pawnbroker, Tottenham-court-road. On the 19th of January the prisoners came to my shop, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning. Brodie produced a pair of decanters to pawn for 12 s. I turned round to put them on our back counter, and while my back was turned, one of them produced the liquor-frame and three bottles, upon which Brodie asked 14 s. I asked Brodie her name, but the other prisoner answered and said her (Brodie's) name was Clarke. I asked Brodie where she lived? Clarke answered at No. 10, Crown-street, Soho. I asked Brodie whose the property was? Clarke said they were things she had had by her a long time, and was going to sell them off. Having seen the prosecutor about half an hour before, I got an officer and gave them in charge.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took the prisoners into custody at Harrison's shop. I went in rather quick - Brodie told me not to be in a hurry, for they would go quietly. As we went to the office, one of them asked if I knew who stole the things? I said No. She then said that a tall man, in a blue coat, with red hair and whiskers, met her in Crown-street, and asked her to pawn them. I think it was Brodie.</p>

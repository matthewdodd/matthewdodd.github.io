From information, on the 4th of July, about twenty minutes past five in the morning, I concealed myself in my neighbour's back kitchen, so that I had a view of my back premises; I saw the prisoner Robinson come into Mr. Couchman's yard and go into mine, the prisoner Salmon opened the back door and let him in. Robinson then followed Salmon into the kitchen, they were in about three minutes, and then Robinson came out with part of a sack of flour upon his back; I let him come off my premises and then I stopped him; he said it was the first time that ever he did it. I apprehended Robinson upon Mr. Couchman's premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine to see what was in the sack at the time - A. I did, there is about ninety pounds odd. I had seen the sack in the bakehouse about an hour before Robinson came. I dare say it is worth two pounds and upwards. I apprehended Salmon in my parlor where he had no business to be.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the regular time for Salmon to come to work - A. At five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. This sack of flour was in the bakehouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he had business there - A. Yes, to work.</p>

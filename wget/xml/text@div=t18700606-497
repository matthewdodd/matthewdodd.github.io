                  </hi>. I live at 1, Wellington Road, Bethnal Green, and am a blacksmith—on 22nd January I sold the prisoner a public-house for 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he gave me a bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment—I let it run for fourteen days, and when I went there were no effects—he called one evening and said he would withdraw that, and he gave me a bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Shires was with him when he came on 22nd January—he was represented to be the broker—Shires asked me to lend him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till the day of change, when he would return it—I had only got a sovereign and I gave that to him, thinking that Mr. Thompson was going to take the house, and I should receive the money on the day of change—I should not have lent him the sovereign unless I had thought that the bill was genuine.</p>

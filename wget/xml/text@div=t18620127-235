                  </hi>. I am a builder, of 4, Wood-street, Westminster—prior to last Christmas I had the repair of the house 10, Portland-place, near the Regent's-park—Beckett, the deceased, at that time was taken into my employ as overlooker—I believe he had been a constable—I engaged a woman of the name of Flynn to take care of the house—the repairs went on—it was her duty to take care of the house at night, principally, as the foreman of the works was in charge in the day time—I cannot say whether the prisoner lived with that woman in that house—I have reason to believe he did, but I myself do not know—I told Beckett that he was to give her a week's notice for her to leave on the Saturday after Christmas—she occupied the butler's pantry, in the basement—that consisted of one room, which opened into the basement passage—there was a window in the room looking into the front area—Beckett had a perfect right to go in and out of the house, by my authority, at all reasonable hours.</p>

               <p>fact that he was sleeping there until his misbehaviour—the woman had to take charge of the whole of the house at night—there were repairs going on daily—the whole house was under repair; every apartment—they slept in the butler's pantry; she slept and lived there—I don't know anything about him—that was the only room that the woman occupied—there was another room occupied by my foreman—that was the only room occupied by the woman; I am positive of that—if she was in any other room it was against my order, or against my knowledge—she had a right to pass through every other room in the house to see that fires were alight in the day time—she had no right to have her meals in any other room—I desired her not—I said, "That is your room; you will live there until I wish you to re<lb></lb>move into another room"—I did not positively desire her not to go into any other room—it was the butler's pantry that was broken open by the deceased, I have been informed; the very room that she was occupying—there was a verbal notice to be given to her—I also told Beckett in the week of Christmas, which was the week of her notice, that he was to enter the house daily, while some of the workmen were absent, to see that it was safe from fire and thieves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter of 20, Cowley-street, West<lb></lb>minster—I am foreman to Mr. Tyler—I had been employed in this house, 10, Portland-place—on 27th December I accompanied Beckett there about 9 o'clock—a labourer, named Gregory, was with me, my brother, a carpenter, and a man of the name of Boyce, a carpenter—when we got to the house I rang the area bell—Mrs. Flynn answered it—we were let in some few minutes afterwards—I did not see the prisoner previous to going to the house—on entering the house we went down the stairs to the basement, and went to the pantry door—I tried the door and found that the prisoner had fastened himself in—I called out to him to come out—I said, "Now Flynn, come out quietly, will you?"—he answered, "I won't come out, for that police<lb></lb>man is there," meaning Beckett—Beckett said he would get in by some means, and he went to fetch a constable—I can't call to my recollection any particular words the prisoner made use of, though, he was speaking a great deal in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270027"></xptr>
               <p>there—Beckett then left—whilst he was gone the prisoner stated in reply to other parties as well as myself requesting him to come out, that he would not come out, and the first man that entered he would run him through—Beckett returned in about half-an-hour, as far as I could judge, with police-constable <hi rend="italic">D</hi> 129 (Woollard)—Beckett first of all tried to force the door with his shoulder, but could not—he then requested Gregory to break it open—before that he called out to the prisoner to open the door, but he could not get it open—I cannot call to my recollection any particular remark he made, no further than calling on him to open the door—I don't think he said anything about what he would do if he did not—I could not hear the prisoner answer Beckett's request—the door was then broken open by Gregory with a crow-bar—Beckett placed himself before Gregory, and was the first man that entered—I saw the prisoner make a thrust with his right hand, and Beckett said, "He has stabbed me"—I gave the prisoner in charge, and requested my brother to take Beckett to a doctor—I did not examine Beckett at all—when he said he was stabbed he put his hand to his side, just by the side of the naval on the left side—I saw no more of him—I afterwards saw a knife given by Mrs. Flynn to the police-constable—that was after the constable had taken the prisoner up into the hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> After the door was open did you go down stairs im<lb></lb>mediately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think half a minute elapsed—the woman did not open the door for me—she was out in the area—she was not up at the front door at all—I don't know who opened the front door—it was open some minutes before I saw it—I rang the bell, Mrs. Flynn answered it, and came up to the gate to speak to me she was speaking to me when the front door was opened—it was not opened in answer to the bell—I believe it was opened by one of my party who got in at the back window—Beckett and Gregory were the two men that got in at the back window—on their opening the door for me I walked straight down stairs—we had not been able to get in to work that day—that was what we wanted to do; we were going there to work that day—we were not in the habit of breaking in at the back of the house to go to work—we had always had the house opened to us previously—we had not been at work on the 26th; we could not get admission then—it was the door of the butler's pantry that was broken open—the woman was out in the area until after the prisoner was taken in charge—I did not shut her out—she was shut out—the door was closed on her, end she was shut out in the area—it certainly required violence to break the door open—it is a large house, consisting of upwards twenty roome—it is a generally strongly built house—the door of the butler's pantry was not a very strong deer; it was an inch and a half-deal door—I should say I was not half a minute in breaking open the door—it was a heavy crow-bar; Gregory was wielding it—he struck it with the end, butted it against the door, like a battering-ram—the door went open with a sudden force—it did not go exactly wide open, it flew open as far as it did go; flew open suddenly—I was not standing close to the door at the time—I was, I suppose, three or four yards away—Gregory and Beckett were standing close to it—the policeman was not far be<lb></lb>hind them; he was very close to them—Beckett went in the moment the door was open—it was done in an instant—the moment the door went open in went Beckett—he went in before Gregory; the moment the door was opened—when the crow-bar was applied Beckett went in first, and imme<lb></lb>diately he went in this took place—I saw the knife in the prisoner's hand before the blow—he was holding it like that (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>) with his thumb a little forward—that would be the position of his hand, I think, as near as I</p>

               <p>could tell, but in the state of confusion I cannot speak to an inch—in a case like that of course there was confusion, which prevents my speaking with accuracy about it—the prisoner was close behind the door when I saw him first—when I say close, I mean within two feet—Beckett entering as he did would not come into close contact with the prisoner exactly at once, because the prisoner, as near as I can judge was about two feet from the door; he certainly would almost immediately, because the whole transaction did not take more than three or four minutes—I believe Gregory was next to Beckett—I was some distance behind at the time the blow was struck; about three yards, as near as I can judge—I did not see Beckett seize hold of the prisoner—I saw Beckett hold up a stick, a common walking-stick—I cannot say whether it was a heavy one—I never had it in my hand to judge—he had it in his right hand and placed it against the prisoner's left shoulder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was Beckett when you first saw him holding up the stick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was standing then just at the entrance of the door—after the door was open the prisoner and he came in closer contact, and he held the stick to the prisoner's shoulder.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I was a labourer for Mr. Tyler—on 27th December I accompanied Beckett and last witness to this house—on reaching the house I went in with the deceased—we got in at a back window on the first floor—Beckett was first—we then went down stairs—during this time Weston was ringing the front door bell—the woman was in the area answering at the time—Beckett stepped forward and shut the door, and shut the woman in the area—then the prisoner was locked in the butler's pantry—Beckett persuaded him first to come out quietly—he asked him if he would come out quietly, or he would break the door open—the prisoner said he would not come out, but the first that attempted to come in he would run through—the deceased then went to fetch a policeman—I should think he was gone nearly half an hour, as near as I can recollect—during his absence we were watching the prisoner's manoeuvres in the room, and persuading him to come out—we could see into the room, looking through a window—I saw the prisoner there alone, he was walking backwards and forwards in the room, with the knife in his hand—I could see the knife, it was in his right hand—he had it in this way, down this side, with the blade open—he was walking about, when the door was shut—he did not my anything more during the absence of Beckett—we were persuading him to come out, and he said he would not, that was all—after the time I have meutioned, Beckett returned with the policeman, D. 129—he then ordered me to break the door open—he said, "I will have him out; break the door open."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did he say that, in a low or a loud tone of voice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, not particularly loud, loud enough for any one inside to hear.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270030"></xptr>
               <p>in a determined voice; of course he was determined—Weston might easily have heard it—I do not know whether he did or not—I saw the knife before these words were used, through the glass—I saw it in his hand after the door was broken open, and before the words were used—he had it in his right hand when the words were used by him—there was no movement of the stick accompanying them—the stick was up; he had it up in this direc<lb></lb>tion (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—the movement of the stick at the time corresponded with the words, so as to intimate to the prisoner that he really meant what he said—he had the stick in that direction (<hi rend="italic">in the middle</hi>)—he had full opportunity to have given him a very severe blow if he thought proper—the next instant he could have given him a very severe blow on the head if he thought proper—not a blow that would have killed him, with that stick I should think—it was an ordinary walking stick—Beckett appeared to be a strong man—it was immediately after the words were used that the blow was struck—Beckett had not advanced at all before the blow was struck—I had the crow-bar in my hand—I was close behind Beckett—I was holding it in both hands—I broke the door open with the ends—after I broke the door open I set the crow-bar down—I did not have it in my hand when I was following Beckett—I had not got it in my hand at the time Beckett used those words—I set it down by the door outside—I had it in my hand till I broke the door open, not after; the moment the door was broken open Beckett went in, the very instant—I mean to say that at the time Beckett said those words, I had not the crow-bar in my hand; it was set down.</p>

On 27th December, I accom<lb></lb>panied Beckett to 10, Portland-place—when we got to the house, Beckett said, "Come into the house"—I went down stairs with him—I heard Beckett ask the prisoner to come out of the room—he said, "You had better come out quietly, and go away quietly"—I could not hear any answer from the prisoner, but a minute or two afterwards they broke open the door—Beckett was one and Gregory the other that did it—as soon as the door was opened Beckett was the first one that entered the room—he came back again, and said, "I am stabbed"—Mr. Weston said, "I will give the prisoner in charge"—I went into the room and saw the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing in the middle of the room with a knife in his hand—I have produced the knife to-day—I told him to lay the knife down; that he must go with me to the police-station—he closed the knife and dropped it out of the win<lb></lb>dow into the area—I took him into custody, asking Gregory and Mr. Weston to hold him a minute while I went into the area and got the knife—I went into the area but could not find the knife anywhere—I afterwards got it from the female—she gave it to me—I then returned to the prisoner</p>

               <p>and conveyed him to the station—on the way he said something to me—before he said so I had said nothing to him—I held out no promise or inducement whatever—it was in Oxford-street that he said it—he said he had been living with this woman and had told her she would be the cause of his doing something wrong, as she would not get up to get his breakfast ready that morning for him to go to work—that was all he said—when the door was broken open I was standing about two or three yards back, in the passage, just at the bottom of the steps—I was about two or three yards from Gregory, as near as I can tell.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the men go into the room, or attempt to go in after the door was broken open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw Beckett—Mr. Weston and Gregory were behind him—Gregory did not attempt to go in—he stood outside in the passage—I cannot say the distance he was from Beckett—he was not a great way; somehing about a yard, or it may be a yard and a half—he had the crow-bar in his hand—I; believe he had it in his hand at the time I heard the deceased say he was stabbed—the prisoner had got his boots on—he was not taken to the station in his slippers—he was in a pair of boots I believe—I did not take any notice of his feet in particular—he walked to the station—he had a pair of boots on—he did not put any boots on after I took him—I swear that—it might be a pair of slippers that he had on, I cannot say—he had a pair of shoes on or something—he did not put any on. after he got to the station—I do not know whether a pair of boots was brought to him after he got to the station—I did not see any—what he had on looked very like boots—when, I went into the room he was not without boots or slippers—I believe he had a pair of boots on—I do not know that his wife brought him a pair of boots at the station three days afterwards—he did not say that he was using the knife cutting the heels of his boots—I have not been in Court while the other witnesses were examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of the Middlesex Hospital—on 27th December, Beckett was brought there—I took him in about 11 o'clock in the forenoon—I examined him in the out-patients room—his clothes were removed before I saw him—there was a punctured wound in the abdomen, about half an inch in width—it was such a wound as a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would make—he was then taken to the ward and placed in bed—I examined the wound many times afterwards, but did not probe it during his lifetime—he died, on the 8th January—I made a post mortem examination—I found that the whole lining membrane of the abdomen and the lining membrane covering the intestines was in a state of inflamma<lb></lb>tion, or had been—that was the cause of his death—I traced the wound—the depth of it was about two inches—it had penetrated to the lining membrane of the abdomen, the lining, of the wall of the abdomen—I should say the inflammation arose from the wound, and the inflammation was the cause of the death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The wound had only penetrated as far as the lining of the abdomen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is continues with the wall of the abdomen—the inflammation was over the whole of the intestines—I have no doubt that the inflammation was the cause of death, and that was caused by the wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you attend him from the time you saw him first until his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I thought it a slight wound at first—there were two surgeons attending him; myself and Mr. Shaw—I saw him every day, and I think Mr. Shaw did—he prescribed for him, and I saw his direc<lb></lb>tions carried out—Mr. Shaw is not here—the wound was on the left side of the abdomen—I did not know the deceased before—I examined the whole of his body, and the head—it was quite healthy—there was some abnormal appearance on the brain; that appeared to be of long standing—I think he gave his age as 35—the inflammation was all over the intestines—I can undertake to say that the inflammation was owing to no other cause, besides the wound—there was nothing else to accouut for it—inflammation is generally set up from a wound within twenty-four hours—you cannot very well ascer<lb></lb>tain it except by the pain it gives rise to—it is ascertained more from the pain which the patient experiences on pressure—I did not really suppose him in danger until about four days before his death—the inflammation was then first well marked—he was confined to his bed in the hospital—I can under<lb></lb>take to say positively that the inflammation could not have been produced by other causes than the wound—I thought it a slight wound at first—it is against the rules of surgery to probe a wound in the abdomen—if I had probed it I could not have thought it a slight one; but from the external appearances it only seemed to be through the outer wall—it is not usual to probe, because that operation might give rise to the penetration of the peritoneum, the very mischief you are anxious to avert—I say that I know of no other cause to have produced it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was yours a general post mortem examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I examined the whole of the viscera, the head, chest, and abdomen—I found inflammation of the peritoneum—I traced that to the wound itself—there was a thickening round the wound, which had evidently proceeded from inflammation—that would tend to show where the inflammation was first set up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector D</hi>). I produce the deceased's clothes that he had on at the time this occurred—I have examined them—I found a small hole going through two shirts, a pair of trousers, and a scarf, near the centre—I was present at the hospital when the deceased's examination was taken, in the presence of Mr. Tyrrwhitt, the Magistrate—the prisoner was also there—the deceased made a statement which was taken down in writing by the Magistrate's clerk—I heard him examined—the prisoner could hear what he said; and he put some questions to him—this is the Magistrate's signature.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was the examination taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Middlesex Hospital in the ward—Beckett was in bed—I saw him sworn by the chief usher of Marylebone police-court—I saw the oath administered—Mr. Tyrrwhitt was present there—the prisoner was standing by the side of Beckett's bed—(<hi rend="italic">The examination of the deceased was here read as follows:</hi>—"On 27th December, I was engaged as a timekeeper of the men employed at No. 10, Portland-place—I had instructions from the builder before he went out of town, to clear the house of these people, meaning the prisoner and the woman who had charge of the house—I went to the room where the prisoner was, with the other men—I got the assistance of the other men—the door was locked—after I got into the house I demanded admittance—the woman was outside the house in the area at the time—I called to him again to open the door, and I heard the woman say, 'Blow his b——brains out'—a man brought a large hammer—the door was broken open immedi<lb></lb>ately</p>

               <p>—I went to the door—I saw the prisoner standing about two paces to the right, in the room—I did not lay bold of him—I saw that he had something about four inches long in his hand—he had never attempted any<lb></lb>thing against me before—I told him if he did anything I would knock him down—he then stepped one pace towards the front, and half-pace towards the left, and he struck me with such force that it was like throwing a skittle ball—it was in the belly and I felt it very warm—I felt the blood—I had a thick waistcoat and thick clothes on, and a cheat protector; and it shows the force it must have struck; but for that it would have gone to the back bone. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> I think it was an Irish labourer we had got there that broke open the door—I did not rush at him, or catch hold of him by the collar—I never raised a finger to him.")</p>

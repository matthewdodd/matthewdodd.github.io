W. Eeles, paymaster—that is his signature acknowledging the receipt of 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is the duty of the paymaster to send in a monthly cash account, which ought to be certified to by me—this signature, Allen H. Gardner, is not my handwriting—I did not authorize the prisoner to sign it, or anybody else—I know the prisoner's signature—I believe that to be his signature, and I believe it to be in the handwriting of the person who wrote my sig<lb></lb>nature—I have very little doubt that it is in the prisoner's writing—the prisoner left the ship, invalided, some time in February.</p>

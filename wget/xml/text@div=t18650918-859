                  </hi> I live at 5, Nelson-Street, Stepney—the deceased was my father—he was about forty-seven years of age, and was a rigger—on Monday, 24th July, I saw him when he went out to work—he seemed very well then—he had had bronchitis last Easter very badly, and was in the London Hospital—he came home to tea about 7 o'clock—he was sober—he went out between 7 and 8—I saw him again that night, when I ran out in consequence of what I heard, and found him lying on the ground at the top of Nelson-street, Stepney—he said his leg was broken—he was taken to the hospital.</p>

On Tuesday the 2d of May, the two prisoners at the bar came into my shop under pretence of looking at some callico for gowns. Davis, after seeing several, said, she would come or send again; and desired I would give her a card of the shop; it was only Davis asked to look at the callico.</p>
               <p>Was any body else in the shop with them? - No. I was at dinner in the parlour; there was no one in the shop. I went into the shop to them. I turned round to reach a card for her (as I had suffered much I was very suspicious of them) I turned back and saw the tall one standing rather open to hide the other. I gave her the card; and just as I had given her the card I saw a piece of muslin under the other's apron. I observed a man standing at the door looking very significant at them, as they always go in a gang; and the short one, who had got the muslin, went to the door. As I know the practice is to give it to a person without, and then to hand it off, I laid hold of her arm and pulled her back. She had by that time got her gown covered over it; it was all huddled together, and she immediately dropped the muslin. I had hold of her arm; it had my shop mark on it; it had just come in, and had never had the wrapper put upon it.</p>
               <p>What quantity is it? - A whole piece, it had never been cut.</p>
               <p>What was the value of it? - It cost me four pounds ten shillings that very same day.</p>
               <p>DAVIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I asked him to let me look at a piece of chintz pattern, which I wanted for an acquaintance. I said they were not fine enough. He said there was a piece at the other end of the shop he thought finer; he shewed it me. I asked him the price; he told me. I said it was a great price; if you will oblige me with a card I will give it the gentlewoman, she may come herself; he went in with this young woman and pushed the shop door to. He said, he had been robbed two or three days before, and he would make her pay for them all. I knew this young woman four or five years ago. I met her accidentally at the end of the Fleet Market, and went with her. I never knew her guilty of any thing of the sort, in my life. I was obliged to stand before her, because I was looking at a piece of chintz.</p>
               <p>MORGAN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never saw the muslin till it lay upon the ground. The gentleman shut the door directly, and said, he supposed I meant to rob him.</p>

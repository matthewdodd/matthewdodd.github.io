                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Clark. I was taking care of the shop of Mrs. Keene, whose daughter-in-law was ill, and is since dead—on the 27th of November the prisoner came into the shop, near ten o'clock at night, and asked for an ounce of common tobacco, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I said, "I am very sorry, but I have not change"—he said, "What am I to do?"—I said, "The shops are open, you can get change"—he took the shilling and said, "Well, I suppose I must, then"—he went out, and returned in about ten minutes, when I had put the shutter up, and said he could not get change; perhaps I could give him some change—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he promised to come the next morning for the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he lived in the neighbourhood, but I never saw him again till the 8th of December, when I saw him in custody—I put the shilling he gave me, in a small bit of paper in a canister—I had offered it the same night at the public-house—they said it was bad—I kept it separate from other money till the 8th of December, when the policeman took it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You said you would see if you had change—you put it in your pocket, and took out sufficient change—you stated at the office that you never found it out till the next morning, when you went to the green-grocers. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, I never said so—I kept it by itself, when I heard that same night that it was bad—he came in for an ounce of tobacco—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, not the full change—if he had come for the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the next morning, I should have given it him.</p>

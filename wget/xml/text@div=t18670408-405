                  </hi>. I live at 7, Foley Street, West Street, Kingsland, and am a lapidary and glasscutter—I work at 10, Baldwin's Place—the prisoner is my brother—on 6th March I was at work; there was a kick at the door of the workshop; I answered it and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner there—he asked me to come out—I told him I could not, because I had some work to finish, but I should have done work about eight o'clock, and then I would come out—he asked me three different times afterwards to come out—I told him I could not—he said I had made him miserable ever since he had been home, meaning from the army—he came home shortly after Christmas, 1865—he had been home a little over fifteen months—he then muttered something which I could not understand, and plunged a knife into my breast—I could not see from where he drew it, but I believe from his sleeve, by the way it was handled—it fortunately only went through my coat, and grazed the skin—I stepped back—he came after me four or five yards into the shop and made four different stabs at me; three of them only grazed the skin, the fourth penetrated my left shoulder—it cut me much; it bled—I called for assistance, and he was dragged on to the ground—I got away—I remained in the hospital three weeks within a day, and am still an out-patient—I had not provoked him in any shape or way, except that shortly after Christmas I met him in<lb></lb>toxicated in a public-house with some friends and have never spoken to him since—that is the only reason that I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Wellington Square, Gray's Inn Road, and work with the prosecutor—on the 6th March, about six o'clock, the prisoner kicked at the door—the brother went to him and I went on work<lb></lb>ing—I then left my work to see whether I knew him, but I did not—there was no quarrel between them or loud speaking, after they had said what they had to say, the prisoner rushed at his brother with a knife—the pro<lb></lb>secutor said, "Jack, he has got a knife," and I saw the prisoner rush at him with a knife in his hand and stab him on the left shoulder and breast—I made a rush, and I and the engineer got the prisoner down and got the knife from him—we then let him get up, and the engineer said to him, "You have got another knife"—the engineer handed over to me another knife and a razor—the prisoner said, "You see I am not short of tools, but I will not hurt any one else"—I gave them to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital—I examined the prosecutor—he had a superficial wound in front of the chest, and another wound between the shoulder-blade and the arm-pit on the left side—there was a good deal of bleeding—it was three and a half inches deep, downwards and backwards—it penetrated the wall of the chest, but escaped the lungs—I considered it dangerous—it brought on a slight attack of pleurisy, but he had a good constitution and was never in danger of death—this knife would inflict the wound.</p>

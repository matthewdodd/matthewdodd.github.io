On the 18th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a piece of pork, which came to 2 s. 4 d. He tendered me a 1 l. note. I took it up, looked at it, and said,</p>
               <p>"Pray, Sir, where did you get this note?" He immediately said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't like it here is another." I said,</p>
               <p>"I like this note perfectly well, and you as well - I shall take both you and the note." The moment I spoke he bolted out, through fourteen or fifteen people, who were in the shop; there was an immediate cry of stop thief! and four or five people pursued him out of the shop. Welch, my man, was among them.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed - A. He had a great coat and a close coat, and an umbrella in his hand; when he was brought back to the shop he had only his close coat on, and his great coat was across his shoulder or under his arm - he had no umbrella then. I gave him in charge, and the watchman said he would take him into the parlour to search him, but he said he would not be searched without a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave you the note, what did you do with it - A. I put it between my lips, kept it there until he was brought back, and then wrote my own name and address on it - (looks at one) - this is it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. By what means did you ascertain it to be forged - A. Because I have been a great sufferer. I have taken 45 l. in forged notes. I suspected this by the paper - it was like some I had taken.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 18th of December, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was passing along Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road, and heard the cry of Stop thief! in John-street, which leads into Windmill-street, and is about two minutes walk from Goodge-street. I arrived at the corner of John-street, and saw the prisoner run out from St. John-street towards Charlotte-street - he had no coat on at all, but was in his shirt-sleeves. I ran after him, collared him, and to the best of my recollection he asked me what I collared him for? I said he would presently see. In a few minutes Mr. Best's man and some others arrived. I took him down John-street, and we met some people with two coats, which the prisoner claimed as his, and insisted on putting one of them on - he took the other under his arm. I took him back to the shop; he asked for his umbrella, but none was produced - the watchman was called in, and attempted to search him, but he refused to be searched without a warrant; we took him to Pancras watch-house, Cleveland-mews. The constable of the night asked him what his name was? He said,</p>
               <p>"That is nothing to you, I'll tell your master" - he gave no account of himself in my hearing. I and Howard, the constable, went to the spot where I took him, and found two half crowns and 1 s. lying on the curb there - it was good money. I suppose twenty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120023"></xptr>minutes had elapsed after I had seized him, before we got there.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Pancras. I took the prisoner, searched him, and found a good 1 l. note on him. He at first refused to be searched, and said I had no authority; I said I should do it without authority; he refused to give me either his name or address. Eaton pointed out the spot where he took him. I found a good shilling there, and Eaton found more money.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes, and have been so twenty-six years. The note is forged in every respect; it is not the impression of the Bank, nor the hand-writing of E. Staple, whose signature it purports to bear. The Bank water-mark is made in the paper, but this is done after.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How do you ascertain that - A. By experience. The Bank paper has a different feel, and is different altogether.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went there to buy pork, pulled two notes out and gave his wife one; she gave it to Best to look at, and said she believed it to be good - I had another. He said he should detain that and me. I ran out, as I could not bear the thoughts of a watch-house, and a man caught me. They wanted to search me; I said the watchman might, but he did not offer. I had no coat on when I was taken to the watch-house, I said I would tell my name when Best came, which I did. I gave my right name and address, I did not know the note was forged, and had no silver about me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Crescent Place, Clapham—I am foreman to Mr. Johnson—that is the Ditchling Potteries Company—I did not send any pots to Mr. Smith—he used to be one of our customers, but has not had anything lately—I did not sign the receipt (<hi rend="italic">now produced</hi>)—that is the prisoner's handwriting—I have seen him write and can state positively that that is in his handwriting—he never accounted to me for a sum of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Smith.</p>

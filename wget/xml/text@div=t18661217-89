                  </hi>. I carry on business as a merchant, and manage the London business of Francis and James Rickett, of Hull, at No. 149, Upper Thames Street—the prisoner was one of our travellers—he was mostly engaged in town, but occasionally in the suburbs and near home—his duty was to receive orders when in town, and to receive orders and money out of town—his salary was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and a commission—I believe his income from us was nearly 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and we also gave him permission to sell on commission for Collier and Sons, the cocoa and chocolate makers—the commission we allowed him was on orders—if they turned out bad he would forfeit his commission upon them—we credited him with his commission upon orders sent in to us, and where the debt was proved to be bad we redebited it to him—he would be away some three or four days on the Oxford journey—it was his duty to pay over the money he received, as soon as he returned, to Mr. Priestman, our cashier—there was a commission account between us—on the 24th October I was sent for by the prisoner to the station—I had previously given orders for his apprehension—I went and saw him—I cannot charge my memory with anything particular that he said—he said nothing about this account of Messrs. Primes, or any other—he called my attention more especially to his wife and children—he gave a sort of general denial of having taken our moneys—Mr. Priest<lb></lb>man had all the money transactions with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he not say he was not aware of this account of Messrs. Prime, or any other, having been received by him and not accounted for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did, to that effect, and that he had obtained a promise from Mr. Priestman that if there were any others he should be informed the same night, that he might make it all right—independently of managing the prosecutor's business, I carry on business as a merchant in connection with my brother at Ipswich; much of it does not fall upon me personally; it is an extensive business—the prisoner would pay over the money he received to Mr. Priestman, not to me—he was paid his com<lb></lb>mission as often as he was entitled to receive it; not on each individual order, perhaps once a fortnight or three weeks, as he wished to draw his money—when commission was due to him it was always given him—he received his salary weekly, and his commission when he thought it of sufficient value to take—I have the ledger in which his account was kept by Mr. Priestman—it was made up every week—it was a very exceptional thing for Mr. Priestman to be out of town—I think he went to see his friends some time last year—if he was absent no doubt one of the clerks would take the money for him, that would be Alexander Patteson; I don't think he would enter it in the cash-book if Mr. Priestman was engaged in London; he might receive the money from the prisoner and lay it on the desk till Mr. Priestman returned; when he would hand it over to him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186612170021"></xptr>
               <p>and he would enter it—I stated at the Mansion House that we had laid down a rule that the prisoner should not deduct his commission, but that I was afraid he had done so; I am extremely glad to find that has not been the case.</p>

               <p>make of it—I have totalled up the prisoner's commission up to the time he left—there was nothing due to him on that—there was money due the other way, when we debited the bad debts—it was his duty to pay all moneys to me before I paid him his commission.</p>

Dear Sir,—We are sorry that you did not come to the office, as usual, this morning. The recently discovered irregularities in your practice while conducting our business make it needful for us to dispense with your services. We have left directions with Mr. Priestman to place one week's salary in advance to the credit of your account, so that you are dismissed from to-day from our employ. We have given directions to have your commission account worked up as soon as pos<lb></lb>sible, and should we not discover any further accounts received by you and not accounted for the difference will not be great; still we fear we shall have to call upon you for some few pounds due to us." It was after that I saw him—the "few pounds due" refers to the commission account—the whole amount of his defalcations is not included in this indictment—there is only one indictment—I am not in the prosecutor's service now—I left because it suited me to go into business on my own account—Mr. Wallis has been aware for twelve months past that I was looking out for a business, and I had his permission to leave at any time I wished—it had nothing to do with these transactions—I left about a month after this was discovered—I am now in business for myself—the prisoner re<lb></lb>ceived about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the last year he was with us—he had to collect a good many small accounts—he has a wife and children.</p>

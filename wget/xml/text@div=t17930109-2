The other boy said, he had no more than a shilling, and then they both ran away; I looked at the window directly and I found the handkerchiefs gone; I immediately pursued them; I saw which way they went, they turned to the left and went up Market-lane; I ran after them into the market, and I saw Crawley throw the handkerchiefs from under his coat under a dark window, when I was not three yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what he threw down? - No, I went and picked up what he threw down and laid hold of him; they were my handkerchiefs, and the person was the prisoner Crawley: I am quite sure that the boy I laid hold of in the street was the same boy who was in the shop by the window.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right you did not see him take the handkerchiefs, but you knew they were there when he came in, and you missed them immediately as he went out? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else came in? - There was a woman came in before the boys went out, she stood at the same counter further on in the shop, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090006"></xptr>bought a pair of stockings but not of me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am eleven years old; he took me out of St. James's-market and said, I stole the handkerchiefs; they stripped me naked and then they took and put marks on them; there were other boys running along besides me; I have a father and a mother, my mother carries loads in the market; I have no friends here now; I have been in prison a week or better.</p>

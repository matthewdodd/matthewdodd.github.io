               <p>I had been drinking in the alehouse, when I came out I found this bundle in the street; I did not know what it was till I took it home: on Saturday I met the Jew that was in company with Whatmore, and he said he had been charged with stealing a bundle; and asked if I saw it on the bench; I told him, no; but I found a bundle as I was coming out; he said perhaps that might be it: I said if it was, he should have it; he told me to go to a public house, and I sent for my wife, who brought the stocks and handkerchief: I told them I was in necessity and had pawned the shirts.</p>

               <p>He said he took them for fear any body else should, and if I would make it up, he would make me any satisfaction; as I did not understand the law I was willing to make it easy.</p>

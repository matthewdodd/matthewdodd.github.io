            , gingerbread-baker, in the Township of New Brentford, in the parish of Hanwell, Middlesex; I went to the house and I saw the prisoner; I told him I had a warrant to search his premises, I knew he lived there, I have known him for a number of years; he said he was very glad to see me, for he wanted a constable, he was accused of stealing the boy's watch, he knew nothing about it, and he was very willing I should search him; I searched his person to see if I could find the duplicate; I did not find any thing about him; he said he had two boxes up stairs if I would go up stairs with him; I went up stairs with him; one was locked, he took the key out of his pocket and unlocked it; I searched the box, I did not find the watch there; he said he had another box there if I would search that he would be glad, it was unlocked; he suspected the servant girl of the house, and the boy had put the watch there; he had a quarrel with them, and they were both his enemies; I looked in that box, and taking up some some loose things this watch lay under them; I took the watch and him before the magistrate, he was committed; I have had the watch ever since; it is a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You went on the Thursday to search the place for what was lost on the Monday morning - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nearly four days had elapsed before you found it, the prisoner was doing his work in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had an opportunity of getting rid of it - A. No doubt of that; I have known him twenty years; I believe him to be too honest for that; I know him to be an honest sober man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The box that was locked he willingly opened with the key, and he told you he wished you to search the box that was unlocked - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a servant girl that has left the place since, she went up stairs to make the bed - A. Yes; the girl left the master's service the night I made the search; she had warning previous to that.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether they were upon good terms together - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. to Salmon. The prisoner got up every morning before you and went to his work, did not he - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Betty, the servant girl and you were upon good terms - A. Not upon very good terms; she had been plagueing of me, she took away my gaiters and I lost a shilling up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Betty ever say to you that she thought she had better confess the frolic that she had with the old man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning when you told the prisoner of your loss he directly advised you to go to the magistrate and get a warrant - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. You did not put the watch in the trunk yourself, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Your lordship, I cannot tell who put it in my trunk, the trunk was open; I persuaded him every day to get a constable and have every body searched in the house; I told him I should then be satisfied, and he would too; I said it grieves me that you should lose your watch. I cannot say that the lad had done any thing against me; I told him to do his business; he always said stop a bit, by that reason I had to do it myself, which sometimes made me so tired I could hardly walk up to bed; I told him I was in my master's place in the bake-house; and two or three times the maid did things which was not her place to do to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

He did not tell this particularly to me, but was telling it to the woman of the house; and he afterwards told me where they were pawned. I went according to his directions, and found the goods pawned at four different pawnbrokers. An acquaintance of mine went with me, and found out three of them; but a fourth we should not have found out, if he had not gone with me, and shewed me the last pawnbroker's himself, or else I should not have found it. He said, he did not know they were my property; he thought they were her own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. How long had this woman been in your service? About fifteen months.</p>
               <p>You know that this case affects her life, if she was guilty, and above fifteen years of age? - She may be under the age of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stavers, I believe you made some offers to the father of this young woman, that if he would have paid you the loss, you would think no more of it? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person in Cree-church-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Hunter in Sugar-loaf-court? - I do.</p>
               <p>I would ask you, whether these persons, or either of them, were not authorized by you to mention to the father, that you would give up the prosecution if a certain sum of money was paid? - I was not seen in it.</p>
               <p>It certainly was most prudent of you not to be seen in it; but how happened it, that these two persons, or either of them, should apply to the father to make up the loss? - I do not know that any body applied.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140061"></xptr>Have you never said on this sort to any body - I only said, it was hard I should lose my property.</p>
               <p>And in consequence of that, might it not happen that you might say, that if the loss was returned, you would think no more of the prosecution? - I did not say so.</p>
               <p>How often did you go to the father's house before she was taken up? - I was twice there.</p>
               <p>Did not you offer to the father, that if your goods were restored, you would not prosecute? - I did not, positively.</p>
               <p>What did you go for? - I only went to tell her father that my goods were lost, and that his daughter was missing.</p>

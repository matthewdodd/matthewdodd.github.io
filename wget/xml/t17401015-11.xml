            . The Prisoner rented a ready furnish'd Lodging of me, and had lived with me about a Month. I happened to go into the Room, and missed my Goods. I desired her to tell me, where my Goods were; but she would not, because it would bring (she said) some People into Trouble. I fetch'd a Constable, and carried her before Justice Poulson , and then she owned where they were. We found 2 Sheets at Mrs Hall's, and a Blanket at Mr Eyre's , according to her Directions. She said she did it for Want; but I don't remember that she said, she designed to bring them again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told the Prosecutor's Wife, that I would find out where they were; for I did not do it with Intent to defraud any body, but would have put them in the Place again.</p>
               <p>Adderson. I believe her to be very honest before this. I had known her before, so enquired no Character of her when she came to my House. <rs id="t17401015-11-verdict61" type="verdictDescription">

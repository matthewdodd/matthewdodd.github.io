            . On the 9th of September last, between one and two o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor was coming up Saffron-hill, Pryor clapped a pistol to his head ; they demanded his money; the prosecutor took his money out, and Odel took it of him. Buridge catched hold of his collar and d - d him, and said he would have his handkerchief; the gentleman said it was not worth taking, so he let it alone. I stood on one side and took his wig and gave him mine; I saw no copper, only three shillings.</p>

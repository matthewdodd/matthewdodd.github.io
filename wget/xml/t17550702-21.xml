I went to bed on the Thursday-night yesterday was month, and whether she came to bed to me or not I can't tell. I awoke at 5 in the morning, and went down without dressing myself to the clock in the hall, to see what o'clock it was. There I saw her. I ask'd her how she came to be up so soon? She said she was not very well, and was coming up to lie down again. I went into bed, and presently after she came up, and lay down by me with her cloaths on. She desired me several times to get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175507020016"></xptr> up, between 5 and 6, and said she was not very well. I got up about six. She asked me to get her something to drink; and said she was very ill. I said I wou'd make her some mint and balm tea, She said she could not drink it. I said I would get her any thing else. She said she had made herself some caudle, but it was too thick. I ask'd if I should make her any better? She said she did not care if I did. I made her some, and carried it to her. When I went down I was surprised to find the doors open.</p>
               <p>Q. What doors?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. The kitchen door, the necessary-house door, and a door behind it. I went into that place behind the necessary, and look'd about, and miss'd some brickbats out of it. This gave me a suspicion that her distemper was not dropsical, but otherwise; for I saw something about the kitchen that was not there before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. I saw some blood about. She drank the caudle, and lay there after my mistress was got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner of your suspicion when you carried her up the caudle ?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. No; I did not. After she had drank it, I went down into the kitchen again; then I went up to her again, and ask'd her how she did? She said she was no better. Then my mistress rang the bell. This was about 7 o'clock. She ask'd me what o'clock it was: I went and told her. She rang the bell again about 8, and ask'd for the prisoner, who was her own maid. I told her she was very ill, and could not come down. My mistress got up, and went up to see her, and I with her. She told us she was very ill. My mistress came down stairs, and mull'd her some wine, and sent it up to her. I shew'd my mistress what I had observ'd in the kitchen as soon as she went there. After that my mistress sent to Mrs. Haines, a neighbour, to know what was good for her. Mrs. Haines came, and went up to her. When she came down, I told her what I had seen in the kitchen; then she said she thought there was something more than what she had told her was the matter with her; and ask'd me if I had look'd in the necessary? I said no. Sometime after that I look'd down there, and saw some brickbats down in it, and told my mistress of it; and in the afternoon the child was found there; but I was above-stairs when it was found.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see this blood?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. Some on the hand-towel, some on the ground, and some on a piece of flanel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her call in the necessary-house?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. No; I did not. I slept very sound.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any impression in the bed where she lay?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. I could not tell; for I got up in a flurry upon missing her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any preparation she had made of child-bed linnen?</p>
               <p>Dickerson. No; I never saw any.</p>

            . I was sent for to Mr. Hopsore's on the 6th of June, about 8 at night, as near as I can guess. I went up to the prisoner, and found her upo n the bed, and asked her how she did ? She made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know you before?</p>
               <p>Walton. No; I never saw her before. I examined what was the matter with her, and told her she'd had a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been shew'd any thing in the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Walton. No; I had not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman?</p>
               <p>Walton. I am a widow, and a midwife. I asked her where the child was? She said I sentenced her very hard. I said she'd had a child; and bid her tell where it was. She said she'd had none. I told her I was sure of it; and if she had not, there was all that belong to a child with her. Then I went down, and told her mistress there was a child somewhere; and we imagined it to be in the necessary-house. Her mistress took a candle, and went along with me there, and look'd down, and saw a parcel of brickbats there. We called the next door neighbour. He and his man came to search it. I went up to the prisoner, and had finished all there. When I came down, there lay the child by the hall door. I wrap'd it up, and carried it to the prisoner, and bid her look at it, and see what a fine child there was. She looked at it, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this child at full growth?</p>
               <p>Walton. There is no certainty as to that; it had nails on its fingers, and hair on its head. I thought it was at full growth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it male or female?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175507020017"></xptr>Walton. It was a female child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any experiment made in your presence, to know whether it was born alive?</p>
               <p>Walton. No; there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any wounds on it?</p>
               <p>Walton. No; no more than what the brickbats had made. There was a little wound on the arm, another on the thigh, and the head pretty much bruised.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was born alive?</p>
               <p>Walton. There is no certainty as to that.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common, when child-bed pains are coming upon a woman, to have a tendency of going to the necessary-house ?</p>
               <p>Walton. Yes; very often.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had been drawn to the necessary-house by these pains, might not this child suddenly slip from her?</p>
               <p>Walton. It is very possible.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the child, how long might it have been born, do you think?</p>
               <p>Walton. About 14 hours.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. The prisoner being ill, I was sent for. I inquired of the mistress, and the first evidence; and suspected there either had or would be a labour. I ask'd the prisoner a few questions; and told her she should send for a midwife. She told me she had no business with a midwife. I told her there was something in her body that wanted to be fetched away, or she would die before morning. Then she consented. I told her, after the midwife had been with her, I would order her what was proper; but before she had been with her, I could not order her any thing. After the midwife had been with her, she came and told me she'd had a child. Then I ordered her something; and the next day I saw the child in the prisoner's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child at full growth?</p>
               <p>Colebourn. It was as much as I can judge of a child.</p>

               <p>Q. Why was not the experiment made on the child's lungs?</p>
               <p>Colebourn. The coroner asked me whether I thought the child was born alive? I said it was very difficult to distinguish that. After that he said, will you try the experiment upon the lungs ? And there was water brought up. I asked him what he did expect upon that? He said, for me to give a final answer, whether it was born alive or not. Then I declined it, as looking upon it not conclusive.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known a case where the child has been at full growth, and has been stillborn ?</p>
               <p>Colebourn. I have, many.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not women always a tendency to go to stool when in strong labour pains?</p>
               <p>Colebourn. The major part have: I believe 18 in 20.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not that be a reason of her going there?</p>
               <p>Colebourn. I can't say what were her reasons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had occasion to go to the necessary-house, between 4 and 5 o'clock; the clock struck five while I was sitting there. There I had an uncommon pain took me, and the child dropt from me; and I sat there some time before I could stir. I had some child-bed linen, which I made in my spare time; and I had sow'd it into my quilted petticoat by my side. I called when my pains came upon me, but could not make any body hear me. The reason I did not let my child-bed linen be seen, was this; I had lived with my mistress a year and a quarter, if I had staid till the 13th of the last month; and I had no money to support me in my illness, without I had staid my quarter up; and if I had let my case be known before, I should be turn'd away, and not have that quarter's wages.</p>
               <p>To her character.</p>
               <p>Fra. Hathey. I have known the prisoner from a little child. We were both born at Wooten-underhedge in Gloucestershire, from whence she came about a year and an half ago. I lived over-right against her. The children there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175507020018"></xptr> as fond of her as possible, and she seemed to take as much delight in pleasing children. Of all that ever I saw of her I should be far from thinking her guilty of doing a murder.</p>

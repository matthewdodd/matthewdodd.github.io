             I live at the Red-Lion at South Mimms; the prisoner came into my house, and called for a pint of small beer; he sat down in a chair while he was drinking the small beer, and said he had got 2 gowns to sell; I saw them, and were suspicious of his stealing them. I sent for the constable, and had him taken up. We took him before the justice, there he owned he was guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his words ?</p>
               <p>M. Tull. He said, he stole the gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Did h e say where he stole them?</p>
               <p>M. Tull. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to send for Mrs. Emmerton?</p>
               <p>M. Tull. Because there was a man in our house that knew the gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner bring them conceal'd or publickly ?</p>
               <p>M. Tull. He brought them in his hand in a little bit of a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.</p>

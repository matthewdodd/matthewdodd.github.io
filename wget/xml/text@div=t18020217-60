Coming from Bank-side, through Bishopsgate church-yard, I heard a terrible noise; I run till I lit of this man, (Harris) and asked him what it was, he said, somebody had robbed a boy of a bundle; a gentleman came up and took me while we were talking together; I know no more of it than the man in the moon.</p>

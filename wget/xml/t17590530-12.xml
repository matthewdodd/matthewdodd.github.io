               <p>John Knight. I was at my warehouse and sent for home; then I was show'd a pair of shoes, my property, and the prisoner at the bar, whom they had secur'd. My lad can give a farther account. I can say nothing as to the taking the shoes. There was another woman with the prisoner, an old offender, one of a very bad character, sister to the prisoner, but we did not search her. I have made it my business to inquire the character of the prisoner since, and have heard a good character of her.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar and another woman came into my master's shop on the 3 d of May. She said she wanted to be fitted for a pair of shoes. I desired her to walk backwards, because we keep our womens shoes there. I tried one pair on, they seemed to fit her very well. She complained they were too long, so I tried on another pair. She said the same of them. While I was looking for another pair, I happen'd to turn my head round,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300014"></xptr> and saw her take a pair of shoes and put them under her cleak. Then I said we have none will fit you. She ask'd when she must come again, I said in two or three days. Then I call'd my young master. As she was going out of the shop I tapp'd her on the shoulder, and said, Mistress, you have got a pair of shoes. She said she had not. I brought her into the middle of the shop, and said, I desire you will give them to me. Then she pull'd them out from under her cloak.</p>

               <p>As I went into that shop I pick'd up a pair of shoes, and put them under my arm, but not with an intent to bring them away.</p>

               <p>Philipi Croucher. I live in the parish of Christ Church, Surry. My husband keeps a Shoemaker's shop. I have known the prisoner ten years. She once lived servant with me about a year. I never knew any ill of her in my life. I believe what she has done is through necessity, having two children, and but twenty-two years of age.</p>

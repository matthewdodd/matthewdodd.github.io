                  </hi>. I manage the Shears public house, in Chequer Alley, Bunhill Row. On 23d April, the prisoner came and brought me this paper—he asked me to change this cheque; he said this was big share in the property left by his mother; that it was Mr. Ford's writing; that the pro<lb></lb>perty was in the Joint Stock Bank, and I could get it there—I said I had not enough to pay him the whole; I would let him have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said, "Very well"—I let him have it—I went with it to the Joint Stock Bank, and from what they told me, I went to the prisoner's house; I told him they could not pay it till he went and gave his order to receive it; he said he would—I went to him again, and said if he did not go at oncet it would be too late—I went again several times—he said he would go with me to the Joint Stock Bank—I went again; he was out, and had left word he was gone to the bank—I went back to the bank; he was not there—I came back, and found him, about 5 o'clock the same evening, in a public house in Bunhill Row.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in Change Alley. I married a sister of the prisoner—my wife's mother died last Sept.—(<hi rend="italic">Cheque read:</hi> "Please to pay Thomas Balden 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., his share of the proceeds of the property of Mrs. Lucy Balden, deceased.

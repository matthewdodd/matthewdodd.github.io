I had noticed the prisoner and another boy near me - the prisoner came beside me, pushed against me, and snatched it from me; I am certain of his person, and should know the other if I saw him. It contained a 20 l. and a 5 l. bank note; three sovereigns, and some silver; the one who was with the prisoner ran across the road, and the prisoner followed him - I ran after them, and never lost sight of them till he was stopped. I am certain of his person, and declare upon my oath that he is the person who took it from me - he escaped at the time, and I did not see him again for three weeks or a month at Worship-street. I recovered the reticule, it was taken from his hand while he was in my sight, but he got away.</p>

Greening, his companion, was also delivered to me, and I took him to Worship-street, but the Magistrate let him go on his father's recognizance till the Sessions.</p>

I am the father of the last witness—she called me into the shop on a Friday about the end of January, and gave me this half-crown—I saw that it was bad, and asked the prisoner where he got it—he said he did not know, and offered to pay with good money, but would not give it to me until I returned him the bad, which I refused to do—I tested it—he said, "Do not spoil it, because I can get it changed"—that made me suspicious, as he said that he did not know where he got it—I told him I should give him in charge—I had to serve somebody else, and he went out with the tobacco—I laid the half-crown on the desk, and went after him, locking the door of the room—I went out, gave the prisoner in charge, and came back, and gave the constable the half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. These two half-crowns are bad, and from the same mould—I know of no object in keeping rosin with bad money, but it can be used in coining, to clear the dross of the metal—it would make the coin sticky by being in the pocket—chalk would do away with the greasiness, but in connection with the rosin it would leave a stickiness.</p>

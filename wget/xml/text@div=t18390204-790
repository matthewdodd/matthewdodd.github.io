                  </hi>. I am a poulterer and cheesemonger, and live in Church-street, Hackney. On the 2nd of February, in consequence of information from the witness Ogan, I looked at the poultry that was exposed for sale, and missed a fowl—I went with Ogan to the Old Mer<lb></lb>maid—he there pointed out the prisoner to me, and told me his name, and said, "That is the person that stole the fowl"—I said, "Come, Mr. Harvey, give me the fowl, let us have no bother about it, all I want is my fowl"—he denied all knowledge of it—I saw a fowl afterwards taken out from between some water-butts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Church-street, Hackney. I was standing at my father's door on Saturday evening, the 2nd of February, directly opposite the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner pass with three others, and as he passed, he took a fowl from the prose<lb></lb>cutor's window, passed it along to the other three, and turned up the old Mermaid-yard, which is close by—I immediately ran and informed the prosecutor, told him the prisoner's name, and went with him into the Mermaid public-house, where I found the prisoner, with others, in the parlour—the water-butts, where the for was taken from, are up the yard, a little distance from the door—the prisoner would have an opportunity of putting it there before he went into the house.</p>

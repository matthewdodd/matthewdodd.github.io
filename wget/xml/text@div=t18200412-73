            . I slept with Brees. About four o'clock in the morning, I heard the door open, which awoke me. I called to the prisoner, who was in the room out of bed. I heard him dress himself, he said nothing. I asked</p>
               <p>"Who was there again?" he said, me. I said</p>
               <p>"What are you doing?" he said, nothing. I jumped up found my clothes and my box as they ought to be, but found my watch taken from my pocket. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is my watch?" he said I do not know, I saw it on the table just now; and at that time I saw my watch in his hand, and saw him put it on the table. Brees jumped up and enquired for his watch. He said he did know - he then put his hand in his pocket, and delivered it up. Brees's clothes were on the bed. My watch is worth 2 l. We sent for the watchman. There is a lamp opposite the window which enabled me to see the prisoner at the table. He had both the watches.</p>

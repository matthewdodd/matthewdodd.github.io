On 15th July, I was on duty in plain clothes in Westbourne-park-road, Paddington, and saw the prisoners and another loitering about; I watched them up the Harrow-road, into Johnson's mews—Joseph came to me and asked me if I had a lucifer; I told him I had not—he went away into the mews and whistled—I followed him and saw Benjamin and another man on the wall at the rear of the public house, and asked what they were doing—Joseph never said a word, but pulled a chisel from his pocket and struck me on the left side of the head with the iron end of it, twice—it cut me in two places, and the blood flowed—I took hold of him, and called, "Police!" and Benjamin and the other man came up to me, and each struck me with a chisel; the right side of my head was cut open, and the doctor afterwards took two pieces of bone out—the two prisoners gave me three wounds—a constable came and took Joseph into custody, and Benjamin was taken afterwards—I took this chisel from Joseph (<hi rend="italic">this being produced was about a foot and a half long</hi>)—Joseph also struck me with his fist on the side of my head—a doctor came to the station and dressed my wounds—the other chisel was as large as this one.</p>

About half-past 1 o'clock, on the morning of 15th July, I was on duty in Westbourne-gardens, and heard a cry of "Police!" in the direction of Johnson's Mews—before I got there I saw two men run away, but did not see their faces—I found Monaghan there and the prisoner Joseph—they had hold of each other—Monaghan said the men had struck him with a chisel, which I saw he had got, and I found another chisel about five yards off—as I was going up to them I saw Joseph strike Monaghan twice on the side of the head with his fist—Monaghan's face was covered with blood—I took Joseph into my custody, and told him he must go to the station—he did not say a word—I saw several marks of blood on his jacket.</p>

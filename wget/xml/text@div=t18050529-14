             sworn. - I keep a shoe-cellar in Monmouth-street: I saw the prisoner speak to the child as she was sitting on the steps; she said, my dear, will you go along with me to Covent-Garden market, I have got something nice in my pocket to give you; I just turned my head, and said, that woman is going to steal Mrs. Thompson's child; the child said, yes; the prisoner had a long red cloak on; she put the cloak she had on over the child, and took her by the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did she go with the child? - A. About three yards, and the child walked with her; I then went up to her, and said, you hussey, you, how came you to steal that child away from the door; she said she was only going to take the child to shew her the way to Covent-Garden market.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman? - A. She attempted to run away, but the people having increased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290012"></xptr>they took her to the watch-house, and I took care of the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she lame as she is now? - A. Yes, she had a stick and a little black dog; she was very black, and in a dirty state.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was a stranger to that end of the town; I came through Monmouth-street, to a door where there fat a child on the threshold of the door, and another girl walking in the street directed me the nearest way to Covent-Garden market; she said, what is that you are saying to the child, and up with her foot and gave me a blow on the small of my back.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hughes.) Did you give her a blow with your foot? - A. No, I only took the child from her; neither was there any other girl at the door or in the street at the time.</p>

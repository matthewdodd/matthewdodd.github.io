In the night of the21st of April, or the morning of the 22nd, about two o'clock; I was awoke by my eldest daughter, and in consequence of what she said, I went into her room, and discovered that almost every article of box or trunk had been rummaged - I do not mean that all the contents were gone, but some were gone; they had been well examined - the boxes were not broken open: a watch, which hung at my daughter's bed-head, had also been removed - I was the last person up the night before, and went to bed about eleven o'clock; I examined every part of the house at that time, and saw it was perfectly secure, the doors, windows, and every thing; in the morning I found a pannel moved from the back-door of the house, leading to the garden, by means of a centre-bit - it appeared they had got in through the aperture, which was quite large enough to admit a body; the door was wide open - they had also unbolted the front door, and unlocked it; that had evidently been opened from within, and I suppose, with a view to get out that way - I made an alarm in front of the house on my daughter giving the alarm; a watchman appeared, and came over the yard to the back door - I then went down, and observed things as I have stated; I, the watchman, and aninspector of the watch of an adjoining parish, examined the premises behind - we found a small crow-bar in the kitchen, a stick by the back-door at which they entered, and a hat and a round for cap in the timber-yard at the side of the premises; I had a watch-dog in the yard - I believe it was partly a bull-dog; it was perfectly well over night, about eight or nine o'clock, when I saw him, and in the morning he appeared in extreme agony - his hind-quarters seemed in great weakness, and about six o'clock that morning he died; I thought I observed a swelling about his neck - he was skinned after death, but I did not see the carcase; I prosecuted a man, named King, for this felony. Having found the cap, stick, and hat on the premises, I made application at Lambeth-street next morning; Shelswell accompanied me to where the hat and cap were - I shewed them to him; he has had them ever since - in consequence of my application to the Police, the prisoner was apprehended about the 16th of May last; he was examined and remanded, probably about seven times, and was not detained on this charge.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, in consequence of some disclosures, did you employ the Police again? A. I went to Lambeth-street in consequence of information, and got a search warrant - I went with the officers to execute it; we called on the prisoner's wife on Fish-street-hill, where she worked - we took her from there to her lodgings, in Prince's-place, Walworth-common, Surrey; we were introduced to the sleeping-room of the wife, made search, and there we found a pair of bracelet-snaps in a small box - I supposed them to belong to my daughter, and in consequence of what she said, I returned to the premises, and found a pair of gold ear-rings, and brought them away in consequence of a description from her - Shelswell has got them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have said the prisoner was in custody on another charge - do you happen to know he has been acquitted on that charge? A. Yes - I think it was on the 5th of August that I searched the premises at Walworth; I have ascertained that the prisoner and his wife have been some time separated - I found the wife living in Prince's-place; I understand the prisoner was not living there - he was not apprehended there, certainly; I found nothing but the bracelet-snaps and earrings, that I claimed - they are not of much value, and a very small portion of the property stolen; in the first instance, the bracelet-snaps were said to belong to the prisoner's wife's sister - his wife's sister said so; the same person has claimed the ear-rings - I did not see that my dog bled at all; I suppose he had been beaten to death, because there appeared to be a swelling on the neck - it might be half an inch larger than the night before.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was the value of the property you lost that night? A. I suppose 20l. or less would replace the whole that was taken away - I first saw the prisoner in custody in the middle of May; he was in custody from that time till the Croydon Assizes - his wife was at large when I saw her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear any noise in the night? A. I heard footsteps when I left my room to go to my daughter's, when she gave the alarm about two o'clock - they were not my daughter's footsteps; they were down stairs by the back-door of the house, and could not be the footsteps of any of my family - I have a wife and seven children; I did not hear the dog cry at all - my daughter did not come into my room; she gave the alarm by knocking at the door - I was asleep when she gave the alarm.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on the night of the 21st of April, near Mr. Newton's house - in the course of the evening I saw some very suspicious looking people, and directed my attention to the people passing and repassing, and among them was James Brown, who was convicted last Session; and I observed the prisoner at the bar - I saw them together; they were passing between eleven and twelve o'clock - about half past eleven they were passing by Mr. Stevens' oil-shop, about twenty-five yards from Mr. Newton's.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - speak advisedly, and tell me whether he is the man? A. I know him perfectly well -I have not the least doubt of his person; he had, to the best of my recollection, a round hairy cap on, and a stick in his hand - I did not notice his dress further; I had seen him about my beat before, and knew his person before -I was relieved about a quarter to one o'clock; Mallett succeeded me - I gave him notice to be vigilant and attentive, having some suspicion on my mind respecting those two men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. One man has been already executed for this robbery? A. He has; I recollect giving evidence on the former trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you state on that former examination, that you saw two men, one of whom you knew, and the other you did not know? A. No, I did not say exactly that -I said I saw two men, and the prisoner 
               <persName id="t18290910-169-person1602">Brown</persName>
             I knew well; I do not recollect your asking if I had as good a knowledge of the other as I had of Brown - I will swear I did not say I did not know the other; I went before the Magistrate in May, and stated that I knew them both - I stated what I have stated here; the prisoner was not discharged - he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100081"></xptr>manded; I believe he was not at that time in custody for another offence-I believe no bill was preferred against him for this offence till now; there was a Session here in June and July-no bill was preferred against him at those Sessions, that I know of; I expect I was not more than ten yards from the two persons I saw - I never swore I was not more than one hundred yards; I believe I did state, on the last trial, that I knew one of them better than the other-I recollect I did say so; and that the prisoner I knew so well was Brown.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Brown tried here at the Session next after you had been before the Justice? A. I believe he was-I believe there has been a session between that and the present; I have not a doubt of the prisoner being the man I saw that night-one was about a head taller than the other; the prisoner was the tallest-I always described him so: the tall man had the cap and stick.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have said at the trial here last Session, that you knew one better than the other? A. I had seen one oftener than the other; the expression I made use of might be that I knew one better than the other - I have no doubt of the prisoner, but I had known the other longer; I recollect the prisoner about the neighbourhood for three or four months; I considered that he did not live faroff-I did not know his name, but knew his person for three or four months before the robbery; I never spoke to either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to notice him so as to know him again? A. I had frequently seen him as I have desribed, with a cap and stick, the same sort of hair cap; I never heard him speak, to my knowledge - I never knew his business, or where he lived, but considered he lived across the Commercial-road, by seeing him go srequently that way.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you appeared at the several examinations, and Brown was committed, was he committed alone? A. He was; the prisoner was not committed with him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mile-end, and succeeded Andrews on his beat at one o'clock on this night - he said something to me about some men; about two o'clock Mr. Newton called out of window for assistance-I went to the house, and saw a person making his escape over the pales in front of Newton's premises; he saw me, retreated back, and made his escape at the back of the premises - I did not see him escape; I was near him when he got over the pales in front-I did not see more than one man on the premises; I saw two men coming from the premises, by the gas-lights at the Bedford Arms, which are at the back of the premises-I observed as they ran by the light, that one had a hat on, and one was a head taller than the other; the one who had not hat on was the tallest-I cannot positively say whether the other had a cap, but I believe he had neither hat nor cap on; I am positive he had no hat-I could not see them so distinctly as to swear to them, other wise than by their size; Andrews had mentioned to me about some men he wished me to have an eye upon, and the two men agreed in size with his description.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you venture to swear that you stated on the former trial, that the man had no hat on? A. I said I could swear the short one had a hat on; I think I said the other had no hat on, nor cap - I will swear I stated so; I said the bind one had a hat on - the short one was the hind one; the other had passed the gas-light- I think I stated the other had passed the gas-light before I could discern him, but I stated he had no hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state he had passed the gas-light, and you could not see what he had on? A. I do not recollect stating any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not? A. I believe I did - well, I did; I could not see what he had on, by the gaslight - I could not see what he had on.</p>

               <p>Q. Then, what do you mean by swearing that he had not a hat? A. That is the best statement I can give - I said I could not see what he had on; I saw him after he had passed the gas-light, and then I am positive he had no hat on - I pursued him after he passed the gas-light; I had not been pursuing him two minutes when the short one passed the gas-light. I stated on the last trial that I had a great coat on, and the man kept gaining ground on me; I have not said now that I was nearer to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said you saw him nearer after he passed the gas-light than before, and he had no hat on then? A. Well, I do not know but I might be nearer; they did gain ground - I believe I said on the last trial that he had no hat on; I will swear I did: I believe I did not state that I could not tell what he had - I said he certainly passed the gas-light before the other, and I could see the other clearer than the first, but to the best of my recollection I said he had no hat - I did state so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly certain that you swore he had no hat? A. I really forget now; I stated on the former trial that I saw he had no hat on - I am quite positive of that, but the other one I saw clearer than him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the former trial Brown was the only person tried? A. Yes; very few questions were put to me respecting the tall one.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you not asked by the counsel for the prosecution on the former occasion, whether you could or not say what the other man had on? A. I think I stated I could not see him so perfect as the other - I was not asked whether he had a hat or not; I believe I was not asked whether I could see what he had on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state positively that you said on the former occasion that the other had no hat on? A. I think I did not state no such thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are we to understand by that - you are asked whether you recollect the tall man? A. I believe the question was never put to me.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. CLARKSON. I certainly stated I could not see him so clear as the other, but I think I said in my first statement, that he had no hat on, if I have a recollection - I believe I did not state on the former occasion that I could not see what the other had on; I said he had no hat on, but that Brown had a hat - I do not recollect stating that I did not know what he had on; I think I stated he had no hat - I did not state that I could not see what he had on</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Brown alone was on trial then? A. Yes; the Judge asked the questions on that trial; Brown's counsel did not cross-examine me about the manner the tall man was dressed - I believe he asked how far I was off, and whether I was in a box; he asked very few questions - I do not recollect his asking me about the tall man at all.</p>

On the 22d of April, about ten minutes past two o'clock in the morning, I went to Mr. Newton's premises; before I reached the back door, I stumbled over some articles of wearing-apparel; I did not see any person on the premises - I found the pannel of the door taken out by a centre-bit; a person pointed out where he had seen a man getting over the front, and then retreating back; I then traced footsteps over four or five garden-walls towards Bedford-street - I think they were the steps of two persons - I stumbled over some wearing-apparel, which Newton has; I found a hat and a cap stuffed in it, and also a walking-stick and small crow-bar; I brought the crow-bar here at the last trial - the cap was a round hairy one - (Shelswell here produced the cup and stick.)</p>

            . I belong to Lambeth-street. This stick and cap were brought to me by Shelswell; after seeing them I went to No. 43, Rose-lane, Spitalfields, and apprehended the prisoner, suspecting he was the person, having seen him wear a cap similar to that, and carry a stick like that frequently - he lodged there; I knew that before - he was coming down stairs; we desired him to go up again, and when we got into the room I told him I wanted him for a robbery; he said, "What robbery?" I told him for a robbery down the road, meaning the Commercial-road: he said if any one wanted him, they might come there (to his lodgings) to see him; I told him that was not the way I did business, he must go to the office - he then went to the fire-place, took up a poker, made use of many oaths, and said he would not go; that I only wanted him to give him trouble; I told him he had better put the poker down - if he did not, we should certainly shoot him; Shelswell had a pistol, and pulled it out; he then sat down, and afterwards said he would go quietly; I searched the room, and found a crow-bar, dark-lantern, matches, phosphorus-box, and skeleton-key - I took him to the office; he underwent several examinations, and was not committed on that charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was this? A. On the 16th of May; I knew he had lodged in Rose-lane two days before, and have ascertained since that he had been there three weeks - I have since ascertained that he was living separate from his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you tell whether, though they might live in separate places, he was not frequently with her? A. I cannot; she lived at that time in Prince's-place, Walworth.</p>

            . I am an officer. The things produced are the same as were found at the prisoner's lodging; this is the cap and stick found at the prosecutor's premises - I know the prisoner, and knew his wife; I saw them together in February last; the prisoner was dressed in a blue jacket and trousers, and a hairy cap, as much like this as possible: in August last I and Mr. Newton called on the prisoner's wife; she went with us to her lodging in Prince's-place, Walworth; I had not seen them together there in February; that was at the George, George-yard, Whitechapel - we found a pair of bracelet snaps, in a small box, in the prisoner's wife's room; Newton wished to take them for his daughter to see, and we took them to her; in consequence of what she said, we went back again, and found a pair of ear-rings - Miss Newton had described some ear-rings; it was that induced us to bring them away, and nothing else; they were in the same box as the snaps - I saw the cap and stick on the morning after the robbery; Newton gave me some description; I knew the prisoner was in the habit of wearing blue trousers and a hairy cap; as soon as I saw the cap I took it up, and suspected it belonged to the prisoner at that time, and desired Newton to keep it safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you search at Walworth? A. On the 5th of August; I was before the Magistrate in May, and stated all I knew; I have not seen the prisoner and his wife together since February; I do not know whether they have lived separate since then - I knew his wife was living in Prince's-place, and he in Rose-lane.</p>

            . I live in Prince's-lane, Walworth-common; I am the prisoner's wife's sister. The search was made at my house in August; she had lived in that house ever since the latter end of October - I have not seen her husband with her since October last, I am positive; I do not know Sarah Stevens, nor Samuel Barwick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have they, to your knowledge, since October lived separate? A. Yes; these bracelet-snaps were found at my house in possession of the prisoner's wife; I know them - I do not know whose property they are; I know nothing of them; I had a pair of ear-rings like these; if these are not them, they are exactly the same pattern (looking at them); they were my husband's mother's, and one was broken in her ear when she was dying, twenty-five years ago last June; one of these are broken - to the best of my belief they are the same.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had they been in your possession since your mother died? A. They have never been out of my possession - the box was mine; my sister had nothing there; she had free access to my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively these are your mother's ear-rings? A. No, because there are so many nlike.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the things were in your box; did she keep any thing in your box? A. Yes, she kept articles of her own in it; the box is in my possession now.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I thought you said you had known the prisoner and his wife a year and a half? A.

               <p>Q. Well, but in the same course of time have you seen them going to visit the brother? A. Each going, certainly - it has not been half a dozen times I should think.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you seen each going to your house separately at different times? A. I do not know that I have; I think I have seen the prisoner at my house more than once, but not in her company, not to my knowledge.</p>

            . I live with my father. On the night of the 21st of April I heard a noise in the house, and alarmed my father about half-past one o'clock; my room was plundered - I lost a watch from my bed, and a box containing some trinkets (looking at the bracelet snaps) - I think these are mine; I have a very strong opinion of it; I had such a pair like them in all particulars, but no particular mark on them; I had a pair of ear-rings, which I described to my father and the officer when they brought the snaps - these are them I am positive (looking at them) - I have not the least doubt about them; I have bad them eight or ten years - they were given to me by my aunt Drysdale; I broke one after they were given to me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not speak positively to the snaps, but think they are yours? A. Yes; I am positive of the ear-rings by the colour, and the manner in which they are broken; I believe them to be a common pattern.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you only know them by the break? A. I know them by the look and appearance - they are the same colour, make, and shape altogether; and are set the same as what I lost; I should not have the least hesitation in saying they were what I lost if I had seen them any where; I should not have known them so well if I had not broken them.</p>

            . I am Miss Newton's aunt. I gave her a pair of ear-rings; I had had them between seven and eight years when I gave them to her, which was ten years ago - these produced are the same I am quite sure; I should know them as well if they were whole as broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What enables you to speak positively to them? A. Because I had them so many years before I gave them to her; they are not a very common pattern - I never saw any like them; I bought them of Mr. Coffee, Commercial road, opposite Bermondsey-street; I know them by the shape of the stone and the colour of the stone; they are a particular dark cornelian; I may not have seen them for a year or a year and a half till they were before the Magistrate; they were broken when I saw them last-I knew them by nothing but the darkness of the cornelian. and the shape; I was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see them there? A. Yes, and had no doubt about them; there is now a part of the broken piece left on the joint, but I had not noticed that.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury, - I beg leave to state that I have been unfortunately tried capitally three times within the short space of three weeks, and am the victim of a foul conspiracy of the officers of Lambeth-street; I do not know why; they have declared, since I have been in custody, that they would hang me if there was a possibility to do it; there must be something more than the ends of justice attached to that - I have no more to say, but trust entirely to your superior judgment; as to the officers speaking to my identity, if they had given such evidence at the office I should have been committed for trial with the unfortunate Brown, and they had it all fresh in their memory then.</p>

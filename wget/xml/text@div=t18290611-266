The prisoner came there on the 8th of June; there was a drawer of ribbons standing before her - I was waiting on another lady - I saw the prisoner take a piece of ribbon, and put it under her shawl - I then saw her take two more pieces, and put under her shawl on the other side - I went to her, and she said, "What is the price of this?" - I said,"Three-halfpence" - she bought one yard of it; when she had gone out I fetched her back - she opened her shawl, and a young man saw her throw down the ribbon which she had taken.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ROE. I was in the next shop - the prisoner was brought back into the shop, where I was - I saw her throw this piece of ribbon down in the middle of the shop under the table - I took it up - there are nineteen yards of it - it is worth eighteenpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not drop any thing. Witness. Yes, you did, and I took it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You looked about the shop, and found this ribbon, and then you asked the females there if they had had that ribbon, and they said, No - then you said,"You must have bought it." A. No, I saw you throw it down - I fancied I saw you throwing something.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took nothing out of the shop but what I purchased - I said, if you will bring a female, I will strip entirely - this young lad looked about for some time, and then be asked the females if they had had it; they said, "No, not since Saturday" - then he said, "You must have had it."</p>

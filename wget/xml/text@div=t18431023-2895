I commanded the ship Saracen, on the coast of Africa, from about October, 1837, to June, 1841—I was en<lb></lb>gaged there for the protection of British commerce and the prevention of the slave-trade—she was a man-of-war—I became acquainted with the river Gal<lb></lb>linas</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know of any other trade or commerce carried on there except the slave-trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever—I was at the whole of the slave establish<lb></lb>ments I have mentioned, went over them all before they were destroyed, and saw nothing but the slave-trade—if there had been any commerce carried on I must have known it—a merchant named Ignatio Rolo was on board the <hi rend="italic">Sara-cen</hi> for near two days—Captain Denman had taken a slave-ship, and he was taken—I never saw him buy or sell a slave; but as far as I know a grocer's trade, I should certainly say, he was wholly and solely a slave dealer—he re<lb></lb>sided at Jacria, a slave establishment—I went all over his stores, and every thing; there was po sign of anything there but the slave-trade—I never saw him there—I did not see him in any occupation—it must have been in No<lb></lb>vember that I saw him, a day or two previous to our going into the Gal<lb></lb>linas to make some arrangements with the chiefs—there is no establish<lb></lb>ment there called by his name—Jacria is the establishment there—he came on board the slave vessel, and was detained by the prize-officer—he is a Spaniard, to the best of my belief—I was not personally acquainted with a merchant named Alvarez—I knew Don Ximinez there, and have seen him at Sierra Leone as well—we fell in with a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi>, several times, and chased her, we finally succeeded in taking her, in April, 1839—she was sailing under Russian colours—a man named Thomas Bernardos was commander of the vessel at that time—the crew were chiefly Spaniards—there might have been one or two Portuguese—she was equipped for the slave-trade, there was no doubt of it in my eyes—she had more water-casks than were ne<lb></lb>cessary for an ordinary or fair trader—they are large vessels called leagers—any vessel may have leagers on board, but she had a larger quantity than was necessary for a merchant vessel, considerably larger, and that is one of the</p>

               <p>fittings of a vessel engaged in the slave-trade, and are forbidden articles, pro<lb></lb>hibited to be used by foreign powers—she had a sliding cabouse, which held a very large copper—that is another article which is also prohibited—the hatches were covered over with temporary planks—there were some other trifling things quite sufficient, according to our treaties with foreign powers, to authorize me to seize her, as a vessel equipped for the slave-trade, had she been under the Spanish flag—I seized her, believing her to be Spanish, although sailing under the Russian flag, but it did not appear by the papers that she had been in a Russian port—I sent her to Sierra Leone, and tried to prosecute her in the British and Spanish mixed Com<lb></lb>mission Court, as a Spanish vessel, but she was not received into Court, being under the Russian flag, and with Russian papers—I then determined to send her to England, that the Lords of the Admiralty might dispose of her as they thought proper, because I felt fully satisfied she could not be a Rus<lb></lb>sian vessel—I sent her to England to be condemned as a slaver—Bernardos went in her to England, but previous to sending her to England I tried her a second time, in the mixed Commission of Sierra Leone—in February, 1841, I again saw that same vessel at anchor at the Gallinas—she anchored at I went on board of her—she wns then named the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, and was under the English flag—I am perfectly satisfied it was the same vessel I had captured before—I found a man named Jennings in command of the vessel at that time—I asked for the ship's papers directly I went on board, and got them—it is my duty to demand the papers, and I received them on demanding them—I received other papers afterwards—after receiving the ship's papers in the first instance I returned them to Jennings; and on his refusing to answer a question which he was bound to answer me, as commanding a British man-of-war, I insisted on detaining the vessel till that question was answered—I afterwards received a packet of papers from Jennings—I took them on board my own vessel, on purpose to read them—I left an officer in charge of the vessel—I detained the vessel—she was afterwards taken to Sierra Leone—I prosecuted her there, and she was afterwards condemned in the Vice-Admi<lb></lb>ralty Court—I have seen nothing of the vessel since.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you say, that although you were for some two or three years cruising on the coast of Africa, it was not till Nov. 1840, that you landed at the Gallinas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I landed on an island in the river, for about half an hour previous to that—with that exception, I had not landed at the Gallinas—there are several villages up the river Gallinas inhabited by natives—the river Gallinas extends some distance into the inte<lb></lb>rior, at least 1 believe so—I have been up it perhaps ten or a dozen miles, and there is a native village called Mina, another called Tardia, and another called Tiendo—I have been up it at least twelve miles—I cannot say whether the river is navigable farther up than I went, I should think not from the appearance of it, except for canoes—I cannot say that the people could pass considerably higher up—I did not see canoes higher up than where I went, nor could I see far up, as rivers are always very winding—as high as I went it was navigable for canoes, but I never saw canoes there—I was on this coast for the protec<lb></lb>tion of British commerce, and for the prevention of the slave-trade—that commerce consisted, among other things, in the exportation of the merchandise of Britain to various places on the coast of Africa—I know that British merchan<lb></lb>dize, in British and other vessels, is exported to a very considerable extant to various parts of the coast of Africa.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that British merchandize, to a very considerable extent, is from time to time exported to the Gallinas in a lawful manner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known English vessels arrive at the Gallinas, and part with a little of their cargo—I have never known an instance, before the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, of an English</p>

               <p>vessel arriving at Gallinas consigned to deliver her cargo—I have known one English vessels dispose of part of their cargo at the Galiinas, but I do not know of its being for a lawful purpose; because I am fully satisfied that from the Gallinas there is no export but slaves, therefore I cannot think it was lawful—I have known British vessels sell part of their cargo, but I doubt whether it was for lawful purposes, because there was no produce in exchange for it—I never knew of ivory or palm oil being exported from the Gallinas—I am only speaking of the period of my knowing the Gallinas—I hare never known British produce or mechandize landed there, without doubting the legality of its purpose, because there was no produce to give in exchange, no produce to be met with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment was there anything illegal in the landing of British produce, for the use either of the native chiefs or inhabitants of the towns or villages you speak of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a question which I cannot presume to answer—I seized this vessel because I considered her trade to be illegal—I have seen a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi>—I think she landed goods at the Gallinas—if that is the vessel I mean, she was commanded by a man named Sargeant; at least I think he landed some goods there—I did not see him—he gave me to understand that he did, and received something in exchange—I think the <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> was there while my vessel was there—I did not think it necessary to seise the <hi rend="italic">Gil Bias</hi>—I heard from the man who commanded her, that goods were landed there—I was not present when he sold them, nor do I know to whom he delivered them; but he gave me to understand he had sold those goods to Pedro Blanco—Sergeant brought off to me from Pedro Blanco a dozen fowls and a sheep, which I was very glad of—I had never seen Pedro Blanco in my life—I had had no fresh provisions for some little time, and he gave me to understand the dozen capons had come from Marseilles, in a vessel Wnieh had that morning tailed with slaves—I cannot remember how long the <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> was off the Gallinas—it might have been a day or two—I do not know of any other vessels that landed goods there, which I never thought of seising—I do not remember ever seeing the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> there—I do not remember the name—I do not remember a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">L'Inferna</hi>—I think I remember the name of the <hi rend="italic">Milford</hi>—uhe did not, to my knowledge, land goods to a very large amount at Gallinas—I do not remember the <hi rend="italic">Sublime</hi>—I was on a cruising visit—my station was extensive—I was a good deal at the Gallinas, because it was a noted slave place—I sometimes remained at anchor there two or three days together, and sometimes my doty would call me away for two or three months together—it is impossible for me to say what goods were landed there—I can only guess at the population of the villages—I should say that Tiendo there might, perhaps have been 800 or 900, at Tardia 200, and Mina 700 or 800, but it is only guess, from casually visiting there—there is another native town further down the river, the name of which I do not know—I only saw it—it was not thickly populated, by any means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As far as you could judge, is not British commerce to the coast of Africa exceedingly serviceable to the natives? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That depends on which way it is to be taken—if British commerce is to be employed in the slave-trade, I doubt its being serviceable to the natives—my station extended from Portan<lb></lb>dicque down to Madagascar—undoubtedly British commerce must be of great benefit to Africa.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Within your own experience on the coast of Africa, is not a lawful trade carried on to a considerable extent by the same persons who likewise carry on the slave-trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not seen those persons trading, and therefore I cannot say—I do not hesitate in saying that I believe, in many Places on the coast of Africa, the same trade is carried on by the same per<lb></lb>sons,</p>

               <p>both the slave-trade and exchange of the produce of the coontry, but I do not believe that to be the caw at the Gallinas—I do not think at the Gallinas there is any trade but the slave-trade—speaking from heartsay, I should say that, at many places on the coast, a lawful trade and the slave-trade is carried on by the same persons; but, at the Gallinas, I am as confident there was not, as it is possible to be from my experience of the place for a long time, from being on the spot—I have been a great deal off Gallinas, and during that period I saw no other trade, nor the sign of any other trade, than the slave-trade—I state that from my knowledge derived from my personal presence at Gallinas—officers in my situation are entitled to a share in the value of the vessel seized, if condemned—supposing a vessel and carge to be of the value of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., condemned in the Vice-Admiralty Court, half the proceeds would go to the Crown, and the other half would be divided among the captors, after all the expenses were paid, of which the admiral gets one-tenth, and the captain gets one-eighth of the remainder—I think that is it, to the best of my knowledge—if the vessel be condemned in the mixed commission, I believe it is nearly the same, but half goes to the nation under whose flag she is sailing—a mixed commission court is a commission com<lb></lb>posed of commissioners of two or various nations, to determine cases of foreign vessels—the Act of Parliament authorises us to seize Portuguese vessels, and prosecute them in the Vice-Admiralty Court—I do not know exactly how the proceeds were to be divided—the mixed commission decides on Spanish or Portuguese vessels, and the British Vice-Admiralty Court decides on vessels sailing under British colours—I do not remember having ever seen a Spunk vessel with a British captain—when I first seized the vessel under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi>, she was not in every respect fitted up for the slave-trade—I do not think she had a slave deck—she was in many respects fitted up for the slave-trade, and that led me to seise her—I sent her to England, and know nothing more of her—I heard nothing from the Admiralty about her—when she bore the name of the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi>, and I seized her from Jennings, she was certainly not, in my opinion, fitted up for the slave-trade—I did not seize her for that the second time—I seized her for her trade—I saw nothing I do not know what might have been under her cargo—I was on the coast of Africa from Oct. 1837 till June 1841, and from Dec. 1838 until April or May 1841 Gallinas was within my station in the first instance—I had charge of a station, during that period, from Admiral Camphell, extending from Cape Palmas up to Cape de Verde Islands, and then there was another senior officer, Captain Denman, appointed—the extent of coast over which my duty extended varied according to the orders I received—from Oct. 1837 till Dec. 1838 I was on the coast, at different parts, from Sierra Leone as far as Madagascar, but from Dec. 1838 till I left the coast of Africa in May or June 1841 it was confined to the coast between Cape Palmas, Portan<lb></lb>dique, and the De Verde Islands—I was up at Portandique for a month—my duty extended over about 1000 miles, I suppose—the sort of British com<lb></lb>merce exported to Africa during that period was gunpowder, muskets, brandy, tobacco, and cotton goods—I do not think it is possible to distinguish articles for the slave-trade and articles for British commerce, at least I do not know how to distinguish them.</p>

I remem<lb></lb>ber the <hi rend="italic">Golupchick</hi> being there in 1840, and while there, I went on board her—I was employed to do something to the water casks—they were double leagers—they were different sizes, but these would contain about 1,000 gal<lb></lb>lons each—there were about a dozen—they were entire when I first went on board—they were found on either side of it, full of water—Mottley, appa<lb></lb>rently, assumed the command of the vessel at that time—I saw Jennings there—I did not know Bernardos—I received directions from a person calling him<lb></lb>self Jennings—he gave me directions to do something with the casks—he took me on board the vessel in the shipwright's boat—I found the casks full of water in the hold of the vessel—I think of the larger kind there was about twelve, and I should say fifty of the smaller—I numbered each stave of the large casks; I rased them with a proper rase-iron which coopers use, their took the hoops from them, took the casks down, put the hoops inside, and made close bundles of them, so that they could be put together again—I re<lb></lb>ballasted the vessel, and stowed them on the top of the ballast in packs, each cask in a separate pack—I did the same with the smaller ones, and left others for water for the voyage—it took me from the 8th to the 19th of Sept. 1840 to do this—while, on the vessel, after putting the large casks into the hold, my attention Was attracted by a noise in one of the smaller casks, which proved to be what was called shackles when I was in the West India trade—I did not count them, but consider, from their weight and appearance, there were nearly 200 pairs—nothing was done with them while I was there—to all appearance they had been in the vessel before—I left the cask nearly in the same place as I found it—we did not take that cask to pieces; we took the head out, hearing the noise—I did not put the head in again myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you the means while in this river Gallinas, from time to time, of ascertaining how many towns or villages there were, as far up the river as you went? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were, to my know<lb></lb>ledge, some three, or four, or five towns on different branches of the river—there are several branches to the river—I went up about ten or twelve miles, I suppose—I am positive there was no trade but slave-trade carried on there—every vessel that landed a cargo there I knew of during a period of ten months, most particularly from March, or April, 1840, till Feb. 1841—I never heard of a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Sublime</hi> landing merchandise there to the value of 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., during that period—I do not at all deny that vessels have landed cargoes there to a very large amount—I say that the slave-trade is exclusive, because no produce in return was exported, nothing but slaves—there are two branches of import to Gallinas—one is the provisions which the slave-traders there eat, and the other the goods which are used by the slave-dealers to buy slaves with—there is no produce exported from there—I do not mean to say to a hundred-weight or a ton, but nothing to be called produce, to be exported—I have known the Gallinas since 1835, and though I have more particularly directed my attention to it for the ten months: I was in charge of that station for two years, during the whole of which time I had vessels stationed at Gallinas, and had reports from that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As you have stated there was nothing but the slave-trade carried on there, and that there are no exports, do you mean to include or exclude from your observation the fact of merchandise being landed and purchased there, and being paid for in money, so that a stranger carrying it there, and selling it, and receiving money, would not know but the whole proceeding was per<lb></lb>fectly lawful? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My answer to that is, that persons who land cargoes at Gallinas, in that way, would not be guilty of slave-trading, but all those goods would of necessity go towards slave-trade, because nothing but slave-trade is in existence—the natives have no money to pay for goods, except money that comes from the slave-trade or slaves—there is no produce, and no money coined in that country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As regards a shipper from this country, supposing any one shipped not as agent, but on his own account, and that he receives money for what he exports, do you mean that there is any slave-trading in that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not of necessity, supposing he did not know the circumstances.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230070"></xptr>
               <p>that ever happens? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never known of such a case—there is no English trade carried on in fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the time you were there, do you mean that no English vessels went there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three English vessels passed, and had a little proceeding, the <hi rend="italic">Augusta</hi> for one—I know, from the statement of the chiefs to me, that there was no trade there—I do not know of the <hi rend="italic">sub<lb></lb>lime</hi> landing goods and disposing of them to the amount of 13,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no such vessel was there during the two years I was there—I think I can positively say that, certainly not for the ten months—the trade I have described has taken place there since 1835, to my knowledge, the landing of goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In 1837, do you know of a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Milford</hi>, having carried goods, and landed, and sold goods at the Gallinas, to the amount of between 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in another part of the world at the time—I have no reason to doubt it—it is very possible—that does not alter the ques<lb></lb>tion, in my opinion, as to whether it was for the slave-trade or not—I know very well that the slave-trade exists, and that 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods was landed there, and not one vessel went away without money or bills, except in cases where they were consigned in cargoes from the Havannah, which was the case with nine out of ten, where the freight was paid in the Havannah by the slave-dealers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the sort of business carried on is this; some vessels do carry commodities to a great extent, receive payment in bills or money, and sail away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Those are the exceptions—very few such cases occur, some do—the system is not to carry goods there, and receive slaves in return—the sys<lb></lb>tem of trade is, a vessel is sent from the Havannah with goods to a slave fac<lb></lb>tor, (Rollo, for instance, or any of these men at the Gallinas,) she sails again in ballast, the freight is all paid at the Havannah—that is the general rule—I do not say that the vessel is of necessity engaged in slave-trade, became of necessity people do not know what they are about; but the consequence of it is of necessity slave-trade, from the way in which the payment is actually made—it furnishes means to persons there of carrying on the slave-trade—a person living in England, or elsewhere, and exporting produce there, may do so, and get his money for it, without knowing to what purpose it is to be ap<lb></lb>piied—it is very possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not had a hand in destroying certain property there, slave factories, if you please, which is the subject of one or more actions against you at this moment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are certain actions brought against me for the destruction of slave factories at the Gallinas—the destruction of those slave factories took place about Nov. 1840—I have been to various other parts of the coast of Africa, where the slave-trade is carried on—at most of the places on the coast there is both a lawful trade carried on and the slave-trade—the Gallinas is an exception, the only exception I know indeed—I know that from my own personal presence on the spot—if a merchant in England consigns commodities to a person at the Gallinas, it implies a certain knowledge of the party—supposing he knows nothing of the character of the parties by whom he is employed, it does not of necessity follow he should know what he is about—if he knew any thing of the person who desires him to ship goods, or the persons at Gallinas with whom the trader corresponds, I should suppose he would know enough of them to know that there was nothing but slave trading—there are undoubtedly many persons on the coast of Africa who carry on both the slave-trade, and also a very extensive lawful trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then how is a gentleman in England, or America, or anywhere else,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know of the existence of slave establishments there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As notoriously as this Court is here—I have seen them myself, and had reports of them from the officers that were sent there—I was only there once—I know Pedro Blanco from report, but not personally—they always kept out of my sight—they would not come near me—it is the duty of every British officer on the coast to suppress the slave-trade as much as possible—it was part of my duty—I had no authority to seize slave ships, but to give information to Her Majesty's squadron, and I believe I did that to some good amount—it was my duty to obtain as much information as possible of what was going on on the coast, and to communicate with naval officers, to enable them to seize the vessels—my station was about fifteen hundred miles from the Gallinas, ex<lb></lb>cept</p>

               <p>when I have been journeying down the coast—Fernando Po is a long distance from the Gallinas, and so is Ascension—I have been running down the coast, and obtaining reports, both myself and from officers—I had the means of ascertaining the way in which the slave-trade was carried on—you cannot get slaves for money—I never saw a slave got for money—they can<lb></lb>not be got without British manufactured goods, supplied by British merchants—the general course is to barter British manufactured goods for slaves, who are brought from the interior of Africa, to places where the trade is carried on—slaves are usually brought to the Gallinas for the purpose of being sold, or bartered for the goods which they meet with there—it is notoriously the most infamous slave-dealing part on the whole coast of Africa—there is a continual drain of slaves from all parts of the interior contiguous to it, continually coming down to the Gallinas—there is nothing going on there but the slave-trade.</p>

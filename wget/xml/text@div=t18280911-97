            . I swear positively to them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you have a private-mark on them? A. No; some of them are numbered, but I speak to them by their appearance; they are differently formed though so much alike; I do not make them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The same maker might make others? A. Yes; but they have been in my possession for some years; one is marked on the brass, but not by me; I do not swear positively to them by the mark - here is 8 on one and 17 on another - that is not very common; I never observed it before on burnishing tools.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did the prisoner come into your employ? A. I believe the latter end of March or the beginning of April; I will not swear it was before May, as I made no memorandum of it - but I firmly believe it was the latter end of March; I did not say he had better tell me what he had done with them, nor did the officer in my presence; he went to work about thirty yards from me.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner. I asked what he had done with the duplicate of the stones - he would not tell me at first, but on the road to the watch-house, he said if I would go back with him he would give me the duplicate, and he did so.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that this prosecution arose from vindictive motives, but giving no account of the transaction; he received a good character.</p>

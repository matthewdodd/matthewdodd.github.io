               <p>Q. Was the shilling he gave you the same shilling that you had given him? - A. I am perfectly sure it was not; I put the shilling which he gave me into my right hand, and collared him with my left hand; I told him he was a villain, that he was ringing the chatter with me, and desired two gentlemen that were standing by to take notice; the prisoner said, what are you going to do you must not throttle me; I told him I was going to the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the person who was with him?- A. We left him with the basket; I led him down Token-house-yard, and as I was crossing Lothburg I heard some money rattle; a person who was behind me said, here is the money in the gulley-hole; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear what he said? - A. Yes; I looked into the gulley-hole and saw both gold and silver; I then sent to the Manslon-house for two officers, and held the prisoner at the spot till Mr. Canner came, and Mr. Dover came up at the same time; I requested them not to leave the money till they saw it taken up, and I took the prisoner to the Mansion-house; I gave Mr. Canner a shilling I had from the prisoner, first having marked it; I then returned to the gulley-hole, the grating was taken up, and the money delivered to Mr. Canner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CANNER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am Under Marshal of the city of London: On Thursday, the 2d of July, near three o'clock, I was sent for by Mr. Hoby; I found him with the prisoner, near the gulley-hole, at the bottom of Princes-street; Mr. Hoby said, in the presence of the prisoner, here is bad money dropped in the gulley-hole, and requested that I would take charge of the money; I had the grating taken up and found in the gulley-hole in a paper, a guinea and three shillings; besides which, I found, dispersed by its having fallen upon the grating, a guinea, and half a guinea, and a seven-shilling piece. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q.Have you a shilling that was produced before the Lord Mayor? - A. Yes; I received it from Mr. Hoby before the Lord Mayor; he marked it before he delivered it to me. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Hoby. This is the shilling I received from the prisoner.</p>

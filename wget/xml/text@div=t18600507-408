                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 110). I ran on that occasion to assist Mackey—when I got there he was in a very bad state—he was down, and the prisoner was underneath him, and one or two of his companions were on him—I knocked them off and they fell on me, and Mackey got up—the prisoner got up and kicked me in the groin—he tried to kick me again, and said he would run a knife through me if he had one—I struck him, and he gave me another knock on the nose—he was secured at last—his companions beat me all the way to the station—I suffer very much from it, and I some<lb></lb>times have to go to a doctor—it bruised me very much—I was not ruptured, but I feel it—when the weather changes I can hardly walk—I was off duty I think fifteen or sixteen days.</p>

Mr. Towns was in the street, and a large number of people about him—they were making their way into High-street—I took the prisoner by the arm; he had blood on his face—I took him a short distance and he struck me in the face, and said, "You b—r, let me go," and he called to his mates—one of them struck me with a stone and I fell—I took out my staff and struck him—I was much hurt, and was laid up for a fortnight.</p>

I was returning from Church and went by where the policemen had got the prisoner—I saw them bleeding and wounded, and not able to take the prisoner, and I being a constable took out my staff and told them I would assist them—the prisouer was taken a considerable way; he kicked aud fought in a very desperate manner—We carried him about half-way to the station, and then he said he would not go any further—he swore dreadfully, and got Mackey's thumb in his mouth, and bit it violently—I struck him on the head with my staff—a constable took him by the nose</p>

            . I am an officer, about seven o'clock in the morning I went into the Black Raven public-house, and found Scott, who told me of his loss; I found the prisoners in bed at a house in Angel-alley; when Clarke put on his clothes they were muddy. I said he had been in the mud: - he said he was so drunk he did not know where he had been. Graves said the same.</p>

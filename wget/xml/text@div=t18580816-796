The prisoner is my step-father, the deceased was my mother; she had been married to the prisoner for fifteen yeas—we lived at 1, Sarah-place, Brick-lane, Christchurch—my mother was 48 years old—the prisoner was a labourer at the docks, I lived at home with them—on Saturday, 29th May, in the afternoon my mother wished to go out, she had some offices to clean; the prisoner was drunk, and he said he would not let her go; she said she would go; he said, "I will not let you go," and then he struck her on her arm with his fist—I interfered—he said if I interfered he would strike me—before that, he threw the table down; that was while he was scuffling with my mother—he intended to hit her and she would not let him, there was a scuffle and the table was knocked over in the scuffle, and one of the legs of the table was broken off—then I took up the poker, and I said I would strike him if he insisted on hitting my mother; he wrested it from me, and then my mother struck him on the head with the leg of the table, it wounded him, his head bled very much, and he fell on the ground—he threw the poker away—I said to mother, "You have done for father now;" she said, "It serves him right, he should have let us alone"—I wiped his head with an apron—my mother told me to go and fetch a constable—I left the room—the prisoner was then on the ground—the room is on the first floot—I went to the bottom of the stairs, when I heard my mother scream, I immediately returned to the room and saw my mother standing with her hand to her left side; my father was standing in the room with his hand to his head—he had nothing in his hand at that time—mother was crying; I saw the poker lying in the place where I had left it—I said to my mother, "What has he done?" she said, "He struck me with the poker on the side"—I then went down stairs and my mother followed me—one of the neighbours had brought a constable, he did not go up stairs—my father looked out of the window; my mother said, "I will give him into custody,"—the policeman seeing my father look out of the window with his head bleeding, desired him to come down stairs, and when he came down he said, "I will give her into custody,"—the policeman said he could not take one without the other, as there was violence on both sides—when my mother wanted to give him into custody I persuaded her not—I said, "Mother, don't give him into custody, he has got more marks to show than you have"—she declined to give him into custody—my father returned to his room, and mother went to her work as usual—she was at home on the Sunday and did the domestic work of the house that day—on the Monday she went to the London hospital, she was not taken in then—she went to her work on the Tuesday, and did some washing on Wednesday—on the Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, she slept at home with the prisoner, and on the Wednesday she was taken into the hospital, not being so well—she remained there till the following Saturday-week, that was the 12th June—I went to see her on the 11th, and found her very well, and she said she would come out on the Saturday if she kept on as well as she was then—on the Saturday, the 12th, the nurse came to say that she was much worse—I went and found her much worse—she wished to come home—the doctors pressed her to remain, as she was so ill, but she would come home, and I took her home in a cab—we met my father as we were coming home and he went home with us, and he gave her some port wine—on the following day (Sunday) she was very ill, and my father went for Mr. Comley the doctor; he was ill, and his son came to attend my mother—he gave her some medicine—she was much worse on the Monday, and died that night—when she came out of the hospital she complained of</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 71, High-street, Whitechapel—on Sun<lb></lb>day, 13th June, I was ill and confined to my bed; in consequence of that, my son went to attend the deceased; he is a dresser at Guy's Hospital—I never saw the woman in her lifetime—by the direction of the Coroner, I went to the Cemetery, and there made a post-mortem examination of her body on Thursday, 1st July—my son identified the body—I found a fracture of the ninth and tenth ribs on the left side; and, on examination internally, I found that a portion of the tenth rib had penetrated the lining membrane of the chest—there was effusion into the chest on both sides—the lungs were very much diseased, and there was the appearance of inflammation where the bone had penetrated the side of the chest; the inflammation was caused by the penetration of the broken bone—there was also inflammation of the stomach and intestines—I did not connect that inflammation with the injury to the ribs—the penetration of the bone into the chest and the subsequent effusion was decidedly the cause of death—a blow from a poker would be likely to cause the fracture I saw; I do not think it would result from a fall against a table.</p>

               <p>apartments, for which she received but a very small remuneration, and whilst she was doing so, having no inducement to remain at home, I was given to the practice of spending at a public-house more than she could possibly earn in the meanwhile. At last, I began to see the inutility of this, and one Saturday night I went home rather the worse for liquor, and resolved that this should continue no longer; I told my wife that she should not go out to work that night; she said she would, and seemed determined to go; this led to a serious altercation between us, during which my step-daughter caught hold of the poker and was going to strike me with it, but I prevented her doing so by seizing hold of it, she then rushed out of the room, but immediately returned; my wife then seized the leg of a table, with which she laid my head open, and from loss of blood I fell to the ground; my step-daughter applied her apron to my head to try to stop the blood, and exclaimed, 'Oh mother! you have killed father;' my wife replied, 'And a very good job too.' My wife then went down stairs, and I followed her; a policeman was called, and she wished to give me in charge, but, seeing the marks of violence and blood upon me, he would not take it. After this she went to work as usual and came home at the usual time. On the next morning (Sunday), she complained of a pain in the side, and not being any better on Monday I advised her to go to the hospital, which she did: she would not remain there, and returned home again that day. On Tuesday she went washing, but on Wednesday she again complained, and made up her mind to go in the hospital. On the Saturday-week following, my step-daughter, as usual, went to see her, and brought word back that she was better, and that she expressed a desire to leave the hospital. I then said, 'If your mother wishes to be fetched away she shall be,' and I then procured a cab and did so. On the Sunday, she told me that her bowels had not been properly acted upon for some days, whereupon I fetched a doctor to see her, who sent her some medicine which relieved her. He called again on the Monday, and ordered the medicine to be continued, but she refused to take it, and did not have any more; and she remained in the same state until Tuesday, when she unexpectedly expired. As is usual in such cases, a medical certificate was procured, and my wife was buried on the Thursday following. The funeral would not have taken place so soon, but that the undertaker stated that it would be improper to keep the corpse any longer. After this, I was persuaded to dispose of my furniture, and unfortunately took to drinking, which, for the time, rendered me quite unconscious of what I was doing, and by some means or other I got down to Sydenham where I was taken into custody and brought to the Worship-street police-court, when I was much surprised to hear the police<lb></lb>man read a long confession, which he stated I had made to him, and which he had taken down at the time, but of which, or how or when or where it was made, I have not the slightest recollection, and upon which evidence I was committed to take my trial. I now beg to throw myself on the mercy of the court."</p>

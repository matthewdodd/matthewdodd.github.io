                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 572). On the morning of 23d May, I was watching Mr. Mann's shop; I saw Gough come to the front of the shop and he stood in front of it about two or three minutes—there were two or three customers in the shop, and after they were served and had left the shop, Whyman came to the door and beckoned Gough in—Whyman went on the other side of the counter, stooped down and produced this basket with something in it; he handed it to Gough, who instantly left the shop and went towards Little Britain—I followed him—he crossed to the other side of the way and went back again—at that moment Whyman came out of the prosecutor's shop and crossed Aldersgate-street and went to a public-house—I stopped Gough and asked him what he had there—he said, "Some meat"—I said I was an officer, aud said, "You brought this from Mr. Mann's shop?"—he said he did—I said, "What did you pay for it?"—he said, "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "You did not"—he said, "I did, I paid him two half-crowns and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece"—I asked him the weight of it; he said ho did not know, he received it from Mr. Mann's foreman—he repeated many times in going to the station that he gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and when at the station he again repeated it—I weighed the meat, it weighed 14 lbs. and three quarters—it was a piece of salt beef—I took Gongh to the station—I then went back to Mr. Mann's shop, I saw Whyman alone in the shop—I asked to see Mr. Mann, and then I asked Whyman what money he had taken, and he said, "That is all the money," pointing to about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that laid on the desk—I paid, "Is that all you have taken?"—he said it was—I said, "Have you sold any salt beef?"—he hesitated and said, "Yes; but the man did not pay for it"—he said, "I will show you all the money I have got about me," and pulled out a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took him to the station on a charge of stealing the meat—he was asked by the Inspector what was the weight of the meat, and he said, "18lbs. and three quarters, at 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>"—I searched him and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more in his waistcoat pocket, which he said he had forgotten to tell me of.</p>

               <p>statement, to test whether he told the truth; not because I had the slightest doubt—I asked Whyman the question for the same reason, to hear his statement—he hesitated, I suppose for a minute—he said he had sold the meat, but the man had not paid for it—there were two other persons in the shop when Gough stood on the pavement.</p>

                  </hi> I am a butcher, and live at 159, Aldersgate-street—Whyman was in my employ—I don't know Gough at all—I saw the piece of beef which was produced by the officer, it was mine—Whyman was authorised to sell meat, but not without the money—he had no right to sell meat on trust to strangers: certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you occasion to send him to London with hay several times; in his way would he come over Finchley Common through Holloway - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discharge him - A. This day fortnight; and on this day week he came to me; he told me that he had heard that I had said that he had sold seven trusses of hay. I told him I had not said any considerable quantity; I said he had sold hay a variety of times, or else I had reason to suspect that he had; he said he was to come to own he was in fault; he was very sorry for it; and if I pleased, he would work it out. No, I told him, it was a matter that I ought not to settle; if he chose to go before a Magistrate, they would settle it; he did go before the Magistrate, and made the confession; it was read over to him, and I saw him sign it.</p>
               <p>The Confession read.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lost hay - A. I can only say by information; I had reason to complain of the state my horses were getting in; the prisoner had four horses under his care. I found my horses were getting in a bad condition; I was fearful that they did not keep in the stable, while the horses were feeding, and that the ostler took it away.</p>

            . Q. Were you the boy attending the hay cart - A. Yes; on the 24th of March I came to town with the prisoner, when he brought the load of hay.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the Bald Face Stag, Finchley Common, did the prisoner do any thing with the hay - A. I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hay given away at Holloway - A. Yes, to the ostler, half a truss.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did the ostler give him for it - A. I cannot say; I only missed the hay off the waggon, while I was at the Bull at Holloway. It was there when I went to the Bull; and when we went away, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110059"></xptr>was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that half truss have been given to the horses - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this that the half truss of hay was taken away at the Bull - A. A week or a fortnight before he was discharged; I told my master's shepherd of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was a bit of loose hay; the ostler took it off the waggon; I said you must not have that; he said why? I said I shall have a piece of work with master; he said, here is sixpence for you. I said that will not do. The ostler said, if I give you any more, I shall not make my money of it. I told him not to take it.</p>

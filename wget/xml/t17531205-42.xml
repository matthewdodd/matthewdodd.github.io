The prisoner came to ask for a coat and waistcoat on the 19th of November, I bid him go into my parlour. I had before that laid a half-guinea on the corner of the bureau, and coming to him by then he had been there two minutes, look'd for it and miss'd it; he was then in the room. I charged him with taking it, he denied it and said I could not detain him without a constable, and used very bad words. I sent for a constable, and as we were going before the justice he took off his right foot shoe and took out the half-guinea, which he gave to the constable, and own'd that was the piece of money that he took from off the board.</p>

            . I am constable. On the 29th of November I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, the prosecutrix told me he had stole half a guinea from her, which I desired him to return; he said he'd give her half a guinea in silver, but denied the taking it. As we were going to the justice's he said if the woman would not hurt him, he'd give her the half-guinea, saying, it was in his shoe. He pull'd off his shoe, and taking out a half-guinea gave it to me, and said that is the piece that I took from off the bureau. We went to Justice Fielding, and there he own'd the same. The half-guinea produced in court.</p>

On the 6th of October I sent him to sell a sack of fat-when he returned I asked him what it weighed? he said twenty-four stone-I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280051"></xptr>said it must have weighed more; he said that was the exact weight. I put some more fat in the sack, and told him to take it to the same place. He returned, and said it weighed five stone. I asked him what the two sacks weighed together? he said, "I made a mistake in the first, it only weighed twenty-three stone four pounds, which makes it twenty-eight stone four pounds together." I said it must have weighed more - He said it did not. I went to Morgan's, where he sold the fat, and asked him, in the prisoner's presence, what the first sack weighed? he said twenty-eight stone four pounds, and that the prisoner had only brought one sack. The prisoner said that nobody was present when he brought the second lot. At last he said the first sack was heavy, and he put it down by the Black Horse, public-house. Rose came out, put it in another sack, and while he took one sack, another person came with the other. I afterwards found it at Wilmot's, at the corner of Great Russell-street, in one of my sacks-it weighed six stone four pounds. The prisoner fell on his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 327). On Monday, 2nd Oct., at two o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Rose-street, Greenwich—I heard a cry of "Murder!"—I went to the place whence it proceeded, knocked at the door, and the moment I got in I found the keeper of the house and the pri<lb></lb>soner struggling—the prisoner had this watch in her hand—the woman charged her with stealing it—I thought the prisoner was endeavouring to hide it amongst the bed-clothes—I pinioned her arms and took it from her—I asked Mr. Suter, who was there, if he had lost anything else—he said, "Yes; a ring"—I then pinioned her arms again, and this ring fell from her hand—an officer who was with me took some money out of her hand—the prisoner made use of bad language, and said we were <hi rend="italic">sharks</hi>—she afterwards said she was going to take care of it, and give it to the gentleman—she was dressed, except her stays, which were under her arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich, and keep a lodging-house for casual visitors of both sexes—the prisoner came to my house on Sunday evening, 1st Oct., about half-past eleven o'clock, with Suter—he was very much in liquor—she asked him if he would give her a little to drink—he said, "Yes"—he took half-a-crown out of his pocket, and gave it to me, to fetch half-a-pint of gin—I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and he gave it me, to pay for the bed—I went a second time for gin for him, and he gave me a sovereign to get it—between one and two 2 heard the prisoner walking about in the room—I went to the street-door—the prisoner came into the passage, and said she was going to get a pot of ale, as she made it a rule to have a pot of ale on the table, as she was thirsty in the night—I said, "You are not going out; I will fetch it," and I sent a boy for it—I had noticed the prosecutor's watch and chain on the drawers—I afterwards saw them in the prisoner's hand—when I went into the room with the pot of ale, she endeavoured to keep me out; but I would go in, and the gentleman's clothes were on the floor, and his watch was in her hand—I took hold of her, and desired hex to put the watch down—she said she would not—she said he had little or no money, and she would not stop with any man, unless he had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I struck her, to try to get the watch from her—she cried "Murder!" and the officers came to the door.</p>

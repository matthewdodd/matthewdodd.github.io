One Thursday, I think on the 9th of February, as I was sitting in the shop, he applied to me to make out Mrs. Daniels' receipt, and said she would pay the money on Friday or Saturday morning- I gave him the receipt for 2l. 19s. 3d. - he never gave me the money; he was at home till the Saturday afternoon, and then he left us - he was taken on the Sunday morning; I asked him if he remembered that I gave him the receipt for Mrs. Daniels - he said Yes: I said, "You have not given me the money;" he said, "I know I received it, but have not given it to you;" we have heard that he is married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he account with you or your husband? A. With me, always; I am sure he asked me for the receipt on Thursday night, and on the Sunday the Police-officer brought him to our house - I cannot swear that money he has received on a Monday has not been paid to me till the Thursday or Friday, but it ought not to be so; he behaved very well before this.</p>

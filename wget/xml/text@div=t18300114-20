On the morning of the 3rd of October I bought for John Forster a chest of Congou tea, which weighed about eighty pounds, at the East India Company's warehouse; it was No. 492, by the Castle Huntley - the chests are delivered on presenting a permit; a paper, requesting the permit, is put into a box at the permit office, at the Excise-office - any individual can go and take the permit from the box; I do not know the prisoner, and never authorised him to get possession of it- Forster's porter should have got it from the warehouse.</p>

I gave Mr. Walker an order to buy a chest of tea; I sent my porter for it, but it was not to be found - I live in Tooley-street; I knew the prisoner, but never authorised him to get it - the permit is a copy of request paper lodged in the office.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ROBERTS. I am a labourer to the East India Company. I take an account of what goes out of the yard - I have known the prisoner some years; I saw him in the yard on the 3rd of October with a permit in his hand, which he presented for a chest of tea, No. 492, by the Castle Huntley - I took the permit, entered it in the book, and helped the chest on his knot; it is always delivered on the permit being presented - I did not see him again till the 28th of November, when he was in custody; he used to work for different carmen - permits are generally put into a box at the permit-office; a stranger could easily get one at that time, but I believe an alteration has been made.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not book my own name to it? A. I booked your name as the person taking it away; I was in the habit of seeing you before the 3rd of October, off and on, but not for a week or a month - I have not known you to have many chests as a porter.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRICE. I am a labourer to the East India Company, and superintend the teas as they go out; the time of delivery is from nine o'clock till four - I saw the prisoner going out with a chest about five minutes after three, which is an improper time, as the men are then going out, and being searched as they go out; it is a time he ought not to leave the yard - I stopped him, and told him it was an improper time; he pleaded ignorance - I detained him till all the men were searched; then called to Roberts, to know if he had booked the chest - he said he had, and I let him go; I have known him coming to the yard for fifteen or sixteen years; I did not see him again till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect whether the call had commenced when I entered the yard? A. I am not certain of that.</p>

            . I am an Excise-locker at Crutched-friars yard. I saw the prisoner take a locker's paper, and go away with it; that is a copy of the request note - by taking that to the Excise-office and putting it through a hole, the permit would be handed out without his being seen by the person - I am certain of him; I knew him before.</p>

               <p>THOMAS DEVY. I am a constable of Aldgate-ward. I apprehended the prisoner in Thames-street, on the 28th of November, and told him I wanted him to go with me to Crutched-friars warehouse - he went, and the witnesses indentified him as the man who had the chest; he said that on the 3rd of October he had been employed by a gentleman to get a chest of tea out of the warehouse, and take it over the water, and he left it at the foot of London-bridge- I asked at what house he delivered it; he said he delivered it in the street at the foot of the bridge, that the gentleman paid him, and he came away - he did not say what the gentleman did with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Ship in Hart-street, when a gentlemanly dressed man asked for a porter; I went out with him - he gave me this paper from his pocket-book, containing the particulars of the chest, and a description of the party; I went to the yard, selected the paper, and got the permit, went to Jones' in Crutchedfriars and borrowed a knot, and when I went to the yard the call had not commenced - when I got to London-bridge I pitched the chest on the block; the same gentleman came, and said, "I will not trouble you further, I have just met my own porter coming" - he gave me 1s., and I delivered the chest to him; here are the instructions I received - there were two persons in the Ship, one was the Imperial Vintner's porter. I thought that the gentleman was Mr. Forster, whose name was on the paper.</p>
               <p>MR. WATKINS. This paper is not my hand-writing - it is customary for the porter to have the particulars to apply for the request paper by.</p>

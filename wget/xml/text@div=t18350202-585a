                  </hi>. I am clerk to James Henry Henderson, a solicitor, of No. 31, Bloomsbury-square. I saw the prisoner in the hall on Tuesday evening, the 27th of January, about a quarter before six o'clock—the door was then shut—he had just brought a note, which he had given to the housemaid—I had not seen him give her the note, but she told me in his presence that he had given her the note—I left him in the passage, while I went with the note into Mr. Henderson's room—I re<lb></lb>turned into the passage—he was still standing there, a little further into the hall, and more under the light, it shone more on his countenance—I have not the slightest doubt of his person—I went down stairs, returned up stairs, and the prisoner was in the act of opening the street door—Mr. Henderson had just come from his office door into the hall—the prisoner had a bundle of clothes on his arm, and a hat in his hand, and he had a hat on his head—as he pulled the door too after him, Mr. Henderson pull<lb></lb>ed it open—I ran out after him, being sure he had got what he ought not to have—I saw him, when I got to the door, running—he ran across the cor<lb></lb>ner of the square, and dropped a cloak and hat—I pursued him till he came to Southampton-row, and there he was stopped by a policeman—I lost sight of him in turning the corners, but immediately caught sight of him again—he had dropped the other clothes at the street door—I gave him in charge—Mr. Henderson, when he ran out, took up the cloak and hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. I went out into the street on hearing an alarm—I did not see the prisoner till he was secured in Southampton-row—my younger brother accompanied me, and we together picked up the cloak and hat at the corner of Bedford-place—I took up the cloak, and told my brother to put the hat on his head—the hat is mine, and the cloak belongs to my younger brother, Henry, who is at Brighton—it is my father's property, because my brother is eleven years old—I am certain the hat is mine—I had hung it in the hall about an hour before, on the horse-peg.</p>

In consequence of suspicion, I got a warrant and searched Warman's mother's house—I had a warrant against him and the male prisoner also—I know nothing was found at Warman's house—I did not execute the warrant myself—Lamb has been in custody, charged as a receiver, and discharged—I do not know where to find him now—it was not known that the prisoner bad made a disclosure then—Lamb I believe lived in Norfolk, and has returned there—Harefield is his native. place—on Saturday evening, the 3rd of Jan., I was at Harefield, and saw the male prisoner after sunset—he had a pair of heavy laced-up boots on—I saw him unlock the door of his cottage, take off the boots, and put on a pair of lighter ones—he came out and walked towards Mr. Ratcliff's house—I saw</p>

Uxbridge note, which she received from her brother—she took me to her box in the kitchen, and produced it from there, and said her brother said he found it, that she received that after the fives.</p>

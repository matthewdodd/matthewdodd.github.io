On Friday afternoon, I tied up two dozen trusses in the cart-house; I left it safe about six o'clock in the evening, and about six is the morning, I went and missed eight trusses, which was too much for one man to carry; the cart-house is close against the road; the prisoner was a stranger to me. I told my master, and on Sunday I went with him and found the prisoner in his own house at Isleworth, three or four miles off, close to the Brentford-road. We found the hay on his premises; some of it was shaken about - there were five trusses and a quantity loose lying there. I put my hand into the truss, and found a shell which I had put in the middle of them. I am sure it is the hay I bound.</p>

            . I am bailiff to Mr. Johnson, whose farm is about a mile and a half from Amer's. On Saturday morning, the 19th of October, about half-past five o'clock, I was in Mr. Johnson's field, and heard a cart stop opposite a cabbage field; I listened and heard the cabbages crack, and thought somebody was stealing. I went over, and found the prisoner with four cabbages in his hand, and the horse and cart stood there with about eight trusses of hay in it. I secured him for taking the cabbages. He was discharged, being fined 10 s. He said he wanted to go to Kingston market, and so I sent a man with him, to deliver up his cart of hay, and then bring him back to me.</p>

Last Saturday week, as I was going to work about a quarter past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner standing by his horse in the road, by the cabbage field.

            . I live at Smallborn-green. I know the prisoner. Last Saturday week I employed him to fetch a bed and a few other things, that came from my mother's at Birmingham; he came to me between the Old Hat and Feathers, public-house, at ten minutes after five o'clock. I accompanied him to the Feathers to meet the waggon; it did not come; I walked by the side of the cart. A man came up with some hay in a one-horse cart, near the Feathers trough; he had a straw cart and another hay cart also. The man said,</p>
               <p>"Do you want to buy a truss or two of hay?" he said</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you sell it too dear for me, I can buy it cheap at home." He bought six trusses, and was to give 2 s. a truss, and then bought two more, as a man came up who knew him and lent him 2 s. 6 d.; the man unloaded it, and he put it up in his cart. I went down to the other public-house to look if my goods had been left there. I left the prisoner; (he wanted to go home in a hurry), to go to Kingston market, and was to come for my things if they arrived.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What public-houses did you go to enquire at - A. To the Two Hats and Green Man; they are about one hundred yards from the Feathers. I was to go to the Blackhorse, public-house, Shepherd's-bush, if they were not there, and so I did not require him to wait, as he was in a hurry to go to Kingston market. I called at his house as I went along, between one and two o'clock in the morning; I went to meet the waggon, as my sister was coming with the goods; she is not come yet, as my mother is ill and cannot spare her.

Last Saturday week, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I saw him stand with his cart, and a load of hay on another cart. I was going to Covent-garden market, after apples.</p>

               <p>Q.What brought you to the Feathers - A. I had business that way. I lent him 2 s. 6 d. - I cannot say what for, but believe it was to buy hay. I came away directly. The Feathers is six miles from Twickenham. I had to call on one Rook, at Ealing, whom I buy apples for; his house is about two hundred yards beyond the Feathers. The hay cart might have a load of hay on it. I did not see the trusses taken out. I was close to the prisoner's cart - there was no hay in that, when I lent him the 2 s. 6 d. I think there was a woman there, but am not certain. I went away as soon as I gave him the half-crown; he did not say what he wanted it for, that I recollect.</p>

               <p>I am a silk garter weaver, and live in Moorfields: upon the 23d of December, about 10 in the morning, Fuller came to me booted and spurred, and said, Goswell wanted to speak to me immediately upon some capital business; I went with him to Goswell, who was at a public house in Blackman-street; I do not remember exactly the house; Fuller went for Goswell, Goswell came: and asked me how I did? he said, he had a bill of Exchange, and if I would discount it for him, he should be obliged to me; this is it (producing a Bill of Exchange for 325 l. 11 s. 7 d.) I said, what will you have for it? he said, if you will get me 150 l. for it, I will give you 10 guineas; I said, I had no money at present; he said, when shall I call for it? I told him, to-morrow; then said he, I will either call or send: I went to Baker's Coffee-house to search the newspaper, whether this bill, which I suspected to be stolen, was advertised, but did not make any discovery that day; upon Tuesday the 24th I examined again; Goswell neither came on the Tuesday or sent, but upon Christmas-day all three of the prisoners came together on horseback, about noon; Goswell leaned down to my cheek and whispered, Have you done the bill for me? I said, No, I have tried a gentleman, but I could not get the cash for it, if you will stay till Friday I will do it for you; he said, give it to me again, I will give you 10 guineas for your trouble; I said, I could not; it was in the hands of such a person, but if he would call on Friday he should have it; on the 26th I went again to search the papers about this bill, and then found that it was advertised as having been stolen upon the 21st of December; they said, they must go, for they had some particular business; I took great notice of all their horses; Goswell's was a sorrel horse with a bald face, Fuller's a dark coloured chesnut gelding, Life's a chesnut mare, about the same colour as Fuller's; having made this discovery, I went to Sir

I came upon other business, I have some watches; he shewed me the chain of one, hanging out of his breeches; he pulled out a tortoiseshell watch out of his waistcoat pocket, said he, you must come and dine with my partners, we have something dressing for dinner at such a place, and they have some watches too; I went to a public house in Primrose Street; Goswell and Life were sitting in a box; I sat down by Goswell; he took out two watches, and said, what do you think of these? I said, they are very pretty ones; upon this he said, this is not all; Life shew yours; then Life pulled out a gold watch and a pocket piece, and asked what I would give for it; I offered him 5 s. he gave it to me, but I did not pay him any money for it; I desired them not to talk of business there, but go home with me; they all went home with me; Goswell said, if you will send for that bill I will give you 20 guineas; I said, I cannot give it you, but I will send for it; I went down to a Mr. Asher, who was below, and desired him to go directly to Sir

               <p>I was sent for; I took this chain out of Life's pocket; I found a loaded pistol upon him, some gunpowder, a crape, and a wig.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The two seals are mine, and that part of the string was fastened to my watch at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>CLARKE. I said to Goswell, where are your horses? Goswell said, loose my hand and I will give you a direction where the horses are; I loosened his hands and he wrote this note (producing it); Barnard went down with me to the place; when we came there, Barnard said, he knew the horses that each person rode upon, and did specify each particular horse immediately upon his coming into the stable; Goswell's horse, he said, was that with the white face.</p>

               <p>I am the ostler at the Golden Lion in Moorfields; I know Life and Fuller perfectly; I observed them the night they came in, and am positive to them; they came in on Thursday afternoon about two o'clock; they were leading the third horse, the third horse was the sorrel horse with a white face; they came in the evening after dark.</p>
               <p>GOSWELL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barnard has spoke very false in his evidence concerning the Bill.</p>
               <p>LIFE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have had no time to prepare for my trial; I did not expect my trial to come on the first day.</p>
               <p>FULLER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I only went on a message as any other person might do; I never was concerned in any robbery in my life; I was foreman to Mr. Moore in Chiswel-street; I have sent to him, but he was busy and could not come.</p>

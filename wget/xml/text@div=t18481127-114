                  </hi>. I live in Greek-street, Soho. I became acquainted with the prisoner; and on 13th Nov. last married him, at St. George's, Bloomsbury—he said he was single—I went away with him to a public-house, and afterwards went to my aunt's—I heard something, went hack to the public-house, and gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My first wife committed adultery, and we parted by mutual consent; I thought I was free; there must have been some plot in it, as I was taken before the marriage was consummated.</p>

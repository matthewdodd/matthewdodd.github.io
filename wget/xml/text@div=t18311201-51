On the evening of the 5th of November my attention was called to the loss of some handkerchiefs from the door; I ran out, and saw the prisoner crossing the road - I ran after her, and saw the handkerchiefs rolled round her arm; I took her about twenty yards from the shop, and gave her in charge; these are the handkerchiefs - there are eleven; they were hanging within the door, and I had an iron guard put round my door, to prevent these depredations.</p>
               <p>HENRY BAKER. I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner- she said she had picked up the handkerchiefs; in crossing Regent-circus she threw two bottles of rum out of her apron, and some glasses, and told me she was a smuggler.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I exchanged some mats for these two bottles of liquor - as I returned back a boy made a stop, and I saw these handkerchiefs on the ground - I took them up; the boy said, "They are mine;" I said, "I shall keep them, as I picked them up;" I have four distressed fatherless children to do for - I never saw the shop, and do not know where it is.</p>

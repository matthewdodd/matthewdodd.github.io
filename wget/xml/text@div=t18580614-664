                  </hi>. I live at No. 24, Steven Street, Mary-le-bonne. On 28th May, at a quarter before 6 o'clock in the morning, I heard the clock strike; I had not left my home above a minute—I saw the prisoner in front of Mr. Dignum's, No. 31; I could not say whether the door was shut or open—I went on, and heard a noise; I came back, and saw the prisoner in the shop—she had in her hand some railway wrappers; she threw them down—I made an alarm, and awoke young Dignum; he came down—I am sure the prisoner had them in her hand, and she dropped them on the floor, just at the end of the counter, inside the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Darby Dignum, at No. 31, Steven Street. He keeps the shop and two back rooms—he deals in ginger beer and harness—we had several railway wrappers on the cot in the middle room—on the morning of 28th May, I was called up by the last witness, as near as possible, about a quarter before 6 o'clock—I came down, and saw these wrappers had been removed, and were placed against the street door—when I went to bed the night before, I left my parents up—when I came down, I saw the prisoner in the shop; I let her go outside, and followed her, and gave her in charge—these are my father's wrappers.</p>

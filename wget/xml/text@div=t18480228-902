                  </hi> I am a widow, and keep the Dover Castle, Weymouth<lb></lb>mews, in the parish of St. Marylebone—it is my dwelling-house—the pri<lb></lb>soners used to come there for the last month. On Saturday, Jan 29th, Wright was there nearly all day—I missed him about ten o'clock in the evening—next morning I opened the bar with a key—it opened very easily, as if the lock had been tried—it appeared to be locked—I found the window open, which had been shut the night before, and the till wide open—I was the last person in the room the night before, and the first in the morning—I missed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in sixpences and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, from the till, and two half-sovereigns, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, from a desk in the same room, which had been shut, but not locked, there were two counterfeit shillings there, sepa<lb></lb>rate from anything else—I saw them there at twelve the night before—two boxes if cigars and cheroots were emptied—there is a tailor's stall in the back yard, by getting over the roof of which, you can get into a mews, and then into the street—I am sure the bar-window was closed, but not fastened—the tailor's shop had a padlock upon the door, and I considered it was fast—it belongs to my premises, but was unoccupied—I found the padlock taken off.</p>

On 30th Jan., between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was with sergeant Martin, at the corner of Prince's-street, Cavendish-square, and saw the prisoners—Wright was smok<lb></lb>ing a cigar, and had his hand in his pocket—they went up the right side of the square, to Mortimer-street—I went up Market-street, into Regent-street, saw them cross Langham-street, and laid hold of Wright—the other one said he would be d—d if he stopped—another constable ran after him—he was stopped—Wright said he would be d—d if anybody would be able to walk the streets shortly—I took him to the station, searched him, and found two half-sovereigns, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., two counterfeit shillings, eleven sixpences, ten 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pieces, eight farthings, fifty-seven halfpence, and fifty-seven cigars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) he had not been anywhere between my taking him and searching him.</p>

On the 1st of August I was looking at a gown piece in a shop window - the prisoner was near me, and I asked her to step in and look at it with me; I had not known her before - we went in and bought a gown-piece and an apron or two; we came out together, and another woman who was with her; I took them to a public-house, had something to drink, and laid the articles down on the table while I stepped out; when I returned they were gone, and the prisoner - I did not intend to make her a present of them; I only took the prisoner in to give her judgement on those things, and I said I would treat them for going; they each had a glass of peppermint, and we called for a pot of cyder - I do not recollect that the prisoner carried the articles out of the shop; I think I did - she dealt for them, but I paid for them.</p>

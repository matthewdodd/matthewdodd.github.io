I am fourteen years of age - my mother told me to shut the shutters that night, which I did - there is only one window to that lower room, which looks into the street - I bolted the bottom bolt of the shutters - it was then a little after five o'clock - it was dusk, but I could see people's faces in the street - these bedclothes were taken from the bed in that room - no one could have got there, without getting in at the window.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Isaacs - he lives in Harrow-alley - on the 2nd of February I was coming from my master - I was in a court at the back of his house, which has no name - I fell over something - I opened my master's back-door, and called for a light - my master brought a light, and I saw the prisoner standing against the wall - I said, "Where did you come from?" - he said,"What is the matter here?" - I caught hold of him, as I thought he had been robbing my master - when my master came, he took him, and I got an officer, who took the prisoner - the things were about one yard from the prisoner - it was then between six and seven o'clock, nearer seven than six.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you see me before you tumbled over the things, and did not a woman collar me first? A. When I called my master to come out, a woman came - I did not see you come up the court, you was up the court - I caught you in the middle of the court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you tumbled over the things you had not seen the prisoner? A. No; I opened my master's back-door, and called out, "Master, you are robbed" - I then saw the prisoner, and seized him - he could not have come up there after I called - he must have passed me if he had, and no one did pass me.</p>

            . I am a night patrol of St. Botolph Without Bishopsgate - I know Little Peter-street - it is about a quarter of a mile from the court, which Polack has described - I was called, and took the prisoner - he was about two yards up the court, and these things were on the pavement by him - the court may be five or six feet wide - no one could have gone up that court without a person who was at Isaacs' back door seeing him - the court is no thoroughfare, it only leads to Isaacs' house, and one other - these are the goods.</p>
               <p>Mrs. EARL. These are my property - I had made the bed at half-past four, and then saw them all safe in the room - I had trusted my daughter to shut the shutters before - the left hand shutter had been forced in, and the bolt had been lifted up with a finger or a piece of wire - there was a bolt at the top, but it went very hard, and could not easily be shut.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from Whitechapel, and heard the voice of two or three persons crying out - I hastened to the spot, and saw the witness talking to a woman - I stood there two or three minutes, and all on a sudden the man turned and seized me.</p>

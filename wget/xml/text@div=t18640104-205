                  </hi>. I keep the Roupell Arms, Lower-road, Charlton—the prisoner has been in my employ as ostler since 15th October, last—on Tuesday night, 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> December, about 11 o'clock, I fastened the house up, and the prisoner went to bed about five minutes past 11—I saw him go up stairs—I went down in the cellar, and was there till half-past 11—I locked the door, put the key in my pocket, and saw that the cellar-flap was safe—the prisoner slept at the top of the house, over my bed-room—no one else slept in the house that night, but myself, and my wife, and the prisoner—I was down first the next morning, and I let in Mary Homer, a charwoman, at twenty minutes past 7—she was in the habit of working for us—I unfastened the front door, took down the shutters, and lighted the fire in the bar—I then went down the kitchen stairs, which is level with the cellar, and found the cellar-door ajar—I went into the kitchen and saw that the window was fastened, and then went up stairs again—the lock of the cellar door was taken off inside—I did not miss any property then—about ten minutes after, I missed the contents of some bottles which had been emptied—they had been full—they were placed on the floor; my cask of rum was nearly empty—it had been three-parts full—nearly three gallous of gin had been taken out of the gin cask—there was a wooden partition between the rum and gin casks, which had been removed—no one could pass before they removed it—it was pulled out at the bottom, and some one had passed through—there was no mark on the casks—they had been shifted—there was a tap to both of them—the kitchen windows and doors were all the same as I had left them the night before—I went up stairs again, and about a quarter to 8 the prisoner came down—I said to him, "Have you heard anything about the house to-night, William"—he said, "No"—he then went out into the back yard, into a little lobby place</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 159). I took the prisoner into custody—I took off his boots and went with Sergeant Monk and the prosecutor into the garden—I saw footmarks and made impressions near them with the boots—they corresponded in every respect, even to the nails—you could count the nails on the outside of the boots—after I took the prisoner I saw a green mark on his trousers, apparently made from a post, five feet long, which had been used to force the bars over the area—the post was standing in the garden at the rear of the house—this is a piece of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the area is four feet ten inches deep, and is covered with dead leaves at the bottom—whoever broke the bars did not go further into the house as far as I saw—the area was whitewashed, and no one had got in or out—I am con<lb></lb>fident no entrance was effected from outside of the house; somebody had gone out of the house from the back door, where the footmarks were traced from—there was no key to that door; it was only fastened with bolts and bars and a bell put on—there were no other footmarks except those that corresponded—when I saw the green on the prisoner's trousers, I said, "How do you account for this?"—he began to rub it off—I stopped him till the others had seen it, and then he said, "I fell down on Saturday."</p>

                  </hi>. On Wednesday, 23rd December, I went with the prosecutor into his cellar, and saw him find this funnel under the rum-cask—there was some sand round the rim and the nose part of the funnel which corresponded with the sand which was in the prisoner's shed where he keeps his corn, on the right-hand side of the house—the funnel smelt of spirits—I could not say what, rum or gin, I should think—I saw a green mark on the prisoner's trousers, and saw him try to rub it off—I went with Sergeant Monk and saw the footmarks—they corresponded in every way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a charwoman, and work at the Roupell Arms—I came there about a quarter past 7 on the morning of the 23rd—Mr. Cuth<lb></lb>bert let me in, and I had some conversation with him—I saw the prisoner that morning about ten minutes to 8—he came into the bar, went to a cupboard there, and took out a large glass with something in it, which looked like gin, and as he drank it, his hand trembled very much—I did not say anything to him then—I afterwards went out into the back yard and said, "This is a pretty job, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>; how did they get out?"—he said, "The house where I was at Bexley-heath was robbed, and they did not find it out"—that was all he said.</p>

Mr. Cuthbert said, "William, did you hear anybody in the cellar in the night?" I said, "No." He said, "There has been some one." I said I did not hear any one, and I went about my work, and after breakfast he came to me and said, "William, I demand your keys; there is something about this I don't like." I said, "I hope you don't accuse me?" and he said, "I have no suspicion of any one." As for the footmarks, people got there all hours of the day and night too. I am as innocent of the robbery as a child unborn. I knew no more where the spirit cellar lay than I did where this Court was. I never was inside the cellar—the tap room window is always left open, any one could get in there; it was not locked for a week and three days before this night, and the land<lb></lb>lord says it was fastened that night.</p>

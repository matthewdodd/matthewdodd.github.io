                  </hi>. I keep the John of Groats, Gray Street, Blackfriars Road—on 5th November, about midday, I served the prisoner with half a pint of ale; he put down this coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said "What is it?"—he said "A sovereign"—it was a Hanoverian medal—I said "Get away off my premises; where did you get it from?"—he said "My master paid it to me for my wages this morning"—he paid me with a good sixpence and I gave him the medal back—I watched him down the road and spoke to a constable, who took him—ha said that his master was Mr. Wilson, of Clapham, but that he paid him on this side of the water.</p>

I took the prisoner—he pulled this coin out of the pocket, and said "This is what I thought was a sovereign, which I received from my master with a sixpence, and if it is bad my master will give me a good one instead"—I said "Who is your master?"—he said "Mr. Wilson"—I said "Where does he live?"—he said "I cannot tell where he lives, as I am no scholar, but I can take you to his house."—I said "Have you any more of this kind of money?"—he said "Yes, five more," which he produced from his left waistcoat pocket—they are five Hanover medals, the same as the other—he said that he received them from a mate at Newhaven twelve months ago.</p>

These are six Hanover medals; some are smaller than sovereigns; here are two sizes, the small ones are a better colour than the others; they are made of brass, and are worth less than a farthing—here is the word "Victoria" on the upper side, and on the other "To Hanever."</p>

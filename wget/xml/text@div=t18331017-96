            . I paid the prisoner on the 12th of May, 1l. 6s. on account of his master; he signed his name to the book in the usual way, but I did not see him sign it - I do not suppose I was present; my son paid him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It is the duty of the person who pays it to have the book signed, but whether that is properly signed, when you are not there, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170059"></xptr>do not know? A. No; I only know that my son paid it by what he told me - I cannot swear that this signature is the prisoner's writing - Mr. Townley does not know it.</p>

            . This is the prisoner's handwriting - he never accounted to me for the receipt of this money - I did not discover it had been received till I lost my day-book and was obliged to call in assistance to elucidate my accounts - the day-book was in the prisoner's custody - I think I missed it on the 4th of September, when the prisoner left me, and I had occasion to examine by books - I had not settled my accounts with the prisoner; he left me in consequence of my books being very back and my accounts very much deranged - I had complained of it, and on the 4th of September, I complained very much, and he said, "I see I cannot get on, I will cut it at once," I said "Agreed" and he went, but in the evening when I was absent, he insinuated himself into the warehouse - the next morning I called in assistance to go into the books and we missed the day-book - the debts which are deficient were between the cash-book and the ledger - the prisoner never accounted to me for this 1l. 6s. - he was in my debt; I had lent him money only a few days before; I have never found my day-book - I had examined that book before September; if this sum had been entered in the day-book I must have seen it, as they were always entered into the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect all the entries? A. No, not a fiftieth, nor perhaps a hundredth part of them - I recollect going to his house after he left me, and desiring him to come and assist me to look at the books, and he was in a state of intoxication; but he came to me several days afterwards - I frequently found fault with his manner of doing business - I have had frequent cause to find fault with my wife - I do not know but I may have quarrelled with every body in the house - I have received many sums of money from the prisoner - my wife has received money of him when I have been out, and some times when I have been at home - the prisoner did not go over the books with me, after he left me; he did through the stock - I have quarrelled with my wife on account of her interfering with the business; it was her duty to receive money sometimes, but not to dictate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember taking the whole file of receipts, and in your fury, pitching the whole file out of the window into the garden? A. Yes; and if I had pitched him out too, it would have been as well; I never was so exasperated in my life - I got the file back again in a minute; to the best of my recollection the prisoner brought it me; I think that was a few days before I accepted his resignation - his lodgings were most accurately searched a few days after he left, but nothing was found - I have not brought my wife here, but the prisoner has subpoened her - this account was received in May, 1832.</p>

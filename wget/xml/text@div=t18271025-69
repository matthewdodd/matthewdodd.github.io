               <p>THOMAS CARLISLE. I live at a butter-shop in Chiswell-street, but sleep in Grub-street. On Sunday, the 21st of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I had been to my place, stopping with my mistress' grandmother, as master and mistress were gone out for the day; I left there at near eleven o'clock: as I was coming down Type-street, the two prisoners stopped me, and asked if I had got any money; I said I had 11d.: Browning took hold of the collar of my coat, and took me down an alley by the side of a public-house; she took me underneath the arch, which goes out of Type-street into <placeName id="t18271025-69-crimeloc428">Grub-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you cry out? A. There was nobody near me; Prince immediately followed after her - Browning did not ask me to go any where with her, or say any thing, but immediately began pulling me about; she undid my waistcoat and the waistband of my trousers - I said nothing to her; Prince held my arm up - Browning searched my pockets; and on my calling out, somebody looked out of window - nobody came to my assistance till after it was all done; I then went down the court, and saw the watchman; I felt in my pocket, and the money was all gone - Prince took off my hat; they stood in the court with a man - I asked him to take the women away, but he refused to assist; I saw the watchman at the bottom of the court - he said he did not hear me call out - I told him what had happened; I cannot say how far the prisoners were off then: I went down Type-street and Grub-street with the watchman; he looked down the alley, but could not find them; I went to the watch-house and told what had happened - the officer sent the watchmen round with me again; we found Browning on the pavement, and Prince under the archway with a man - they asked the man whether he had got my money; he said No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let them do this without crying out? A. I did call out, after they got my money; I attended at the watch-house, and gave the same account at the office the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not because you were afraid your master would inquire about your hat that you gave any alarm? A. I cried out as soon as they took my money; a man looked out of a window, and Prince took my hat off - I cannot say how long I was in the alley - it might he a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes; I was pulled into the alley; I did not want to go with them - the public-house was shut up, and there was nobody for me to call out to - I am not in the habit of being out late; I did not know there was any harm in telling them what money I had got - they were pulling me about, and searching my pockets; I was very much frightened - I do not know why I did not halloo before; I have seen Browning at our shop - she came to buy butter; I do not recollect seeing Prince before - she was tipsy - the man stood looking on all the time, and heard me halloo - both the prisoners were with me when the person looked out of the window - I was dragged into the court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you get your hat again? A. Yes; Prince threw it down; they did not fondle with me, or attempt to entice me any where.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About a quarter past eleven o'clock, I was in Type-street, and saw this lad come out of a court, on the other side the road, crying- I was about nine yards from the court - I called him over, and asked what was the matter; he said he had been robbed of 11d. by two girls; I asked if he should know them again; he said Yes; I took him through the next court, thinking they might come into Grub-street, but could not see then; I then took him into the court he was robbed in - only two or three houses there are inhabited; I took him to the watch-house, and afterwards went out with him again; he pointed to Browning, who was about 100 yards off, and said, "There is the young woman:" my brother watchman took her; he said, "There is the other," pointing to Prince, who was talking to some man; she said, "What am I to go to the watch-house for?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you on your beat? A. Yes; it is about twelve yards from the court; I heard no hallooing; I had come up that moment from calling eleven o'clock - it is a very dark narrow court; there is one lamp there, but it gives a bad light; he could not see them, unless it was done under the lamp; the public-house had been closed sooner than usual that night; when I saw the boy his waistband, and his waistcoat were open.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Type-court; I was in bed a little after eleven o'clock, and heard what I thought the cry of a little girl in the court; I laid a minute or two, and heard the voice say, "Pray let me go; I have got no more;" I jumped out of bed, opened the window, and called out, "What are you doing with that girl?" I then saw it was a boy - I saw Browning, as I suppose there - I could only distinguish her by her voice; I have heard her speak several times before; after I called out, she let go of the boy, and went down the court; Bruce called the boy to him, and asked what they had robbed him of; he said 11d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is a bad light in the court? A. It is an oil lamp; I could not discern any body's features.</p>

            . I am a constable; the prisoners were brought to the watch-house on this charge; the boy said, in their hearing, that he was going up Type-street, and one of them met him at the end of the court, and took him up there; that one held his hands while the other robbed him, and then took his hat off; that a man hallooed out of a window to them, and they ran away, after dropping the hat; they denied it; I found on Browning 1s. 31/2d. in copper, including a pocket-piece called a Macclesfield halfpenny; also 2s. in silver; a man passed by the watch-house, whom I knew kept company with Browning; I took him in charge, and fetched Carlisle to the watch-house; as we came along, he said he had lost a Macclesfield halfpenny; I threw the money down on the table, and he picked out the halfpenny.</p>

               <p>BROWNING's Defence. There is only one lamp in the court, and nobody could perceive a person unless they were close to them; the prosecutor said at Worship-street, that the watchman was twelve yards off, and afterwards said he did not see him till he came to Type-street; Harrison asked him if he had lost a pocket-piece, and he said Yes; there is hardly a 5s. paper of half-pence without such a pocket-piece as that in it; I had treated this young woman with a quartern of rum, and she is innocent.</p>

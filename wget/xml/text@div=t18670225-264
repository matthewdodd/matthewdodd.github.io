                  </hi>. In May last I was in the employment of Messrs. Taylor and Stokes, of 45, Friday Street, Cheapside, silk manu<lb></lb>facturers—I hare been in their employment a little over three years—I am just gone eighteen years of age—I know Brown, he is a marine store dealer in George Street, Langham Street, near Portland Place—Newman is a publicau, and keeps the Swan public-house, in George Street—I don't know what Cuthbert is or where he lives—I have known Brown some months, I first saw him at the Swan—about October or November last I sold him six or eight moire" antique dresses—on Thursday, 22nd November, I sold him two dresses, there were eleven yards in each dress; they were worth 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had bought some of me before, and he asked me to get these for him—I got them from a cupboard of Messrs. Taylor and Stokes, I stole them—at the time I sold them to Brown I was in front of his shop—there were a lot of old things in the shop, bills about rags for 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and that sort of thing—I was just inside the shop—I believe Brown gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two dresses—I had first seen him in the morn<lb></lb>ing—he had asked me before to get him the two dresses and when I saw him I said, "I have got those two dresses of moire for you"—after he</p>

               <p>had paid me the money we went round to the Globe public-house: that was in the morning, when we had something to drink; and as we were coming home he asked me if I could get him eleven dresses, I told him I would let him know—I saw a bar-woman at the Globe; it was not there that he asked me, it was as we were coming along home back again he said ten or eleven dresses—I said eleven, because I got him eleven—I said I would let him know, and I did let him know next day, Friday; I said I could get them—I saw him on Friday morning at his own house, and in the evening at the Swan—I then told him I would get them, and he told me to bring them at half-past two next day, Saturday—I don't think any price was mentioned by Brown to me at that time—on the Saturday I took the eleven dresses from Messrs. Taylor and Stokes—I went there at half-past eight in the morning; my proper time was nine o'clock—Mrs. Woolner, the housekeeper, opened the door to me—I had to get the keys from her—I took the eleven dresses a little after half-past eight, I took them to the Golden Last public-house, in Cannon Street—I left no one in the warehouse when I came out—I locked the door and took the keys up again to the housekeeper—the parcel I left at the Golden Last was packed in brown paper—the colours were packed in sheets of brown paper, and then wrapped up in another parcel of brown paper—there were three dresses of black, three of brown, three of bine, and two of violet—I took them from a large quantity in the warehouse—I left them with the bar-woman at the Golden Last, and went back to the warehouse—I went again to the Golden Last about one or a little after, and took away the parcel and took it to the Portland Stores, at the corner of Marylebone Street and George Street—I left it there about half-past one or twenty minutes to two till I called for it—I then went to see if Brown was in—I went to his house, he was not in; I heard that I should see him in the evening at the Swan, about six or seven—I went there about five—after a time Brown came in, and went down to the skittle ground—I went there and saw him; there were other persons there, but neither of the other prisoners—I said to Brown, "I have got these moires for you"—he said, "Well, I have not got the money now; I shall see you bye and bye"—he was to give me about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dress, I put it down on a piece of paper for him; that was arranged on the Friday evenig, I be<lb></lb>lieve—I left the paper with brown—I did not stop long in the skittle ground—I went up stairs, and had a game of bagatelle—I saw Brown occasionally during the evening—before seven was the time I saw him and spoke to him—he said, "I have been disappointed, I cannot get any money to buy these moires, but I have a man here that will buy them, and that will do as well, I suppose"—he pointed to Cuthbert—at that time the dresses were at the Portland Stores—Brown and Cuthbert had been speaking together before; and when Brown said, "Here is a man, that will do as well," pointing to Cuthbert, Brown asked me to get the goods, and took them into the back kitchen of the Swan—I did so, and Brown brought Cuthbert out there; Brown did not remain, he went away, leaving Cuthbert with me—he first said, "Is that the parcel?"—I said, "Yes"—I was going to undo it—he said, "You need not undo it, I will take your word for what is in it"—I did not undo it, he did not see the inside—I told him what there was, eleven dresses—I told him there were three dresses of black, three dresses of brown, three of blue, and two of violet moire antique, making eleven in all—he then said, "How much do you want for them?"—I said, "16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the lot;" that would be 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dress—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250005"></xptr>
               <p>he then said, "I suppose you will take 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them"—he made me that offer without seeing them, he took my word; at least, I suppose somebody had told him before—when he offered me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I said I would take it—he then said he had not got the money with him, but he daresay he could borrow it of Mr. Newman; "at all events," he said, "I can borrow 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him; if you will write me out a receipt for the money, I will get it from Mr. Newman, and I will give you an I O U for the remainder"—he went to Newman at the bar, and said, "Lend me a tenner, will you, Bill?"—he said, "I have not got it, but I can spare you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if that will do"—he asked me if I would take the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and have the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Monday between six and eight—I said yes, after a little while—Newman gave Cathbert 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Cuthbert wrote out a receipt for a stamp, and signed for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the receipt—it is Cuthbert's writing, and this is my signature—(<hi rend="italic">read;</hi> "London, November 25th, 1866. Received of Mr. Cuth<lb></lb>bert the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account of silk received. <hi rend="smallCaps">G. MORELL</hi>.") I saw Cuthbert write that, and I stamped and signed it; I then handed it to Cuthbert, and he gave me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he brought the parcel from the back kitchen and handed it over to Mr. Newman, and he put it behind the bar—I then went away—I saw Cuthbert again on the Monday between six and ten at the Swan—on the Sunday I saw my master, Mr. Taylor—I was taken by him to the house of his brother—on the Monday evening following, close upon eight, I went to the Swan, and he was gone—I saw Newman, he asked a barman or potman called Tom to fetch up a note that Cuthbert had left for me; he brought it to me—I handed it to one of the detectives almost directly, when I left the Swan—I read it and gave it to the detective—I went to Wormwood Street at eleven next morning, at the corner of Bishopsgate Street, and there met Cuthbtrt—I first spoke to him, and he said, "I have not got the money for you, but I shall see you this evening at the Swan—I said, "Can't I meet you at your house or somewhere else? I don't like always going to the Swan"—he said no—he asked me if I would have a glass of something to drink, and we went into a public-house at the corner of Wormwood Street and Bishops<lb></lb>gate Street, and the police came and took him into custody—when Cuth<lb></lb>bert and I were in the back kitchen with the dresses on the Saturday he did not ask where I got them from, he only said, "I do not wish every<lb></lb>body to know my business outside, I want it kept dark"—Cuthbert was alone with me at that time—I said, "Nobody knows anything about it but Brown and you"'—he said, "All right"—I once sold Newman two dresses, that was some time before the eleven dresses.</p>

WARNER SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long is it since you first stole anything from your employers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four months or so before the first examination—I believe I said so at the police-court—I had not stolen patterns ten months before—I took them because they were of no use—I don't believe I said at the police-court that I stole them—if I did it was a mistake—I don't recollect having said so—I will not swear I did not—I had goods on sale or return—I said so to Miss Botwood; that is all, I think—I have told persons that I had woollen goods on sale or return—I think I have sold about thirty dresses of moire altogether; twenty-one to the prisoners and the remainder to Sylvester—I don't know that Mr. Gushway says there are about forty dresses missing—I saw it stated in the paper, but they often lose dresses—I always had receipt stamps in my pocket-book—Cuthbertbrought me the receipt to sign, and then I took out the pocket-book and the receipt stamp—he said, "Give me a receipt, and I will give you an I O U for the remainder of the money"—it was before Cuthbert went into the back kitchen that I saw Brown speaking to him, and after Brown said he could not buy the things, both before and after—I believe I hare said before to-day that Cuthbert said he would take my word for what the parcel contained, and also that I told him the number and colours of the dresses—I believe I did not tell Shakespeare that I sold goods on commission—I am not certain; I would not swear I have not—I was not in the police-court when he was examined—I used to spend a good deal of money about.</p>

BELEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at those pieces of silk (<hi rend="italic">producing some</hi>); are those the kind of things you call "patterns?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they are the weaver's patterns, with the stripes on each side; they had not been cut off a dress—they are useless in the warehouse, they would make up into a tie—those are the things I had my master's permission to take some of—I don't know how many of them I sold—I gave away a great many more than I sold—I got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I include in the sixteen or seventeen persons to whom I sold things those to whom I sold these patterns; they were mostly young men about my own age—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are moire antique dresses of the same kind that I took and sold, the same sort as the eleven dresses—I stole some thirty dresses altogether—the satins were folded in handkerchiefs—they were not severed; they could be made into dresses—I should say I took from fifteen to twenty dozen of those—Edwards had two or three of those to sell; with that exception no one but Sylvester and the prisoners had any satins or silks—the highest price I got for the silk was from Sylvester, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one dress—the first trans<lb></lb>action with Brown was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Newman gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for two dresses; they were not quite so rich as those I sold to Brown—I had about half a dozen shirts from Cushway to sell, and two or three shawls at from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was what I gave for them—I sold two or three; I don't remember how many—I always paid Cushway for them before I took them away—the shirts were 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece; and there was a knitted Cardigan jacket at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not sell any sheets; I had some—I made about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. profit on the sixteen or seventeen trans<lb></lb>actions</p>

               <p>with those goods that I had on sale or return, I mean on the lot—I never sold as much as 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth to any one person—I have men<lb></lb>tioned all the transactions I had in reference to the sale of goods—the excuse I made to the housekeeper for being at the warehouse so early in the morning was, that I had to go and see somebody off by the railway by an early train, and then I went there afterwards—whoever was there first, Cushway or me, or any other, had the keys—I represented that the satins Sylvester bought were part of an old stock, not the moire antiques; any one could see they were new.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not usual in selling old stock to sell at a large discount from the wholesale price? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know; not when goods are of any value—in this case the old stock was worth a good deal more than new, because silk had risen a good deal—I did not represent to the prisonen that I was a commission agent, or that I had these or any other goods on sale or return—I did not represent that these were job lots.</p>

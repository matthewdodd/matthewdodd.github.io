I had two pots of beer before the prisoner and his companions came into my company, and then I treated them with whatever they liked - I paid for six pots of beer, which we drank among us, and about half a pint of gin.

While I was standing at her door, the prisoner and four of his companions came up, and said nothing; but the prisoner clapped his left hand against my breast, and gave me a shove back with his right hand, and took my watch out of my pocket, and gave it to another one; they all started off immediately. My witness and her companion ran and called out, "Stop thief!" and the prisoner was stopped by the patrol, before he got out of my sight. I have not got my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What had you been doing in the early part of the day - A. I was on duty on board ship. I drank about a pot of beer before I went to the house. I saw the prisoner at the Standard directly I went in; they joined my company after I had drank two pots; we had some gin before us. I was rather intoxicated at the time I left the house. I was to have met Gamble and her friend there at six o'clock - she is a woman of pleasure. I had a glass of grog at one o'clock. Bluegate-fields is about three-quarters of a mile from the house. I felt the watch go, saw it in his hand, and made a grasp at it. I was rather intoxicated.</p>

            . I have known Newton eight or nine months. On the 17th of November, I lived at No. 12, Bluegate-fields. I saw 
               <persName id="t18231203-16-person200">Newton</persName>
             that night, at ten o'clock, at the Standard - I went there with a female; I had promised to meet him there at six o'clock. We stopped there about half an hour, and had a pint of beer, which I paid for. I saw the prisoner there; I did not know him before - he was in company with four more. I could not get Newton away, and I went and spoke to the watchman to help me out of the house with him - he was not much in liquor, but the prisoner and his companions wanted him to stop there with them. I went to sit down by him, and they shoved me out of the seat, and said I did not belong to him, and they would not let him go. When I got the watchman, he came away with me - the prisoner and two more helped him out of the door. Newton, I, and the young woman went away together, and they all five followed us, and one of them said if I did not let the man go, he would knock me down. When we got to my door, the prisoner shoved Newton back against the wall, and took the watch out of his pocket with his right hand, and as he was getting it out he put his thumb up to my throat, and almost throttled me. He gave the watch to one of his companions, and then ran away - I ran after them, calling Stop thief! Newton also ran. The prisoner was stopped, but he got out of my sight for a short time; I am sure he is the man who took the watch. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure you never saw him before - A. Never. I was never at the Standard but once before. My friend is an unfortunate woman, and lived in the same house, but not in the same room. The prosecutor was a little in liquor, but not much; he was not tipsy. The prisoner pushed him in the breast with his left hand, and took the watch with the right, and at that time put his left hand to my throat; there is a gaslight at the door. I am certain of his person. Newton took his watch out at the public-house to see the time, and I saw his seal hanging out in the street; it is a silver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030009"></xptr>watch - I had often seen it - he had two seals and a key. Betsey Harris is the female who was with me; she was not bound over to attend here - she went before the Magistrate, but was not called. She went home last Monday to her mother's, who is very ill. Newton set up in my room all night, and did not go to bed.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 17th of November, I was stationed in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, and about the middle of New Gravel-lane, I heard the rattle spring, between eleven and twelve o'clock - I listened, heard it a second and third time, and heard a call of Stop thief! it came down the lane from towards me. I stopped under the gas lamp, and saw five men running towards my beat; I stepped into the middle of the road, and drew my stick ready to receive them - three ran on the left side, and two on the right; I collared the first who came up - he said, "I have not done it, that is the one who has done it," pointing to the prisoner. I directly let go of him, and laid hold of the prisoner, but still called Stop thief! after the others. The prisoner said, "I have not done it, the man you have let go has done it;" I said, "Somebody has done it, and I shall secure you right or wrong." The first person who came up was Gamble, the witness - she said, "Watchman, what have you got him?" I said, "Is this the man;" she said, "Yes, that is the man who robbed him, I will swear." The prisoner did not say a word. I searched him, but found nothing. Newton came up next, and said he was the man who had stolen his watch, and gave him in charge. The prisoner seemed out of breath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw five persons in the road, at that time you saw none in pursuit - A. No; none of them were in sight at the time. Newton appeared tipsy, but I cannot say, for I was so flurried, having so many round me, but he appeared very intoxicated.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after you stopped the prisoner did Gamble come up - A. About two minutes. I stopped him six or seven hundred yards from Bluegate-fields. I did not know the charge against him till Newton came up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am wholly innocent.</p>
               <p>Seven witnesses gave the prisoner a good Character.</p>

About half-past six o'clock in the evening of the robbery, I saw him at home - I took the newspaper over and a bushel of coals. It was half-past six to the best of my recollection - I have no particular reason for fixing the time. The Standard is half a mile off.</p>

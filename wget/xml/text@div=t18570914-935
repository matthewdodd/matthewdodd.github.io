On 25th Aug., a few minutes before 6 o'clock, I was sent out to receive an account, and on returning back there was a cheesemonger's cart, which had left some hams—I missed one of them; there ought to have been ten, and there were but nine—I went after the prisoner directly up Flying Horse Yard, but I could see nothing—a woman said she knew the prisoner, and I got a police<lb></lb>man—the woman saw the prisoner, and I gave him in charge.</p>

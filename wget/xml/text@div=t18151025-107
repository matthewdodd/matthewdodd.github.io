            . On Friday, the 22nd of September last, I was in Tower-street, between five and six in the evening; I saw the man prisoner, gingling a three shilling token, which was bad, on the step of a door. I followed them up Mark lane, in company together; the man went into a baker's shop, the woman went in after him, and I stood on the outside; I saw him tender a three shilling token; it was refused. They joined again, and went through a court, which lead into Billeter-square; they then went into London Hall street; there the female prisoner went into a chandler's shop; the man stood outside, at about ten yards from the shop. She staid a very little time in the shop; when she came out, I went in.

             keeps that shop; I made enquiry; in consequence of which, I continued to watch them; I followed them through Billeter-square, into Fenchurch-street, and to Mr. Sharp's shop; the woman went in there; Blakeney stood outside; it is a grocer's shop. She came out, and they immediately joined company again. I then went into the shop, and was shewn a three shilling piece, which I desired the young man in the shop to mark, and he marked it in my presence. I then followed the prisoners into Crutched Friars; there the woman sat on the step of a door, whilst the man went into a baker's shop. I saw him throw down a three shilling piece, which was refused; that was Moxey's. Then they joined company, and went into Mark-lane, from thence into Tower-street, where they went into a public-house; I followed them, and made some enquiry of the landlord. I followed them from thence into Thames-street; the man then went into a cook's shop, and came out almost directly; upon his coming out, they joined company again directly, and went into the Red House, Lower Thames-street. I went in, and observed the person, whom I thought to be the landlord, coming from the tap room towards the bar, with a three shilling piece in his hand. I asked him what the people had given him, and he shewed me the three shilling piece, which he said was a bad one, and in my presence he marked it, by my directions. I then apprehended the prisoners, who were in the tap room. I found nothing on the man; on the woman I found a counterfeit three shilling en in her right hand, and fourpence halfpenny in copper.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy a shop and parlour in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields—the landlord occupies the second floor. On 16th Oct., a little before ten o'clock, I left my shop, and locked the door—I went to a public-house in Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner there, with two others—I knew him by sight—after I had been there a good while, I found they bad left the room—in consequence of that, I went to my shop, and found the door bolted on the inside—I said, "Go round the back way"—I had no one with me, but was fearful they might make their escape at the back—the prisoner came out at the side door about two minutes after I went round—I went to collar him—he ran away down the street, and I after him—he threw some<lb></lb>thing down an area, which sounded like keys—I went on, and saw him stopped—I gave him in charge, and pointed out the area to one policeman, and went back to my house with another, I found the door bolted inside, and the door the prisoner came out of, open, which I bad left locked—my drawers had been opened, and some sponges were on the floor, which had been on the counter—the till was open—I did not miss anything from it—I found a key on the pavement, which I gave to the policeman.</p>

I was on duty in Great Queen-street about half-past eleven o'clock at night, and heard a cry of" Stop thief!"—the prisoner ran out of the door of No. 50—I pursued him, and saw him throw something towards the areas—I took him to the station, searched him, and found some matches in his coat pocket—I went back to the area, and found these eight skeleton keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

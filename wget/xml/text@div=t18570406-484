                  </hi>. I carry on business at No. 1, Spring Garden Place, Stepney; I keep a butter shop. On Monday, 16th Feb., in the afternoon, I had a firkin of butter in my establishment—I saw it last in my shop about 3 o'clock—I missed it next morning, and in consequence of information I went with Copping to the prisoner's shop—it is an oil shop, in Leonard Street, Curtain Road—I went in first by myself, leaving the officer outside—I saw the prisoner, and said to him, "I understand you bought a firkin of butter last evening which was stolen from my shop"—he said, "No, I have bought no butter"—I said, "It is no use your deny<lb></lb>ing it; I have a man outside who saw it stolen from my shop, and watched it till it was brought to yours"—he said again that he had bought no butter—a constable came in uniform, and asked the prisoner if he had not bought any butter—the prisoner denied it again—the constable told him that we had proof of it, and had a person outside that saw it stolen—the prisoner then said that he had had some butter brought there the previous evening, but he did not buy it; he had lent some money on it—we went into the parlour behind the shop, and the prisoner said to me, "I suppose you have no vindictive feeling towards me"—I said, "No"—he asked if I knew the value of the firkin of butter—I said it cost me about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "If you will make out your bill, I will pay you for it; I am a respect<lb></lb>able man, and have been in business a number of years; I would rather do that than have any <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about it"—I repudiated anything of that—the butter is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ann Street, Globe Road. On 16th Feb. I was near the prosecutor's shop, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing—I saw four men together, and one of them went and took up a cask of butter from the prosecutor's shop, and put into a bag, and then upon a barrow, and took it to the Curtain Road to the prisoner's shop—I followed them—they did not stop before they got to Mr. Jackson's shop—when they got there, they took it off the barrow into the shop—two of them went into the prisoner's shop; one of them came out again—the bag containing the butter was taken in—I saw them all leave the shop—they only took the barrow away—I believe the bag was left there with the butter—I followed them for a short distance, on my road home—I was in custody three weeks ago; it was a mistake on the constable's part—the Magistrate said that I was honourably discharged—there was no evidence against me.</p>

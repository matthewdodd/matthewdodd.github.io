                  </hi>. I am potman at the Duke of York, Lower Searle's-place, St. Clement's—on Thursday night, March 22d, the prisoner was playing at skittles in the skittle-ground—I served him with refreshment, which came to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling, which I put in my pocket and gave him 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, telling him that I would give him the other halfpenny in a few minutes—I had no other money there—I went to my mistress at the bar, and gave her the shilling about ten minutes afterwards—she found that it was bad—I had not lost sight of it—I went to the skittle-ground and told the prisoner that he had given me a bad shilling—he said that he had not—I told him he had—he said I was a liar—he put on his coat, sat down on a seat, and was fumbling in his pockets—I saw his hand under the seat and asked him what he was up to—he said, "Nothing; what do you want! give me that bad shilling, here is a good one"—I took the good shilling, but did not give him the bad one—I told him that I would lock him up—he attempted to run away, but I got hold of him at the door and saw him throw something from him—I picked it up—it was a bad shilling wrapped up in a bit of paper—a constable was sent for, and I gave him in charge with the two bad shillings.</p>

               <p>at the Duke of York, and saw the prisoner—there were several other persons in the ground—he was crossing the yard with Stack—they were struggling together, and I picked up a bad shilling in the yard and took it to the bar and gave it to Mrs. Wilson—I saw him throw something but cannot tell what—I saw some paper in his hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

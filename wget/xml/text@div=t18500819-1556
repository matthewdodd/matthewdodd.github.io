                  </hi>. I live at Wandsworth. On Saturday night, 17th Aug., I met the prisoner there about eleven o'clock, when I came out of a public-house—she asked me if I was an Irishman—I told her I was—I walked up the street with her, talking about Ireland—she told me she knew my brother and sister; I was very much rejoiced at it—she told me she was very badly off, and wanted something to pay her lodging—I took out 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and gave her—she said it was another penny, and I gave her another penny—she then bid me good-night, and made a rush across the street—I suspected her, and put my hand in my pocket—I missed my money, amounting to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know I had it at the time she had been with me—I ran after her and caught her, without losing sight of her—I took hold of her and got her down—I took her hand and found three shillings in it—I asked her for the rest of the money, but she said she would see me b—d first, and told me to get a policeman if I liked—I kept her till the policeman came up—I know that I had three half-crowns and other silver.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V.</hi> 89). I found the prosecutor and the prisoner struggling at the top of East-street, Wandsworth—I found in the prisoner's hand threepence, and twopence in her pocket—I did not find any shillings—she said she ought to give the prosecutor in charge for taking 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from her, a shilling which he gave her, and sixpence her own money—the prosecutor gave me three shillings, which he said he had taken from her hand.</p>

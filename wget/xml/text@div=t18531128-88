                  </hi>. I am the wife of John York, <hi rend="italic">of No.</hi> 1, Vine-court, Burn-street, Marylebone; I know the prisoners by sight. On 4th Oct. last I went into the King William the Fourth, in Salisbury-street, Lisson-grove, with another woman—some time after I had been there the prisoners came in; it appears that the woman who was with me went out and fetched them—I had 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money with me when I went into the house; it was in a handkerchief—I had 25<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether at first—I took the woman in to give her something to drink—I was not sober—the woman saw my money—I do not know that she knew the prisoners—I never saw them in her company—besides the 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I had placed 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the hands of the landlord of the public house; I do not know his name—I had 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it back, and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was left—I asked him for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave it me—I put that in another handkerchief—one handkerchief was a blue one, with a white flower on it, and the other was blue, with a white diamond spot on it—the prisoners were not in the house when I got the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the landlord, they had not come in then—they saw it, because I took it out of the handkerchief and gave it to the potboy—they told me why could not I take care of it myself—they both said that, and I had it back from the potboy again—they saw that—I put it into the same handkerchief it was in before—I afterwards left the house—I went out before the prisoners—there was another in company with the prisoners, but I did not know him—the prisoners followed me out—Lamb asked me to "go somewhere else—I refused, and he then tried to get the handkerchiefs out of my hand—I fell down on I my knees; Lamb then took both the handkerchiefs out of my hand; he I twisted my hand round, and here is my gown to prove how I tried to struggle for them—the other prisoner took the handkerchiefs from Lamb, and they both ran away—I told them not to take my money, but they did, and ran away—I tried to follow them, but they escaped, and I did not see them any more till they were in custody—I was thrown down in the struggle by both of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lamb.</hi> I went into the public-house along with my father and mother, and three or four working men, to have something to drink; the prosecutrix and another woman were there; she was speechless drunk; when she went out, three or four men followed her; I followed her too, but not to rob her; one man snatched her handkerchiefs from her; she said, "Don't rob me of my money? he ran away; I ran after him, but could not overtake him, and when I came back she was in another public house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am not aware that Lamb's father and mother were in the public house; I did not see them—I know his father, I do not know his mother—I am quite sure that Lamb is one of the men that robbed me, because I caught hold of him, and he handed the handkerchiefs to the other man—I was not sober, but not so tipsy but what I knew them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Lamb.</hi> After I was in custody she went to my wife to ask her for some money. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not, his wife and her mother came to me to ask me what I would make it up for—they came to me several times before I went to them, and I said I did not wish to harm them if they would make up for the place in my gown—I went to the mother, and she gave me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to keep away—I went to her on the Sunday evening, and she brought the 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to me</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live at No. 8, South-street Islington. I was in the William the Fourth on 4th Oct., from 11 o'clock till half past 3 o'clock—I saw the prosecutrix and heard her ask the landlord for some money, I saw him give her 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she wrapped it in the corner of a pocket handkerchief—I saw the prisoners in the house before that—there is a partition in the house—they were on one side of the partition before she received the money, and on the other side of it after she received it—at the time the landlord handed the prosecutrix the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I think only the taller prisoner (Lamb) was there, he no doubt observed the money passing—I noticed that he then went out for perhaps half a minute, and then I Hainsbury came in with him—they went to where the prosecutrix was, I saw her in conversation with Lamb—she afterwards went out, Lamb followed her and said something to Hainsbury, and at the same time made some sort of side motion which I interpreted to mean that he should pull the handkerchiefs away from her—he made a sort of snatch with his hand and looked at her, she was close to them and had the handkerchiefs in her hand under her shawl—after they had left the house I heard a noise, I went to the door and saw three men pushing the prosecutrix, the prisoners were two of them—I saw her knocked partially down, I think on one knee—while she was down I saw Lamb pull the handkerchiefs away from her, and directly afterwards I saw Hainsbury take the handkerchiefs from Lamb, put them in his trowsers pocket and run off—she ran after them—they both ran away—while Lamb was snatching the handkerchiefs from her, she was attempting to keep hold of them—I did not hear whether she said any thing or not at the time—I saw nothing more until an hour and a half afterwards, when I think I saw Lamb just put his head within the public house door and then immediately go out again, he did not stay there more than a few seconds—I think when the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was given to the prosecutrix, she might have had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her hand—I saw silver and copper in her hand—I have no doubt whatever as to the prisoners being the persons.</p>

On 4th Oct., about 2 o'clock in the afternoon as I was passing the William the Fourth, I saw Mrs. York come out of the door—I saw two persons, Lamb I can swear to, but I cannot exactly swear to the other, with the handkerchief partly in their hand and partly in hers—they pulled her from the door and she went on the ground by the strength of the handkerchief, she laying hold of it—the handkerchief was taken from her, I could not say by whom, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. flew out of it—I heard her say, "Don't take my money"—that was after she was down on the ground—both the men then ran up Earl-street—the prosecutrix stood there and seized hold of a third person who came up, but I did not observe him being there, and I told her I did not think he knew anything about it—she afterwards let him go, and I do not know what then became of her—about an hour afterwards I saw Lamb at Cooper's beer shop in Bell-street Lisson-grove, where I happened to go in, I spoke to a policeman and had him apprehended—I am certain he is one of the men that took the handkerchief from Mrs. York.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant-major of the Royal Artillery, part of which is lying at Woolwich. On the 20th of October, about ten minutes before nine o'clock in the morning, I was on the parade in front of the barracks, and noticed the prisoner there—he was saying he belonged to the battalion—I asked his name—he said, it was Ferguson—I asked him whose coat that was which he had—it was a regimental coat—he said it was his own—I found it belonged to Little—I detained him, had him taken in charge—he had been in the Artillery, but had been discharged.</p>

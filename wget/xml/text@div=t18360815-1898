               <p>how you get out;" which took my attention from my bag rather, he was so very polite, which made me notice him—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went down to my counting-house—I immediately recollected my bag of silver, and ran out to look for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, but he was gone—I caught sight of him—he went like lightning round Woodstock-street—I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> after making inquiry, but did not overtake him—I drove about for three hours, and went to Somerset-house twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Edward-street, Dorset-square, and am a carpenter and joiner. I am the prisoner's landlord—I know he was at home on the 25th of June, ill—his wife came to pay my rent on the 25th, and he was at home for several days after—I saw him at home on the 29th</p>

               <p>of June, and for several days after that I can say he was at home ill, and did not go out at the front door for several days, that I could see—he might go out at the back door—he did not go out till a fortnight after the 25th—I saw him about the middle of the day, from twelve to one o'clock, on the 29th—he could not go out—he had a stick, and was almost double and leaning on the bannisters of the stairs—he complained of pain across his loins—Mr. Kenrick's son has called on me.</p>

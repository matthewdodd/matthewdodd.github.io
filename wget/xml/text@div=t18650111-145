                  </hi>. I live at 50, Bath-street, New Swindon—on Saturday, 24th December, I was walking with my wife and brother down Aldgate High-street—I stood to look in at a shop-window—the prisoner was standing beside me on my right side—he was the only man there—I had a watch in my right-hand pocket—I felt my watch going away from my chain—there was no one but the prisoner that could have moved it—I col<lb></lb>lared him—I saw a pocket-handkerchief in his hand, which he passed directly behind him, and I saw no more of it—there were two or three little boys behind him—I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long were you standing against the window before you missed your watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a minute—I had seen you about five minutes before—I could not see the watch when I collared you—I believe it was in the handkerchief which you passed behind you—you tried to get away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's brother, and was with him at this time—we stopped to look in at a toy-shop window—I saw the prisoner there, and I had seen him previously at another shop—he moved on as we did, and at the toy-shop he stood alongside my brother—I saw my brother lay hold of him—the prisoner had a pocket-handkerchief, and he stooped down and passed it behind his back; I believe it was taken by a shoe-black boy, who was near him—there were two or three round—I don't know what became of them; such a crowd came round at once I could not see—there was no one else near enough to my brother to take his watch, but the prisoner and two little boys—I don't believe the boys took it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I make any resistance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you did—I suspected that the watch was in the handkerchief—I did not take hold of it; you were too wide-awake for that—a little boy came up and told the policeman that there were two men over the way looking at a watch—that was a penny watch—I did not see it.</p>

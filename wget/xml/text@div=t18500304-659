                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 47). On the afternoon of 12th Feb. I saw Henderson come off the steps of the door of Mr. Bachelor's shop, in High-street, Clapham—Bryant was standing in a turning, close by, just round the corner—Henderson walked across the road and Bryant also, and they joined company—I followed them down the road about a quarter of a mile in company, and they then returned separately, on different sides of the road, to the top of Acre-lane, and then joined company again—they then went towards Mr. Marler's—I lost sight of Bryant—Henderson then crossed the road, and I lost sight of him—I then saw him come out of Mr. Marler's shop, buttoning something under his coat, and walk past a turning close by—it appeared to me as if he was looking for his companion—I went across, took him into custody, and found one bottle under his coat, and another in his pocket—I then saw Bryant standing down a turning, about fifty yards off—I took Hender<lb></lb>son to the station, went and found Bryant, and took him to the station—I then went back to where I saw Bryant standing, and there saw a candlestick, which is claimed by Mr. Badcock—Bryant was forty or fifty yards from the shop when I apprehended Henderson—I believe he saw me take Henderson—he walked off, down the Clapham-road—another constable found on the spot where Bryant had been standing, two candlesticks belonging to Mr. Marler, as well as the candlestick belonging to Mr. Badcock.</p>

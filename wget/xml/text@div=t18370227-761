                  </hi>. I live in Great Alie-street. The prisoner was in my service for about three weeks—she was to leave on the 7th of February, but on the 5th she threw a large coal at my sister-in-law, and I was induced to tell her to quit at the moment—she hesitated a little, and then said she would go—she put on her bonnet, and took her box under her arm—I said her box ought to be examined before she left, which she would not agree to—I asked her several times, but she still declined—I sent for a policeman—during that time I saw her go to her box, and from there to the water-closet, and return—she was then requested to open her box—she consented, and the things which are now here were in it—I believe them to be mine—the boots I can swear to, because they have some pieces placed in them—this tippet I believe is mine—I deal in these the articles.</p>

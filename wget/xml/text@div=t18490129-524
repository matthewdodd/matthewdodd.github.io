                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bateman; he lives at the Georgt public-house at the corner of Little Prescot-street, Goodman's-fields. I know the elder Arment—he brought this check to me on the evening of the 25th or 26th Oct., and asked me to give him cash for it—he said it was one he had taken in the course of his business—I looked at it, and said, "If you place your name at the back, I will change it for you"—he said, "I can't write; I will thank you to do it for me"—I wrote his name on the back—I knew he was a coal-merchant—I had had four tons of coals of him—I did not know he kept a coal-shed.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know whether he is a person who sells things on commission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never had any dealings with him, but ever since I have had that house I have known him as a customer—he asked me for an order for coals, and I gave it him—I knew his name, and wrote it for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live at 83, White-chapel-road. About three months ago the younger Arment came to me, and offered to sell some crimson silk-damask similar to this—I asked him where it came from—he said he sold it for a small manufacturer in Spitalfieldi—I declined it—I believe he offered me this piece of goods at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he told me afterwards he had sold it to Mr. Jackson for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturing stationer, In Fleet-street. On the night of the 28th of April I was going through Temple—her—the prisoner met me close to my own house—she asked me to accom<lb></lb>pany her, which I declined, and requested her to leave me; but she still continued walking with me, and managed to extract from my pocket two half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences—I charged her with it, and begged her to return me my money, and go about her business—she said she had not taken any money, but I was certain she had—I felt her hand about my person, and when she was about leaving me her hand was clenched—I said, "What have you in your hand?"—she said, "Nothing," and put it to her bosom—I said she had robbed me, and insisted on her giving me my money—I kept her in sight, and gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of St. Dunstan's in the West. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house—I searched her, and found half-a-crown in her bosom and two sixpences in her pocket—I took her down to the cell—the prosecutor said he was positive she had his money—I went to her, and told her to unlace herself, and let her petticoat and pocket drop on the floor—she loosened herself, and the other half-crown fell to the ground—in all I found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on her—she had said she had no money at all about her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the master of St. Mary-le-bonne Work-house. There is a room there called the Rota room—I know the prisoners very well; they have all been in and out of the house—Hickey was dis<lb></lb>charged on 27th March, at his own request; Hibberd in May, 1853, I have not seen him since; and Williams in Feb., 1854—there is a chest of ten drawers in the Rota room—it is not usual to put money in those drawers, but money has been put there when relief was administered, and the prisoners have partaken of that relief—it is given both in money and provisions—on the evening of 28th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I went round the premises, according to my custom, and saw that they were per<lb></lb>fectly safe—the rota room, being part of my residence, is the last part I got to; I am bound to sit up till 12 o'clock, and if anybody had got in before then, I should certainly have heard them—from information I received on the following morning, I went to the rota room, and found one of the win<lb></lb>dows up, one shutter broken, and one panel completely off—the parties must have got on each other's backs, and got over the front wall—eight of the drawers which had locks on them had been broken open; the other two</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 857). On Tuesday morning, 28th March, about half past 5 o'clock, I was in Alsop-place, New-road, and saw the three prisoners coming in a direction from Regent's-park towards the New-road, about 100 yards from the workhouse—I followed them—Williams went down Northumberland-street, and the others down Nottingham-place; I stopped them in Paddington-street, and asked them where they had been to all night—they said they had been at Mary-le-bonne stone yard inquiring for work—I said, "I suspect you; give me the property you have got about you"—Hickey on that produced this pair of punches, and Hibberd this pocket book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "I shall take you to the station house, for I expect you have perhaps both committed some burglary"—I asked where they got these things—they said they found them in the road—I gave them in charge of another constable, and went after Williams; I found him at the corner of Nottingham-street and Paddington-street—I asked him where he had been all night; he said, "Me and the other two have been at a coffee shop all night—they were all three taken to the station, and I found on Hibberd this brass ornament, with matches in it—I found a knife on Hickey; I have not got it here, because he was discharged by the inspector, and the knife and ornament were given up, but the pocket book we kept—the point of the knife was a little bent; it had been sharp<lb></lb>ened, and would do for a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on a small scale—it has a pen blade.</p>

About half past 6 o'clock on this morning I went to the workhouse and found a poker on the window sill, and two chains on the roof of a shed adjoining the outer wall—from that point a person could get into the rota room—I found the room in great disorder, the shutters broken off, and eighteen drawers broken open—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I found on the table would do it—the other knife found would also be sufficiently large to do it—I did not compare it with this, as I had not got it then—the prisoners had been discharged, and were not taken into custody until afterwards—about half past two o'clock I took Williams—he said he had been taken before, and he had nothing to do with it.</p>

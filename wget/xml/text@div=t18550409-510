                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness. I recollect her coming to me in the bakehouse, at a little before 12 o'clock—she gave me a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I discovered that it was bad—I went into the shop, and found the prisoner there—I told him it was bad, and he asked me to give it him back—I refused that, and asked him where he got it from—he said he got it in change for a sovereign—I said he must have more about him—he said nothing to that—he went away, and I followed him for nearly two miles—he walked in a circle, and went by the back of the Exhibition—I saw him stop, and count some silver—he turned, saw me, and ran away—he threw something from his right hand—he made a jump from a wall, and ran away—I called to a man to follow him—he took him, and I went with the officer to the spot where I saw something thrown—I saw the officer pick up one shilling—I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I have seen it since—I know it by a mark I made on it.</p>

My son is a silversmith and engraver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you fell knives in that shop? - My son-in-law does. I told him that Mr. Roberts was not come down, but he would be down in a few minutes; I got up from the stool that I was sitting on, and rung the bell for him, but Mr. Roberts not coming down as quick as I could wish him, and the maid servant being in a room by the side of the shop, I left the boy in the shop, and went up one pair of stairs to call Mr. Roberts, I called him, when I got to the top of these stairs, and coming down the stairs, about half way, the prisoner darted out of the shop, immediately I see him, which gave me a suspicion that he had stolen something, and I hastened down stairs as fast as I could, the remainder part of the stairs, and got out of doors, and saw him running with all his might, along the street, then I called out stop thief! and he was stopped near the Bell inn, I saw him stopped, I saw a man take hold of his coat, and brought him forward; my next door neighbour, Mr. Trustee, and I seeing of that, went and met him and collared him, I brought him into the shop of Mr. Trustee, my next door neighbour searched him, I see him, and took the buckles from him out of his pocket; Mr. Trustee delivered him into the hands of the officer, whom I charged him with,

               <p>Mrs. Rutter. She was in confinement in Brentford cage, and she said, she should know the shop, and at last; she took us into the shop, we saw the gown upon a shelf.</p>
               <p>Court. But how came you to ask her if she had your gown? - Because she had robbed my neighbour, that gave me suspicion.</p>

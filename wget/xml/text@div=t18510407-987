                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, at High-street, Stratford. Alfred Berry has been my shopman two years. On 2nd April, I marked some sixpences, shillings, and seven fourpenny pieces, and gave them to Hardy, who is a customer of mine, to go to my shop—Frederick Berry was afterwards brought to me at the parlour of the Blue Boar by police<lb></lb>men Benton and Harvey, and I asked him if his brother had given him anything—he said he had given him nothing—he afterwards said he had given him a fourpenny-piece, which was produced, and was one of those I had marked.</p>

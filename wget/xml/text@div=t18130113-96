I trusted him with the tools mentioned in the indictment, to draw silver wire for me; a part of which he brought home. He had left me previous, and had been in bad company. He got into Tothill-fields. I made him an out-door apprentice, in a kind of a way that he might keep himself in credit, and not finding all the wire come home, I got a search warrant, and when I went I found all my tools missing, and never could find what he had done with my silver wire. My tools are here; they are plates and copper rings. I trusted him with the complete tools, altogether worth between ten and fifteen pounds.</p>

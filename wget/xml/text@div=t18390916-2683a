This property was taken from our wharf in Lambeth—Bowley was in my service as carman, and resided in the yard—Carter was in the service of a man named Cross, at the next wharf to oars—this sack is mine, and the contents likewise—Bowley's business would not take him in my yard at four o'clock in the morning, but at half-past four, and from that to five o'clock—on the morning this occurred, it was his business to take a cart out at half-past four.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a workman at Mr. Sinnott's. On the night of the 13th of September I was watching up in a loft over a stable, and a little before four o'clock in the morning I saw Carter get over a fence adjoin<lb></lb>ing the premises at the same time, and stood by the side of the slop-cart, which was about three yards from where Carter got over—Bowley must have seen Carter—he passed him within about three fart—Carter then went up the wharf, and passed the stable about three yards, that is about twenty yards from where Rowley was—Carter took a ladder, tarried back about three yards, and put it against the stable-door—he got up it, climbed over, and was in the stable about ten minutes—the stable-door was in sight of Bowley, who was standing still in the same position—this sack was thrown over the door into the ground, then Carter came out, look it up on his shoulders, went down the wharf with it, and passed Bowley again—I did not hear them speak, but he passed about the same distance that he did before—he threw the sack over the fence, then turned back, and spoke to Bowley—I and Hampson then went down to the wharf, he laid hold of Carter, and I sprung a rattle—Bowley went on to the stable-door.</p>

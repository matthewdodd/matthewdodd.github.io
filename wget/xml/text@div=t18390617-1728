                  </hi>. I live in Aldermanbury. Hirst was my journeyman—I marked two ends of black cloth at Messrs. Brett, Bro<lb></lb>thers, and Co., in Wood-street—it was sent to me on Friday, the 31st of May—these two, with six others, were damped and pressed, and returned in the usual way to Messrs. Brett—I went to Brett's and examined them, and the two I had marked had been cut—about a quarter of a yard was gone from each—I went to Roe, the officer, on the Wednesday—he came to my place at two o'clock the same day, and Mr. Brett, with Hint, was up stairs—I accused him of cutting these cloths—he at first positively denied it—I told him, if he told me about the cloths he had cut I would not prosecute him—Roe went to Bateman, and returned with two cuts of cloth, which I owned as mine—this one was safe on my premises on the Tuesday night—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

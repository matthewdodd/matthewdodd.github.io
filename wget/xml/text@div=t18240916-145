            . I am the wife of Charles Bates - we live in Borough-road. On the 10th of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner hired a truck of me for three hours, and said he was going to draw hardware in it - I said he must leave 1 s. deposit; he said he had not got one, but would go home and fetch one; that he lived at No. 15, Clifford-street, Blackfriars-road, and his name was Roberts. Seeing him a decent man I said,</p>

               <p>"Never mind, bring it when you return the truck; it is 3 d. an hour." He took it away, and said he would return it in three hours.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOSWORTH. I am a labourer, and live in Gray's Inn lane. On the 10th of November, between three and four o'clock, I was crossing Smithfield, and saw the prisoner by the Bear and Ragged Staff, public-house, with a truck, and asked him if it was for sale - he said he did not know, but he would call the person who belonged to it, and while I was speaking to him a man came up, of whom I bought it, in the prisoner's presence, for 15 s. The officer came up and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRANSCOMB. I am an officer. I was in Smith-field, and in consequence of information I went up to this truck; the prisoner and Bosworth came out of the public-house; I asked the prisoner if the truck belonged to him - he said it did: Bosworth said he had just bought it; I said I must take the prisoner into custody, and at that moment the man who I understood had received the money, ran out of the public-house, and escaped. Bates claimed the truck - his name was on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man who received the money persuaded me to borrow it for him.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 18.</p>

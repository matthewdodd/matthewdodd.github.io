            . I was on a visit to my sister, who is Solomon's wife. On the eight of March, about half-past six o'clock, I was up stairs, and heard a knocking in the shop - I went down, and found the prisoner Brough in the shop, with an apron on, and his right-hand under it; he asked if we sold china marbles; I said we did not sell any thing of the kind; he then went a little on one side; I opened the door, and let him out - I stood at the door a minute, and then shut it, and am sure that I latched it; I went up stairs again. I had seen the glass dish and jug in the shop before he came in, but did not look for them afterwards, not suspecting any thing. He was brought back by Watkins four or five minutes after I let him out.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Sowerby, of Chiswell-street. On the 8th of March, about twenty-five minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, I was shutting up the shop - day-light had quite gone; I saw the prisoner Medwinter looking in at the prosecutor's window: I did not know him before, but am sure of him. In about half a minute I saw him open the door and go in, and in about another half minute I saw him come out with something glass in his right hand, and when he passed me I saw that it was a glass jug; he ran down Finsbury-street - at the corner of which is our house - I pursued him, and at the bottom of Finsbury-street saw him give the jug to Brough, saying,</p>
               <p>"Here Jem, is another;" this was about 100 yards from Solomon's house - he was never out of my sight - a person in Finsbury-street could not see Solomon's shop; he walked on a little, and then ran. I collared Brough, took the jug from him, and began to unrol his apron - he then said,</p>
               <p>"Here is something he has just been making me a present of," which I found was the dish. I took him back to Solomon's; a constable was sent for, to whom I gave the jug and dish.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEE. I am a constable. Here is the jug and dish, which I received at Solomons.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL SOLOMON. I know them both very well.</p>

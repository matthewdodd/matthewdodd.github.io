I missed the watch from my bed-room about eight o'clock in the morning of the 10th of January. I asked if he had got his father's watch; he said No. He went out of the room - I followed him, and stopped with him till his father came home; he then searched him, and took it from his trowsers pocket - he said nothing then - he denied it till his father found it.</p>

            . I am an oilman. When I returned home, my wife charged my son with stealing my watch. I told him from what his mother had said, I was convinced he had got it - he denied it. He was in the privy. I found the watch laying upon the seat, and his hand upon it. I did not see him take it out of his pocket. I have seven children - he is the eldest but one.</p>
               <p>JOANNAH LORD. It was in his pocket when I went out of the privy, for I could hear the chain rattle.</p>

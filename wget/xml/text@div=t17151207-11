Cooke in his Defence said, That he had the sole Management of his Master's Business, which he transacted by verbal Order: That he never defrauded , nor intended to defraud Mr. Bateman , tho' many thousand Pounds had pass'd through his Hands for him: That upon a Difference between the Commissioners and Mr. Bateman, he was obliged to go into the Mint; and Mr. Bateman was in Danger of losing his Place; which brought upon him this Prosecution. That he had very much reduc'd his Debt to Mr. Bateman: and that he endors'd the Notes having a regard to Mortality only, and not in the least to injure his Master.

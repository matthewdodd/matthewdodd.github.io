The prisoner lodged in my house on the 11th of August - he slept there on the Friday night, and on the Saturday night I left him to mind my room while I went out to buy a cap; when I returned in a quarter of an hour my little child, whom I had left at home, was crying - the prisoner had broken a lock, and taken my shawl, which he had in his hand - I said, "What are you doing?" he said nothing. I laid hold of the shawl, but he got away, and I could not hold him; my neighbours were in bed - my husband came home soon after: he went after the prisoner all night, but could not find him; we then offered a reward. I afterwards missed the cotton - I have never seen the property since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you stand before the Judge, and say you saw me with the shawl? A. Yes, and you said you would knock me down if I stopped you.</p>

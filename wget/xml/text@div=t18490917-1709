                  </hi>. I was in Messrs. Baker's employ up to May last—I entered their employ in Jan., and in May I was taken into custody. At the June Sessions I pleaded guilty to robbing them—the prisoner was their foreman—they are large meat contractors in Newgate-market—they supply the Model Prison at Pentonville with meat—it was the prisoner's duty to take the meat there every day—it was weighed out to the different contracts between five and eight o'clock in the morning, and the weight put down, and when weighed it was put on one side of the shop in trays, separately, and then taken out in carts—on 17th April the prisoner drove the cart to the Model Prison—after the meat was weighed, and before it went, I saw the prisoner in the shop—I took out the tray, and put it into the cart—I then took a leg of mutton, a leg of beef, and some steaks, to the cart, which had not been weighed—I saw where they came from—the prisoner took the leg of mutton from the rail in the shop—he asked me whether I knew how many there were—I said," No"—Mr. Baker had just gone out of the shop, and the prisoner told me to</p>

               <p>give an eye to Mr. Baker that he was not looking while he took one leg down—he took also a leg of beef from the rail—he cut it from a quarter of beef, and about 4lbs. of steaks—he put them into a tray, and told me to take them to the cart—they were not weighed—there was no one in the shop but the prisoner and me—I put them into the cart—the horse-keeper was there, he told me there was a leg of mutton that did not belong to the Model meat—I know this was on 17th April, because I was going out for a holiday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horse-keeper in the service of Messrs. Baker, of Newgate market. On the morning of 17th April I saw Bigg put some meat into the cart for the Model Prison—after that I saw him bring a round tray, with a leg of mutton, and some beef without bone—I said to him, "That is not Model meat;" and he said, "That is all you know about it"—the prisoner was not there then—the meat was put into the cart, and the prisoner drove it to the Model Prison—it was his duty to take the cart there, and it was my duty to prepare the carts and bring them up—I was induced to make the remark I did, because I had been in the shop while the prisoner and Bigg were there, and no one else; and one of them, I do not know which, had a leg of mutton in his hand, and when I went in he laid it down, and not many minutes afterwards I saw the meat brought out; it was taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Charles Baker, and am in partnership with him. The prisoner was our foreman up to July—we serve the Model Prison with meat—we send out perhaps 800 or 1000 stone of meat a day—the practice is to weigh the meat from five till eight o'clock for the different contracts, and put it by in separate trays—when the meat was weighed it was called out to some one, and the weight put down—none of our men had liberty to take out meat that had not been weighed—I did not know of any meat being taken to the Model Prison on 17th April that had not been weighed—it was done contrary to our orders—it was the prisoner's duty to drive the cart to the Model Prison every morning.</p>

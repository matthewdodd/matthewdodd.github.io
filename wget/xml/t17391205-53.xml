             the 15th of September, between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock at Night, I was robb'd of all the Things mentioned in the Indictment. They were taken out of my Shop in <placeName id="t17391205-53-crimeloc256">Water Lane, in Fleet-street</placeName>

Tis always lock'd o'Nights. I was gone to Bed, but my Wife was in the Shop, at the same time; though she did not miss the Things till between Seven and Eight the next Morning. On the 24th of October last the Prisoner came into the Shop, (I was present at the same time) and he asked my Wife, if she had not lost some Tea, and two Tea-cannisters? yes. Did not you lose a Coffee-cannister, and some Coffee? Yes. Did not you lose two Brass Candlesticks and a Drudging-box, and Pepper-box? Yes. Did you not lose a light Peruke , and a Poker? Yes. Was not your Money-drawer like to have been broke open? Yes. Why then, Mrs.Foster, I am the Thief. I am not drunk; I come to tell you that I am the Thief, and here I am, and will stay till you get a Constable. My Wife asked him, where she sat when he took the Things; you sat, (said he) asleep by the Fire-side. She told him, she had rather sit down with the Loss, than have any Trouble, and so she bid him take himself away; but he damn'd his Eyes, and said, If you don't prosecute me, I'll prosecute you, and will make it cost you 40 l. he was then very sober, and wrote down an Account of the Things we had lost. Upon this I sent to see for an Officer, but we could not get one, nor find a Magistrate at home, so we let him go about his Business. On the Saturday after I took him again, and carried him before Mr. Alderman Lambert , where he deny'd all.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Do you know that I ever wronged any body of a Farthing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foster. I have known the Prisoner several Years: He is a Fellow that follows the Coal-Carts, he's what they call a Scuffle-hunter, and lives in Hanging-sword-Alley; that's no very good Place.</p>
               <p>Tviphena Foster gave the same Account, with only this Variation, That she believed the Prisoner had been drinking, but he was (she said) compos mentis.</p>

             . I know nothing of the Robbery, but I was in the Prosecutor's House when the Prisoner came in and made the Confession (as above.) He told them, They endeavoured to break open the Till with the Poker, but he would not tell who he meant by - They I asked him, if he knew what he was about? yes. Why, (says I) this is a Thing of bad Consequence. I know it, (says he) - I shall go to New Prison. I told him, no, he would go to the Compter: But he said, he knew better, for Evidences went to New Prison, I thought it look'd as if he intended to have made himself an Evidence. He told them, he knew he must go to Prison somewhere, and insisted on their charging a Constable with him, and would not stir out of the House till an Officer came. Upon this I went for a Constable, but the Constable told me, he was busy, and as the Prisoner came voluntarily, we might go with him ourselves before a Magistrate; and we went accordingly to my Lord Mayor's, and to Sir

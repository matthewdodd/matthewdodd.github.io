                  </hi>, I am single, and live at 16, Upton Street, West Ham—the prisoner was in my service for about a month—on Saturday, 14th August, I went to London, and left her in charge of the house—I returned the same evening about 8 o'clock—I found all the drawers turned out, and the prisoner gone—she had not given me any notice—I missed a gold watch, a chain, a key, three rings, brooch, and earrings, and a purse containing a half-sovereign, and various articles of clothing to the value of about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen the greater part of them since, and have identified them—on the Tuesday following I received a letter from the prisoner, stating that she had sent some of the things back, but I did not receive them—there was no address to the letter.</p>

               <p>—on 20th August I received information, and went to a beer-house near Bury, which is kept by the prisoner's mother and grandmother—I saw the prisoner there—I told her I was in pursuit of a young person going in the name of Caroline Hewetson, and I supposed that she was the person—I then read to her a list of the articles that had been stolen—she said, "Shall I be tried at Bury"—I said, "No"—then she said, "I have not got the things"—I said, "Well, I intend to search the house, and you can give me as little trouble as you like"—she said, "I will tell you where they are"—she took me up stairs and produced the greater portion of the things, I which the prosecutrix has identified—I found some of them at Alpheton, some distance off, and some she was wearing.</p>

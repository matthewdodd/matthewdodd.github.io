            . I live with my father, who is a wine and spirit broker, and lives in Great Tower-street; the prisoner was his errand-boy. One morning when I came to town, he took the two bill-cases in question, out of a drawer, and said,</p>
               <p>"See Thomas, what I found yesterday on St. Dunstan's-hill as I was going home." I asked him if he had shown them to his father, and what they contained? he said,</p>
               <p>"I have not, nor have I opened them, for I was so agitated when I found them that I knew not what to do; they are too large to go in my pocket, and I did not like to carry them home in my hand, so I returned to the counting-house, and put them in this drawer." I said he should have spoken to his father about them; and have them advertised, and said he had better speak to him as soon as possible, for if they were found upon him he might be hung; he said he knew that, and he should have spoken to him, but he had not seen him, and he was thinking of speaking to my father when he came in, which I desired him to do, and said if he liked I would mention it myself; he said I might, but afterwards that he had better state the facts himself - I told him to do as he pleased. He then opened the cases, and showed me the contents, which were a bill for 496 l. 18 s. 11 d., a 1 l. bank note, some silver and copper, some coffee warrants, and memorandums; he tied the cases up, and replaced them in the drawer. My father came in shortly after but did not stop long. When he was gone I asked him why he had not spoken to him? he said he saw no occasion for troubling my father, and had rather speak to his father, which he intended to do as soon as he got home, and he would go with him directly to the newspaper office, and have them advertised without any further delay. Next day he said they were advertised. I looked into the Times, and said it was not there; he said he knew it was not there, but it was in the the Morning Advertiser, or Chronicle, I do not remember which. I said I wondered his father had not advertised it in some other papers, as it was so large an amount. He said his father looked upon that paper as being generally perused throughout the City, and thought it sufficient; he said,</p>
               <p>"To-morrow I will tell you the result." On the morrow he informed me that he and his father had been to Messrs. Palmer and King, and restored them the cases. I asked him if they gave him any thing? he said,</p>
               <p>"No, my father would not allow me to accept any recompence, saying it was my duty to restore the property," and said there was property in the cases to the amount of 300 l. or 400 l. in bank notes, and that the gentleman suspected that the person or persons who robbed them had taken the notes out, overlooked this 1 l. note, and thrown the cases away, that some person might find them, and thence bear a suspicion of knowing something of the other property; and said</p>
               <p>"the gentlemen were fully satisfied with respect to my knowing nothing of it, were extremely obliged to my father for his trouble, and would willingly have given me some recompence, if he would have allowed him to accept it. My father has desired me to mention this circumstance to no person, for as the other property is not yet recovered, people may conjecture, by my finding the cases, that I know something of it, but as I told it to you in the first instance, and promised to tell you the result, so I have, but I earnestly entreat you not to mention it to your father or anybody, for you see how the case stands. My father does not wish it to get wind for it is a very unpleasant affair, and might bring suspicion on my family."</p>
               <p>Q. You do not remember the day this took place - A. No. My father had been robbed, and I was looking in the cupboard to see if I could discover any thing, when I found these two bill-cases - this was on the 3d of May, which was a long time after this conversation took place - it might be three weeks or more after. I immediately spoke to my father on the subject, and he went to the prosecutors'.</p>

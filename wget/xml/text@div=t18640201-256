                  </hi>. I am a detective city officer—about half-past 7 on the night of 5th January, I went into the Three Cranes public-house, in Watling-street, and saw Fearn sitting on this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and Moore on his right-hand side whispering to him—I waited there some time, at last they separated; Fearn going in the direction of Southwark-bridge—I followed him, took hold of the parcel, and said, "Fearn, I shall take you into custody for receiving that parcel from one of Mr. Olney's servants; the little man with the plaid scarf on"—Moore at that time was wearing a plaid scarf—Fearn said, "For God's sake don't take me, you will ruin me; I shall lose my character"—he repeated those expressions several times on the way to the station—he said "It is a very bad job for me"—I told him that I had seen them together many times before, and it had been going on for some time—when we got to the station I left him there for a little while and returned to the Three Cranes, thinking to find Moore, but he had gone—I then went back to the station, and said to Fearn, "I-am about to put a question to you, you can please yourself whether you answer it or not. What is the name of that little man you received the parcel from?"—he said"Samuel Moore"—I said, "You knew he was employed at Olney's in Watling-street?"—he said, "I did not know he was employed there, but I knew he was employed in the neighbourhood"—previous to this, I had seen the prisoners together in Fountain-court, Lawrence-lane, where money has passed from Fearn to Moore—the parcel contained twenty-four packets, each packet consisting of a dozen reels of cotton.</p>

               <p>was about to take him in custody for stealing a quantity of cotton from his employers the previous night, which he had given to a man named Fearn, in the Three Cranes public-house—he said, "Whoever has told you that I gave Fearn anything in the Three Cranes, has told you a lie"—I said, "I make a mistake about the Three Cranes, it was in Queen-street, "to which he made no reply—I took him to Bow-lane police-station, where the charge was entered—I asked him if he had a box at Mr. Olney's place, having ascertained that he boarded on the premises—he told me he had, and I should find the keys of it in his trousers pocket, hanging over it in his bedroom—I went to the bedroom, and found the keys as he had stated—I opened the box, searched it, and found one dozen sets of charms and half a dozen clasps, and in a purse in the box I found this address, "Mr. E. Fearn, 39, John-street, Urfur-street, New Kent-road"—that is Fearn's address—I returned to the station, showed these things to Moore, and asked him if he was aware they were in his box—he told me he was, and he considered they were his; he found them in the sweepings at the warehouse—I was present at the Mansion House when Moore was charged with this offence—he asked, in my presence, if he could pay for those articles—I believe he asked Mr. Olney to be merciful to him, or something of that sort.</p>

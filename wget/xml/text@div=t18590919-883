"Yes,"—we were going in, and he made a bolt and ran away the third time, as hard as he could—my barman ran after him—while he was running away I saw the dog pick up something—I saw him at the police-station without any coat—he had a coat on when he ran away.</p>

I am barman to the last witness—on Friday, 9th September, the prisoner came to our house and asked for a pint of porter—I served him, and he gave me in payment a half-crown—I looked at it, tried it, found it was a bad one, and took it into the parlour to my master—he came into the bar—the prisoner was then going out, and I said to him, "Where are you going? you have given me a bad half-crown"—he said, "I am going to look for my dog"—he went out, came in again, and said, "Never mind, I will give you a good shilling"—I then took the good shilling and gave him 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he brought the dog back with him when he went out—it was a large blood-hound—I gave the half-crown to the policeman as soon as he was taken—I did not see the prisoner start—I ran after him after he had started—I was about fifteen yards behind him the whole of the distance—at that time he had a coat and a white hat on—as I was following him some one threw me down—when I got up I saw the prisoner running a long way ahead of me without a coat—I have no recollection of having seen the prisoner before at our house.</p>

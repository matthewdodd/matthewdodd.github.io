                  </hi>. I am a bailiff of the Sheriff's Court of the City of London—I received a process against the defendant, Louis Nathan—this is the warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is directed to Moses Coleman and other officers, stating that there was a warrant against Louis Nathan in the White-chapel County Court—for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and whereon he did not attend—it was ordered and required that he should be taken and delivered into custody—I went with Abraham Brown on 19th March for the purpose of executing this warrant—I found Louis Nathan in Meeting-House-yard, Whitechapel—I told him we had a wan-ant to take him; he said he did not owe the money, and he should not go with us—we told him if he would not go quietly we should be obliged to take him by force—he said if we would go to the other defendant he would convince us that he did not owe the money—we took hold of him and he went a short distance; he then said if we would let him go he would go quietly, and then he began to abuse us and to kick; that continued for about ten minutes before the other defendant came up—we did not get out of the yard before Abraham Nathan came up—I felt a blow in the back, and I turned round and saw Abraham Nathan; he pulled me away, and succeeded in rescuing Louis Nathan—Louis Nathan was not in such a position as to be able to strike me that blow—when I turned round Abraham Nathan was behind me and there were other persons—Abraham Nathan was in such a position that he could have inflicted the blow—he pulled me away from Louis Nathan by taking hold of my arm—</p>

               <p>my hat fell on the ground; I stooped to pick it up and I saw Louis Nathan running away—he escaped for a time, but he was taken directly afterwards—Abraham Nathan went away—we procured the assistance of a policeman—while Louis Nathan was kicking us he said, if we did not let him go he would kick us in such a place that we should remember it for life.</p>

I am one of the bailiffs of the Sheriff's Court—I went with the last witness on 19th March to arrest Louis Nathan—we found him standing in Meeting-House-yard, by the side of a barrow—we walked up to him and stated we had a warrant from the Sheriff's Court against him, and Coleman took out the judgment summons and showed it to him—he said he did not owe the money and he would not pay—we said he must go with us; he said he would not—he said he wonld go to the plaintiff—I said, "No, you must go with us"—he said he would not—we waited ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and he would not, and I took hold of one of his arms, and Coleman took the other—we walked about twenty yards, and then he said if we would let him go he would go quietly; we did, and then he kicked me in a violent manner—we seized him again, and there was a struggle—a great many people came up, and his brother Abraham came up, and someone struck Coleman, and he was separated from me, and I was left with Louis Nathan, and Abraham laid hold of my wrist and wrenched it from the collar of his brother's coat, which I was holding and Abraham said to his brother, "Run away," and Louis Nathan ran across the Yard; I followed him, and he got in at the door and slammed it in my face—the policeman came up, and I opened the door and we went in and took him—Abraham Nathan got away altogether—I saw Louis Nathan kick Coleman, and he kicked me—I have two marks on me now—and he battered me on the chest several times.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Chapel-place, Brompton, and am in the employ of the British Museum. On 6th Nov., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come into the saloon—I watched him, and saw something projecting from his pocket behind—he passed from the saloon to the new gallery, and put his hand behind him and looked up at the ceiling, which caused the impression to be more perfect, and I saw the appearance of an inkstand through the cloth of the coat—I spoke to Hayes, a fellow-servant, the prisoner was near enough to hear what I said—I told Hayes to watch him, and not to allow him to put anything away, as I was going for a policeman—as I was going away the prisoner said something about an inkstand, and he said, "Where is Mr. Ling<lb></lb>ard"—we took the prisoner into a side-room, and he told the policeman he had no pockets—this is the inkstand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it was taken from</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the attendants at the British Museum. On 6th Nov. Shelver told me he believed the prisoner had an inkstand in his pocket, and recommended me to see that he did not make away with it while he went for a policeman—it was said loud enough for the prisoner to hear—I went to the prisoner, and saw something projecting from his pocket—he took out this inkstand, and asked me if my name was Lin<lb></lb>gard—I said, "No, where did you get that inkstand?"—he said he found it in some bye-place—it has the mark of the British Museum on it, and Mr. Lingard's name—the prisoner said at the station that he found it in a bye-place, and then that he found it on a stool or seat on the stairs.</p>

I am an attendant in the mineral department at the British Museum—I saw this inkstand on the morning of 6th Nov. in its proper place, on a shelf in the fourth room in the mineral depart<lb></lb>ment—I have to take it down when I use it—Sir Henry Ellis has the care of the property in the British Museum.</p>

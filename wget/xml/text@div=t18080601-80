               <p>Q. On the 25th of May did you see the prisoners in your shop - A. Yes, I recollect when I came down stairs they were there; it was a little after seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What order did you receive from the prisoners - A.Mrs. Taylor was receiving an order for mourning rings, with mottoes round them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with them. - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time they were in the shop, did you observe any thing particular in their conduct - A. I did not; they were only shewn one tray of rings by Mrs. Taylor; they were laying on the counter when I came into the shop; in that tray were the rings and the pins in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them there - A. I do not know that I saw them there that day; I saw them before frequent; they were some of the most valuable rings, therefore we look after them first.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your taking the order the prisoners went away - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information did you follow after them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. They gave you an order to make rings - A. They gave an order; I requested a deposit, as it is always customary with strangers; they ordered two at three guineas each, and one at a guinea and a half, I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did they say what time they should want them - A. They said they should want them on the Saturday following; this was on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after they left your shop had you reason to suspect them - A. When I missed the property, about five or six minutes after they went; I missed the the rings and the pins; the boy had been previously sent after them, he said they came in a chaise. I went up Cornhill, in Mr. Fearn's shop, nearly opposite the Royal exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Fearn - A. A jeweller. Upon goin there I found the two prisoners at the bar, giving a similar order; they were both of them conversing to Mr. Weddal about mourning rings; I shut the door to, I put my foot against it; I told Mr. Weddal I wished to speak to them when he had done with them; the tall one immediately turned round and said he would wish to speak to a lady who was at a coffee house hard by, and if the lady would wait the time he would give them the order.</p>
               <p>COURT. He would give Mr. Fearn the order - A. Yes. I said that I wished to speak a few words with him before he went; he swore at me and struck me a violent blow on my forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you said to him - A. Yes; I kept my right foot against the door, I seized him by the coat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010060"></xptr>which tore all down the left side; I told him I should hold him right or wrong as he struck at me; he struck at me several times; I took hold of his collar and secured him; I requested Mr. Weddal to secure the other, which he did; we took them into Mr. Fearn's parlour, and some rings were shewn me by Mr. Weddal.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the rings produced to you by Mr. Weddal your property - A. I identified two out of the thirteen, which are the subject of the present charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your pin - A. No, the pin was not found at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where Mr. Weddal picked up these rings you do not know - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 25th of May do you recollect the two prisoners coming to Mr. Taylor's shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Look at them and see whether you are sure they are the persons. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. When the prisoners came in you and Mrs. Taylor were only in the shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a tray of rings being shewn them by your mistress - A. I do; when the tray of rings was shewn them, the short one took his handkerchief and wiped his mouth; afterwards he took his glove to wipe his mouth; then soon afterwards he said he had hurt his eye with the finger of his glove; my mistress thinking that he had hurt his eye very much sent me to get a glass of spring water to wash his eye with; I came back with the spring water, and he dipped the corner of his handkerchief in it; I saw him looking over the rings with his hand; I could see underneath that he was hooking them up on his little finger.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the little man that did this was it - A. Yes; then he took his handkerchief and wiped his eye again, and stamped his foot, and said what pain he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the handkerchief could cover the ring if it was on his finger - A. Yes; then the tall one said you had better go into the chaise if your eye is so bad.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was the chaise at the door - A. No, I saw no chaise; the tall one had a riding whip in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a jockey whip. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you saw done by either of them - A. No; my master came down into the shop directly I heard the tall one say you had better go into the chaise; I went round the counter unbeknown to them and let down the lock and bolted it; then as my master was standing in the shop, I touched him on the hand, and asked him to come into the parlour, and then I told him what I had seen softly by ourselves; my master went round the other side of the counter, and took the order of them; the tall one gave a brass ring for the size of his finger, and a piece of hair to put into the mourning ring. I stood at the door till my master wished them good evening. I then opened the door and let them out; my mistress sent me after them to see what sort of a chaise they had come in; I went to look and they went down Lime street; I came back and told my mistress which way they went, and when I came back my master was gone after them.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure these are the men - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>EDWARD WEDDLE. Q. You live with Mr. Fearn, who is a jeweller - A. Yes; I am his shopman.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 25th of May last, do you remember the two prisoners coming into Mr. Fearn's shop - A. I do well, it was somewhere between seven and eight o'clock; their object was to buy pearl and mourning rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to buy or to order - A.They wanted to buy at first when they came in, and before they went away they wanted to order.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Taylor coming in - A. I do, he came in towards the latter part of their being there.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the account that Mr. Taylor gave - do you recollect what passed - A. I do; when Mr. Taylor came in he spoke to me over the counter; he said I believe you know me, sir; I told him yes; upon that I saw him shut the door rather in a hurry, and set his foot against it; he appeared rather agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners see him - A. Yes, I believe they did; after that I drew my rings back, and the two particular rings, that I had been shewing them, I did not see at the moment at the place; I looked again at the place and I saw them; after that I saw one of them strike Mr. Taylor; Mr. Taylor said he wished to speak to them after they had done with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it struck Mr. Taylor - A. The tallest one,

            , I think with the whip in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say nothing more than that he desired to speak with them when they had done with you - A. Nothing else; upon that a scuffle ensued, and I saw him strike Mr. Taylor several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing that past in your presence that would create a quarrel - A. Nothing but civility upon the part of Mr. Taylor; upon that the door opened, I do not know upon what reason, and they both went out in the street, Mr. Taylor and Charles Brown; I was sure all was not right, I secured the short one; the tall one was brought back, and pushed with his back against the counter, and after we had taken them from the counter and put them in the parlour, I found thirteen rings upon the counter in a purse, lying close by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of the things the property of yourself and master - A. They were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body by at the time to put these rings on the counter besides the prisoners - A. I saw nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person have left these rings on the counter before they came in without your seeing them - A. I am quite sure they could not; I went round that very counter a few minutes before; these are the two rings which Mr. Taylor has claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept them ever since that Wednesday evening - A. I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that these two rings were kept in the tray that you shewed to the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them in the tray - A. I cannot exactly say. I generally saw them there every day when I am serving in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that you saw them on the day that you shewed them to the prisoner - A. No, I cannot, they were kept in the tray in a very regular manner; I arranged the rings before I left the shop; I said I missed two rings of the quality of these rings; one of them is marked the other is not; it is marked with a private mark, what we give and what we sell for; it is marked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010061"></xptr>inside on the gold; it is never erased, it goes out to the purchasers with it.</p>

               <p>Q.What is the value of them - A. Ten pounds; they are worth more, and cost me more than twelve pounds.</p>

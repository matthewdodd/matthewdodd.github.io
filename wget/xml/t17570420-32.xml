               <p>Samuel Hill. On the night between the twentieth and twenty first of last January I lost a black gelding, which was taken from <placeName id="t17570420-32-crimeloc161">Hummerton, in Hackney parish</placeName>

I examined the toll book at Smithfield, and found that such a horse by the description was sold to Mr. Harvey, of Gloucestershire, who happened to be in town I inquired and found him, and he shew'd me the horse, which proved to be the same I had lost. On paying the money he gave for him [he being sold] he deliver'd the horse up to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live upon the spot where the horse was lost from?</p>

               <p>Hill. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise that night?</p>

               <p>Hill. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>

               <p>Hill. Yes, he lived within a quarter of a mile of me.</p>

               <p>Q. When was the horse deliver'd to you?</p>

               <p>Hill. On Tuesday, February 1.</p>

I saw Tate and the prisoner talk together, they went into an alehouse, when they came out again the horse was delivered to Tate, who put the last witness upon him to ride him about, in order to sell him again I heard him say in the evening he had sold his bargain again, and get a trifle by him.</p>

               <p>Martin. No, I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you liv'd there?</p>

               <p>Martin. Almost half a year.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Mr. Carter ?</p>

               <p>Martin. He is a mill-washer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in his house?</p>

               <p>Martin. He did, but I can't be positive that he liv'd there when the horse was stole.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he go from Mr. Carter's ?</p>

               <p>Martin. I don't know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Carter turn him away ?</p>

               <p>Martin. I don't know that.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did he go away?</p>

               <p>Martin. I can't tell.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it before or after the horse was reported to be stolen?</p>

               <p>Martin. Not above three or four days; he was at our house when Mr. Hill had taken up Mr. Tate.</p>

               <p>Q. Had not he been away?</p>

               <p>Martin. There was a young woman he used to go to see sometimes on nights.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go away before or after the horse was stolen?</p>

               <p>Martin. It was after the horse was stolen; he was servant to my master at the time the horse was stolen, but I believe he had been out a night or two before, because he had lodgings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he lie at your master's the night between the 20th and 21st of January?</p>

               <p>Martin. I don't know that.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had this surcingle and saddle used to be kept?</p>

               <p>Martin. In our mills.</p>

               <p>Q. Could any body come at them?</p>

               <p>Martin. They might</p>

               <p>Q. Were they lock'd up in the night time?</p>

               <p>Martin. They were.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>

               <p>Martin. We miss'd them the Saturday before he was missing; after that we heard he was on shipboard.</p>

               <p>Q. to W. Reynolds. Are this surcingle and saddle cloth the same your master bought of the prisoner when he bought the horse?</p>

               <p>Reynolds. They are the same.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>

               <p>I bought this horse at Tottenham for fifty-five shillings, I ask'd my master leave to go out that day. I came as far as Hackney back again, and there I had this surcingle and saddle cloth, which I had left there a day or two before. I rode from thence to Smithfield, and sold him to this man the same day; please to ask my mistress whether she knows that I was not at home that night.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What time did you miss the horse?</p>

            . The prisoner liv'd servant with me two years, he was a very good servant, and always took a great deal of care; I never heard any thing against his character, or that he lay a night out of the house while he was our servant; that night the prosecutor lost his horse I am very certain he was at home.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>

               <p>J. Carter. It was on a Thursday night in last January.</p>

               <p>Q. By what do you know he lay in your house that night ?</p>

               <p>J. Carter. Because I and a servant sat up that night with a child that was sick, I was awake all night and should have heard if any body went out.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was he at home in the evening ?</p>

               <p>J. Carter. He was at home before dark, I saw him betwixt eight and nine o'clock in the kitchen, we never sit up late; I saw him and Martin, another of my servants, go up stairs that night, they call'd in as they went by, to know how the child did, and I saw him the next morning between eight and nine at breakfast. I suppose he had been at his business in the mill before he came to breakfast, he was up before I came down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear him go down stairs?</p>

               <p>J. Carter. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. How can you pretend to give an account of his being in your house all night, if you did not hear him come down in the morning?</p>

               <p>J. Carter. I suppose he got up when his master called him. I can't swear to these things.</p>

On the 21st of August, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I heard an alarm that the prisoner had stole some bed-furniture out of the drying-ground. I went into the fields. I saw the prisoner running across the fields, with a bundle under his arm. He got out of the fields into a lane. He was not half a minute out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man. - A. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the bundle. - A. He threw it over that field, and then he ran back again into the field that he came out of, and ran about half a mile before I took him: then I gave him in charge of another man. I went over the field and picked up the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your drying-ground join the road. - A. No, it is at the back of the house; there is a thoroughfare in the field adjoining it.</p>

            . - I am a carpenter. I was at work by the side of Captain Dobree's field. I perceived them both running as fast as they could; the witness cried out stop thief, I joined in the pursuit; he then did not run above an hundred and fifty yards before we took him by the collar; he said do not collar me, I will go without. As we were coming home, the last witness asked the prisoner where the wet linen was; he said, I am not the man. We went out of the field into the road, till we came to Pound Lane, we went about an hundred yards down; the witness said, I think it is somewhere here where you throwed the linen; he answered, upon my word I am not telling you a word of a story, I saw a man throw the linen over between two trees. The witness left him in my care, and he found the linen exactly where he described it to be.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Heathcote. I looked through a window into the drying-ground. I found the furniture gone. I had seen it about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160054"></xptr>half an hour before I assisted in hanging the furniture up. I ran to the gardener for him to pursue after the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man. - A. I never saw the man.</p>

I had been down to Layton; coming up the lane I saw a person running down pretty sharp; the gentleman overtook me; he told me to stop, I stopped immediately; he said, what is become of the bundle you had under your arm, I said I met a person running, he throwed it under the hedge.</p>

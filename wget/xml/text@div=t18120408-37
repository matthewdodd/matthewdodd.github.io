On the 17th of January I went to a banking-house in the city to change a check and the bankers gave me a fifty pound note, which I marked with the banker's name upon the back; after that I took it home, my father being then ill I was to give all the money I got to my second eldest sister; I gave her this fifty pound note on that day. On the 25th of January the same year, the day after my father died, my sister and myself went to look up the money to give to our executors.</p>

In a day or two after that she called upon me, she said, take and change this note, and take what few pounds you want. I looked at the note, and said, what do you call this; she said, it is a fifty pound; I said, have you nothing else but this to let me have, it is not worth while to change this for so small a sum; she said, take that note, and call and give me the change when you have changed the note. I took the note to my master, Mr. Branston in Cheapside, I asked him to change me a fifty pound note; he said, he could not, but if I went to the Bank I could get done; I went to the Bank, I set my name to the note, and the place where I lived. When I presented the note for change they told me the note was stopped.</p>

Consols, in my own name, Elizabeth Smith; Mr. Pickering, of Swallow-street, was the broker - I lived with General Taunton, in Ireland, five or six weeks, and then went to live with Lord Farnham, who was then Colonel Barry; I was two years with him, and then married - I quitted his Lordship's service, and settled in Ireland; I have not been in England since, till I came over for this prosecution - Colonel Barry advanced my husband 10l. on my shewing the stock receipt, and some money was advanced to me on the dividends; I never had a niece named Jane Smith - I never knew such a person; I have one brother, named William - he lived in Lincolnshire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. Is your brother married? A. He married before I left England; his wife's name was Mary - I am certain of that, for I knew her from a child; I frequently had letters from her - my brother has two children, a boy named William, and a girl Elizabeth, for I stood godmother to her at the time I was at Lord St. Asaph's - I have never seen the child since, and do not know whether it is dead or alive; my brother has written to me - I never corresponded with my niece; I know nothing of the prisoner - I gave my stock receipts to Lord Farnham fourteen years ago, when he advanced the money on it.</p>

             - the prisoner was the surety. I at that time lived at Hendon, and advertised for a cottage - I saw a gentleman, who found out what profession I was in - he said he would come to Townsend's to take out letters of administration; and these people came for letters of administration to one Elizabeth Smith, deceased - Jane Smith came with the prisoner and this gentleman, calling himself Mr. March;

             represented herself to be the niece of Elizabeth Smith, deceased, and produced these documents to me (looking at them) - the prisoner represented herself as a friend to the administratrix, and surety for her; she said her name was Patfull, and she lived in Tottenham-court road - I drew this petition for her (looking at it,) from instructions which I received from the administratrix - they were altogether at the office in Doctors'-commons when the instructions were given; I drew this petition according to the instructions they gave, and from the documents which were annexed - they were altogether at the production of the documents, and giving the instructions; letters of administration were obtained, and sent to Mr. Townsend's broker to be registered, and the broker gave them to Jane Smith - I attended with them, I think, to enter into the bond; I know Mr. Townsend went, and I think I also attended - I think I attended with the administratrix at the Bank three days after, when the stock was sold out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The administratrix was accompanied by the prisoner? A. Yes, and by a person named Rorke - the prisoner herself said she knew the party very well, and gave a draft on her agent for 3l. for the current expences; I think that was not on the first application - they applied several times; we required money to be paid down before we proceeded, as we did not know the party, and the property being an unclaimed dividend, we did not know whether they would receive it; we required the money before we proceeded, and the prisoner gave the order.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not when the documents were ready, and you refused to give them up without being paid? A. No; it was on the first or second application - the administratrix was not surprised at my requiring the money- I said the business could not be transacted without the money, and the prisoner gave Mr. Townsend the order for 3l., on account of the current expenses; the order was on a navy agent, in Craig's-court - I had not produced our bill before she gave the order, and never saw her, except on these three or four occasions, but am positive she is the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. By what name did the prisoner appear? A. Warburton Patfull - she produced a document proving she was possessed of 50l. a year; the cheque at Craig's-court was not paid.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. How long was it from the commencement of these proceedings to the end? A. I think the order was at three months after date: I sent to ascertain if it would be paid, but think that was after the business was done, because she said her dividends became due at a certain period.</p>

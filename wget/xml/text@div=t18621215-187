On Saturday afternoon, 22d November, I was in St. George's-road, near the Elephant and Castle—I was about thirty yards from the prisoner, whom I knew, and saw him looking at me, and then at a turning, as if to know whether he would go down it or not—I stopped him, and said, "Hallo! what is your game now here?"—he turned round and said, "It is very fine"—I said, "Yes, it is; have you any</p>

On Saturday afternoon, 22d November, I saw the prisoner talking to Ham—I was in uniform, and was twenty yards off—I saw the prisoner take something from his right-hand trousers' pocket like a brown-paper parcel, and throw it over the house—Ham took hold of his collar, and not knowing him to be a constable, I went over, but he said, "I am a constable; he has thrown some bad money over that house"—I took the prisoner to the station, and found on him a crown-piece and one shilling, both good.</p>

I had only had it three or four minutes. I did not know he was a constable, and I told him to come to the station and see. I certainly threw it over the house. I asked the policeman if he knew the man he had seen me with. He said, "No." He says now that he knows the house where he lived. He admitted to me that he had never seen me before, but took me for another man. The man has now gone away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Percy-street. On 17th and 18th Oct. I was in the prisoner's service at Burnham-place, Bagnigge-wells-road—on 17th or 18th Oct., on my return from dinner, I found the prisoner and his wife in the shop—his wife was crying—I think the prisoner was behind the counter—his wife was standing by the door leading from the shop to the parlour—the prisoner was not far from her: he could hear what she said—she said, "He has been beating me with a shovel," and she asked me to look at her head, as there were some pieces of comb in it—I looked at her head, and saw one piece sticking in her head—I told her so, and she said, "Don't touch it; I will go to Mr. Phillips, the surgeon, to have it taken out"—she was sitting on the sofa in the parlour when I was looking at her head—the prisoner and his wife were not on good terms all the time I was living with them—I remember one quarrel more violent than another about a fornight before that; it was at night—he was beating her in the parlour, I think with the hand-broom—when he was beating her she called out for me—she said, "Henry!"—the prisoner said, "I will <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> you!"—I remember his wife being out one night with the horse and cart; that was three or four weeks before this—she</p>

               <p>came home about 10 o'clock—she got out of the cart at the door, and told me to go and take it to the stable—I took it, and she walked towards the stable—when I got to the corner of Great Percy-street she came and got in the cart, and told me to drive away—I drove up Acton-street, and the prisoner overtook her in Acton-street and got up in the cart, and he was beating her with his fist all the way from there to the stable, which was about 100 yards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon, and live in Sackville-street, Piccadilly. I saw the deceased at her own house on 22nd Oct., and she was at my house on the 20th, and my assistant had seen her—I attended her on the 22nd for an injury on the hand, from which she had erysipelas of the hand and arm—there was a black mark on the outside of the hand, which was very much swollen all round, and inflammation proceeded up the arm—on the hand there was an indentation, about the size of a half-crown: it was a bruise—she told me how it was caused—I continued to attend her from 22nd Oct. till the time of her death—the cause of her death was erysipelas, the primary cause of which was the wound on the back of the hand—I bad attended her for twelve months, and I never saw her tipsy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The death, according to your judgment, was from erysipelas, which, you gather, had been occasioned by the inflammation that you found on the hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—supposing a woman to get her hand jammed between the door-cill and the panel, I do not think it would occa<lb></lb>sion such a mark as she had, because the wound was a round one—that round black mark must have been occasioned by some flat round substance, such as the top of a poker or the bottom part of a shovel—I have seen a flat top to a poker—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the internal parts of her body were not in a state of high inflammation: there was chronic inflam<lb></lb>mation—I should expect to find that in a woman given to intemperance, and a violent passionate woman—I have seen such appearances in persons of intemperate habits—intemperance would cause great debility.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was her constitution in a bad condition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was in such a condition as to be more liable than usual to erysipelas—when I saw her on the 22nd leeches had been applied to her hand, by direction of my assistant, the night before—erysipelas of these skin, in a debilitated constitution, may proceed from the use of leeches—this was erysipelas of the cellular mem<lb></lb>brane</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in George-street, Bagnage-wells-road. I was called to attend the deceased on Saturday, 25th Oct.—I was with her from that time to her death—the prisoner came into the room on the 25th—pretty well the whole of the night he sat on the bed by her, occasionally sleeping between whiles—I did not hear him say anything—I saw him twice lean over her, and she whispered to him; but, besides that, she said, loud enough for me to hear, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> you have done it; you promised to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for me, and you have done it"—he did not answer her—his behaviour that night was affected; it was in a cold way.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was his conduct to her that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He acted strangely altogether; he leaned over her twice, affectionately rather than otherwise, but he took long sleeps after that—she spoke to him, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom, Tom</hi>!" and he did not <hi rend="italic">care</hi> to answer her—towards morning her head became affected—these fits of delirium did not last long—I could not exactly say when I first noticed them—I had no watch—when she made the obser<lb></lb>vation that I have just stated she was as right as I am at this moment—the said many times, "You will not escape, <hi rend="italic">Tom.</hi> "</p>

Last night, between six and seven o'clock, I had seen the prisoner lurking about, and a friend observed him take this bacon; I followed him, and asked what he was going to do with it - he said it was not mine; I took it from him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CAVE. I was in Mr. Watson's shop, and saw the prisoner in the adjoining passage; I saw him put his arm round into the prosecutor's shop, but I did not see him take the bacon - I saw him for about ten minutes, while I was washing myself: when I got out he was in custody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PORTEOUS. I was on duty, and a man told me I was wanted - I went, and the prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner, for taking this bacon; he made a violent resistance, and offered 2s. a lb. for the bacon.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LEES. This is my bacon - it fell from my hand when I took it from under the prisoner's coat; it could not have been reached without a person stepped into my shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take it from the shop, and he did not take it from me - he at first said he found it in the street.</p>

            . I am a waterman and lighterman. On the 1st of this month, I heard a cry of stop thief! and saw the prisoner running. He got up under the pillars in Wellclose square. I followed him up there, and the people run by him and me. I told him he had stolen the hat which I saw in his hand. He made use of shocking had language, and I collared him; we struggled together, and he made use of horrid imprecations, what he would do to me, if I did not let him go. He swore he would cut my b - y guts out; and I don't know what he would not do. He struck at me, and I hit him very hard in the eye, and knocked him down. I then got on him, and kept him down. Nobody would come to help me, though there were plenty standing about, because he was such a desperate villian. A young man I knew came up to me, and said Lillie, let him go, he is an, out, and outer. I had not lived so long near Tower Hill, without knowing pretty well what that means. It means, one of the very worst description of thieves. I then let him up, for I was frightened. When I got up myself, I found my seal was gone, and a double breasted waistcoat which I had on, cut through and through. He then took off his coat, and put himself in an attitude for boxing; and said, come on you b - y b - r. He squared backwards, until he came to the corner, and then he right about face, and was off in an instant.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 27th of June, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner going down Parliament-street with a soldier, who was having words with her; she had some thing in her hand - the soldier said, "You have something there, I will give you in charge;" I walked over, and saw her put her hand to her bosom - she turned a corner, and began to run; I followed her, and put my hand on her shoulder - she then took this watch from her bosom, and threw it away; I asked what it was - she said she had no watch; I took it up.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to a public-house with him; he was intoxicated - he went to a room with me, and gave me the watch to keep till Monday; we then came out, and he said I had robbed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brother of the last witness. On 28th July, the prisoner came into my brother's house; he asked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin and water, and tendered me a counterfeit shilling; I put it between my teeth, and told him it was bad; he threw it into a water jug, and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence—he remained in the house, and had some more gin, and gave me another counterfeit shilling—I served that in the same way, and gave it him back, and he gave me a good sixpence—he then took another shilling from his pocket, bit it in four pieces, and threw them on the ground—he appeared tipsy—he left the house after that—I took the shilling out of the water, and put it on the shelf—I did not see the shilling that my brother had taken till after that—the second shilling that I gave back to the prisoner, he threw on the counter, and I put that and the other one both on the shelf—I know my own bite—this is the shilling that was thrown in the water—this is the second shilling he gave me—these are the pieces of the shilling which a little girl took off the floor.</p>

Q.</hi> How long was the second gin he had, after the first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be a quarter of an hour; he then tendered me a second shilling, and I told him it was bad—he did not take several pieces of money out of his pocket—he muttered something to himself when he took the last shilling out, and he broke it, and threw it on the floor—he was allowed to go away—he paid me for all the gin—it was on Friday he gave me these, and on Saturday week I was summoned to attend before the Magistrate—I had seen the prisoner once or twice in the house before—he sells china and earthen ware—the Broadway is not many minutes' walk from our house.</p>

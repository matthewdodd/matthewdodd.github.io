On the night of Thursday, the 7th of May, I was on duty at Camden-hill, Kensington, at half-past eight o'clock—I saw the two prisoners walking along, and Varney had an empty sack under his arm—they were together, and were going in the direction of the Duchess of Bedford's garden—I went a short distance and returned back—I then saw Varney coming over a fence with a sack with something in it, which turned out to be sand—Beazeley was standing in the lane outside the field—he was doing nothing—he was three or four yards from Varney when I saw him coming out of the field, and in such a situation that he could see what was going on in the field—I said, "Varney, what have you got there?"—he said, "Sand"—I said, "Whose sand is it?"—Beazeley</p>

On Thursday, the 7th of May, there was some sand in a little corner of that field, and some loam—it belonged to the Duchess—I saw it safe at half-past five o'clock that evening—the officer produced some sand, which was a part of that heap—it corresponded exactly with it—I be-lieve it to be part of the same heap—I found in the morning that the heap had been disturbed, and about a bushel of it was gone—it is worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

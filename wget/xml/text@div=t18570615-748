                  </hi>. I am a livery stable keeper at Elpha Row, Brixton. On Monday, 8th June, at 11 o'clock, the prisoner rode into my yard on the pony, and said that he wanted to sell it—I asked him where he brought it from—he said that he had won it in a raffle at Westminster—that he was a painter, and rode it up to the Crystal Palace to seek for employment, and not getting any wanted to sell it, as he had got no money and wanted to get something to eat and drink—I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, and he left it in my care till the Tuesday evening, when he said that he would come for it and bring a proper direction where it came from, if I liked to buy it—I showed it to Mr. Gillett on the next day, and afterwards saw the prisoner in custody at Woolwich—he gave his name George Smith.</p>

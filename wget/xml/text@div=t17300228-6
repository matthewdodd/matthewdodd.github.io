               <p>The Prosecutor depos'd, He had lost Timber out of his Yard from time to time, and that he had taken a piece of Fir-Timber that was his, out of the Prisoner's Fire, which he swore to be his Timber. He call'd an Evidence, who depos'd, That he being a Lodger in the Prisoner's House, and looking out at the Window, did see the Prisoner one Sunday Morning, take Timber out of the Prosecutor's Yard, put it into her Apron, and carry it into her House. He also call'd some of his Journeymen, who depos'd, That they miss'd several Pieces of Timber that they had cut out for Roossing, they being Carpenters.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and pleaded in her Defence, That she had a great deal of Timber of her own, her Husband (since deceas'd) having bought Partitions, and other wooden Stuff belonging to another House: she also alledg'd, that the Prosecution was Malicious, because she being Tenant to the Prosecutor, after her Husband's Decease, was removing her Goods to go away; upon which the Prosecutor made a Seizure before any Rent was due, for which Cause she having arrested him, he set on Foot this Prosecution, to prove which she call'd several Evidences.</p>

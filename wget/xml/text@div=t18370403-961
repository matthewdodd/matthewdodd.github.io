                  </hi>. I live in Crown-street, Soho, and am in the em<lb></lb>ploy of Mr. Charles Deacon. On the 6th of March, he had a sale at a private house in Manchester-square, and I was one of the men in charge of the things—in consequence of information, about half-past two o'clock, I went out to the corner of South-street, and saw the prisoner walking very fast—I overtook him, and touched him on the shoulder twice, and told him he was wanted back at the house he had just come out of—he went back with me readily—I asked him if he was particularly cold, and wanted a blanket to wrap himself up—he began to ask forgiveness—I asked him to unbutton his coat, and I found the blanket tied round his body with a piece of string—he said he could make it all right if he could see Mr. Deacon—I asked him where he got the blanket from—he said out of the second-floor back room.</p>

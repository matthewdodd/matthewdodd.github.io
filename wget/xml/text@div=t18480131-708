                  </hi>. I am a farmer, in partnership with my brother, and live at West Ham. On Thursday evening, 27th Jan., I went into my chaff-house, between six and and seven o'clock—my brother called my attention to it—I found the lock on the chaff-house door, but not locked, which it ought to have been—it was in Newman's charge, he was the chaff-cutter—I opened the door, and found a bag of beans hid under the clover—it ought not to have been there—he ought to have mixed the beans up with the chaff he had cut that day, and given it to the carters for the horses' food—I mixed some wheat with it, cut up some green willow rods, and put them with the beans, to identify them—I left the sack where I had found it, and shut the door—Hewett was in my employ—it was his business to drive my horses to</p>

               <p>town—he had no business in the chaff-house—I gave information to the police, and the next morning, a little after four o'clock, I went to a stable at the King's Arms—I saw some beans—they were not in a sack then, but shot into a bin—I am certain they were mine, because I found in them the wheat and the cut sticks that I had put in them, and I found the sack that they were in—Pye was ostler there—he was asked by the policeman how he came by the beans—he said he had brought them of a man from Kent, but he did not know who he was—I am quite positive they were my bean, and what had been in the that morning.</p>

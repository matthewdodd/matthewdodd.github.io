I saw the prisoner go near these bags; he was gone near ten minutes. I saw Nightingale go down to the place where they were; I did not see him take the bags. I knew they were there when he went down that place. Immediately he was gone, I went down, and saw they were gone. I informed the commodore of it. In consequence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060029"></xptr>of that, the prisoner was searched, and the bags were found upon him.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARE. I am an officer, and a labourer in the spice warehouse, where the nutmegs were. The prisoner was also a labourer. I searched the prisoner. I found forty-four nutmegs in his coat pocket, and two pounds of nutmegs in his breeches pocket; he pulled them out of his breeches and delivered them into my hands. I found two bags of nutmegs upon him. He said, he was sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. I was there when his lodgings were searched. We found six pounds of nutmegs there; they are worth ten shillings a pound, exclusive of the duty.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

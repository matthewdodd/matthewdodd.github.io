                  </hi>. I am a foreigner—I deal in watches, and live in Duke-street, Aldgate—on the 6th of June, about twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner, in company with another woman*, named Tucker, at the cor<lb></lb>ner of Houndsditch—I went home with them—I do not know to what street—it is near Petticoat-lane—I went up stairs, in to a bed room with the prisoner—Tucker remained below—the prisoner asked me to give her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for the room—I had a ring on my finger—she said, "You have a very handsome ring on your finger"—she took it off" and went down stairs—I expected she would return, but she did not.</p>

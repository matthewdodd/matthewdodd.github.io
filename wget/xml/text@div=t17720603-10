            . I am a carver and gilder, and live at No. 52, in the Strand; Adams came to me as an under clerk the 8th of November, 1771. Mr. Burtoff gave him a character; he was with me till the 18th of January; he is a sober, honest young fellow; he was entrusted to receive and pay money for me; I always found him honest, sober and industrious, while he lived with me.</p>

               <p>Fenton. I sent him about some business, not returning so soon as he might have done, we had a few words, and I turned him away directly.</p>

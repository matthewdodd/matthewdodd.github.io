            . I enquired for the long room. She said, she would shew me the long room. From there she took me into another house; then she told me to sit down by the fire; then these two men came down and dragged me about; the little man took the watch from me, and the big man said, if I was not quiet he would take a blanket and choak me. The big man told me to go to bed; I undressed myself and went to bed. I was frightened for fear they should kill me. I sprang out of bed and sang out murder; the big man pulled me by my shirt, and said, if I would not be quiet I should not see any more daylight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman lodge in the house - A. I do not know; it was the house the woman took me to. The little man took the watch from me and ran away with it; the big man held me all the while; he told me to be quiet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. What countryman are you - A. A Prussian. I came from Memmel.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this - A. When I went on shore it was ten o'clock. I first saw the girl in a public-house; I staid there about five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been drinking before you went to this public-house - A. I had been in a public-house on the other side of the river. I drank two glasses of grog. I was neither drunk or sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any money about you - A. Yes, twenty-five shillings. I lost two three-shilling pieces. I do not know where I lost them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to after you left the public-house - A. She took me to a house; I don't know the street. She took me up stairs into a room in another house; I was there a little while; the big man made me go to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you done any thing to the girl - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Who broke the panes of glass - A. I did. When I jumped out he took my watch and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not take your money - A. That I cannot say, I was so frightened.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken were not you beating and striking that woman - A. No. When I called the watchman I charged the little man with taking my watch. I never saw either of these men before in my life; they came directly in the house after me; and the moment they got into the house they got hold of me; the little man took my watch and ran away out of the house. The big man told me if I did not do what he pleased I never should see any more daylight.</p>

            . On Monday, the 23d of November, I saw the prosecutor before he was robbed. I saw him about a quarter before five; he had his watch with him. At the Globe stairs he took out his watch.

            . I am inspector of the watch at the parish of Shadwell. I was going through the parish between twelve and one o'clock. I was speaking to one of our men, who is here present, and while I was speaking to him we heard a noise in the street. We went towards the noise. We observed two or three women standing in the street; we asked them who had made that noise; they said there had been a cry of murder, and the window was broken to pieces. We went in and went up stairs; on the first floor were Flitchberg, and the woman prisoner, and Ellis; the man that had lost his watch was crying; he said, that he had been very ill used, and the man that had beat him and robbed him of his watch was gone away; it was not Ellis, he said. I observed his head swelled; he had received a blow on the right side of his face. I asked Ellis had he struck Fitchberg; he said he had. Fitchberg said it was the man who had got his watch that had struck him. I asked him how the window got broken; he said, he broke the window in endeavouring to save his life. We took Ellis, the girl, and the prosecutor to the watchhouse. We locked the two men in the watch-house, and took the girl back to the house. Not being satisfied but that the watch might be safe somewhere we searched the room all over; we could not find it. We went into the adjoining room, that was open; in that room Lloyd was in bed with another girl. I asked Lloyd how long he had been there; he said he came in about ten o'clock. I told him to get up that we might search the bed; we searched the bed and all about; we found nothing. We took him to the watch-house. Fitchberg, when he saw Lloyd, said he was the man that had robbed him and beat him. Ellis said he was the man that beat Fitchberg, he had been beating the girl and threatened to cut her throat with a case knife; he shewed me the knife; he said, that was the reason he beat him. The girl had no appearance of having been beat; she complained of having been beat.</p>
               <p>- BERRY. I am a patrol of Shadwell. On this night I was patroling Spring-street, about half-past twelve at night. I was in company with Saunders. I heard a noise in the street; we approached towards it. I went up stairs; I saw Ellis and Lindsey, with the prosecutor, in the room. I asked him how the windows came broken; he said, he tried to escape out of the window; Ellis would not let him; he pulled him back. We took them to the watchhouse. Ellis said he was the man that struck him; the prosecutor denied it, said it was a little man that struck him and took his watch. We detained the prosecutor and Ellis, and went back to the room to search it, and in the adjoining room there was a bed with Lloyd and a girl in it. At the watch-house Fitchberg said, Lloyd was the man that had taken his watch. Lloyd denied it.</p>
               <p>Ellis said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

            's Defence. I first came in company with the prosecutor at the Coach and Horses, in Old Gravel-lane. He asked me to shew him the long room; he said he had given an old woman six shillings to shew him the long room, and she had run away. He wanted to lock me in the room; I would not be locked in, and he struck me several times. I called for assistance. Ellis came in and struck him; then he ran to the window. I called out watch first. Ellis would not let him jump out of the window. His watch I never saw.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner and the deceased in the yard of the Cricket house last Tuesday three weeks. The prisoner came into the yard - the deceased was standing there; the prisoner went up and said,</p>
               <p>"What is this you have been saying about me?" The deceased said,</p>
               <p>"What I have said I don't deny - you have robbed me of a sovereign." The prisoner replied,</p>
               <p>"Oh! you rascal!" and struck him right in the face. I endeavoured to get between them; the deceased said," It is no matter, Peter - I don't want to quarrel with you, but you have robbed me of a sovereign. He struck him again - the deceased said,</p>
               <p>"You did rob me, and I think myself as good a man as you." They both struck; we pacified them, and he was putting his clothes on again. The deceased said he did rob him, and they fought again; the yard was slippery with the rain, and the deceased fell. He got up and struck at the prisoner, who fell against the wall; the prisoner caught him by the breast, and threw him against the seat; he again said,</p>
               <p>"It is no matter - you robbed me of a sovereign." We prevented them from fighting further. He lived a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The deceased was in a violent passion - A. Very. I cannot say whether he fell from a blow or not.</p>

            . I knew the deceased and the prisoner. After the quarrel, the deceased sent for me and the prisoner. I went in after the prisoner. The deceased said he sent for me on purpose to say, that he owed no malice to the prisoner. I left them together drinking wine. I brought a pint of wine in myself, for the deceased to drink, and saw him drink some.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Ratcliffe-cross. I was ordered by the Coroner to open the body of the deceased. I examined the head, chest, and belly; the liver was unusually enlarged, it extended down to the right hip - and over to the left side, and ran up into the chest very high; the chest had bloody serum mixed with matter; the head and brain were perfectly natural. I think he could not die by the accident; his death might be accelerated by it - a blow on the head could not affect the liver. I think he would have died without the fight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had not seen him before death - A. No; all the symptoms might have existed without any violence whatever; they were most probably produced by previous disease. I think it might be accelerated by the exertion of fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. But suppose he drank the greatest part of a bottle of wine, might that have accelerated his death - A. Certainly. The liver was full of blood - his death would have taken place very soon, without any battle.</p>

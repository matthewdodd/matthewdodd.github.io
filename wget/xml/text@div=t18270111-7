            . I am a Bow-street officer. On Thursday morning, the 21st of December, I was on duty, and saw the prisoner in a lane leading from Bromley to Stepney, about half-past eight o'clock; he was coming in a direction from the prosecutor's, and walking very slow, with a basket and a copper pump on his shoulder. I asked what he had got - he said it was a pump which he was going to repair; that he was a carpenter, and was going to make a box for it, and that he had brought it from Mr. Miller's, at Bromley - I asked what part of Bromley - he said he could not tell me, but he was a gentleman, and kept two servants and a gardener; that he (the prisoner) lived in a court in Brick-lane, but he could not remember what court, or the number of the house. I found part of a leaden cistern in the basket - as we went to the watch-house, he said he had received it from Mr. Miller's gardener; I asked if he could take me to Miller's; he said he should say no more about it - I delivered the property to Daintry.</p>

            . I received this pump and cistern from Shields. I found on the prisoner a chissel and a knife, which appeared to have been cutting lead - Mr. Appleton's servant delivered me a piece of lead, which matches with the cistern - it appears to have been cut with a knife.</p>
               <p>JOHN APPLETON. This is part of a copper pump and leaden cistern which are mine, and had been put in Mr. Cross's premises - I saw them there about a week before; I consider the engine worth 2l. 10s.; it was in a tolerable state, except part being broken - there is a particular mark on them both, by which I knew them; the cistern was complete, and had been separated from the pump on the premises that night.</p>

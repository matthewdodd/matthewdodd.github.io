             sworn. I live in No. 22, Dorset-street, I live in the lower room. On the 30th of September I saw the prisoner on the landing place (of this house) of the first floor; when she came down stairs she asked for one Mrs. Aplebee, a velveteen weaver; I have lived in the house ten months, there was no such person lodged in the house all the time I have been there; I saw her go out with her apron in her arm; immediately missing the pot from the landing place of the first floor, I ran after her into the lane, where I caught her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of her from the time that she left the door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that she is the same woman. - A. I will not nt be positive, I asked the prisoner what she had in her lap, she told me a quart pot, she said her master had sent her for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure her. - A. Yes, and afterwards I left her when I saw the constable had got her; she had the quart pot in her apron, in a bag belonging to herself.</p>
               <p>LAZURAS JACOBS sworn. I am a constable, I took charge of this woman. On the 30th of September I was coming by, there was a mob of people round her, I instantly went up; the quart pot was in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the last witness. - A. Yes, she said that she had got a quart pot from her stairs, I asked the prisoner how she came by it, she said she had it given her; she appeared to be very much in liquor; I produce the pot.</p>
               <p>(The pot identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

             sworn. I work at the slop work, I have known the prisoner above twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. How has she supported herself. - A. By her needle; she is at times very deranged in her mind, she lost a daughter fourteen years of age; the night before this happened I took care of her, she was very deranged, I kept her in the room all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she got too much liquor. - A. She was very tipsy indeed; I am positive that she did not know what she was at; that morning I could not keep her in, do all I could; she is apt to be tipsy, she has been in every madhouse about London, she was nine months in St. Luke's.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Seymour-street, Euston-square - I have been a surgeon about five years - I saw the deceased after death,(not before,) on the 8th of March, at No. 23, Exeter-street, Brompton - she died of disease, effusion on the chest, and a concomitant disease - I should say the effusion of water on the chest, and perhaps the combination of water in the head also, was the cause of her death - there was effusion of water on the head, and congestion of the ventricles - these I should say were the causes of death- they produce death - I cannot precisely say the occasion of those symptoms - she had externally two bruises, one on the left eye, and one on the back of the head - I cannot say that they produced the symptoms - the bruises would have accelerated death, supposing the child to be labouring under disease - she had tubercular disease of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you pronounce at all what was the occasion of the state you found her in? A. The effusion of water on the chest or head, or the tubercular disease of the lungs? A. It might be produced by fever, which I understand she laboured under - if she had fever at the time, I should conceive the blows accelerated the fever - the blows inflicted on a child in a healthy state, I should suppose, would not cause death.</p>

            . I am a member of the college of surgeons. I attended the child for about three weeks before she died - she was labouring under fever, occasioned, I suppose, from atmospherical causes, the effect of change of weather - if she was badly fed, it might have increased that, but would not have occasioned it - she was labouring under, fever, and had a pain in the head, which was produced, I understood, from a blow at the back of the head - which was sufficient to account for the pain in the head - it was a violent blow - the effect of the blow subsided before she died - I certainly do not consider that to be an exciting cause of the fever - it appears to me, she was labouring under fever, and died from the effect of the fever, produced from atmospherical causes, I suppose - I do not think that ill usage, or want of food, or violence, had any thing to do with it - she was not under the prisoner's care at the time I attended her, but under the care of a 
               <persName id="t18340410-189-person1178">Mrs. Saunders</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand that, having attended her three weeks before death, you are by no means prepared to say any violence, or blows, or want of food, or care, had occasioned the illness of which she ultimately died? A. I think not - if she had been used well, she must have died of the complaint - the blows on the back of her head or neck might have accelerated death - I cannot say it did - the blows were external and subsided - when she died, she had no symptoms whatever of water in the head, nor any fracture - I examined the body - there was disease in the bowels and intestines, but not the effect of want of food - it was the result of continued fever.</p>

            . I live at Fulham, about a mile from Mr. Holmes'. On the 24th of June, between three and four o'clock, I was going to his house, which is near the church - I observed the two prisoners as I crossed the church-yard; one of them appeared to be lurking near the wall, and the other was among the tomb-stones - I walked round the church-yard, and directed my attention to them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080018"></xptr>- I saw one of them cross from the path among the tombs - I did not see the other; I then walked round the church-yard again, and observed neither of them then - they had nothing in their hands: I saw Mr. Chasemore - he asked me a question about them; after he left me I found the box in the moat which runs along the same walk as I had met the prisoners in, and about forty yards from where I last saw them; it was wrapped in a blue apron, partly uncovered - I went to the top of the walk, and there were some labourers; I saw it taken out of the moat, and taken up to the Bishop's lodge - I saw the prisoners in Barker's custody in about half an hour, and am sure they are the men I saw in the church-yard; I saw Barker bring the box back to Mr. Holmes'.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is not the moat in a public pathway? A. Yes; there is about an acre of water - the prisoners were taken going towards Hammersmith; about half an hour intervened between my seeing them and Chasemore, and in half an hour more I saw them in custody. When I last saw them they were going towards Hammersmith - when I saw them in the church-yard they were going towards Mr. Holmes', which is about twenty yards from the church-yard; there are other houses adjoining - one was among the tombs, and the other by Holmes' wall; the labourers were haymaking at the top of the Bishop's-walk.</p>
               <p>HENRY CHASEMORE. I live at Fulham. I was in the church-yard between three and four o'clock, and saw Sullivan standing there, looking up the lane towards Mr. Holmes' house; (he is the husband of Lady Strong) - Matthews was not in the church-yard at that time; Sullivan was thirty or forty yards from the house, looking down the lane once or twice - I afterwards saw Matthews come in a direction from Holmes' house, with a mahogany box under his arm, in a blue apron; he was going from me, and the hind part of the box was exposed - he went towards Bishop's-walk; Sullivan followed after him, ten or twelve yards behind - I saw nothing pass between them; Matthews' face was not towards me - I should be very sorry to swear positively to him; I met Mr. Gifford several minutes after, and made a communication to him - I went after the prisoners towards Hammersmith; I went along Bishop's-walk, and saw a box with a blue apron in the moat - I left it there, and went on, but did not see the prisoners till I got near Hammersmith turnpike; I saw the Policeman, and he took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not the Bishop's-walk a very public thoroughfare? A. Yes - Mr. Holmes' door looks towards the church, but there is a wall and a garden between; I did not see Sullivan nearer to the house than thirty or forty yards - I am certain it was him: the path through the church-yard, I believe, leads to Mr. Holmes' house, and also to Bishop's-walk; I did not notice any body else - other people might be passing; I stopped to talk to the hay-makers; they were about thirty yards from the moat in a field, and three or four hundred yards from the box.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners by direction of Chasemore, at Hammersmith turnpike - I found a spike and two keys on Sullivan; I followed them for seven or eight minutes - they were together, going in a direction for Fulham; I first saw them come down the lane from the Bishop's-walk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why, this spike is a tenpenny nail? A. It is a very large one; I saw them about two hundred yards from Bishop's-walk - that was as near four o'clock as I can tell; the toll-gate is about half a mile further - they were about ten minutes in my sight; Chasemore said the one with the box had his back to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Have you the box? A. Yes, the Bishop's garderer delivered it to me in the field, near the walk - this blue apron was with it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>ANDREW GIFFORD. That is the box I saw in the moat; I saw it taken to the Bishop's lodge - I saw it in the gardener's hands, and afterwards in Barker's hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not that a common description of article? A. I cannot say - I was close to the moat, and could see nearly all of it; I am acquainted with Mr. Holmes, and had seen the box there before the robbery - I was about thirty yards from the prisoners in the church-yard, and passed them in Bishop's-walk; if they had had the box in the church-yard I must have seen it, I think - the prosecutor's house is built to represent a cave, with French windows to it; it is a house that people go to look at; I do not know whether any body had been there that day - there was only an old servant in care of it; she is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When did you see them last? A.They passed me in Bishop's-walk, about fifty yards from the church-yard, in company; the box was much nearer the church-yard than that - they had passed the place where it was; I was a few minutes walking round the church-yard - I am certain of their persons.</p>
               <p>Matthews' Defence. I was going to see a friend near Hammersmith.</p>

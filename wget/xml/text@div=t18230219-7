On the 6th of November, about a quarter before six o'clock in the evening, I went into a wine vaults, in <placeName id="t18230219-7-crimeloc45">Elliston-street, Petticoat-lane</placeName>

I saw Martin, the officer there - he fetched the prisoner in; I was there till a quarter to nine o'clock, as Martin said, if I dared to come out, he would take me into custody. I sent for Forrester, but he did not come. I drank nothing, but went into the bar, and had tea with the landlady - I left there about five minutes past nine o'clock; two officers saw me home. When I went into the wine vaults, I had two rings on my finger. The prisoner called me by the most in famous names, and spit upon me eight or nine times; I never spoke to her before that. I had indicted Martin, who she lived with, for a conspiracy - she said,</p>
               <p>"If that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190008"></xptr>won't suit you Madam," and then threw off her shawl and bonnet, and began to beat me; I protected my face with my hands, and she took my ring off, and after breaking my thumb, and knocking out one of my teeth, she went out. I then missed the ring, and took a candle, but could not find it. I felt her pull my ring off; she then returned, and tore my cap and gown off. I went before the Lord Mayor about it, but she was bailed, and Martin went to indict me for it - I went out of the way, to avoid their taking my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Did not you apply for a summons - A. I went for a summons for the man, for teaching her to take my ring, but never mentioned her.</p>

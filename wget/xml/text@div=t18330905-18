               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. By seeing him walk up and down by the Docks - I mentioned this when Pedley was tried; I stated it to Lee, the officer, near twelve months ago; I was taken up for it, and was in custody ten weeks, and came from gaol to give evidence against Pedley - Ellis put the property into the cart himself - I was up in the cart all the time - I was not present when Ellis was examined, some time ago - I heard nothing of it - I was taken up nearly twelve months ago - I might know Ellis before by passing backwards and forwards about the Dock - I am positive of his person.</p>

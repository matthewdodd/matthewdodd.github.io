                  </hi>. I live in Windmill-street, Marylebone. About eight o'clock at night, on the 25th of Feb., I saw the prisoner and two other men watching a linen-draper's shop in Edgware-road—I watched them some little time—I then left them to go to a shop on business of my own—when I came out they were gone from the shop where I first saw them—I saw them deliberately go to the prosecutor's shop, and one who was in company with the prisoner, went up the steps and took a pair of shoes—he backed himself to the prisoner, who was about six steps from him—I saw the prisoner take them from him, and put them under his coat—I went up to him, and said I knew he had got something which did not belong to him—he gave the shoes to me—I took him into the shop, and got a policeman.</p>

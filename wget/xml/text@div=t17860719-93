               <p>Do you know at all whether the man was at home at the time or not? - I believe he was not at home, because he was frequently at the latter end of the week working at his business.</p>
               <p>What is his business? - He is a journeyman taylor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoners counsel. You cannot pretend to say but you might have lost different parcels of it on the Friday, and on the Saturday? - I cannot say, they were things I did not immediately want, therefore I did not look after them.</p>

               <p>I found the things coming home on the stairs, the apron tumbled out, and I put it in my pocket to go down to shew it to Mrs. Balls; my husband was not at home, and she was busy in the shop; my husband did not come home till ten; on the next day my husband and I went out, and on our returning back we found our door had been broke open; I said, I knew nothing of any thing of Mrs. Ball's, but I owned to the property: the stairs being a thoroughfare, I did not know but somebody might have dropped them; for there were people passing.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What was the value of those things that were found? - I value those that were in our presence at two guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Ball. How came you to know the bundle was in the bed? - I went to the bed to search for my sheet and blankets.</p>
               <p>Had you been in the room before? - Yes, I had; it was by order of Justice Abbington; he said, in case it was my own furniture, I had a right to go in and examine whether my blankets and sheets were there.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called one witness who gave them both a good character.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Again it appeared by the Act that the certificate could only be granted by a Judge or Registrar in Bankruptcy, but the certificate in question had been granted by a Deputy Registrar. The maxim, "delegatus non potest delegari," operated here, and therefore the deputy's appointment was void. No proof had been given of the transfer of the proceedings from Grimsby to London, or that the alleged offence had been com<lb></lb>mitted within the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court, He contended therefore that the liquidation not having commenced when the prisoner concealed from his creditors' knowledge the fact of his possession of the notes, he was not responsible for so concealing them.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that the certificate when granted gave the Trustee power as from the time of his nomination by the creditors, and that he having, as</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in reply, contended that the appointment of a Trustee dated from the very moment that the creditors selected him, and that the subsequent granting of a certificate was a mere rati<lb></lb>fication of their choice, and did not necessarily nullify an act committed in the mean time. The Act did not contemplate that in the all-important matter of the decision of the creditors as to whether the debtor should be made a bankrupt or allowed to liquidate, he should be permitted to make any number of false or misleading statements, which he could withdraw was the matter was settled.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">on the same side called attention to the</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th sub-sec, of the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th see. of the Debtors' Act, c.</hi> 62, <hi rend="italic">by which it appeared that if any person whose affairs were liquidated by arrangement, made any material omission in his statement relating to those affairs he was guilty of a misdemeanour, unless the Jury were satisfied that he had no intent to defraud.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was heard in reply.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEPUTY RECORDER</hi>: "<hi rend="italic">My opinion at present is that I could not stop the case on any of these objections. With regard to the objection that the Deputy Registrar had no authority to sign the document, I have Had the opportunity of taking the opinion of the learned Judges. As to the transfer of the proceedings I under<lb></lb>stand that objection to be withdrawn, as the papers may be transmitted by book post or in any other way. The third objection is that up to the 5th July the prisoner was never within this jurisdiction, and that the false statements must be made after the appointment of the Trustee. I don't think that will hold, I think the sections show clearly that any false statement or omission he makes of his affairs is within the meaning of the Act. Then at to the Jurisdiction, the offence was clearly committed in London. I am not at all certain that between the</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th and the</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th there was not also a repetition of his statement so long as it remained uncontradicted. With regard to the removal of the property, it would be a question for the Jury whether it was with him in London, and whether he did not take it away, intending to deprive his creditors thereof.</hi>

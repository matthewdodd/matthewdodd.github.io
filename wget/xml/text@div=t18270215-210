            . I live at Tottenham, and am a poulterer. On Wednesday, the 31st of January, Cater came to my house, and asked if I would buy any fowls - it was about nine o'clock in the morning; I said perhaps I might; Cater said they had some to sell; I said I was going out, and would look at them in the afternoon; he said,"Oh, you may see them now;" he went out, and beckoned to Collins, who came in, and shot them out of a sack; they had not been fattened - they were dead, and I said they were worth nothing to me; he said "They are worth 1s.;" I then sent for an officer, and gave them in charge.</p>

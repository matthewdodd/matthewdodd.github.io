            , I asked him to assist me; then I went up and laid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150067"></xptr>hold of the horse by the head, I said, "Mr. Brown, you know I am an Excise-officer, I shall seize the horse and cart for his Majesty's use;" he made no answer, but took up the whip and struck me about the head, and got my hat off; he still kept whipping me and the horse; and the other man, who took the cask into the shop, came out and laid hold of me by the collar, putting his knuckles into my shirt, endeavouring to choak me, and made me let go the cart, and the cart drove off a wilful gallop; as he went off I had an opportunity of seeing that there were a great many tubs in it; then I went to Mitchell's door, and insisted upon entrance, to get at the tub that was carried in; with a great deal of trouble, and pushing the man who obstructed me a great deal, and with the assistance of some gentlemen, I got in; when I got in, I saw the sack lying by the side of the counter, an a tub of gin in it, in the same form that I saw it carried in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on foot or horseback yourself? - A. On foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the usual conveyance for smuggled liquors? - A. Yes; the same sort of cask, a half anker.</p>
               <p>Q. They are prohibited carrying it so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You knew the defendant very well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have tried your hand with this sort of work before with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There you were not believed? - A. I could not help that.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave the evidence then as you do now, but met with no credit, though you were supported by another officer? - A. I was not supported by any officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been unfortunate in not including him, but you were determined to do this man, if you had an opportunity? - A. I was determined to do smugglers.</p>
               <p>Q. But you remember the words, "if I have an opportunity, I will do him"? - A. I remember saying, d-n him, if I catch hold of him, I will do him.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not expect you would own it, you surprise me by owning it-this interview took place at Mile-end? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This very fast horse and cart you speak of, you were able to keep company with it, and got to Whitechapel before it? - A. No; I was behind it, about seventy yards.</p>
               <p>Q. But you went the same pace with this horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about nine o'clock in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The public were passing and re-passing, during this transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was market day? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it hay-market day? - A. I will not venture to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. You took notice of all this, and yet will not swear whether it was market day or not? - A. I kept my eye upon him, to see whether he was going into the inn-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether Monday is haymarket day, or not? - A. I don't understand it.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether it is so, or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept your eye upon this cart, though you were seventy yards behind? - A. Seventy yards off is a very little way, it is only a gun shot.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, do you know whether carts stand in the street, or not? - A. No; they don't stop the gang way.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason of your not taking him, was the butchers being there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not occur to you to get any body for your assistance, even when you saw the butchers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know which way the cart was going, by your going to Houndsditch? - A. I was not far from the cart; I thought he was going into one of the inns.</p>
               <p>Q. He went off a wilful gallop? - A. Not when I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in the cart, and you at the horse's head? - A. Yes, at Mitchell's door.</p>
               <p>Q. At the distance of his being in the cart, and you at the head of the horse, he whipt you? - A. Yes; that I will swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it must be with the lash of the whip, and therefore you were not much hurt with that? - A. Yes, I was, if you had twenty or thirty strokes across the face, you would not like it.</p>
               <p>No, I should not. - Q. You stood near enough to be whipt, to prevent the horse getting away? - A. I stood near to him, to keep him from running away; I did not stand before the horses' head, because that is not the way to hold a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. This other man that pommelled you so, you have not indicted? - A. No; I have not seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. He assaulted you in going into the house? - A. Yes; till some gentlemen assisted me in getting into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the same cask you saw taken into the house you will swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And though it was in a sack, you will swear to it? - A. Yes; I saw it through the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you might break the window, and look in? - A. I pushed it and broke it, I did not go to break the glass.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know the other man, or his name, or can you swear to him? - A. I believe I shall find him out.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not indicted him here? - A. No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150068"></xptr>Court. Q. You are positive to this man? - A. Yes; I have seen him frequently since the last time he had a trial.</p>
               <p>Q. What hat had he on? - A. A round hat and light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. When he passed you, he was by the Hospital, going quick? - A. Yes, a trot.</p>
               <p>Q. That is half a mile from the butchers' shambles? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were behind him then, and when he got to Whitechapel, you got up to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face then? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. From there it is not a great distance to Houndsditch? - A. About one hundred yards; when he came by me there, I had an opportunity of seeing his face again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, when you had the horse by the head, and endeavoured to stop him, did you see his face then? - A. About three minutes; I told him, Brown, you know I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tubs were there in the cart? - A. About ten or twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. In this sack could you see the tub, or did there seem to be a small tub in it? - A. I saw the sack, and there appeared to be a small keg in it.</p>

               <p>Q. To whom? - A. To Mr. Charington; Norman is his surveyor, I have known him these seven or eight years; On the 5th of September last, I was going to town with a load of beer, near Aldgate-Church, my fore-horse had liked to run over Norman; I saw a cart stop at Mr. Mitchell's, near Aldgate; when it stopped, I saw a man go in with a sack, which was handed out of the cart by another man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did any thing appear to be in the sack? - A. I was so far off, I could not tell; Norman directly went up, and laid hold of the horse by the head, then the whip went to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Who began to whip? - A. The man in the cart; he whipped the horse, and Norman to disengage himself and get away, which he did; then he attempted to go back down Whitechapel, but I crossed the street with my horses, to prevent him, and he turned back again; the man that went into Mitchell's, I did not observe again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the man in the cart, so as to know him again? - A. I cannot swear that is the man. For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Barnet fair? - A. Yes; on the 5th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to the day? - A. Yes; because I came up on the Sunday, the 4th of September, to the prisoner's house, about five in the afternoon; I staid there that evening, and slept there; the next morning I went with him to Barnet; we sat off about six o'clock in a cart, and arrived at Barnet between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What kind of a cart? - A. A kind of an open chaise-cart, painted blue; I believe it was Mr. Brown's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you got there, how long did you stay in company with Brown? - A. It might be about half an hour; I left him about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in company with him the next time? - A. I saw him in the fair several different times, and came home with him again that night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you look at your watch, or the clock? - A. I did look at the clock; I cannot say for a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. If you looked at the clock, you could tell what hour it was, but you say you guessed it; that is a little unfortunate, I think? - A. I might go by guess work, but I do'nt go by guess work now; it was just after six by the clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't go by guess, but by the clock? - A. I will swear it went six before I went out of the house, and I was out before it went seven.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not look at the clock to observe particularly? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you go? - A. Down Bow-lane, by Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes; Mr. Brown knew that way; he said that was the nighest way to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to next? - A. To the best of my recollection, I believe it was Highgate.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a good horse? - A. Yes, the horse went very well.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that your only reason for thinking it was nine o'clock? - A. That is not; I looked at my watch when I saw another person I knew in the fair, before ten, a man of the name of Brookes.</p>

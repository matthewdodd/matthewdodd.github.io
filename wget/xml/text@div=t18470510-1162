                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live at Red Lion-street, Holborn. I have known the prisoner about two years—he is a baker—I do not know where he lives—about eighteen months ago I had a dispute with him—he attempted to stab me in my dwelling-house—he locked himself in my room; and when I attempted to go in, the door was burst open, and he attempted to stab me—I cannot explain his reason—I had not had any dispute with him before he locked himself in—I had not known much of him before—on the 13th of April he came to my shop, and purchased a cigar—as he left the shop he dropped a pistol on the floor, immediately picked it up, Put it into his pocket, and went away—on the 14th of April, about ten o'clock in the evening, I saw him again, walking up and down opposite my shop—at a quarter to twelve I began to close my shop—on going out with the first</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 85.) I took the prisoner—he was standing in Red Lion-street, opposite Mr. Hay's shop—I had seen him go from that place, out of a doorway three or four houses off—Mr. Hay was bringing out his shutter when the prisoner changed his position—as I went towards him I saw a slight flash, as if a flash in the pan—I secured him, and took a pistol from him—the pan had the appearance of gunpowder having been flashed from it at the time—the pistol was loaded with powder and a small pebble stone—I asked him what he meant by it—he said, if I did not leave go of him he would turn it into me—at the station he said, "I had good reason for it, and he (meaning the prosecutor) knows all about it"—he was quite sober, and did not appear at all excited—I found a quarter of a pound of coffee in his pocket—I have made inquiry about his state of mind, but know nobody who knows him at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live at 75, Leman-street. On 25th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was talking to a girl in New Gravel-lane, and a young man passed by, whom I took for my shipmate—he went into Leader's house, as I thought; so I went after him—I saw Barney at the door; and said, "There is a shipmate of mine inside"—she said there was not—a quarrel took place between us, and she took hold of me by the jacket and tore it, struck me on the eye and blacked it—I had not struck her—Leader then ran out of the house, caught me by the hair, and struck me several blows on the back of the neck—I was bleeding and wounded—Burney had nothing in her hands—there was no light there—I saw no weapon.</p>

My father keeps an oil and color shop in Kentish Town, and I serve in it—on 28th April, between 8 and 9 p.m. I served the prisoner with a penny candle—he gave me a bad florin, I broke it between my teeth and laid the pieces on the counter saying, "What do you call that"—he said "Vat, vat me no understand English"—I said "You under<lb></lb>stand enough to ask for a penny composite, how many have you got?" he brought a purse from his breast pocket and put the two pieces into it, he paid me with a half-crown, and I gave him the change.</p>

I am a grocer of 35, Warden Road, Kentish Town—on 29th April about 9.30., the prisoner came in and asked in pretty good Eng<lb></lb>lish for a penny composite—he tendered me a bad florin—I asked him where he got it—he said "Me cannot speak English," he put down a sixpence—but when he heard me tell the boy to go for a policeman he picked it up again and rushed off.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I arrived in London about a month from the time I was taken in custody. I was not very rich then and Mr. Laverne, of New-man Street, lent me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; my defence simply is that somebody asked me to carry some boxes to that part of the town and gave me half a crown for my trouble; as I returned home I recollected that I had no candle at home and went into the grocer's, who examined the piece and bent it in his teeth which made me believe it was not good, and for fear of being arrested I ran away. I do not know the first gentleman; I never saw him before. I wish to call Mr. Laverne.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LAVERNE</hi>. The prisoner is the son of a gentleman—he came five weeks ago to England without any money, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., tea shillings at a time—I do not know how he spent it—the last money <hi rend="italic">X</hi> gave him was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 16th April—I heard no more of him till I had a letter from his mother saying, that he was arrested; he was employed at an hotel to wash glasses, since he has been in England but only for one week—he lost that situation about three weeks before the 28th.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any silver? - A. I lost three pieces of silver, I have lost property at several times: On the 18th of July, one piece was taken from the prisoner, seventeen penny-weights, all in one piece; I lost it out of my shop between the hours of six and seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it there last? - A. It was left there on the Monday at dinner-time, till the Wednesday; it was cut off this bit of slip by the prisoner; I ordered my apprentice to conceal himself in the loft of the shop. (Produces the slip of silver from which it was cut off.)</p>
               <p>Q. You had suspicions a long time before? - A. Yes, and particularly of the prisoner; my apprentice saw the whole of the circumstance.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Bridgeman.) Is that your piece of silver? - A. Yes; it was cut off this slip, it fits it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say more, than I have been a hard working man through my life-time; I have got a wife, and six helpless children, and an aged mother, who looks to me for support; I hope, Mr. Bridgeman, you will recommend me to mercy, on account of my family.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When you did that, you did not think of my family, but I recommend you to mercy.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) How long had he worked for you? - A. Better than a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

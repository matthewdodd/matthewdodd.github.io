               <p>THOMAS PARISH. I live in Riley-street, Chelsea. On the 21st of June, between five and six o'clock, I was going to work, and saw two genteel dressed men at the prosecutrix's door. One of them said,</p>
               <p>"Here he is." The prisoner came to the door with a horse and cart. They opened the door, and brought him out three or four large bundles, which he drove away with towards town - they followed. I knew the prisoner by sight before.</p>

            . I am an oilman, and am son-in-law to Mrs. Dark. On the 24th of June, I received information, went to the house, and remained there all night. About<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150012"></xptr>four o'clock in the morning two men passed the area, and peeped down. I followed them part of the way to Fulham - they kept looking back. I returned between four and five o'clock, and saw the prisoner with a horse and cart, walking about - there was neither name or number on the cart. I asked him why he was there? He said he was waiting for two gentlemen, who were coming from Kensington, as he was to take them to town to save the toll. He said his cart had been painted a week before, which was the reason he had no number. He took me to Mr. Gan, of Deptford, whom he knew. I left him there.</p>

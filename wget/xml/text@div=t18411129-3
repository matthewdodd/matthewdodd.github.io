                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in London generally. On Monday, the 4th of August, I was at Tunbridge Wells—I had occasion to send my clothes and other things up to London that day—I packed the articles stated in the indictment in a white deal box, I nailed the box down, corded it, and put on it a direction, "To the care of Tho<lb></lb>mas Jackson, No. 18, Wild-court, Drury-lane, London"—I took it to the Van-office—in due course it should have arrived in London about the middle of Tuesday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Patterson. Q.</hi> Is this a workshop or a dwelling-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> work-shop belonging to Thomas Jackson—I do not know whether you lived there at the time—I did not say at Bow-street that you did live there—I believe you merely worked at the shop.</p>

I would leave London, and not prosecute you, nor any thing of the kind—I merely called there—I had seen the party several times about the neighbourhood of Seven Dials—I never saw him before I came from Tunbridge Wells.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker. I was working at No. 18, Wild-court, Drury-lane, on Tuesday, the 31st of August—about eleven o'clock in the day the carrier brought a white deal box, directed to the care of the person I worked for, "Mr. Jackson, No. 18, Wild-court, Drury-lane"—I did not see where the carrier came from—the prisoner Pat<lb></lb>terson was at work there when the box arrived—he owned part of the shop—I left the box between two benches where we work, in the shop where Patterson was—he worked in the shop, and was there at the time—I went there next day—I did not see Patterson there then.</p>

Q.</hi>—Did any person help you up the stairs with the box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Harry Goodrich—I cannot tell when was the last day I worked for Jackson—I did no work for him on the Monday, or from the Saturday before—I have not worked for him since Saturday, the 28th of August—I went there, on the 31st, after some money which was owing me—I was not doing any work that day—a man named Warner came into the shop with me—we had some beer to drink there—I did not fetch it—there were other parties about the shop—I stopped there about an hour and a half—I went there about ten o'clock next day—you were not there then—I cannot say you were not there at all that day—you might have been there unknown to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Lock, of No. 28, Clement's-lane, Strand. A woman named Clark lodged in the same house, above me, for about twelve months, and in August last the prisoner Ashton came to live with Clark—I have frequently seen Patterson at the house before the rob<lb></lb>bery—on the 31st of August, between four and five o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, I saw him come in with a white deal box—he was carrying it on his shoulders—it was heavy—I was at the street-door—he asked me to allow him to pass me, which he did, and went up stairs—I afterwards saw Clark come down with something, and after that I saw Clark and Ashton go out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290007"></xptr>
               <p>together—they returned in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and went up stairs where Patterson was—they might in a shorter space than that have gone to Picket-street and Clare-market—I afterwards saw the two prisoners, Clark and another man, a friend of Clark's, who had come in, leave together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Patterson. Q.</hi> Who rented the room that Clark lived in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Clark her-self did—she took it in her own name, and a man named Goodrich lived with her—I remember your coming there several times last summer, and telling her to send Goodrich to your shop to work for you—I do not know whether he worked for you last summer—you called several times after the rob<lb></lb>bery, to know whether they were at home—Clark and Goodrich left the house that same week, and he has not been there since—the police have been after him there—he is visible enough to be found, I believe—I after<lb></lb>wards pointed Clark out to the policeman—I was asked where I bought a duplicate—Clark had been in prison before, while she was living at this house, and that you know as well as I do—I do not know what it was for—she was in custody last Christmas, and several times for different things, attempting robberies, and that sort of thing, but I do not know that she was ever committed to any prison.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ashton</hi>. I never lived with Clark—I had lodgings of my own—I merely called on Clark as a person I knew—Patterson was there—he asked if I would go and pledge a pair of boots for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I did, and brought him back the money and duplicate—I know nothing more of it, and Patterson knows I do not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks in the Post-office—the prisoner was an auxiliary letter-carrier in the north-west district, that is, Eversholt-street, St. Pancras—on Saturday, 11th May, in consequence of complaints, I made up some letters, addressed to persons in the prisoner's</p>

               <p>delivery, and after I had done so, I went to the district office, and the prisoner was brought to me there about 11 o'clock—that allowed time for those letters to reach their destination in the ordinary course—Crocker, who brought him in, produced nine letters to me, all unopened, among which I found two of those which I had made up—I asked the prisoner why he had not delivered them—he said, "Some I do not know, and others were not answered," meaning that some of the ad<lb></lb>dresses he did not know, and others he could get no answers at the doors—I told him I had seen him go to Mr. Garrett, the butcher's, at the corner of Weston-place, and afterwards saw him go to the top of Brewer-street, or nearly so, and I said, "What became of you after<lb></lb>wards, did you go into Agar-town?"—he said, "Well, I did not"—Agar-town, is the part of his district in which the letters were to be delivered—I directed Crocker to go and search the prisoner's house, and he returned with nearly 400 letters and a few papers—the prisoner was present—none of them had been opened—three or four of the letters contained money, and some, keys—Crocker told the prisoner that they were found in a box under his bed, and asked how he accounted for it—he made no reply—they bore post-marks of February, March, and April—there was among them a letter addressed, "Mrs. Clements, 4, Perry-street, Old St. Pancras-road," bearing the London post-mark of 6th March—that is, I believe, in the prisoner's district—the contents of it are gone—I opened it at Bow-street; but as I opened three or four I do not recollect what this one contained—here are two addressed to Mrs. Lockie, 23, Weston-street, Somers-town—I do not recollect what this one contained; it bears the post-mark of 9th April, and the other of March 5th—here is a letter addressed, "Mrs. Horley, Duke of Clarence, Old St. Pancras-road," post-mark 15th April, and three addressed, "Miss Kidwell, 10, Aldenham-terrace," post-marks 19th February, 8th April, and 15th April.</p>

               <p>different stamps on them, and had all passed through the Post-office at different dates, from February to May—I took them all to Mr. Gardner—the prisoner was with him—among those letters were two addressed to Mr. Lockie, one to Mrs. Horley, and one to Mrs. Clements—I delivered them, and received back the envelopes—on 19th May I went again to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house with Mr. Bingham, and received from the prisoner's wife, an old tea-chest, in which I found 387 letters and packets, all having the post-mark, and different dates between February and May on them—they were also delivered, and the envelopes received back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier in the employment of the Post-office, and in the tame department at the prisoner—I have observed a peculiarity in his manner for the last few months: I could not help it—he seemed to assist in sorting letters, but he did not do anything; he was more in the way than anything else—I sorted his letters for him, for his district—he was competent to deliver them if I <hi rend="italic">set them in,</hi> but not otherwise; and I did it for him for four months, up to the last day—I had to write on the letters in pencil to show him more minutely which way to go—he appeared to me to have a great failing of memory—I had to put some letters in his right hand, and others in hit left; and I did the same for two more, and among these are letters and papers which I had written on; for instance, I put on one, "Opposite the Great Northern Railway"—he would have a good many letters for the workhouse, but there are none of them among the letters found at his house—I used to put these in one hand, and the work-house letters in the other, which were the bulk of his delivery—the average of his walk would be thirty-five letters, eight or nine of which were for the workhouse, and seven or eight for Cottam's iron foundry, and the others would be for private persons, poor people in the vicinity of Agar-town.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Flint. Q. Was I not lying on the table? A. No, he was standing by the fire - Binglow and Comerford were sitting down; I cannot say which of them pinched me.</p>

I came down, and saw Flint lying in the passage, and two officers trying to handcuff him - Bicknell then asked where his hat and the parcel were; he went into the room, and the parcel was gone - I had seen Evans go towards the yard with a parcel; we went and found it over the wall of the next house.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TYRRELL. I am a Police-officer. On Sunday, the 15th of November, I took Evans in Westmister; I accused her of the robbery, and asked her why she threw the bundle over the wall - she said she was in such a flurry she did not know what she did; I then went to Bedfordbury, where I had information Binglow was - I knocked at the door of the room, but got no answer - I burst the door open, and found him there, in the dark, without his shoes.</p>

I had nothing to do with the articles - I was going to my mother-in-law, and knowing Evans I called upon her; I went into her room, and asked if she would have any thing to drink - I sent for something: I own I had been drinking with the prosecutor, and was rather intoxicated; I laid my head on the table, and when the officer came in, I was roused up with the parcel in my pocket, but I do not know how it got there.</p>

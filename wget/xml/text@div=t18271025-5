On Sunday, the 16th of September, I went down to see a friend at the Blue Anchor public-house, Petticoat-lane, in the parish of Christ-church, Spitalfields; I got there about one o'clock- I had two glasses of rum and a pint of porter; I staid there till about six o'clock; I had nothing more there. I called at the next public-house in my way, and got one glass of gin there; I staid there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I went to the next public-house, and had half a quartern of gin - I staid there about a quarter of an hour -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250007"></xptr>I was going on, and felt myself tipsy on the road - and going towards Shoreditch I met a man who pretended to know me - he called me by my name, and asked how I did - that was not the prisoner; that man persuaded me to go into the <placeName id="t18271025-5-crimeloc31">King and Queen public-house</placeName>

I was pushed and shoved about there, and my hat fell off - I was pushed down; there were ten or twelve pushing me about - they made a bit of a push - a sort of a shove, and got me out of doors, pretending to go and see me home; they were leading me along the street, and pushed me down two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they push you down, or might you not have fallen? A. I will not swear it; I felt somebody pulling my coat behind me; I do not recollect what happened afterwards, for I became senseless by the fall, and did not come to myself till morning, when I found myself in the watch-house. I had a silver watch, two gold seals, a gold key, and a gold ring in my fob, and 18s. in money, all of which were gone. I cannot speak to any body having robbed me.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at Bethnal-green. On Sunday evening, the 16th of September, I was going towards home, and saw the prosecutor dragged out of this public-house; there were ten or twelve persons about him. I saw that all was not right, and suspected the men about him; I spoke to the witnesses Keyworth and Blaizey, to help me get him away. I went and laid hold of the prosecutor's arm - the prisoner had hold of his other arm: we tried to get him along between us. I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's right hand breeches pocket - I told him to take his hand out, for he was robbing him - he did so; I saw him put his hand into the pocket again. I saw them tear his trousers in pulling him about; they pulled him down several times; the prisoner had hold of one of his arms, and forced him back, as I forced him forward. I saw the prisoner tear his fob right off; I could not see the watch in it, but saw the seals hanging to it; the prisoner then walked down the street. I conducted the prosecutor to the watch-house, for a place of safety, and did not follow the prisoner, but I knew him before perfectly well; he was generally about the coach-stand by Sun-street. I am certain he is the man who had hold of his arm, and tore his fob off, and went away with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How near were you to him when you saw him pull the fob out? A. I had hold of the prosecutor's arm, and saw the seals, but not the watch; he was leaning on me with one arm, and on the prisoner with the other. I had not been into the public-house - they came out of Norton-falgate into Shoreditch - it was just dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not try to take the prisoner? A. I went with the prosecutor - two witnesses followed the prisoner; I cannot say whether the prisoner was sober - he reeled about a little, but whether it was real or not I cannot tell - he walked down the street.</p>

            . I saw what Canch has stated, I have heard his evidence. I was a yard or two from the prosecutor - it was about half-past six o'clock in the evening; the gas was lighted. The prosecutor was very drunk, and the prisoner was in liquor; I saw the prosecutor on the ground, and the prisoner on him, and two others on each side; they lifted him up; the prisoner's hand was then in the prosecutor's pocket. I saw that he drew his hand out, and walked up Plough-yard2, and two others with him; the two others looked in his hands - he appeared to be showing them what he had got; I cannot say what it was - I saw nothing else; I did not see the fob taken - I and Blaizey followed the prisoner - we did not offer to take him, as we could see no officer near; he asked us to have something to drink - we said, "No thank you," and left him- we followed him for half a mile, and two others followed us at a distance behind; we left him opposite Shoreditch church. I have no doubt whatever of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you first see them? - A. In Shoreditch. I walked after the prisoner for half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not return almost to the spot where you had seen him at first? A. Yes; there were plenty of persons about. I did not meet many persons when I followed him, but when I saw him a second time there were several people passing, but the first time I did not meet above four or five people: he did not attempt to run; the prosecutor had not got his hat on when I saw him. The prisoner was not so tipsy as to be unable to walk.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. - I received information of the robbery in the morning, from the prosecutor, and in the evening I went with Brown, and assisted in bringing the prisoner to the office. I searched him, and found nothing but a knife, a letter, and a few halfpence about him. Two or three evenings afterwards a patrol brought a hat to me at the office - the prosecutor claimed it.</p>
               <p>JOHN MURRELL. Here are the trousers which I wore that night; the fob is torn quite out - it was all right before this happened. The trousers are torn very much, and are very dirty.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Great Charlotte-street, Black friars-road—I am in the habit of reporting for the public press, and have been so employed for five or six years. In the course of my employment, I attended a meeting on Clerken well-green, on Monday, 29th May—I got there about half-past six o'clock in the evening—there was a van, on which a platform was placed for the speakers—I saw the defendant, Fussell, in the van—there were eighteen or twenty persons in it, and between 2000 and 3000 persons were assembled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What class of persons 'did they appear to be chiefly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were Mine working men; the others I hardly know how to describe, the lower orders I suppose; they were very dirty and very ragged—I noticed a person named Williams there—he spoke first to the meeting—he was on the van—I took a note of what he said, such as I should take if I gave a newspaper report—I did not take it all, only a portion—this is the note I then made (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is not in short-hand, but in abbreviated long-hand—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "My friends, tie bloody aristocracy <hi rend="italic">have now done its</hi> work at last," or "at least," I am not positive which; "they have sent John Mitchell from his country. I trust while you remain here you will be peaceable, and obey my injunctions as to the course you shall adopt—all the arrangements have been made; and when you have been addressed by two or three speakers, I shall give you a signal, when you must fall into marching order, four abreast, and follow me where I shall lead you; you will know where when you are there. I shall take you then to a place where you will meet ten times as many as are here, and then you will be told what to do. I have made up my mind on a course of action. I fear banishment no more than that brave patriot and noble man, John Mitchell, who has been <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> by these base, bloody, and brutal Whigs, by partizan judges, packed juries, and a perjured sheriff"—that was all I took of Williams's speech—it was spoken loud, so as to be heard by the people assembled—a man named M'Carthy then addressed the meeting—J have a note of portions of his speech—he commenced something about the base, brutal, and bloody Whigs—I did not take that; but he continued, "If John Mitchell is allowed to leave his country, other brave <hi rend="italic">men</hi> will fall victims to that bloody <hi rend="italic">Gagging</hi> Bill. It is now your time, if you value liberty, to strike the blow. Ireland may, for aught I know, at the present time be in arms; but if she is not, she is only remaining quiet in order to recruit her strength the more effectually to strike the blow, and release herself from tyranny and oppression"—that is the whole of his speech—these two speeches were received by the mob with clapping of hands, and apparently with great satis<lb></lb>faction—Fussell</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030028"></xptr>
               <p>then proceeded to address the meeting—I did not take all he said, only such parts as struck me—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "The Government have succeeded in convicting honest John Mitchell. How have they accom<lb></lb>plished it? Why, by packed juries and partizan judges. I tell Lord John Russell that I have no sympathy with his damnable government. John Mitchell had asked if the Queen had not forgotten her duty to her country—I now ask the same question, and adopt his views. If the Queen forgets to recognize the people, then the people must forget to recognize the Queen. If John Mitchell is sent out of his country, every Irishman must rise and revenge the insult, or they will no longer be worthy the name"—the next part of his speech consisted of some abuse of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and accused the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of being in the pay of the Government, and keeping back the Irish news—I did not take a note of that, not thinking 1 should be required here, and a newspaper would not require that—he went on: "The Government is not worthy the support of any honest man; it is too contemptible to be recog<lb></lb>nized, and you must use your best endeavours to overthrow it. And now I wish to impress upon you that there is one safe way of getting rid of bad rulers, who forget their duty to their country: I openly avow that I mean private assassination. What made the Emperor of Austria fly from his country? Why, the fear of assassination; and it is by these means that other bad rulers will soon fly. I have five sons," (I am not positive whether it is five or four, I suppose I was knocked on the elbow at the time;) "and I now declare that I would disown any one who would refuse to assassinate any person who may be instrumental in banishing me from my country for such an offence as John Mitchell was convicted of"—that is all I took of Fussell's speech—Williams then said, 'How, my lads, fall into marching order, four abreast"—the people obeyed that order, and Williams placed himself at their head—as far as I recollect, the three speakers toot the lead—after forming in that way, they marched down Aylesbury-street, into St. John's-street—I left them there, went down Wilderness-row, and met them again in Goswell-street, at the corner of Old-street-road—they west down Old-street into the City-road, to Finsbury-square—they walked round Finsbury-square, I suppose half or three-quarters of an hour, apparently waiting for some other parties; in fact, it was stated that there was some meeting at Stepney, and they expected the parties from Stepney down there—I did not see them joined by any other body of men there—after they left Finsbury-square, they proceeded up Chiswell-street, Beech-street, Barbican, Long-lane to Smithfield—they then went down Snow-hill, along Holborn to the corner of New Oxford-street, till they came to the Land and Labour Bank, where there was a stoppage, and three cheers were given—they went along Broad-street, and turned off one of the streets near Monmouth-street, in the neighbourhood of Seven Dials, diagonally, towards Leicester-square, through Cranbourn-street, into Leicester-square, and up Princes-street—from there they turned off, I think, by Macclesfield-street, they took the street from the bottom of Dean-street, and went into Soho-square, where I left them—they stopped at the Chartist Assembly-rooms I think it is called, in Dean-street, and I believe they were addressed from the window—I cannot speak posi<lb></lb>tively—I saw men at the window—I cannot say whether they were address<lb></lb>ing them, but it appeared so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of about how many persons did this procession consist? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When it started, I should say about 3, 000, but it was almost impossible to say the number at the last, you could not see them—it was increased by large numbers at every street—the party said, "Fall in," and the people did fall in, as they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030029"></xptr>
               <p>went along; in fact, there might be 50, 000 or 60, 000—I could not speak positively—Dean-street was completely filled from one end to the other, and they turned into Oxford-street—it was about a quarter to ten, or half-past nine, when I left them in Dean-street—they left Clerkenwell-green about quarter to eight,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you notice during their progress what effect was produced upon the inhabitants residing in the line of inarch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A great deal of fear, and terror, and surprise, it appeared to me—a number of them shut up their shops and closed their doors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT ALLEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you on the van? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the speaking lasted altogether about twenty minutes, or half an hour at the outside—there were only three speakers—there was a good deal of noise among the people below the van—I was behind "Williams and Fussell—I sat on the side of the van—parties would be getting up behind I occasionally, and it might have been at that particular moment that my elbow was touched—I was liable to be interrupted, but that was the only instance of it—it is usual to take reports for the newspapers in abbreviated long hand—this is it (<hi rend="italic">handing in his note-book</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you translate that for me, beginning there? (<hi rend="italic">pointing out a passage in witness's vote-book.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "Williams. Now, my friends, fall into marching order, four abreast"—this is the way in which I do whatever I do for the news<lb></lb>papers, and thirty or forty first-rate reporters to the daily journals write the same system—that is the ordinary way of a reporter, not of every reporter—it is not the way in which a short-hand writer reports—there is a difference between a reporter and a short-hand writer—I have been employed for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and all the papers—I reported this meeting for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I was not employed to do it—I attend any meeting I like, and send my copy to the newspaper, and if they use it, they pay me for it—that is the case with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, or any other paper—I attended this meeting on speculation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you ever specifically employed by any paper, to take what passed at a meeting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, frequently—I have been employed by them all—I have attended many meetings for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I go and ask the question, whether I shall go to a particular meeting, and they say, "Yes," that is what I call employing me, and they use my copy in preference to anybody else's—no other person would stand a chance, if I got engaged first—I call that an engagement, going to the office, and asking the editor to attend a particular meet<lb></lb>ing—I have asked the editor; I have seen the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I am no ac<lb></lb>qaaintance of his—I have seen him—I never said that the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> tad engaged me personally—I never spoke to him personally about it—the system of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> is, if you have any communication to make to the editor, you must send it, and you get your answer in the same way—I have cer<lb></lb>kinly communicated personally with the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever been engaged to attend any specific meeting by the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to report that meeting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>. Well, I presume the answer coming through the printer in the office, who receives his orders from the editor, may be considered as an engagement from the editor—he did not come cut himself, but I have attended the meeting, sent in my copy, which has been used, and I was paid, so I suppose he engaged me—I did not tell you I had spoken to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—Ido not know that I have ever done so—I have seen him dozens of times—I believe he is Mr. John De Laine—I have taken orders as from him, in acting as a reporter—I have been a reporter six or seven years altogether, not constantly—I have been a newspaper proprietor in the meantime—the paper was called <hi rend="italic">The Railway</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>—I have not during that period attended the Police-offices in any capacity—I have been to a Police-office, not as a reporter—I think I was there once, perhaps twice—thirteen years ago I was there in the capacity of a defendant, for running away from my employer when I was an apprentice—I have also been there as a defendant, but it can have nothing to do with this case—it was on a charge by the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, but it is calculated to do me a serious injury in my profession, these things coming out; but as you ask me the question, I must explain how I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know the distinction between a person charged with a lesser offence, who is called a defendant, and a person charged as a prisoner with a crime? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know what you are aiming at—I was charged with felony—there is no reason for beating about the bush, if you will allow me to explain it—six or seven years ago, as I was going home one night with my brother and another person, I knocked a lighted cigar against the door of the <hi rend="italic">Morn-ing Chroniclc</hi>-ofnce, the porter came out and asked, "Why are you knocking the ashes of your cigar into our letter-box?" I said, "I have done nothing of the kind," he said, "You have, and it has been done two or three nights—it is a good job that no policeman is here, or I would give you in charge—the parties with me fetched a policeman from the opposite sice, and said, "Here is a policeman, if you have any charge to make"—the porter immediately said to the policeman, "I give this person in charge for putting the end of his cigar into our letter-box"—the policeman said, "I know nothing of you; I must take the charge from your employer'-we went round to the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle-office</hi> for the purpose of taking the charge, and my brother, who was with me, Wished to go into the office—the porter said he could not come in—the policeman said, "Yes, he must; he saw the charge, and he must be present;" but the porter insisted he should not, and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and knocked my brother down, and the policeman took him in charge for the assault, having witnessed it—Dr. Black, who was then the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, came down, and I was given in charge to the policeman on a charge of arson, taken to Bow-street, and locked up—the porter was given in charge for the assault, and he was bailed—the case came before Mr. Hall, at Bow-street next day, and I was dismissed; the Magistrate saying there was no ground at <hi rend="italic">all</hi> forgiving me in charge, and the porter was fined 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the assault on my brother—that was the charge of felony—I commenced an action against the proprietor; but the policeman who took the charge had left the force in the meantime, and I could not com<lb></lb>plete the evidence, and abandoned it; and not proceeding with the action I was <hi rend="italic">let into</hi> the costs, and had to pay 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But there was a case with the Sun Fire-office, where there was really some burning, was there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a house which I held in conjunction with my brother was burnt down—my brother was with me on the occasion at the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>-office, and saw the whole—I do not know that any<lb></lb>thing particularly happened to prevent my brother being a witness—the solicitor who had the business advised us that we could not safely go to trial without the policeman who took the charge—I do not think my brother was examined as a witness, but I forget now; it is seven or eight years ago—I claimed 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Sun Fire-office—I got none of it—I was insured for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the defendant recovered a verdict upon some points—there were six pleas on the record—they got a verdict upon three, and we upon the other three; but I know that our three precluded us from getting any money—I do not know whether one of the pleas was that I had set fire to my own house; I never looked at the pleas, but it is not very likely, or they would</p>

               <p>not have offered to settle it before we went to trial—they offered to settle it, and to arbitrate—I was at the trial—I did not hear that I was charged with setting fire to my house—there were a great many things said by counsel, but I "never pay any attention to those things—I did not, after I had become an editor, find it necessary or desirable to leave London for some time—I have been out of London once or twice; I have been all over England, I cannot tell when, reporting—I never absconded, in consequence of having committed a fraud on the Messrs. Spicer, the paper-makers—I was never chared with having defrauded them; I am not aware that I am indebted to them—I have never been out of London as much as two months; never more than a week altogether—if any debt was contracted with the Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And if you do not send in a report with something in it, you are not 'My to have it inserted or to be paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I see your drift—if there is nothing in it the editor does not put it in; but he docs not find fault with us</p>

               <p>because there is nothing in it—if there is nothing in our report worthy of public attention the chances are that the editor would not put it in—if it was something very attractive, or novel, or extraordinary, most likely I should get it in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4. Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriar's-road, and am a reporter. I report for all the daily papers—I report in short<lb></lb>hand—I attended the meeting at Clerkenwell on 29th May—I got there about seven o'clock—the meeting did not commence till ten minutes afterhere was a van in the centre, which served the purpose of a platform—I was on it—there were about 3, 000 people assembled round the van when the proceedings commenced—there might have been about thirty on the van, it was full—Williams, M'Carthy, and Fussell were there—I took a note in short-hand of pan of the proceedings—I did not take the whole—I took as much as served my purpose—Williams addressed the meeting first—these are my original notes, which I took in the van—I did not take all that Williams said—I took the salient points for newspaper reporting—he said, "Friends, the b—y aristocracy has done its work at last; although we have got a Government spy among us, we do not care; that man (I believe allud<lb></lb>ing to a policeman in the crowd, my impression is that he pointed to some<lb></lb>body in the crowd, but I do not exactly recollect,) has transported his own sons; but keep the peace, my friends; but if any man disturbs you, I hope you have sufficient energy to defend yourselves; now, keep the peace and 1 will take you to a place where you will meet five times the number of men that are collected here; I will take you to a certain place, and we will hold a meeting there; when I give you the signal, I want you to fall into march<lb></lb>ing order, four abreast, and to follow me where I will lead you; I will the: take you to a place where you will meet ten times as many persons as are here, and then you will be advised what to do; until then I ask you to be obedient to orders"—that is all I have on my notes, but I recollect that he advised them to be orderly and steady, and not to be riotous, but to conduct themselves peaceably, to follow him, and place implicit reliance on his direc<lb></lb>tions—I do not recollect that he said anything about Mitchell—he did not say much more than I have got down—the speeches were all very short; and Williams requested them to be brief—M'Carthy spoke next; I beg your pardon, I have taken a large M. which I put down for Mitchell, as the beginning of M'Carthy's speech—Williams went on to say—" I do not fear punishment more than Mitchell; he does not care for his punishment; he feels proud of his punishment, although he is manacled, and although the Whig Govern<lb></lb>ment have determined to murder that honest patriot; the <hi rend="italic">Gagging Bill</hi> was brought in for no other purpose than to murder him; honest John Mitchell has been murdered by these base, bloody, and brutal Whigs; through the instrumentality of packed juries and partizan Judges"—then came the direc<lb></lb>tion of Williams, which I before alluded to, and subsequently M'Carthy's speech—he agreed with Williams in his condemnation of the Whigs:-"Would the people of Ireland allow John Mitchell to be sent away from his native shores; if they allowed John Mitchell to be taken away from his native land, many other brave men would fall victims to the diabolical <hi rend="italic">Gagging</hi>

               <p>Bill; it is now the time for all who value liberty, to strike the blow, and Ireland will rise in arms; if that country has been quiet, it is only that it might recruit its strength to make a bold effort to release herself at the proper time"—that is all I have of M'Carthy's speech—Fussell followed; he said, "The Government has succeeded in obtaining the conviction of honest John Mitchell, by means of subservient Judges and packed juries; John Mitchell had asked whether the Queen had not forgotten her duty to her country; and I advocate the same sentiments that John Mitchell has uttered; Govern<lb></lb>ment, it has been said, has acted upon expediency; but that is a ridiculous sad false plea for so great a crime; I have been told that I must not use such language, because I shall bring the Government into contempt; but that is ridiculous, for the Government is so contemptible at present, that it would be impossible to bring it into greater contempt;—I should like to tell the meeting that there is one safe way of getting rid of rulers—those rulers who forget their duty to their country; and that is by private assassi<lb></lb>nation; if my sons were not capable of assassinating any person who sent me out of the country, I should be ashamed of them; these are the means of chastising the most evil nations on the earth; the fear of private assassina<lb></lb>tion made the Emperor of Austria run; and it is the fear of that might make rulers, in this country run also; if John Mitchell was sent to Spike Island, then it is quite evident that you may use <hi rend="italic">spikes</hi> for the Government; I have five sons, and I would disown them if they were not ready to assassinate men who sent me out of the country for such a crime as that of which John Mitchell was said to be guilty"—that is all I have—I have another note here, of Williams's—he then said: "Now my friends, fall into marching order"—they obeyed his directions, and fell in four a breast, and marched through the streets—Williams was in the front rank, and M'Carthy and Fussell', I think, but I am not quite clear about those two—I went down Red Lion-street, I think it is, and met them again at the corner of Wilderness<lb></lb>row, and then at Finsbury-square—they then marched round the square two or three times—I should think there were 7, 000 or 8, 000 people then—I then followed them up Holborn, down what used to be Monmouth-street, and down a street into Leicester-square, up Princes-street, and into Dean-street, where the Chartist Hall is situate—they there shouted, as they had done on the road previously, and were received by a party, who appeared to address them from the window of the Hall but on account of the noise, I could not distinctly ascertain whether he was addressing them, or whether it was a mere dumb-show—I then left them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where do you say you live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 4, Great Char<lb></lb>lotte-street, Blackfriars-road—that is the same house as the last witness lives in—we do not live together, but we have both been there six or seven months—my engagement is pretty much the same as his—I have not heard him examined—I send my report to any of the papers—I was not engaged by any paper to attend this meeting; I went voluntarily—I did not observe any other reporters at the meeting—I am not aware that there were any but myself and Fowler; but among so large a crowd there might have been without my seeing them—I did not observe any other person taking notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induced you to go there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The same reason that induced me to go to other meetings, to report them for the papers, on the chance of getting an account of it inserted, and to be paid for it by the line if inserted; that is the nature of my engagement with the papers I send copy to—I had agreed with Fouler in the morning, when we saw the announcement, to be there for this purpose—Fowler might have done it by himself, and so might I, and so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030034"></xptr>
               <p>might you conduct this case yourself; but you have some one to assist you<lb></lb>I send my copy to all the papers—the speeches lasted thirty or forty minutes—I write short-hand—this report is in short-hand—I could have reported for forty minutes without assistance—I do not usually require assistance when reporting for forty minutes—I could have done it alone, hut we heard of the announcement at the same time, and as it was likely to be a matter of profit one could not justly take the whole of it, so we agreed to divide it, and take the meeting between us; we were, in fact, partners, and shared the proceed:—we go shares in many things; it is convenient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it true that if you send a false report to a newspaper you are never again employed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not in the habit of sending false reports—I should imagine that if I sent a report to the newspapers which turned out to be false the proper course for the editor to adopt would be not to employ me again; that is the course; I do not, therefore, find it necessary to fortify myself in making a report, by having a partner—I retired with Fowls from the meeting—we did not compare our notes; I did not read over to him what I should send to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, nor did he to me—I will tell you the manner in which it was done, and that will get rid of that difficulty—I wrote out me portion of the meeting while he wrote the other, so that we had no occasion to compare notes—I do not recollect what portion of the meeting Fowler wrote—sometimes one writes the beginning, and the other the speeches—I recollect writing some of the description of the procession, but whether I wrote it all 1 do not know—the procession was quiet enough—I have an in-pression that I wrote Fussell's speech, but I am not positively certain-there was a great noise at intervals—while Fussell was speaking I was in the van, immediately behind him—he spoke for about ten minutes, as near as I can recollect—they all took about the same time—there was a noise, unless there was anything sprightly said—there was nothing very sprightly said, to my mind, but that is a matter of taste; but I mean any point—when I say I only took the salient points, I mean the points that I thought most likely to be of use in a newspaper report.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May I take the liberty of supposing that that means, likely to induce the editor to insert it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, you may suppose that—of course if it was all nonsense they would not put it in—I think the newspaper did put all in that I sent—Fowler and I did not compare our copy before we sent it—we could not compare it, because they were different parts—I wrote a portion and he wrote a portion—there could be no comparison; one was grafted on the other—Fowler wrote that which was appended to my portion of the report for my papers, and I wrote whatever my portion was for the papers to which he sent—I reported on that occasion for the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>—the last part of that report would be Fowler's composition.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, G</hi> 15.) On Monday evening 29th May, about seven o'clock, I was at Clerkenwell-green—there was a meeting there—I was there before it commenced—there was a van there; Williams was the first person who spoke from it—I should say there were about twelve hundred people round the van when the meeting first began—I made some notes of what Williams said—I have a copy of them here—the first words he said were, "The b----y aristocracy has now done its work, "or," now had their wish;" I am not quite sure which it was—I left the meeting for a short time, and when I returned Fussell was speaking—I was not near enough to hear distinctly what he said—I did not report any of it—the meeting was cheering very much—Williams came to the front of the van, and put his hand against Fussell's leg while he was speaking—I do not think Fussell intended</p>

               <p>to have left oil so soon, and Williams said, "Now, friends, fall in four deep," and the mob formed into the procession four deep, as he desired, and marched off the Green—I did not see who walked in front of the procession until I got to Compton-street, Clerkenwell, a short distance from the place, and I then saw that Williams was in front of the procession—I saw Williams leave the front of the procession in Compton-street, and come down the sides—he spoke to the people who were walking on the pavement, and said, "Now, friends, if you are friends to the cause, you will fall into the procession, and not walk on the pavement"—I do not know whether any one fell into the procession then—the procession was marching along at the time—they proceeded along Goswell-street, Old-street, and City-road down to Finsbury-square—they cheered several times as they went along—they marched round Finsbury-square two or three times, waiting," I believe, for another party to come up—I did not see whether any other party joined them—I know a person of the name of Vernon—I did not see him at the meeting before it started—the first I saw of him was at Finsbury-sqaare; he was then marching with the procession—I cannot call to mind in what part of the procession he was—after leaving Finsbury-square, they pro<lb></lb>ceded along Chiswell-street, Beech-street, Barbican, Long-lane, through Smith-field, up Holborn, and turned down, I think, Great St. Andrew's-street, and got into Leicester-square—they then went along the end of Piccadilly, up Princes-street, Compton-street, and up Dean-street, to No, 83, where there are rooms occupied by the Irish Confederates—a great number of persons came to the windows and the door—the mob did not positively halt, but they moved much slower, and there was a great deal of cheering from the mob and from tie house, and several persons from the house came out and joined the pro<lb></lb>cession—after leaving Dean-street they went into Oxford-street and down. Regent-street, through the Quadrant, through Whitcomb-street and Pall-mall Rast, through Trafalgar-square into the Strand—in the Strand I heard some persons in the procession singing to the tune of the "Marseillaise Hymn" and also to the tune of "Rule Britannia"—I do not know the words, but I had heard them sing the same, at some of their previous meetings, to some words about the Charter—the words they sang to the "Marseillaise Hymn" appeared to be an English version of that which I have-read—from the Strand they went to fleet-street—they halted at the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> newspaper-office, and hooted and groaned a very great deal, and some persons who stood near me said, "Let us smash the place in"—that was not general, but the hooting and groaning was general—they then passed towards Farringdon-street—they there hesitated, and many of them said, "Let us go to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>-office"—they did not go, but proceeded up Farringdon-street, and up Skinner-street and Giltspur-street, into Smithfield—Williams was then at the head of the procession—he said to the leading section of the procession, "We will halt here in Smithfield, and I will <hi rend="italic">get</hi> up a lamp-post and address them"—he or some one got up a lamp-post—I do not know who it was—I moved away out of the crowd—the City police then interfered, and they moved along Long-lane, and to Red cross-street—they halted at a coffee-shop there—Williams, who was at the head of the procession, said, "Now do not any of you come inside, don't come inside the walls of the house"—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>let us have a meeting on the 10th April; we have had one now without his leave"—he said they would continue to-meet night after night until such time as they had news from Ireland, which the damnable press would not give them—" I mean," he said, "when our Irish brethren will want us to assist them in obtaining their liberties"—Vernon afterwards addressed them from the window, and M'Carthy after him—M'Carthy said, "Not to-night, but to<lb></lb>morrow night"—that was in answer to some people in the crowd, who said "Come down to-night, come down among us to-night, and lead us, and we will do it to-night!"—I cannot say what that referred to; it was while Vernon was speaking—M'Carthy said, "No, not to-night, but to<lb></lb>morrow night, and bring your guns and pistols with you"—the City police then interfered, and dispersed the assembly—I was in plain clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you in the crowd at the first part of the meeting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about twelve yards from the van, in front of the speakers—there was cheering very frequently—I was present when Fussell spoke a little, but in consequence of the noise I was not able to take much notice of him—I was there during the latter part of his speech—I was farther away from the van then, because I had left the meeting—it was very noisy—I could hear that Fussell was speaking—I did not see Fussell after the procession started—I heard Williams enjoin them to keep the peace and be orderly, perhaps more than once, I will not be quite sure—he said after it started, that if they were friends to the cause they would fall in, and not walk on the pavement—there were a great many private persons, not belonging to the procession, on the pavement—walking on the pavement would have obstructed the way—that might possibly have been bis reason for saying that—I thought at the time it was for the purpose of increasing the procession<lb></lb>it might have been either way—I do not know what the words were that they sang, but they were about the Charter—the tune was "Rule Britannia"—I know that tune, and the air of the "Marseillaise Hymn"—I have heard it fre<lb></lb>quently played by musicians, and I have played it on the flute—I heard a word or two, but I cannot positively remember now what they were—I have heard the English version of the hymn, and I believe it was that—I waited till the meeting dispersed—that was about half-past eleven o'clock—they dispersed in disorder—the police removed them violently rather—I mean the mob dispersed violently—they ran away—I should say there were at least 3000 persons present before the coffee-shop at that time—that was the greatest number there had been in the procession—there was at no time as many as 15, 000 or 16, 000; if I was to include the persons on the pavement, there might have been, but not in the actual procession—it was impossible to estimate the numbers on the pavement—as far as they went all along the streets the pavement was generally crowded with persons looking on-persons kept coming up the by-streets into the thoroughfare where the pro<lb></lb>cession passed along—they were people there who merely came out of curiosity, attracted by the procession, but not in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> They were not running away in terror and alarm, but coming up to observe it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were not 15, 000 or 16, 000 persons in the pro<lb></lb>cession—I counted them once, and estimated the number in the procession it about 3, 000—that was in Oxford-street, while they were coming out of Dean-street—what Williams said at the coffee-shop was a few minutes before they dispersed—they did not disperse of themselves, they were dispersed by the police—I was in the crowd, in plain clothes—I do not know how many policemen there were—the police ordered them to remove, and they began to run, and I ran with the rest: in fact, I was obliged to run; we all went together—I suppose that was upon the order to disperse, I do not know—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman carpenter. I was at the meet-ing of 29th May, and was near enough to hear the speeches—I heard Fussell address the people assembled—I heard the whole of his speech—I heard bin say the Emperor of Austria had been compelled to fly, for fear of private assassination—that was the only time he used the word "assassinate"—he did not say there was one safe way of getting rid of rulers, who forgot their duty to their country, by means of private assassination<lb></lb>there was nothing of the kind mentioned—he said, supposing he was placed in the same position as Mitchell was, he had five sons, and if they did not avenge his wrongs he would disown them—that was the most important part of his speech—he only used the word "private assassination" once, because if he had, it would have dwelt on my mind; because, whether he was a friend or an enemy, I never would have recognised him—I would have disowned him, if such an expression had struck my mind—I had no knowledge of him previous to the meeting—next day my attention was called to the report of what was attributed to him—it was not a correct report.</p>

               <p>number would fill—it is a rough calculation—there was not much noise, there was a little applause—when Fussell said the Emperor of Austria had been compelled to fly, for fear of private assassination, he was referring to a paragraph he read in the paper—he had no paper there—he was speaking of the Government immediately before that—he said they wanted to change the system of Government, that they were over-taxed, that was all—that the people were over burdened with taxes—I heard a good deal more than that, but I cannot recollect the whole of it—I merely speak respecting the private assassination—that word was only applied once—I think there was some<lb></lb>thing said about the Queen—I cannot tell what, it is so long ago—I did not bear it in mind—I believe he was in favour of royalty—I believe he spoke so in his speech—I know some allusion was made to the Queen, but what the precise words were I cannot tell—I think it was in favour—I heard him speak of John Mitchell, that he had been a persecuted man, and he spoke respect<lb></lb>ing his (Fussell's) five sons—I do not know whether he has five sons—I did not hear anything said about the duty of Irishmen to rise and revenge insults—I do not recollect those words, or anything of the sort—I do not think any man, who would recommend private assassination, would be a fit man for any society, therefore I would not countenance any man that said ft—if Fussell had made use of such an expression, I should not have forgotten it—what he said about his five sous did not directly follow the use of the words "private assassination," as applied to the Emperor of Austria—I do not recollect what he said before—I went with the meeting afterwards as far as Snow-hill, at least I saw them at Snow-hill—I did not go from Clerken-wcli-green with them—I did not see Fussell go with them—I do not recollect hin—I never saw him but that once, when he was making his speech—my employ is in Snow-hill, and I went to my employ, and was speaking to Mr. Driver, at the oil-shop, at the time I saw the procession—I did not join them—I went to Snow-hill, because it is my regular rule after I have done my employ, to go to my shop most evenings, unless I work till late in the evening, which I did not that day—I left work about a quarter-past six—my work is in Theobald's-road—I had to go to the shop to book my time—I went home to have my tea first—it was about eight, or a little after, that I got to Snow-hill—I do not know how many persons there were in the proces<lb></lb>sion, but a great many—not 120, 000 I should say—they took a long while to pass—three-quarters of an hour I should say—I do not know whether they were four or five abreast—I saw no one leading them, no one at the head—I did not see the leaders—I did not see Vernon—I know him, and have seen Williams—I did not see them in the procession—I heard Williams speak at the meeting—I think I heard him talk of the b—aristocracy—I did not disown him for that expression—I did not hear him tell the meeting, that he hoped they bad energy enough to defend themselves if there was any obstruction—nothing of the kind—he told them to fall in on a signal—I do know whether that had been arranged beforehand—I never knew anything of the meeting—although 1 belong to a district, I am not always there—I heard M'Carthy speak—I do not recollect his saying, that now was the time for every one who valued liberty to strike the blow—I am not sure he did not say it—I was as near to him as I was to Fussell, but I have not borne these things in. mind.</p>

I was present at the meeting on 29th May—I heard Fus<lb></lb>ell's speech—I was about six or seven yards off the van he was in—I did not hear the first two or three sentences—the first I heard was about John Mitchell, and I heard all the rest from there—what he said about his sons was, "I have five children, and I would disown <hi rend="italic">ere a one</hi> of them that would not avenge "or" revenge me, if the government was to serve me as they did John Mitchell"—there was nothing said about assassination—the expression was not made use of then—in the early part of his speech he was speaking about how strong a government might be, and yet what a little thing might upset it; and he said, speaking of being surrounded with military and police, and all that, the mere threat of assassination, drove the emperor of Austria from Milan or Vienna, or wherever it was—I did not bear him make use of the word "assassination" at any other part of his speech.</p>

Whatever has been done or said by the most disaffected persons in all Ireland, against the existence of the party which calls itself the Government, nothing can go too far for me; whatever public treasons there are in this land, I have stomach for them all May I presume to address the women of limerick—It is the first time I have ever been in the presence of the daughters of those heroines who held the breach against King William; and they will understand me when I say that no Irishwoman ought so much as to speak to a man who has not provided himself with arms. No lady is too delicate for the culinary operation of casting bullets; no hand is too white to make up cartridges; and I hope, if it be needful to come to the last resort, that the citizens of Limerick, male and female, will not disgrace their paternal and maternal ancestors."</p>

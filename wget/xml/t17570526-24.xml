               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to them?</p>
               <p>Bristerfield. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alone?</p>
               <p>Bristerfield. There was a man with me, named John Ainsow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing to them before Harding pushed you?</p>
               <p>Bristerfield. No, I never touch'd them; I missed my watch about five minutes after this.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the watch last?</p>
               <p>Bristerfield. I went from Mr. Woolf's house about three o'clock, and look'd at my watch at my going out.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Mr. Woolf's house from the place where they met you?</p>
               <p>Bristerfield. It is in the same street, but a little way off.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Bristerfield. I am a sugar baker, Mr. Woolf is my master.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been from your master's house?</p>
               <p>Bristerfield. From the time that I looked at my watch to the time that I missed it, was not much above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since?</p>
               <p>Bristerfield. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Where ?</p>
               <p>Bristerfield. A man at the Thirteen Cantons sent to my master's house, to let me know my watch was at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>

               <p>Bristerfield. It is there now.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoners with taking it?</p>
               <p>Bristerfield. Because I missed it so soon after that push which Harding gave me.</p>

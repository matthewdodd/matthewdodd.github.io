I knew the deceased William Davey; he was a constable in the same division as myself—the station-house of that division is at Acton, and the deceased's beat was in that parish—he was on duty on 19th January last—there were some building materials deposited upon the premises of a person of the name of Saunders, in Park-road, North—Davey lived at Petherton Villa—I know the prisoners—I did not know where they lived at the time this matter occurred; I know now—the three places mentioned are all within a very short distance</p>

I live at 4, Acorn Cottages, Acton-green, and am the wife of George Samuel Winning—on the evening of 19th January last, from about 6 o'clock to a quarter-past 6, I was going along a footpath leading across the fields to Acton—there is a place called Cumberland Villa, which I had to pass—when I came there I saw the two prisoners, coming towards Turnham-green, meeting me—Joseph Brooks said to Isaac, "Run, you b—, run"—Isaac made some reply, but I could not distinguish what it was—I had known them both before for some time—after that expression they took to their heels and ran—they were soon out of the field; I soon lost sight of them—they had been running before, and then they stopped, and then ran again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Mill-hill, Acton—on the evening of 19th January, I was walking with my wife from Acton towards Acton-green—we went from Acton down what they now call the Church-road, a slight bit down Avenue-road, and turned round by Petherton Villa on the left, then round a lodge that used to belong to Mrs. Smythe (the lady to whom the estate belongs), then along a footpath by the top of the market gardeners' ground—the footpath leads right past Cumberland Villa towards Acton-green (<hi rend="italic">referring to a plan</hi>)—there is a narrow part of the road near Cumberland Villa where there are four posts; as I was going through those posts, I saw a man standing there leaning on the muzzle of a gun—I was on the footpath, and ht was standing not half a yard off the foot<lb></lb>path, to the left; my wife was on my left, and she could have put her hand and touched him—he was dressed in a dark coat, and appeared respectably dressed, as a man generally is after his day's labour; they were not working clothes, not so far as his coat was concerned—it was a very dark night—I do not know either of the prisoners, I never saw them to my knowledge—what I particularly observed was the gun—I could not positively say whether I should know the man again, he appeared to have something like hair under his chin, and something flat on his head, I thought it was a flat hat—with regard to the countenance I could not speak, it was such a dark night—I know Chapel-place, Back-common, Turnham-green—a person coming from Chapel-place to Petherton Villa would pass those posts one way; you could do it another way, but that is the nearest—I think those posts are between half and three-quarters of a mile from Chapel place—it was, as near as I can possibly guess, not a quarter-past 8 when we passed that place, allowing a quarter of an hour to walk there from the town of Acton; it was between 8 and a quarter-past—it was not over a quarter-past 8.</p>

I am a builder, and live at No. 1, New-palace, Acton—on the evening of 19th January, I was in company with James Edwards, going from Turnham-green to Acton—we passed the lodge near the corner of the Avenue-road, a short distance from Petherton Villa—we came along the footpath, past Cumberland Villa—the lodge is at the corner of the path—it was from twenty minutes to a quarter to 8 when I passed the lodge—I know that, because it was 8 o'clock when we got to the White Hart at Acton—we went straight from there up the Avenue-road, and it would not take us more than ten minutes to go from there—as we approached the lodge I saw two men standing under the trees at the side of the road—there is a ditch behind the trees—the men stood looking towards us as we came up to them—Edwards spoke to one of the men and said, "Good night," and he answered, "Good night," in a very gruff sort of manner—the other man was behind the man that answered, but as we approached he "<hi rend="italic">dis<lb></lb>persed</hi>;" he went into the ditch and left the other man—I was within three yards of the men—I noticed that the man that Edwards spoke to, and who answered him, had got his coat buttoned up very close to him—it appeared to me to be a sort of brown coat, I don't think it was a black coat; it was a dark coat; it appeared to be a coat which mortar had turned—mortar will turn a coat, and I thought it appeared to be a coat of that description—the man resembled the prisoner, Joseph Brooks.</p>

I forgot it was there"—I examined the gun, I put my little finger into the muzzle as I took it from the bed, and I said, "This gun has been recently discharged"—the muzzle was quite greasy, and my finger was quite black from the powder, the barrel was quite cold—I looked at the nipple; there was no cap; the cap that had discharged the gun was off, but I should judge from the smell of the nipple that it had been very recently discharged—the prisoner did not make any observation when I said the gun had been recently discharged—he treated the matter very</p>

               <p>lightly; he laughed in dressing himself—after he had pulled his stockings on, the bed and bed-clothes were all thrown over together, and in turning them back the prisoner took up the corded jacket that he now has on, by the bottom part, which caused the pockets to be upside-down, and from the jacket pocket fell a powder-flask, which he endeavoured to conceal with the bed-clothes—it fell on the bed—I put my hand over, and said, "What is that?"—Sergeant Byden, who was in the room, took it up, and said, "It is a powder-flask"—I asked Joseph where he had been that evening—he said nowhere at first; he afterwards said he had not been out since he returned from his work about six o'clock—that was while he was dressing him<lb></lb>self—I then took him down stairs where Scotney was with Isaac—and then, in the presence of both, I repeated the charge I had made, of shooting con<lb></lb>stable Davey—Joseph repeated that he had not been out, and Isaac said the same, that he (Isaac) had not been out, and that his wife knew it—I believe Joseph said that the gun had only been taken out of pawn that evening, and Isaac's wife said, "Yes, Jane Lake fetched it out; she and me went to Ham<lb></lb>mersmith, and only got it out this evening"—we took the prisoners to the station at Hammersmith—I went back to the house several times afterwards, but I could get no admission till Saturday the 24th; the house was shut up—on the 24th I looked in a box under the bed in Joseph's room—I had seen that box when I was there on the night of the 19th, and had looked in it—on the 24th I found this coat in the box—I had seen that same coat on the 19th, but did not take it then, not being aware of any reason for doing so—I found a quantity of shot in the pocket, and loose shot in the box—the shot was taken from the pocket by Inspector Scotney, and in the right-hand pocket I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) rolled up in this handkerchief—it was in the same pocket from which the shot was taken by Scotney—some of that shot was given to Mr. Lingham—there were also five copper caps in the box.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity of shot was taken from the pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About an ounce and a half—there were about a score of loose shot besides in the box—it was while I was gathering them up from the box, that Scotney put his hand in the pocket, and took the shot from there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Cambridge-villas, Hammersmith—the prisoners were employed by me at a building in Park-road north, Acton—I did not give Isaac any instructions with respect to the constable Davey; I told him to see a policeman, but not that individual policeman—I told him to tell a constable just to look round the building during the night—that was on the Monday afternoon previous to the murder, just a week before—I did not, to my knowledge, speak to either of the prisoners about it after giving that direction—I afterwards saw the constable Davey; neither of the prisoners were with me then—I had some conversation with him—I did not afterwards tell Isaac that I had seen Davey—my premises are about from thirty to forty yards from Mr. Saunder's place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor—I prepared the plan pro<lb></lb>duced—I know Chapel-place, Turnham-green—from there to the posts near Cumberland-villa the distance is 5 furlongs 11 yards, and from the posts to Petherton Villa is 2 furlongs 198 yards, going up the footpath north wards—it is 111 yards short of a mile from Chapel-place to Petherton-villa—the footpath through the posts is the shortest way, keeping the path; it is almost a direct line—I know Mr. Saunders' premises in Park-road North—the distance from there to the ricks in Bollow-bridge-road, is 260 or 270 yards, going southwards down Park-road North, and across the fields—to do that you would have to get over a hedge—it is a very scanty hedge, it is hardly to be called a hedge; there are gaps, and there has been a footpath through it in several places—it may be used very easily.</p>

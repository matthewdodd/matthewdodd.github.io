On the 13th of April, I met the prisoner in Shepherd-street, Oxford-street, and we went together - he desired me to pay for the room, as he had no silver. I had two half-crowns and two sixpences, after paying 1 s. for the room, and I then had the money in my hand - he was then in the room and could see it - he proposed to stop all night. I consented, and he said I had better go and ask how much the room would be for the night. I was partly undressed; but I went down. I had taken my gown, pocket, and shawl off, and put the pocket into my bonnet. I came up again, and told him 3 s. He said,</p>
               <p>"Poh, poh, nonsense, I will go down, and speak to the mistress." He went down, and met the servant on the stairs, and said</p>
               <p>"Is that the lowest?" - I heard her say,</p>
               <p>"Here is my mistress." I then heard him run out. I went up stairs to put on my clothes, and found the money gone. I saw him on the Saturday week at the office. I had not seen him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long has your husband been dead - A. Twelve months and a fortnight. I was married at St. John's, Westminster; I did not accost him, but he accosted me; he said he had no silver till he got change, and he would then return it.</p>

            . I am an officer; I saw the prisoner on Saturday the 24th of April. The witness had told me of her being robbed, and described the man. I charged him with it, and he said he was innocent; I asked why he ran away; he said he had no money, and wished to bilk them; I did not detain him. I afterwards went to his house and pushed the door open, and said I had a charge of felony against him; he said</p>
               <p>"About that girl?" he then said he did not rob her, but was as innocent as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to his house more than once - A. Yes; several times; I called at last, and said I had a charge of felony against him; he confessed that he had been at the house, and that he ran away, but did not wish to rob the girl.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl; I was at the house on this night talking to the landlady, when the question was asked about the price of the lodging; I knew the prisoner perfectly well; I saw Mrs. Hunt with the shawl thrown over her shoulders; she went up stairs again, and I heard her speak to him, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Poh, poh, nonsense." He came down, and the servant said,</p>
               <p>"Here is my mistress" - he then ran away, and Mrs. Hunt came down and said she had been robbed of 11 s.</p>

               <p>"Will you take a walk with me." I said,</p>
               <p>"I have very little money, I have but half-a-crown, if you will take that and pay for the room, I will." We went into the house, and she paid for the room; the servant came, and she asked the price of the room for the night - she said 3 s.; I said it was too much, and she said,</p>

               <p>"Go down and ask my mistress;" and I went, and as I did not wish to be seen with the females who were there, I went out. I heard somebody say</p>
               <p>"That is the man, stop him." When the officer came to me he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you recollect being with a person in that street." I said</p>
               <p>"About that girl;" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, the girl you robbed." I said</p>

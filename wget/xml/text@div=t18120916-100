               <p>WILLIAM WILKINS. In November, 1810, I had a house, <placeName id="t18120916-100-crimeloc563">No. 37, Upper Berkley-street, in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you occasionally sleep in the house - A.Either me or my servent hardly ever missed sleeping there, for protection to the house. I now reside in Edward-street, Cavendish-square. This house, in Upper Berkley-street, I generally let furnished. It was uninhabited at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. On what night was the house robbed - A. On the 7th of November, 1810. On the morning of the 8th we discovered it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 7th did you sleep in it - A. No, nor my servant. I intended to sleep there again, but on that night it did not suit my convenience, and it was left without protection. I believe the other man that was tried for this burglary was Thomas Robinson, he was capitally convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. On what time, on the 7th, were you at the house - A. About half after eight in the evening; it was then dark.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you leave the house secure - A. I did. I double-locked the door. My house was then safe. On the next morning I went to my house at half after seven. I received information that it had been robbed. I went and found the door a jar, and the people that surrounded the door went in with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Altogether, what did you lose - A. A carpet, four feather beds, seven blankets, two counterpanes, and six window curtains.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value - A. The value to me, altogether, was seventy pounds.</p>
               <p>JOHN FARR. I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 8th of November did you apprehend the prisoner - A. I did, just at seven o'clock in the morning. It was day-light then. It had been day-light about half an hour then. I apprehended him in Short's-gardens, near Drury-lane. He had a bed upon him very carelessly tied up in a blanket, and seeing it was a new bed, and a new blanket, and he not a porter, it gave me suspicion. I asked him, where he came from. He said, he brought it from No. 5, Wardour-street. Where are you going to take it? To No. 6, King-street, Drury-lane, to Mrs. Glover. I said, you will not take it to Mrs. Glover this morning. I do not think you came honestly by it. I guarded him to the watchhouse. The watchhouse was very full, and the watch were relieving. He laid the bed down on the table. He was sent out with me to go and enquire of Mrs. Glover. He took to his heels, and away he ran. I could not catch him. I never saw him since that morning, until I saw him in Marlborough-street office. I am positive he is the man. I know his father and mother. They live opposite of me, and I had known the prisoner some time.</p>

            . I am watchhouse-keeper. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse by Farr, at the time he mentioned, and the feather bed, blanket, and bolster. These things were claimed by Mr. Wilkins the next day, and they were delivered up in this court, on the trial of Robinson, the other man. He was brought to our watchhouse a fortnight afterwards. I am sure the prisoner is the same person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask Mr. Baxter if he has not been convicted of perjury since - A. No. I have never been convicted of any crime.</p>
               <p>Q.to prosecutor. Were the bed and the blanket delivered up to you here - A. Yes. I am sure they were my property. The bed was worth ten pounds, and the blanket, found on the prisoner, five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty of the charge that is laid against me. I have worked for my father the two years past.</p>

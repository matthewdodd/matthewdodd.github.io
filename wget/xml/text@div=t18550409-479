I know the prisoner—he was formerly in the same employment as myself—he kept the underwriting books, and was aware that Messrs. Boddington were in the habit of drawing cheques on their underwriting accounts—I know his writing—I believe this cheque and the endorsement to be his writing—there is no disguise about the endorsement—I have known him about eighteen years—the signature resembles Mr. Davis's, who is in partnership with Mr. Boddington, and who signs cheques on the underwriting accounts more frequently than Mr. Bod<lb></lb>dington—Messrs.

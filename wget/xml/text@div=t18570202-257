                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). On 8th Jan. I saw the prisoner at the corner of Turnagain-lane, Skinner-street, about 6 o'clock in the evening—he had a large bag, with something in it, which he was carrying on his. shoulder—I followed him to Cock-lane, Smithfield, and there stopped him—I said, "What have you got in this bag?"—he said, "Newspapers"—I said, "Where are you going to take them?"—he said, "To the Post Office"—I said, "Where did you bring them from?"—he said, "From Fleet-street, a man gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a pint of beer to take them for him "—I said, "Do you know that man?"—he said that he did not, but I had better go to the Post Office with him, and look for him, he might see him—I felt the bag, and found that what was in it was not like newspapers, and I told him the account was not satisfactory, and he must go to the station—I took him there, and found the bag contained 116 copies of "Kirke White."</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Robert Benton Seeley, and others, publishers, in Fleet-street. I have known the prisoner several years—he has been in the book trade—these 116 copies of "Memoirs of Kirke White," in sheets, is the property of the firm—it is worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not seen the prisoner on 8th Jan.—we received these sheets from the printer the day before—they were placed in the passage of the warehouse, inside the folding doors—I examined our stock when the officer called, and missed exactly 116 copies—we very seldom sell them in quires to the trade—I am certain we had not sold these.</p>

I know these parcels, I received them on Wednesday, 7th Jan., from Bailey, the printer; they were put in the passage, within the folding doors—I know these, they are the same bundles—we have examined the stock since, and 116 copies are gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the morning of the day I was taken, I went to St. Katharine's Docks, and waited there nearly the whole day; I did not happen to get called on—I returned home, and on the way I thought I would take a walk round the City; I went towards Fleet-street, and met a man with this bag; I knew it to be a Post-office bag, by the rings on it; he said to me, "Have you anything to do?" I said, "No;" he said, "I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to go on to the Post-office with this;" I went on towards the Post-office with them; he told me the mail cart had gone from the place in Fleet-street; many a time I have earned a few halfpence in going from that place; as I was going on the officer stopped me, and asked what I had got; I said, "Newspapers," which I thought they were; he refused to go to the Post-office; if I had gone there I have no doubt I should have found the man, but since that I have had no opportunity to find him; I know the man by sight, but do not know his name; Mr. Seeley knows that I have laid out some hundreds of pounds at his shop; I used to collect for Piper and Co., Paternoster-row.</p>

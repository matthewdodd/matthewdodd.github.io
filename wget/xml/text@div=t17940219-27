               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in the room at all, or any where in that house where you slept? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your breeches since, or your gloves? - I have seen the breeches, I got them the same day at Guildhall from the hands of the constable that took them, Dawson.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about where the breeches were taken from? - I do not, the prisoner acknowledged to taking the breeches, but he denied the money, as he was coming to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you was an officer? - Yes, because I put him in the Compter; I was talking to him about the three half guineas, and guinea, that he had better bring that forward; I told him that I was sure if he had the breeches, he must have the money, he said he had the breeches, but he had not the money.</p>

               <p>Q. You had told him that he had better bring that forward? - I had.</p>

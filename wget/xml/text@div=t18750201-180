                  </hi>. I am a sub-warder in the Middlesex House of Correction, at Westminster—the prisoner was a prisoner confined there under a sentence of three months' imprisonment—she came there on the 21st December—on. Friday, the 22nd January, she was confined in the punishment cell, which is on a corridor where there are a number of other cells—a number of pri<lb></lb>soners were in these cells—the punishment cell has a place about 6 or 7 feet from the ground for letting the warm air in from the corridor—the other cells in the corridor have similar places opening on to the corridor, and there are also apertures level with the floor for taking the bad air off—the punish<lb></lb>ment cell is part brick and part stone, and the door is wood lined with iron—there is a sort of closet in the cell with a pan to it—the seat is made of wood, and is fixed to the building—there is a gas light also in the cell—on Friday morning, 22nd January, I went to the prisoner's cell about 8 o'clock—I lighted her gas—I gave her her bedding, which consisted of a straw mattress, two blankets, and a rug—the mattress goes on the floor—I left her, leaving the gas alight—I went on to other cells—I was about about two minutes, and then went back to her cell—I did not go in—I put her gas out by turning a tap on the outside of the cell—there is a trap to the door, which is made of wood—I opened the trap and asked her if she was all right, and if she was in bed, and she said "Yes, she was"—I shut the trap and proceeded downstairs to, another landing.—the other prisoners in the corridor had had their beds—I went on to the next prison and put the gas out,. and on coming back again I heard ringing of bells and cries of "Fire!"—that was in about ten minutes—I first went into the prison to inquire where the alarm was, and from there I went up to the corridor where the prisoner's cell was—I noticed very dense smoke coming from the ventilator of her cell—I opened the door—I heard her crying out, and I was obliged to rush back, the smoke was so dense—sub-warder Wilson was with me and she pulled the prisoner out—she was in a fainting state—I noticed fire in the cell and a dense smoke—as soon as I opened the door the fire blazed up from the bedding on the floor—the prisoner was lying with her head on the seat of the closet when I first saw her—I got her some water; she was very sick and faint—Fuller one of the male warders came with assistance after I had reported to the matron—the fire was ultimately put out—the prisoner was taken to another cell in a different part of the prison—I asked her how she had done it—she said "I lighted my pocket-handkerchief and hid it white you passed downstairs and then flared it up to make it blaze, then threw it on my bed; when I found that it did not burn quick enough I undressed and took off my underclothing to make it burn better, and I only wish I had burnt the b—prison down"—I examined the cell afterwards—the bed and the blankets were burnt, and the clothing belonging to the prisoner—I found her clothing was deficient</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the sub-warders at the House of Correction at Westminster—on Friday evening, 22nd January, I heard the alarm of fire and went to the prisoner's cell with the last witness—the corridor was smoky, and I saw smoke issuing from the door and the ventilator of the prisoner's cell—the door was opened—the cell was full of smoke—very dense—the prisoner was on her knees at the aperture where the closet is; I pulled her out by the arm—she was suffocating, and vomited when she was outside—after some little time she said if she had been there many minutes longer she should have been suffocated—I asked her why she did it, and she said "I did it for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, I wanted to see my bed on fire"—she was afterwards taken to another part of the prison, and nine other prisoners were taken out of their cells and removed because of the smoke—I went into their cells, they were smelling very much of smoke, in fact the corridor was full of smoke—the windows had to be taken out so as to let in as much air as possible—the window of the prisoner's cell was broken to let the air in there—this corridor was the top tier of the building.</p>

I am one of the warders at the House of Correction—I heard the alarm of fire and went to the prisoner's cell—the door was Shut when I got there—I opened it but had to shut it immediately, the smoke was so dense—I took the window out at the end of the corridor which was filling fast with smoke at the time from the ventilator of the cell—the ventilation of the cell was reversed from the fire, the smoke was going out where the cold air ought to have gone in—after I had taken out the windows I opened the cell door and broke the window—I went in several times before I succeeded getting up to her bed, as the room is 16 feet long—when I did get to the bed I sent it to the other end and put it out as well as I could with pails of water—I went into the cell on my hands and knees on account of the smoke—I put the fire out to a certain extent, and then drew it more towards the door, and then I put it out effectually—nearly all the things were burnt—the mattress was straw with a canvass covering—I did not go into the other cells—I was not present when the prisoner was got out—that was before I arrived.</p>

On the Friday when this matter occurred I was in cell No. 4 on the same corridor on the opposite side, and if I had not been removed out of it in a few minutes it would have caused me my life—I heard cries of "Fire!" and presently my cell began to fill very much with smoke and I had to jump out of bed as quick as I could, and if Miss Sims had not opened my door in two or three minutes I should have been suffo<lb></lb>cated—when I saw the smoke I tried to ring the bell, but I could not get to it, I fell on the floor—I should fancy the smoke came in at the bottom of the door some where—I have not been well since, for I have spit up blood.</p>

I was sent to prison innocently, which of course preyed on my mind. Directly I got there they put me in the punishment cell, and that is why I went on as I did. I went to see the doctor to ask him if he would not do something for me as I was not well, to take me off my oakum and he would not—I did not do it with intent to injure any person.</p>

            . I am a Policeman of the Hampstead division. Last Saturday morning I saw the prisoner in the New North-road, about half past one o'clock, going towards London, with a large bundle on his shoulder - I was in a field, and he in the road; I stepped into the road- he then threw down the bundle, and ran off; I pursued him - he got over some rails, and fell into the ditch; I had called to him to stop before he got over the rails-on his falling into the ditch I got over the rails, and secured him; I asked what he had dropped, and he said a bit of mutton which had been given to him, and he had brought it from St. Albans - I asked why he ran; he said for fear that we gentlemen might stop him, as it was a late hour, and he should not like to be stopped; I got over the rails and brought him half way back - another Policeman came up and I gave him in charge while I went on for the bundle; I found a smaller bundle in a white and blue handkerchief - I took it up, went on further, and found the large bundle which I had seen him drop; he was taken to the station-house - I carried the large bundle there, and my partner carried the other; on the way be stated that he went to St. Albans the day before yesterday, that he bought the mutton of a man who hawked meat, and gave him 5d. a lb. for it - he said there was a pluck and some fat in the smaller bundle, which he had given the same man 1s. for; he said he left St. Albans at three o'clock, and the mutton was conveyed by a country waggon to Finchley - that it arrived at Finchley about eleven, and from there he brought it; I opened the bundles at the station-house - the small one contained the sheep's pluck, some fat, and some rags, and the large one contained two hind-quarters of mutton; I found on his person a razor, a pocket-knife, a duplicate, and a comb; I returned to the spot where had found the large bundle, and near that spot I found this butcher's knife - it is a small knife; there is some fat on it - Mr. Coleman afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200009"></xptr>saw the mutton, the pluck, fat, and rags; I left them all at the station-house, in charge of the serjeant - Coleman came there, but I was not present; he saw all the things I had picked up at High-street office the same evening - I had taken part of them there; I am sure he saw what I had found; I had marked them.</p>

            . I am a salesman, at Smithfield - I have a field in the parish of Finchley, near Hampstead-heath; there are about two fields between mine and the New North-road. I went to the field on Saturday afternoon, between twelve and one o'clock, and found twelve sheep only - there is a shed adjoining the field between that and the lane; I examined that shed, and found some blood and fat on a post, where I suppose the sheep had been hung up to be dressed - the blood appeared as if a sheep had been stuck there, and in a hedge, in the field where the shed was, I found the skin; it was quite fresh and marked like the twelve sheep which were left behind - I brought the skin to the Spaniards public-house, at Hampstead-heath; I left it there- Pegler fetched it from there; I saw it at Marylebone office yesterday morning - it was the same skin; Soper went to the shed after I first went there - I found him there on the same day as it happened; I saw the mutton at Marylebone-office - the knuckles were left on the skin, and we matched them to the hind-quarters; it corresponded as near as could be, and fitted - the tail had some wool left on the skin, and that corresponded; the mutton was dressed as if by a butcher; it was very well done - I do not know the prisoner; there were the marks of the footsteps of one person about the shed - there were no footmarks in the field to enable me to say how many had been there, as people are often walking about the field; Busswell saw the skin at Marylebone-office yesterday.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I went to the shed with Mr. Coleman; I saw some blood in the shed, and found two pieces of rag; there was fat on the post-I found one piece of rag two or three yards from the shed with a piece of fat on it; the other piece of rag was in the shed - one was a piece of canvas, and the other part of a shirt-sleeve; I compared the piece of canvas with one of the pieces in the small bundle; it appeared that one had been torn from the other by the seam - the piece of rag was the top of a shirt-sleeve, and the other piece in the bundle was the bottom part of the sleeve - they are the same quality, and corresponded; they fitted together - one had been taken from the other; I fitted both pieces.</p>

In the evening of the 11th of May, I caught the prisoner in the house, coming down the stair case with a bundle; I asked who was there; she said, a friend. I asked her what she had got in the bundle; she said, nothing of yours. I requested to see what she had got, and she proceeded a little further down stairs, and then threw the bundle down, and tried to make her escape out at the door. I called for assistance, and she was stopped, and an officer was sent for, and she was taken into custody. There were several things belonging to a young man who travels for the firm; the fowl and green baize belonged to the firm. She said, she had not got any plate; but that was what she wanted; she had got these things from the two pair of stairs.</p>

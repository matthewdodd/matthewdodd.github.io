I lived at Calais in February; the prisoner was an inmate at my house there for a considerable time, and so was her daughter likewise—I left France about the latter end of February—she left some few days after me—before I left, she packed up, and had the care of all my luggage, to the amount of fourteen or fifteen packages—I left my luggage in her care—she was to clear it at the Custom-house at Dover, and leave it at the waggon office there, till she saw me or heard from me—I left France and went to Dover—I saw her at Barfreston, in Kent—she gave me a paper there, which was an order for me to go to Dover, to claim my luggage—I went, and found all my luggage there, except a box which is in Court, containing the articles stated in the indictment—she went to Canterbury, and staid till my luggage arrived—then joined me and my family, and we went to Herne Bay together—we did not know at that time what we had lost, not having unpacked our luggage; but still we consi<lb></lb>dered if she had got it, it would be as safe as if we had it ourselves—one box was missing at Dover; that had been sent to London by the prisoner—she did not tell me so; but I had not packed my luggage myself, and did not know what there was till I missed it—she left me and came to London, and after I took a house, and unpacked my luggage, I missed the articles—when she first had the possession of these articles, they were in a rose-wood tea-caddy—we left her to pack them up—I came to London to ask her for them—I found her at 51, Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell—I asked her for my things—she said, "You cannot have them to-night, you shall have them to-morrow"—she did not say where they were till next day—next day she left a note under the tea-board—I have not got it here—her husband took it away—I did not see her next day, for she had absconded from the house, daughter and all—I had appointed to breakfast</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What business are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A carpenter by trade—that is the business I profess—I followed that business in France, and kept a carpenter's shop—the prisoner first came to live with me there, about eighteen months ago—she then passed by the name of Ray—she has had several names lately—I kept a boarding-house at Calais—I believe the prisoner arrived in Calais the latter end of January, or the beginning of February—I do not know why she came there—I suppose it was to see her daughter, who was boarded and educated at my house—I was not in any particular difficulty at that time—I was not about to run away from my creditors—I have no creditors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not write to the prisoner to say, you expected the bailiffs to come into your house daily, to take your goods in execution, and carry you to prison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I declare to God I did not—I never sent her such a message, nor did my wife, to my knowledge; she cannot write her own name—I did not send for the prisoner to come to Calais—I expected her, because she wrote and said she was coming to see her daughter—I did not tell her I was a ruined man, and was in daily expectation of having my goods seized—I never knew any thing was the matter to cause me to say so—I did not say so—I did not tell her she was the only person upon whose assistance I could rely—I asked her to hire a room for me at Calais—I had not room enough at the boarding-house—she purchased a small quantity of furniture from me, and wanted a small room to put it in—I wanted an extra room, and she put this furniture in it, which she bought of me—I hired it for my business—I do not know that you have a right to question me—I had business as a broker, and had not room sufficient to keep the goods in which I bought—I never put any thing in the room, but my in-mates did—I told the prisoner to sell this furniture, which she did—I know she sold it, and she gave me the money—they were sold in the market-place at Calais, in my presence—I never had a farthing—she never gave it to me—I think it is likely she gave it to my wife; it might amount to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you leave Calais in a hurry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not particularly; I came as quick as the packet would bring me—I wanted to come to London—I went to St. Omer, and from St. Omer to Boulogne—I went to St. Omer on pleasure; I had no business in particular—I got from Calais to St. Omer in five hours—I got there very late at night—I left about nine o'clock in the morning—I did not transact any particular business in that time—I bought a few articles of wearing apparel, a pair of boots, a neck<lb></lb>handkerchief, and other articles—it did not suit me to buy them at Calais as I liked St. Omer best—I had no other business there—I got to Bou<lb></lb>logne in about five hours—I made my way from there to Dover when the tide suited—before I left Calais, I requested the prisoner to take care of my goods, and bring them to England—I never promised to pay her fare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not she all along alleged that she received the gold chain, gold seal, and snuff-box, from your wife, after you left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is no such thing; she never said any thing of the kind before the magistrate—there</p>

               <p>might be a word of that sort happen; but I scarcely believe she spoke three words—my wife is now keeping an eating-house at Herne Bay—the pri<lb></lb>soner never came to live regularly with us after she returned—she came to Barfreston, and brought me the order for my luggage—I have never had a house since—I have always been in lodgings and hotels, and different places—she was never in my house at Herne Bay—she was with me about three days, but not three weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you learn she was gone to Pentonville? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Her husband promised to produce the goods at two o'clock in the afternoon, and he never came—we waited till three o'clock, and went to the house, and she had flown, goods and all—the landlord and landlady did not know where she was gone—the apprentice boy promiscuously knew where it was—I did not write to her in Wynyatt-street, just before I took her up—I had seen her about two days before I took her up—she had agreed to go to Graves<lb></lb>end with me before we left France—I believe my wife always paid her fare and expenses—I never received a letter from her when she came to London; and did not know she had arrived, till I went to Barfresto—I <hi rend="italic">judged</hi> to find some one or other there—she never informed me of her having come to Dover—she did not know where to write to me—I wrote perpetually to France, but never could get an answer—I did not knot she was in England—I found I could not get the things from the waggon<lb></lb>office, because they were in her name—she did not tell me so before I went—I did not see her—I wrote for her to come to Dover, but she ar<lb></lb>rived before the letter reached, and gave me the bill—she knew I could not get the goods without it—I did not know she was married till her hus<lb></lb>band came to Herne Bay, and informed me—I did not express any anger at it; I was rather surprised at her not letting me know it was going to happen—the watch was left with me by Mr. Wall, her present husband, as security for money he owes me—I had it from him nearly twelve months ago, or quite—I believe the gold chain and other things were in pawn before I left France—I took them out of pawn before I came away—I gave the money for that purpose, and they were brought out in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner tell you, after you wrote to her to come to Dover, that in order to clear the other things, (you not having paid her fare,) she was obliged to pledge them, to raise the money to go there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She never said such a word.</p>

               <p>Mr. Smith leaving Calais—I cannot tell what month it was in—my mother left in February—she sold some goods for Mr. Smith before he left—Mr. Smith expected the bailiffs to come in—he told me so before he went—he asked my mother to take care of his goods, and bring them to England for him—she agreed to do so, on his promising to pay her fare—the bailiffs came into the house about three days after he went away—be<lb></lb>fore they came, Mrs. Smith gave my mother a gold chain, a silver snuff<lb></lb>box, a necklace, an ink-stand, nine silver tea-spoons, and a gold ring—I cannot tell what Mrs. Smith said—all I know is, she gave mother these things, and I was by at the time—Mrs. Smith said she would rather my mother should have them, than the bailiffs, because she expected every minute the bailiffs would take her to prison—I came to England with my mother this last time; we came to Dover—she brought some goods be<lb></lb>longing to Mr. Smith, and they were placed in the Custom-house—after my mother came to London, I was living with her, after she married Mr. Wall—I know Mr. Smith's handwriting—I remember my mother receiv<lb></lb>ing a letter from him in London—in consequence of that letter my mother went to Dover, and pledged the materials which Mrs. Smith had given her at Calais to go with—Mr. Smith knew where my mother lived when we came to London—he wrote to her—he was not in the habit of writing very often—I have been with my mother when she has received letters from him—she returned from Dover about a fortnight afterwards—I did not see Mr. Smith till the Monday after she returned—my mother went from Lon<lb></lb>don to Herne Bay;—that was before she went to Dover—she went to Herne Bay at the same time as she went to Dover—she was gone a fortnight alto<lb></lb>gether—she returned from Dover about three months before she was taken up.</p>

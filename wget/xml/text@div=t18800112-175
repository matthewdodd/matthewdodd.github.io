Per fortnight interest, and that they got about 60 per cent. Advanced upon them—Edward Learoyed was present during this interview—he said little or nothing; he generally endorsed what Wilton said, a sort of "Yes" or "No" to anything that was put to him—I asked Dunderdale how it was that they were pawing goods in this manner, and did he not know what it would lead to—he said "Well, I have nothing to do with it; I am simply the buyer, and that is all I have to do with it"—he subsequently said that they were put there for a very short time, just to get a little money, and then they would redeem them again—after Wilton's arrest I saw him in prison and asked him for a copy letter-book containing particulars of pledgings to the parties in London—he said "I cannot do with your coming down here asking me question now; Mr. Armitage, the solicitor, is my father confessor, I will tell him every<lb></lb>thing and he can tell you what he likes"—before this partnership Wilton was in the colonial trade, and he told me he had failed in march, 1878, and paid his creditors 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound; he did not say whether he had his discharge.</p>

               <p>the time of his arrest he answered me every question I put to him, I believe fairly and straightforwardly—I believe that he did not conceal anything form me—I have ascertained the amounts for which the goods were pledged, but I have not ascertained the value, except that the prices were the in<lb></lb>voice prices, except in one case wilton told me that he put 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a yard on some portion of goods that Mr. Cacuhai had—I presume those were goods going to the paris market—about 60 per cent. was advanced upon them—afther Learoyed joined the firm the business was carried on under the name of Learoyed, Wilton, and Co.—both before and after Learoyd jained, the firm of phillipine, pellissier, and Co. were in the habit of discounting the foreign of bills of the firm, and to a considerable extent—there were legitimate transactions of considerable magnitude between then—that firm failed about march, 1879—the defendant's firm by that failure sustained a loss of 2,256<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but we cannot make out a claim against the trustee for more then half—wilton gave us those figures; they were taken out of the bill-book—I should say it is a more difficult matter to get foreign bills dis<lb></lb>counted in England than English bills—I have got everything the defendants gave up to me; there are some bankers' books, cheques, and so on—I find that all the sums obtained by pledging were legitimately paid in to the banking account of the firm; the pass-book shows that—I should take it, from the books, that the repayments were made in a legitimate way by cheque, but I have nothing particularly to prove it—Wilton told me that at one time they had a business in Genoa—I can only trace 467<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of goods sents to Genoa—he told me that some samples were sent to France, Italy, and Belgium—Mr. Wallker is one of the principal creditors—I have not seen him hare; he want over to Paris with Wilton at the time of the failure—I don't know that Mr. Walker has declined to have any<lb></lb>thing to do with this prosecution; he voted for it at the statutary meeting—he offered to be bail—I don't know how the goods were pledged at the Magasin Generale.</p>

Walker would renew, it had noting to do with these goods—on 21st August I advanced 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was a renewal—on 28th August I advanced 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on goods that came from Crossland's; on 2nd September 594<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on goods from Judd and Son, Robshaw, Thackeray, and Ward and Son—on 13th September 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on goods from Benn, Staple<lb></lb>ton, and Co., Liddell and Brierly, C. and J. Hurst, and Hall and Dyson—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are documents which I received from Wilton and Co.—my commission on the advances was from 3 to 5 per cent—in round numbers, since May, if I had all that was due to me, it would be about 377<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not hold any capital at Wilton's disposal on 27th August, 1879—when I made the advance I received a memorandum, and the original invoices and the transfer orders, and on the receipt of those documents and the goods I gave my cheque.</p>

I have been in dustiness in the City For some time, and have had frequent dealing in advancing money on goods Consigned to merchants of high standing and respectability—it is no un<lb></lb>usual thing for merchants to require temporary advances on goods consigned to them for sale; I believe it is very common—I never imagined that there was anything wrong about the dealing with these goods, if I had I should have ceased to have any dealings of the kind—I frequently advanced money on the goods that were sent to Paris before the loans were repaid—the arrangement was, that on the arrival of the goods in Paris the bills they gave me would be taken up—they were to be met through my bank—in no case were the goods given up first—the dealing I had with this firm in no way practically differed from the dealing I had with mer<lb></lb>chants of the highest respectability—I knew nothing of the value of the woollen goods, except from the invoices—all the loans were for short times—generally speaking the goods were redeemed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the police. By desire of Mr. Powrie, I was concealed with him in a room over the back parlour, above the shop, where we had command of his shop about a quarter or twenty minutes after eleven o'clock, on the night of the 26th of April—the prisoner had been pointed out to me—about a quarter after four, I heard the lock go leading from the bake-house to the shop—I heard the turning of a key in the lock—I saw the prisoner go into the shop with a pot with a candle stuck into it—I saw him turn round into the parlour under where I was—I lost sight of him for about seven minutes—I then saw him come into the shop and try the desk, which was placed against the window—he could not open that—he then opened a drawer, and took some biscuits from it, put some into his pocket, and commenced eating them—I went round to the side door to secure him—I was without my boots—I took him into custody in the shop—I told him I belonged to the police, that he had been suspected of robbing his master some time, and must consider himself in my custody—he commenced break<lb></lb>ing the biscuits and putting them into his mouth—he said he would be d----d if he would be accused—I took him into custody—I found the shop-door open, and received a pair of pincers from Mr. Powrie—I examined the door, and saw this end of the key projected about one-eigth of an inch through the lock, so that it might be turned, and by the constant application of something the key was worn away.</p>

               <p>this case—I gave evidence, and he was remanded on it—I made a depo<lb></lb>sition in the case, and signed it, but it was not transmitted here—the Magis<lb></lb>trate did not commit, and the prosecutor was so surprised that he went back and made farther application, and was ordered to prefer an indictment—he felt dissatisfied that the prisoner was not committed on the burglary—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor followed me down directly—the biscuits were put into a bag, when I took them from the prisoner—he was going to return to the bakehouse when I stopped him—probably he heard me coming down stairs—I had my shoes off, but I made a noise getting down so quick—I met him at the bakehouse door—the biscuits were in his waistcoat pocket—Mrs. Powrie afterwards came into the shop, as there was a noise—the prisoner began to get very violent—he said he would bed—d if he would be accused, and spoke very loud—no conversation took place between her and him—there were some words passed on Mrs. Powrie's part—what they were I did not attend to—she was very much agitated, and I had a great deal to do to keep the prisoner quiet, as he wanted to go down to the bakehouse—he said at Worship-street that he wanted some oil for a lamp—he did not say so that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Finsbury-place, St. Luke's—the prisoner was in my employ for nine or ten months—my parlour is quite away from the bakehouse—it was the prisoner's duty to attend to the bakehouse from half-past eleven at night, till the following morning—he had no right in any other part of the premises—my desk is next the shop window—I frequently kept cash there—on the night of the 26th, I watched with Brannan, and while waiting we heard footsteps coming up the stairs—I then saw the prisoner come into the shop—he had no right in the shop—he opened the door into the shop—I positively swear it was locked over night, about half an hour before we went to watch—after the prisoner had been secured, I went to the door, between four and five o'clock in the morning, and found it open—I had left the key inside the lock, on the shop side—a portion of the other end projected through the key-hole, and it had been turned from the outside—after the prisoner came into the shop he went into the parlour, as I suppose—we lost sight of him in that direction—he then came into the shop, went to the desk, and appeared to try to open it with both hands, but it was locked and he could not—he then went to several drawers, opened them, and took out these biscuits—I produce a pair of pin<lb></lb>cers which my wife gave me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you give information against the prisoner your-self? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I had assistance to detect somebody who I knew robbed my place—I have known the prisoner ten months—I do not know any of his family—I have been friendly to him, as I have to all my men—I have not fought with him, neither jokingly nor in earnest—I have not drank with him—I might perhaps, on one occasion—I am not aware that he and my wife have been very intimate, and sat together at the same table—I have drank with him on one occasion; it may be two, but I think not—I will swear it was not three—I think I have a recollection of two—I cannot say whether all the biscuits were in one drawer—he opened more than one drawer—we counted nine biscuits originally—I dare say there are not more than eight now, but they are broken—it is not a rule for bakers to eat as much as they like, provided they do not pocket any—I never knew it a rule for them to take biscuits to eat—it was never done where I hate been—a moderate quan<lb></lb>tity of bread is generally allowed to bakers—I lived with a Mr. Adamson</p>

               <p>once—I was discharged—I also lived with a Mr. Lowe—I was not discharged from there—I was never charged with robbing him that I know of—I think I gave him notice to quit—I do not exactly remember—I cannot positively say, at this distance of time, whether I was discharged or gave notice—the shop door was locked in the usual way, by a key—I locked it myself, to the best of my recollection—I know I tried it—I will swear I locked it—when the policeman was sitting in the parlour, I went to the door myself, and locked it—I afterwards tried it—I cannot say where my wife was at that time—she was not with me—I do not know what became of her after I went out, which was about half-past eleven—I left her up then in the parlour, I think—when I returned I found her down in the passage—I am quite sure of that—after the alarm, to the best of my knowledge she was dressed, not dressed to go out, but so far covered that she could not catch cold very easily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—I found this pair of pincers on the step at the top of the bakehouse stairs, close to the door which was opened—I heard a noise in the night, and came down.—I had been in bed previously, the whole night with the servant and my boy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

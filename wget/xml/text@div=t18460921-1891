                  </hi>, Esq. I am captain in the 2nd regiment of Life-guards, and have been so for many years—I purchased this watch in 1834 of Mr. Veyreo in Pall Mall—it was made for me, and is a very curious watch—it has a chronometer movement—I paid 45 guineas for it—I lost it certainly more than nine years ago—I was married in Aug. 1837 and it was lost previous to my marriage—the prisoner was at that time a private in my troop—he continued in the regiment till the Dec. following that Aug.—I communicated the loss to my brother officers and to the company—it was—well known that I had lost a very curious gold watch—I was not in the habit of wearing it when I was in uniform, nor when on parade—I then left it in my room—I heard nothing of this matter till the prisoner was taken—the next time I saw the watch was last Sunday—I recognized it instantly—it had either my crest or my initials on the back, I do not know which—but they have been erased.</p>

               <p>beginning of June in the present year—he was going into a beer-shop which he now keeps, and wanted to raise some money to fit it up—he said to me that he had a gold watch in his possession, but he was afraid to dispose of it—that it had formerly belonged to one of the officers of his regiment, and that he had picked it up on the parade, that it was a very small gold watch, and he would send it me to look at—his wife came with it about a week afterwards, this is it—it was in this bag—it continued in my possession about a month or six weeks—his wife came to me one evening crying, and said she dare not go home without it, as he had sharpened a knife at tea-time, and said he would kill her if she did not bring it back—she went back with it—that is about a month ago.</p>

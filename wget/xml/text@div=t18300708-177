               <p>JOHN SCHOLES. I am clerk to Messrs. Deacon and others. I received this parcel on the 24th of February, 1827 - it arrived by the waggon from Huddersfield; in about two hours we looked for it and could not find it - we supposed they were Valentias from the direction; they were for Mr. Kesteven, in King-street, Covent-garden - it had been put down in the yard, and when we wanted to send it out it was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Are there many persons about there? A. About sixteen or seventeen men; it was an open place - I never saw the prisoner till he was at the office; I cannot say that I ever saw him in our yard.</p>
               <p>JOHN WOOD. I am a manufacturer, and live near Huddersfield. We sent off the parcel on the 20th of February, 1827, by the waggon; I understood it was on the road about four days - the parcel contained Valentias; I have seen some of them since - these are the ends of those I sent.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEA. I have these samples of twelve pieces of Valentias, which I found in a box in a lodging at Islington, where the prisoner was living by the name of Jones - the pieces of Valentia were brought to the office, and Mr. Deacon made a memorandum of receiving them, and these samples were cut off them; I took the prisoner on the 21th of April, 1827, on Mr. McCabe's robbery, and found these things there - he said nothing about them.</p>
               <p>JANE OADES. I know the prisoner. In March, 1827, he came to lodge in my house at Islington - his wife took a furnished room in the name of Jones; they brought a variety of things - he said nothing to me about any valentias; his conduct was always correct in my house.</p>
               <p>JOHN OADES. I am this witness' husband. I know nothing of this parcel.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAVIES. I was at that time an officer, and went with Lea.</p>
               <p>- I am clerk to Messrs, Kesteven; the parcel never reached us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never committed a robbery at all; I know nothing of it whatsoever.</p>

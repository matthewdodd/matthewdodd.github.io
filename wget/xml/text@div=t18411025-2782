                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Blackfriars-road. The prisoner was in my service. On the 30th of September I was out on bu<lb></lb>siness, and when I came home I thought the prisoner walked about as if he had a pair of new boots on, but I did not like to speak to him, as he had not been in the house above twenty-two hours—my lad then told me something, and I told the prisoner that my lad thought he had a pair of our boots on—he said, yes, be had, and he meant to keep them, and he had told <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> of it—I said, "What do you mean by that, why did you not tell me of it?"—I told him to sit down and pull them off—he pulled off one, I saw my mark on it, and sent for a policeman—he then began to shuffle about, and pulled a pair of shoes out of his pocket—he pulled another pair out of his pocket, and put them behind him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Matthews. I recollect the pri<lb></lb>soner going to his tea about half-past six o'clock that evening—he went to a public-house at the corner of the bridge-foot, as he told me—then he came back and said he could not go there, there was no place to sit down—I sent him to Holland-street—I had noticed when he went out that his pockets were very full—I noticed that he had a pair of new boots on, and when my master came back I told him of it—he had riot asked me about taking them, or told me that he had taken them—my master came out and told him he had got a pair of his boots on—he said, "Yes, I have"—my master told him to take them off—I saw him. take a pair of red shoes out of his pocket and put them in the wheels.</p>

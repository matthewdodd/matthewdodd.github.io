               <p>I believe when the trial was here, your little boy was absent, and the Court waited for him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you send him back upon any occasion? - No, I did not, I was in the court, and Haylock came in to me, and put up his hand, says he, here is a pretty mess we are in, now that bloody rogue Blacketer has sent your apprentice away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I desire you Mr. Burley to stand up and get the trial put off the value of an hour? - He came in at that door; and I stood there; he did desire me to speak to the Judge concerning the matter that the boy was sent away; but he laid it on Blacketer.</p>
               <p>Do you know what he swore before the Justice? - No.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Burley; and attended the trial of Kirby and Carr, here the last session; I was out of the way when the trial came on.</p>
               <p>Who sent you out of the way? - Blacketer and the prisoner came both together, and asked which was Burley's boy, I said, there he is; I thought they meant the little boy, they said, no, the apprentice; Blacketer said that; then Haylock told me, that my master was in court, and he had sent out word, that I was to go home for some beef stakes, I am sure it was Haylock that told me so; I was at the Justice's in Litchfield-street, and going to the watch-house, I heard the prisoner say, that Carr ran right plump into his arms; I took Kirby.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether Blacketer did not send this boy home to fetch the bag that the meat was in? - They did not speak about the bag at first, they told me it was about beef stakes; I did not mention how many, but that I was to bring enough for them, and they told me, to mind, and be sure to bring the bag along with me; that was the bag that the prisoner Kirby and Carr left in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you bring the bag? - Yes, along with the stakes.</p>
               <p>Was it produced in evidence? - It was not called for, only my master shewed it.</p>
               <p>Was it the bag they sent you for or the beef stakes? - The beef stakes, and then they told me to bring the bag.</p>

               <p>When Carr ran out of the shop, I pursued him, and cried stop thief; when he came to the corner of the Cock, this prisoner laid hold of him; I am sure he was running then the same pace that he did all up the street; he was running away from me; Sanderson came up to me next, and Mr. Brandy afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you go afterwards to Litchfield-street? - Yes, the next day, and at the watch-house, this prisoner made a bad expression, and said, he ran into his arms.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - B - st my eyes he ran into my arms; I am confident he was running, not walking, and this prisoner told me the night before the trial and several other times, that if I said, I lost sight of him when he turned round the corner; I should have a guinea or two.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of him? - No, only turning the corner, I got sight of him instantly; I gave account at the Justice's in the prisoner's hearing, that I never lost sight of him, and it was after that, that he made me this promise; at the Justice's, he said, he knew both the men, that they were both brothers.</p>

               <p>I am going of fifteen; I remember the time when Carr was apprehended for stealing some meat out of Burley's shop; I did not see him stopped, he was running when he went round the corner, very fast; the prisoner said, Carr came quite into his arms, he opened his arms, and said, he came right into his arms, he did not say with what pace; I cannot say whether he walked or run past the Cock.</p>

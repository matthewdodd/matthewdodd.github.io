               <p>CHARLES HORTON PULLEY. I am a solicitor, and live at Hackney. On the 13th of February, about a five o'clock in the evening, I was passing through <placeName id="t18300527-157-crimeloc854">Dalston-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18300527-157-crimeloc854" type="placeName" value="Dalston-lane"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You knew this to be her husband's house? A. Yes, he lives with her - I should think about the same quantity of turnips had been taken from the heap that was found in the bin; I believe they put them there to feed cows.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What length of time elapsed between your first and second going in? A. Perhaps a quarter of an hour - I went up to Hackney, and back again directly.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Laycock. On the 13th of February I went with the carts; we were coming from Essex - I missed Bishop and Wood at Dalston-rise; there were nine teams in all; I rode back, but could not find the men - I could not detain the teams on the road - I drove them home, and on examining I missed one bag from Bishop's and one bag from Wood's team - I then heard the men were in the watch-house; these are the nose-bags; I can particularly swear to this one - it belonged to Wood's team; the other I cannot swear to, but it is the same as our bags are.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you venture to swear that is the bag that Wood had that morning? A. Yes - I saw it filled that morning; each man has his own bag.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see it again? A. On that day with the turnips it it, and on the Monday.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you notice the particular bag of each carter? A. Yes, and if any other man had taken this I should have known it in a moment.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LAYCOCK. I am the proprietor of the turnips - I know nothing of this circumstance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe these men said they had a right to them as perquisites? A. Yes, they said so.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the Hackney watch. I received the two men in charge, at half-past five o'clock in the afternoon - I then went to the prisoner's house, and found the door fastened; I got in the back way - these are the two bags which I received with the two men; I found forty or fifty turnips in the bin - I saw those under the dresser in the bake-house; I asked the prisoner how she came by them - before she had time to speak, her niece said she had purchased them during the absence of her aunt, and given 4s. for them; the prisoner said she supposed they were brought in to play her a trick to poison her cows, as she had had some pigs or cows poisoned before, and she cautioned the girl to purchase no more turnips during her absence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That niece was there? A. Yes; I should think she was twenty-three or twenty-four years old.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH D - . I was there, and asked the prisoner how she managed to get these turnips: she said her niece bought them during her absence, and gave 4s. for them - this was a little after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the niece say so? A. No. - the prisoner went to the office, and went away; she has surrendered to-day - I had a warrant, but could not find her.</p>

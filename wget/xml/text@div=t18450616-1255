                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 225.) On Friday, the 23rd of May, I was on duty on Snow-hill, and just at the end of King-street, Snow-hill, I saw a small spring cart come out of King-street, and going down Snow-hill—the deceased was in it—he was driving at the rate of four or five miles an hour—he appeared to go very steadily, just out of the walk—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about four or five yards behind the cart, at the time it came out of King-street, going in the same direction—the prisoner was driving that <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was going at a very swift pace, as fast as the horse could trot—he overtook the cart, and went on the right-hand side of it—I should think there was a space of twenty-five feet between the foot-path and that side of the cart—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> ran against the right-hand side of the cart, struck it, turned it over on the side, flung the horse on its side, and broke the shaft—the deceased was thrown out on his back in the street—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped directly—I ordered the by-standers to take the deceased into the public-house just opposite, which they did—I took charge of the prisoner on the spot—he appeared the worse for liquor—if he had driven carefully he could have avoided the accident—I afterwards went into the public-house, to see how the deceased was going on—he was quite insensible—he was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farrier, and live at Isleworth. I was in com<lb></lb>pany with William Temple on the 23rd of May—we had come fam Dixon's, in Barbican—I was on horseback before him—there was no one in the cart besides him—we were going about five or six miles an hour, slow, just out of a walk—when we got to Snow-hill a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> drove against him on the offside, knocked the cart over, and the horse down, and Temple fell out—he never spoke afterwards—I was in the act of looking back at the time, hearing the noise of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and was just in time to see him fall from the cart—the blow had been given—I cannot say whether there was room enough for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to have passed the cart—I should think there was—there was plenty of room where I was, and he was close against my horses—I had been in company with the deceased all day—we had not been into any public-house—we had two pints of porter with our dinner, which I drank most of, and that was all that we had all day—he was quite sober—when I saw him fall, I got off my horse to assist him—I saw him into the public-house, and afterwards assisted him to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you observe that the whole of the near side of the way down Snow-hill was uninterrupted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the deceased was not driving the cart on the off side—he was driving on the near side. I should say—the cart was more on the left hand than the right—I do not know the width of the road there—I should say it is more than thirty feet wide—I did not notice that the road was greasy—the horses did not slip about much—it is stone paving, I believe, not M'Adamised, but I do not know—I have since looked at the cart—the shaft is broken—we came from Dixon's, down Long-lane, across Smithfield, down the hill, and down King-street, I suppose it is—I do not know the name of the street—I am not much accustomed to London, nor was Temple—I knew my way home—he told me to go on gently, and he would follow me, and that was how I came to be first—I did not see how it happened—I saw no gas alight—it was a quarter to eight o'clock—it was quite light enough to see anything that was done—it was a wet evening, and duskish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there light enough to see at twenty or thirty yards what was taking place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, quite—I had two horses with me—I was leading one, and riding the other—I was on the near side, I should think twelve or fourteen feet from the footpath, but this happened more at the corner, where there is a great deal of room—I did not notice the space on my off side, not thinking anything would happen, and afterwards my atten<lb></lb>tion was occupied with my friend's condition—I looked all round the cart, but could discover no mark of any blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at Bartholomew's Hospital when Mr. Temple was brought there—he was in an insensible state, and had a wound on the back part of his head—he lived till three o'clock next morn<lb></lb>ing—he was not sensible at any time before his death—there was not much hemorrhage from the wound—he was bled in the course of the night, for the purpose of preventing undue pressure on the brain, but he continued to get worse—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found a fracture of the bones of the base of the skull—I attribute his death to that fracture, and to a laceration of the brain on the side on which the skull was fractured—there was a considerable quantity of blood shed within the cavity of the skull—it was such an injury as would be caused by consider<lb></lb>able violence to the head—a fall would produce it—he was a very heavy man.</p>

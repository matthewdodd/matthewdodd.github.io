There is a door between the two shops. On last Monday morning, about ten o'clock, while I was in the hat shop finishing an hat, I looked in and saw a boy going out of the shop, and the prisoner following him. I went out after her, and saw the prisoner in the foot-path. I asked what she wanted; she said a pair of silk stockings. I said, come in, my dear, I will serve you; just as I said so two pair of stockings fell from her on the footpath. I seized her by the hand, took up the two pair of stockings, and brought her into the shop, and then another pair of stockings fell from her. I called the maid and Mrs. Walker into the shop, and told them what had happened, and desired them to search her; the maid would not, and Mrs. Walker was very poorly, and was not able. I desired her to sit down in the chair, and then she dropped another pair of stockings. When Mr. Walker came in we got a constable, and under the chair where she sat we found two other pair of stockinge.</p>
               <p>Whose property are they? - Mr. Walker's, I believe; there are no marks on them. The prisoner cried, went down on her knees, and begged pardon.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promises? - No; nor did I make use of any threats.</p>
               <p>Were any stockings missing? - There was a parcel.</p>

               <p>I never was inside the shop till he took me; going by I saw a man and woman. I stopped to see what was the matter, and that man took and dragged me into the shop.</p>

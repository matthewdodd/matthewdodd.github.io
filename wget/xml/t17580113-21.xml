               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner at the bar ?</p>
               <p>Mackarel. I don't know that he stole it, but I saw him about our yard at the time. My master has a little farm in his hands, and the man that manages it agreed with him to thresh in the barn. We gave him leave to lodge in the cow-house, and that evening we lost the afs, and never saw the man after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Mackarel. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the afs again?</p>
               <p>Mackarel. Yes, we found her again. We made inquiry at Stratford turnpike, and about a week afterwards found her at

            . The prisoner at the bar brought a she-ass to me about the 25th or 26th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Guy. I live at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>Guy. No; he asked me if I wanted an ass, and I bought it of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him for it?</p>
               <p>Guy. I gave him a guinea for it. I asked him if he came honestly by it. He said it was his and his brother's.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he ask you for it?</p>
               <p>Guy. He ask'd me two guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say he bought it of?</p>
               <p>Guy. He said he bought it of a woman that goes about the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep asses?</p>
               <p>Guy. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you keep?</p>
               <p>Guy. I really can't say how many, I believe near three-score. I should not have taken the prisoner if he had not came on the 29th of December with three more to sell.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.</p>

On the 14th of February, at six o'clock in the evening, I went to the yard in Fan-street, and saw the woman standing at the corner of a dung-hill - as I approached her she coughed three times, which excited my suspicion - I looked round, and saw Shorey bring a eight-bushel sack out of my stable, and take it into the female prisoner's husband's stable; she immediately followed him into the stable, and said, "Sam, Sam, here is your master;" he said, "Where? where?" I seized him, and said, "Here"- I took from his hands this bag, filled with oats, chaff, and beans, mixed; he said it was the first time - I asked how he came to do it - he then said the woman had nothing for her horse to eat that night, and he had lent it to her - it was worth 20s. I gave charge of them both, and found another sack of mine in Henley's stable, and some hay, which I feel certain was grown on my father's farm. I found one sack full, and another half full of the same mixture in the loft, and am certain that was also my chaff.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you cut the chaff yourself? A. No, but I know it by its corresponding with the rest: I have samples of my own here, and have compared it; Shorey said at first that it was the first time - he afterwards said he had lent it to her. I gave him particular orders not to lend provender, having missed a good deal. I have forty workmen, and had less suspicion of him than any one. I never borrow provender - our stables are both in the same range, but do not communicate - the yard is common to us all. I believe Henley is a hard-working industrious woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SHOREY. Q. Have you not sent me to borrow straw? A. Never. I have one partner.</p>

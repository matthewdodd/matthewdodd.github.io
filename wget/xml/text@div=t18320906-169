            . The prisoner used to do needlework for me - I gave her 6d. a day and her victuals. On the 10th of July I told her I should want her the next day - while she was there my husband, James Donnelly, counted a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, one sixpence, and twelve shillings; he put it into a tea-caddy on the shelf, and said, "I think there is a shilling more than we want;" the prisoner was then laying her head on the table, and appeared asleep; I said to her soon after, "I want to go out;" she said, "Is there any thing I can do, if there is, I would rather do it to-night than come in the morning;" I said, "Here are some bed-curtains I want unpicked;" I then went out, and said I should be back in a quarter of an hour, but I staid for an hour - when I came back I missed her; Dwyer afterwards gave me this money in a piece of bed-furniture which I had left the prisoner at work at - my husband has lost his speech, and the use of his limbs.</p>

             (Police-constable F 151). I took the prisoner in Lincoln's Inn-fields two days afterwards - I told her she had made a foolish job of it, and she must go with me; she said she was aware of it, and the next morning she said, "They have sworn falsely against me, it was 29s. 6d. instead of 30s."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never said so. Witness. Yes she did, as I was taking her from Covent-garden station to the office.</p>

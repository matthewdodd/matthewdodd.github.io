            . I am street-keeper of Broad-street. On the 27th of March, between three and four in the afternoon, I was standing close to the Bank Coffee-house, and somebody called me. I found the prisoner stopped by a man; he was scuffling with him. I asked what was the matter. The man said the prisoner had lead about him which belonged to the Bank. He put his hand in his bosom, and pulled this lead out, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is all I have got." I took him inside the Bank gates, and found two more ingots of lead on him, with the word</p>
               <p>"Bank" stamped upon them; each weighed 28 lbs. I secured him, and found 7 l. 9 s. 6 d. on him and a silver watch.</p>

            . I am clerk of the works at the Bank. I know the lead. When we receive the lead I always lock it up. Nobody has the delivery of it but myself. I gave out, on the 26th of March, eight ingots to the prisoner for one flashing, to be melted into the stone. He would not have to go out of the Bank gates with it. The work was to be done inside the building. He had worked there for more than six months.</p>

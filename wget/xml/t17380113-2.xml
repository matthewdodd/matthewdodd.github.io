               <p>Mrs. Goodman. A little after 6 in the Evening, Dec. 23 I had been a Minute or two out of the Shop, and I heard a little Bustling, so I return'd and saw the Shadow of something in the Shop, and the Hatch at the End of the Counter open. I cry'd out, stop Thief, but before I could get to the Door, the Thief was gone. I went out into the Street, and heard a Noise like the falling of a Drawer. A Gentleman took the Prisoner and brought him back; this is the Drawer, which he confess'd he took out of my Shop, and all the Things mention'd in the Indictment were in it, when he took it away. I keep a Pawnbroker's Shop, but these Things are my Property; I have had some of them several Years. At the same Time, I lost a Bundle of Linnen which I never heard of again.</p>
               <p>Peter Deval I was coming that Night thro' Wide Gate-Alley and heard the Cry - Stop Thief; seeing the Prisoner run with a Drawer in his Hand, I pursu'd him about the Length of this Hall, then I saw him drop it. I did not stay to take it up, but continu'd running after him; I kept him in Sight all the Way, and in Gravel-Lane I took him. As soon as I came up with him, he told me I knew him, and begg'd of me not to take him; I did know him indeed, for he liv'd at a Livery Stable where I kept my Horse, but I told him he must go back to the Place, from whence the Drawer was taken, and I carry'd him back accordingly. The next Day he was carry'd before the Lord Mayor; at first he deny'd the Fact, but at last he confess'd that he open'd the Hatch, and took out of the Shop, a Bundle of Linnen which lay under the Counter, and gave it to a Confederate; then he went in again (he said) and took the Drawer. He impeached 2 Fellows with whom I knew he kept Company, and to them he had given (he said) the Bundle of Linnen.</p>

            . I live next Door but one to Mrs. Goodman. I heard the Cry - Stop Thief, and saw a Person about the Size of the Prisoner go on the opposite Side of the Way. I push'd after him and he dropp'd the Till. I stood by that, while Mr. Deval pursu'd the Man. He overtook him and brought him back, and we carry'd him to Wilson the Constable's House; the Prisoner deny'd the Fact at first, but afterwards I heard him confess it, and he told us he would make himself an Evidence against 6 or 7. The Constable keeps an Alehouse in Bishop's-Gate-Street, and us'd us very ill, and tho' we sent a Messenger to my Lord Mayor's, who brought us Word that my Lord was ready to hear us, and tho' we call'd a Coach to tempt him to go, yet he told us he had Customers of his own to mind, and would not go 'till he could spare Time.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodman. The Prisoner told us if we could go before a Justice then, we might get the Bundle of Linnen, but it would be gone (he said) if we staid till Morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Powel. The Prisoner confess'd at the Constable's House, that he went into the Shop, and took out a Bundle first, which he gave his Accomplice; that upon their urging him to make a second Attempt, he went in again and took this Drawer, with the Things mention'd in the Indictment. We took an Inventory of all the Things that were in it, as soon as we had pick'd it up, and they are the Goods mention'd in the Indictment; I did not know what was in it when I took it up in the Street.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodman. All the Things that are mention'd, were in it when 'twas taken away; they were all seal'd up before my Lord Mayor, and have never been opened till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming past Mrs. Goodman's Door that Night about 7 o'Clock, and I saw a Boy run out with the Drawer, he dropt it, and I took it up; when the Gentlewoman cry'd stop Thief, I threw it down again, so they took me and carried me to an Alehouse. I am innocent of it as you are.</p>

My Lord, I hope you will take it into Consideration, - this young Youth, - he has been disform'd in Communication, People have drawn him into Snares; he never was a Transgression, nor were any of his Family in any Transgression. In the first Place, I desire<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173712130005"></xptr> you will take it into Consideration, that if he has transgressed with other People, - concerning what he said before my Lord-Mayor, it was not with Regard to himself.

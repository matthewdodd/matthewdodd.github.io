               <p>Q. How soon did you miss your things after he was gone? - Almost instantly in one minute or less. I did not miss them things so soon, but I had reason for thinking that something was gone, and it took me some time to examine my goods before I could know what was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. I see there is a cloth coat pawned by Benedict Dalton, and another by Alexander Macklane, were they taken away at the same time? - They were.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he any other business besides that of an old clothes man? - I do not recollect any other business that he has ever followed.</p>

               <p>Q. So that this prisoner is charged with stealing these coats, and taking them to another pawnbroker about six hundred yards from you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then not taking your stock for a month before, and having frequent dealing with him in these fort of articles, will you take on yourself to say that these clothes had not gone out of your shop? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never any quarrel with him? - No otherwise than he used to come to the shop and put all into confusion on purpose to take the advantage of me, and I begged of him not to come asking for money.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, this good man, this prisoner at the bar, he lived in the same parish about six doors from you, and he pawned the things about six hundred yards from you, your stock you had not taken for above a month before, and you had frequent dealings with him in the same article? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of the parish of St. Luke's, Chelsea. Mr. Murray made application to me, and told me that he had lost one or two coats out of the shop, and as such that he had been to one or two pawnbrokers, and I went and apprehended the prisoner immediately, he seemed very angry that I apprehended him as I was a neighbour; he said if I had informed him of it, he would have gone and made it up with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you apprehend him? - In his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why the prosecutor, the prisoner, and Mr. Kemble, are all neighbours? - They are all four neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you found him at home? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner before? - Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew he had been a soldier, and been on the Continent? - Yes. He quartered at my house.</p>

            Had they any tickets on when they were taken away? - They had; the tickets have been taken off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You can safely swear to them coats? - I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to every coat that is pawned with you? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had these coats been pawned with you? - These were pawned the second of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them particularly yourself, could you swear to them any where? - I don't know that I could, if I was to see them promiscuously in a strange place.</p>
               <p>Smith. This is the coat I pawned, the blue coat, there is a hole under the left arm, the buttons are yellow, and a little grazed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You mean to swear to this coat by the buttons being yellow, there is nothing particular in these buttons, and the other things that you swear to is the hole under the arm, because that is very particular. Why it has the appearance of a coat that has been worn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Dalton. This is my coat, I know it by the hole under the arm, and the yellow buttons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had you ever a blue coat before? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q.But you have seen many a blue coat before with yellow buttons? - I have nothing further to say against the prisoner, only that is my property.</p>
               <p>Macklane. This is my husband's coat, I can swear to it any where, here are six buttons on the outside of the sleeve, and it is what they call a slash sleeve; and I was going to clean the buttons, to see if the buttons would clean, and here is one of the buttons brighter than the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - No, it is my husband's coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Is your husband here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this by the flash sleeve? - Yes, it is a very remarkable one.</p>
               <p>Q. And one of the buttons is brighter? - Yes, and the pockets want mending.</p>
               <p>Q. That is an additional circumstance by which you are enabled to swear to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you look at that gentleman's duplicate, it is pawned in the name of a black coat. That night I wanted some money, and I took my own coat into Mr. Murray's, and asked him to let me have some money? He said, he had no money. Says I, then I must go to Mr. Kemble; and I took my two coats, and the rug off my bed, and pawned them at Mr. Kemble's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character, and also Mr. Kemble, who said, he never knew any thing bad of him, but he had heard things.</p>

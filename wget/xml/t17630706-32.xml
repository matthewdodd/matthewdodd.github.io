            . On the 27th of June, between 6 and 7 in the evening, I was going from London to West-end by way of Marybone on foot, about two or three fields from <placeName id="t17630706-32-crimeloc193">Marybone</placeName>

He got hold of me, and began to beat me about the face and head, I endeavoured to defend myself as well as I could; he got me on the ground in a gutter, and beat me as long as he thought proper, my head and face was all over bloody; then he took hold at the string of my watch, and pulled it out, and ran away, I followed and called thief and murder. There was a man lying on the grass about 50 or 60 yards distance, he got up and stared about him, his name is Ellis, I told him what had happened, he looked about and said he saw him; a farmer was riding about looking after his haymakers, he rode down and said he saw the man in a field. The poor man and I ran, some time we saw him, and some time not, we lost him, then we came again into the field where I was robbed, the grass not being cut down, we tracked him about a dozen yards in it, presently we found him lying on his belly in the ditch, the poor man jumped in and took him out; then the prisoner said, I'll give you your watch again; no, said I, you don't though. We took him to the Justice at Hamstead, who sent for a constable and he was secured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with James Shoolbred and another. The prisoner was in our employ—in consequence of something I heard, I desired him, on 5th Dec, about eight o'clock in the evening, to go into a private room—Mr. Shoolbred asked him there what he had to say about the lace sleeves that he had taken from the lace department—he said they were in the drawer—Mr. Shoolbred told his son to search him—the prisoner then pulled out these two pairs of lace sleeves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his trowsers-pocket—they are our property—we gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to the prosecutors in the lace-department. On 5th Dec, the prisoner came and asked me for the lace-sleeves—he said he was going to send them on approbation—I asked him if they were likely to be kept; he said they were—I let him have them—I mentioned it to another young man, and he mentioned it to the firm—at night the prisoner was called in—he said he had them in his drawer, but they were on him—that is not the usual way for sending out goods.</p>

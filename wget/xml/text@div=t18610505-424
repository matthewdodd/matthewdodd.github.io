                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Nor they arms public-house, Limehouse—the prisoner came there on 23d march for a glass of ale—I served her—she gave me a florin—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Out and she left—a Mrs. Wilson came in for her supper beer at the time, and gave me a half-crown, and I gave her that florin in change—It had not been out of my hand before I gave it to her—she left, and came back in about five minutes—from what she said, I found that it was bad—I gave her two shillings for it—I laid the florin by, separate from other money—I gave it to the constable, Bryant, on 15th April, on which day I saw the prisoner again—she came between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, called for a glass of ale, and tendered me another florin—I put it in my teeth, and found it was bad—I bent it in the detector, and laid it on the counter—I said, "it is a bad one, and you are the person that passed me one two or three weeks ago"—she snatched it up, and ran out of the house—my husband went after her, and brought her back with the police—when she came back she said she had never been in the house, and had no knowledge of it.</p>

And I said, "yes, I do; it was the 23d March"—I did not say that I gave the policeman the two-shilling piece the night before—I did not say, "you are very much like a woman that has been here two or three weeks ago, and gave me a two-shilling piece;" I said "you are the person"—I did not state on oath that the piece was marked on the 23d—I did on the 23d march ask you for the change of the two-shilling piece—nothing of the sort was mentioned—I did not say that if you did not return me the change of the half-crown I would lock you up.</p>

On 15th April I saw my wife receive a two-shilling piece, put it in the trier, bend it, and put it on the counter—she said, "this is a bad one, and you are the same party that passed one to me three or four weeks ago"—the prisoner took it up from the counter, and ran out of the house—she had not drunk</p>

               <p>the ale—I ran out after her, and caught her twenty or thirty yards from the house—I took hold of her, and said, "you have passed a bad two-shilling piece to my wife"—she said, "let me go, let me go; I am a poor unfortunate girl; I only came up from ports mouth the day before"—I said, "I will let you go as soon as the constable comes, and I shall give you in charge"—she begged hard of me after that to let her right hand go, which I was silly enough to do—she put it up to her mouth, and the people cried to me, "look at the woman, she is choking"—I looked at her, and she was quite black, and then she begged of me to let her go—she said, "a man gave me the two-shilling piece by the church"—I took her back to the house, and then she swore that she had never been in my house at all.</p>

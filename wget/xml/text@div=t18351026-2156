                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 2.) On Tuesday, the 6th of Octo<lb></lb>ber, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went to the prisoner's house, No. 8, Husband-street—I asked her if she had bought any linen of any kind that day or the night before, and described some shirts with small frills to them, and marked: also some stockings and shifts—she said she had not bought any thing that day—she had not her shop open the whole day, and had bought and sold nothing, nor the night before—I asked her over and over again—she said no, she had not—I told her Mrs. Massey had been robbed of some linen, and she had information that she was the person who had bought it—she denied it very strongly—she showed Mrs. Massey three or four boxes in the room—there was nothing in them she could identify—she asked if she was satisfied—she said she was not, and gave her in charge—I then commenced searching the place, and under the bed, on the sacking, I found one shirt—Mrs. Massey directly said, "That is one of the shirts"—I then looked underneath another bed, between the sacking and bed, and there I found five pairs of stockings, two petticoats, and a shift—in a corner of the room I found a pair of drawers—in the shop I found an<lb></lb>other shirt—we then took her to the station-house—she said nothing to me, nor in my presence, but strongly denied buying these things—that was all she said.</p>

               <p>come and give the key of one of the boxes—he produced two keys—I cannot say whether Dillon received these things the day or night before—the Magistrate did not rebuke me, or express his astonishment, at my keep<lb></lb>ing back the expression she used till the last examination, because at the first the case was not properly gone into—she was discharged that we might get more evidence.</p>

                  </hi>. On Tuesday night, the 6th of October, I went to the prisoner Mullin's house—it is Robert Dillon's house I believe—I have known the house long—Dillon lived there and Ellen Mullins—I have seen them for four or five months—Ellen Mullins attends to the shop, and Dillon also—I found the prisoner there—Stone asked her if she had bought any linen—she said, "No"—Stone gave her a description of the things—Dil<lb></lb>lon was in the shop—we asked him in her presence—he said he knew nothing about it—we then searched—Mullins and Dillon were there—one shirt was found between the sacking and the bed—when Stone found it she began to cry, and in a very agitated manner, said, "Don't tear me from my children'—we had not charged her with this when she said that—Dillon said nothing—I said nothing—I was in the shop with Dillon when Stone found the things—under another bed we found the other things, between the sacking and the bed—she still kept crying—Mrs. Massey gave her in charge—she said nothing beside, "Don't tear me from my children."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The last answer is a true one is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I heard her make use of that expression—I was in the shop—there was nothing else said that I can bring to my recollection now—she said that if she was taken she should be transported—Stone was present—that was the second time we apprehended her—I did not mention that to the Magistrate—it slipped my memory—I was examined about five times on this charge—I never mentioned to the Magistrate that she said, "Don't tear me from my children," but Stone did—it slipped my memory—both the ex<lb></lb>pressions slipped my memory—my evidence was not called for—Stone's evidence was not read out in my presence—I was not in the office till the last time Stone gave his evidence—I think it was then Stone said, she said, "Don't tear me from my children "—I do not think that Stone said, she said any thing else—I was there, and was asked if I corroborated what Stone said—I said, I did—Stone mentioned, the last time, that she said, "Don't tear me from my children, I shall be transported"—Stone mentioned that at the last examination, and it was read out—I corrobor<lb></lb>ated it—we told the Magistrate we found the things between the bed and the sacking—there was no mattress—Stone did not say it was between the bed and mattress—Dillon was taken up on this charge—he was in the house when we first went in—I said, "Well, Dillon, there you are "—Stone was in the back room when I said this—Dillon then went away—Mrs. Massey gave the prisoner in charge—I went to the public-house to fetch dillon, that I might take him into custody—he waited in the shop while we searched the place—all he said was that he kenw nothing about it—he did not nothing—he said he was answerable for what his wife bought or sold—he said nothing more—Stone was present—he gave his wife some keys—that did not slip my mind, when I said that was all he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the Magistrate on the last examination, express his asto<lb></lb>nishment that the speech attributed to the woman was not mentioned before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he did not know it was mentioned before, and if it was he did not hear it—he did not remember any thing being said about it—I will not swear that he did not express his surprise, and rebuke Stone—Dillon</p>

               <p>was taken up twice—the name of Dillon was over the shop—I have seen him in the shop behind the counter—Stone has not been with me—I have seen him there I should think four or five times—I do not know that it was not Dillon that took in these goods—Stone asked the prisoner, first, if she knew a boy named Barlow, and if she had bought my linen that day, fully describing it by the marks—he asked if she had bought any the night previous—that was all be asked her—we went there on Tuesday, and that night she was discharged—I took her up the same night, on getting further information—the boy is not here—I have known Dillon living in that house six or seven months—he appeared as master.</p>

Oh, my God, that ever I should have kept such a shop! "—I had attended on the three previous examinations, and neither Stone nor Harris had said a word about it—Mr. Conant was very much surprised to hear it, for if it had been said before, he must have heard it—Stone did not state that the prisoner said, she should be transported—that was not read from his deposition—the Magistrate was about to discharge the prisoner, when Stone said, she was a noted receiver, and she was then admitted to bail—I am sure Stone said, on the last examination, that he found these things between the bed and the mattress, and on the previous examination, he said he found them under the bed—I have subpœnted her landlady to prove there was no mattress.</p>

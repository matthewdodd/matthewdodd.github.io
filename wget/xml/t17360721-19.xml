I had 4s. and a Dutch halt Crown when I was in Cheapside, and I came directly from thence, no one had been near me but the Prisoner, and I was as sober as I am now. I seized her directly, and never released her, till I had charged the Watch with her, but I never thought of searching her.</p>

I was talking to another Woman in the Street, and this Man came up to me, and said a Woman in a black Gown had robbed him. and says he, I don't see no other in black, therefore I will take Care of you. Whereof I took hold of his Arm, and went with him to the Constable, and turn'd my Pockets inside out; whereof he said, he would lay me a Full-pot I had the Money. I would have strip'd myself, but he was resolved to send me to Goal. <rs id="t17360721-19-verdict103" type="verdictDescription">

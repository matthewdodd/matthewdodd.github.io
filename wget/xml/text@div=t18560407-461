               <p>the houses are connected—you can go from one to the other without going into the street—I am a jeweller—on the night of 16th Feb., I saw my shop shut up at 11 o'clock—the key of the shop was brought to me into the parlour—I myself ascertained that the premises were safe at half past 12 o'clock—I then went to bed—I left no person up—I took the key with me—about half past 6 o'clock in the morning I was called by the police—I came down into the shop, and found the back window in the shop open—that window opens into a small yard at the back—a cushion or squab of this de<lb></lb>scription was there (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the police took possession of it immediately—this was across an iron shutter that partly covers that window—it is two sheets of iron—one hangs on to the top, and the other comes to the half of the window—this lay on the top of the iron, so that a person could not get hurt in getting over—there was a rope with a hook attached to a cistern in the yard—that would enable a person to descend from the top of the window down into the shop by the assistance of that rope—it was fastened to a cis<lb></lb>tern in the yard, and put into this window so that a person could get down into the shop—the rope went over the pillow—I found the shop all in con<lb></lb>fusion in the morning, and various implements of house breaking—there were several chisels and a saw, two sharp pointed instruments like daggen, a life preserver, a dark lantern, and a knife—I missed from the shop a great number of rings and watches and chains, of the value of 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were taken from the cases, and the cases were scattered about—here is one card which was left behind, though the articles on it were of trifling value, it would take a person a considerable time to get them off, the string was drawn tightly, and fastened with strong gum at the back.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Chapel-place, Little Coram-street. The house No. 15, Chapel-place, belongs to me—the backs of the houses between Chapel-place and Marchmont-street are all open—there is a wall between each house—they run parallel—the back of Chapel-place is to the back of Tavistock-place—the back yards meet—I know Stapleton—he took two kitchens at No. 15, Chapel-place, on 28th Jan., he and two females—if he bad stopped there till Monday, 18th Feb., he would have been there three weeks, but he left on Sunday, the 17th, and the females too—he gave me no notice of his intention to go—Price was one of the women—she appeared to be a hard working woman—the other woman appeared to be in the family way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Clark, a porter. I live in the front parlour, at No. 15, Chapel-place. I know the prisoner, Price, she resided in the two kitchens, at No. 15, Chapel-place—she was there three weeks all but one day—I remember the evening preceding Sunday, 17th Feb.; during that night I heard the footsteps of a man—they appeared to go from the yard through the street door into the court—the latest time I saw Price was between 8 and 9 o'clock on the Saturday night—I did not go to their rooms between the Sunday morning and the Wednesday—on the Wednesday morning the policeman went in—I did not see him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the <hi rend="italic">E</hi> division. On 20th Feb., I went to No. 15, Chapel-place; I went to the kitchen, and found this rent book—there was some furniture which has been shown to Mrs. Tomalin—I found this bonnet curtain inside the pillow which has been produced—I found this piece of Orleans cloth in the same pillow that Smith gave me, and this other piece of Orleans cloth I found—I was a draper before I was a policeman—these pieces of cloth must have been from the same piece, and they must have been worn together to change the colour—I found some I flock in the kitchen, in Chapel-place—I have compared it with the flock in the pillow that Smith gave me, and they correspond—the quantity of flock I found, and what Smith gave me, would just fill this pillow case—I did not examine the premises—I took Staple ton into custody about 12 o'clock at night, on 15th March, in Gray's Inn-lane—I had been trying to find him before for five weeks, either I or one of my officers never had our eyes off his dwelling, No. 11, Tash-street, Gray's Inn-lane, from 18th Feb., till 15th March—I was not able to trace him—when I took him, I said, "I want you for Mr. West's robbery; you are also connected with two females of the name of Price; your name is not Price, but Stapleton"—he said, "I know of no one of the name of Price;"but on the road to the station, he said, "I know a family of that name living in Tash-street"—I said, "Those are not the persons"—I was present when this teapot and mug were found in the back kitchen, at Chapel-place—the furniture had then been removed from the front kitchen—I took the prisoner Price on 3rd April—I was watching the Hit or Miss beer shop, in Waterloo-road—I saw Price go in there—I sent a person in, and I saw Price go hastily from the bar, pursued by sergeant Smith; he brought her back in a few moments and gave her to me—on the way to the station she said, "I never lived in Chapel-place; I know of no one by the name of Price or Stapleton"—she afterwards said, "Well, I left him because he ill used me"—she did not mention any<lb></lb>body's name.</p>

               <p>used of all colours—plush is made in a piece—perhaps a yard would make a bonnet—it would depend on how it is made—pieces of plush are made of the same colour, and like every other thing, in thousands.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, E</hi> 16). On Sunday morning, 17th Feb., I went to the premises of Mr. West—I have been to No. 15, Chapel<lb></lb>place—to get to the window, a person would have to go out of No. 15, Chapel-place, to a garden in Tavistock-street, and over five or six different walls to No. 20, Marchmont-street, and if they walked along the wall they would get to the back premises of Mr. West's shop—they would get on the cistern over the <hi rend="italic">chevaux de frise</hi>—there are very high iron rails at the back of Mr. West's—they would get over the <hi rend="italic">chevaux</hi> before they got to the cistern—I tracked the way from Mr. West's window to No. 15, Chapel-place—I observed footmarks from garden to garden, from No. 15, Chapel-place to No. 20, Marchmont-street, to Mr. West's house—I found this pillow lying over the iron shutters, and a rope, which had a hook at the end of it—this rope was fastened to a part of the cistern, and hung over the iron shutter and this pillow, and descended into the shop—I was with Mr. Checkley when he found the cloth and other things—he opened this pillow—it was dosed up when I found it—I examined Mr. West's premises—the door was open when I got there, and one or two constables were there—I took pos<lb></lb>session of these things—here is a dark lantern, a life preserver, check gimlet, and this screwdriver—I traced the steps from No. 15, Chapel-place to Mr. West's—there were the steps of more than one person—I should say of two or three—I apprehended the prisoner Price—I went to the Hit or Miss beer shop, in Waterloo-road, about a quarter before 11 o'clock, this day week—I looked for her, but did not see her in the bar—I saw the landlady coming up stairs, with a candle in her hand—I took the candle from her hand, and went down to the back yard—I found Price there; she was being assisted over a wall by a man—I said, "Fanny, I am a police officer; I want you, for being concerned with a man named Staple<lb></lb>ton, otherwise Price, in committing a burglary at Mr. West's, in March<lb></lb>mont-street"—she said, "I know nothing about it; I do not know any man by the name of Stapleton or Price."</p>

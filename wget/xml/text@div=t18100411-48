             was the last of them; I was alone, he came up by the side of me, I felt a blow on my side; the other persons had passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any other person, in the situation in which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110035"></xptr>he was to you, give you that blow but the prisoner - A. No; no other person was near enough to give me that blow but the prisoner; I immediately perceived my watch-chain, seals, and key, were gone; I called to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. A gold watch key - A. Yes; the seals were gold and the chain was gold.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you perceived a blow on your side - A. It was a blow, I supposed, merely to draw of my attention.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a blow, not a mere push - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a blow to hurt you - A. It gave me pain for the moment; it rather stunned me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a watch - A. I had; the watch held in my pocket; I imagine the chain gave way, in attempting to draw out the watch; it did not remove the watch from my fob. I called out to the watchman; I followed the prisoner; he ran very hard for 50 yards; I never lost sight of him; I was never more than two or three yards off him; he was stopped at the end of the lane by the watchman; he was met in the lane by the watchman; he turned back, and ran up a yard, where, in consequence of his falling, he was taken. I came up to him while he was on the ground, and assisted the watchman in securing him. The chain, key, and seals were never found.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he struck you, when the persons were coming up the lane with him, were they near enough for him to have any communication with them. - A. I should have thought not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your chain and seal since - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark or light night - A. It was directly under a lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the atmosphere - A. It was neither very dark or light.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you are quite sure that you never lost sight of him from the time that you felt him snatch the chain. - A. He was never more than two or three yards before me; I am sure the man I secured is the man who struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. And snatched the chain - A. Yes; I supposed he snatched the chain; there was nobody but him near me to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all see whether the other persons who came up the lane at the same time joined company afterwards with him - A. They did not afterwards; I went one way, and they the other.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Giles's. About half past one, me and another patrol was in Drury-lane; we heard the alarm of Stop thief! I have lost my watch. The alarm came from the corner of the coal-yard in Drury-lane; the prisoner ran down the coal-yard; me and my partner pursued him; we saw him instantly the alarm was given; the prosecutor was following of him; the prisoner turned down a short turning in the coal-yard, where there was no thoroughfare; he was running; we secured him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What charge did the prosecutor make against him then - 
               <persName id="t18100411-48-person530">A. </persName>
            He laid his charge of the seal, key, and chain; he thought he had lost his watch, but he had not; when he put his hand to his waistband, he found his watch remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe in what way, he had lost it - A. Yes; he said the prisoner came and gave him a blow on the side; and he lost the chain at the same moment. This was in the prisoner's hearing; the prisoner said he knew nothing of it; he was innocent. I searched for the chain and seal; I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. This was rather an unseasonable hour; from what you saw of the prosecutor, and the manner of his behaviour, did he appear to you to be sober -

            Perfectly.</p>
               <p>- BAKER. I am a patrol; I was in company with Bellamy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the cry of stop thief - A. I did; I was almost close to the prisoner; I saw him when the alarm was given; he was running, and the prosecutor close to him; I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner ever out of your sight before you secured him - A. Yes, about two minutes. The prosecutor and the prisoner were running; I could not mistake him for another person; the prosecutor said he had robbed him of his chain and seal, and at the watch-house he said he gave him a blow on the side before he took the watch-chain from him; the prisoner denied the charge in toto; we looked for the watch-chain and seals; we could not find it.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ROBERTS. I am the keeper of the watch-house; when the prisoner was brought in; I searched him nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday the 3d of March I left work, about seven o'clock in the evening; I went to Mr. Knight's, an ironmonger in Foster-lane, to purchase a bit of copper to finish my work the next week, and coming up Holborn. I called in a strange public house that I never was in before; I had a pint of porter, and hearing a few songs sung caused me to stop till between twelve and one o'clock. When I left the public house I lit with a couple of young women that I never saw before, they asked me to give them a glass of something to drink, I did so, they took me to a public house facing of Hatton Garden; I stood outside of the door, where there were several more people standing; I took a walk a little way with these two young women and after I left them I went down a turning which brought me into a coal-yard, a man came running towards me. I heard the cry of stop thief, I went to run towards him, he knocked me down, and when I got up the watchman stopped me, and the gentleman accused me of robbing him. I was all over mud, and no one was nigh me till I got up, and then the watchman came and stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Can you be certain that there was no person near him when you were pursuing him, could any person be running to knock him down - A. No; I deny it upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. to Baker. Did the prosecutor appear to you to be at all intoxicated - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner - A. I could not discover any thing in him; he acted very consistent, he appeared to be sober.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character</p>

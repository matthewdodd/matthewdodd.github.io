On Thursday, the 24th of January, between three and four o'clock, I observed the prisoner watching about the door; from information that I received, I went to Marlborough-street to get an officer to take him into custody, and while I was gone this bible was taken away; I suppose I was not gone above five minutes; when I returned, the man that was lurking about the shop, and the bible were gone; I then gave notice to different booksellers to stop it if it was offered for sale; on the 28th of the same month, I was informed that it was on a stall in Piccadilly, I accordingly went down Piccadilly to get my bible; as I was going I met the prisoner, but I did not take hold of him till I was sure it was my bible; I went to see the bible, and returned and took the prisoner into custody, I am sure the prisoner was the man, that was lurking about my shop.</p>

             sworn. I am a bookseller, I keep a stall in Piccadilly. On Tuesday, the 28th of January the prisoner came to me and asked me whether I would buy some books, I told him I could not buy them till I saw them, he told me there was a good bible among some other books, which induced me to go and look at them; I went with him to a pawnborker's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190036"></xptr>shop in Cranbourn-alley, where the bible in question was taken out; he took me to two more pawnbroker's shops in St. Martin's-lane, where there were more books taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. What price did you give him for the bible. - A. I gave him five shillings and sevenpence farthing; he said it was his property (the bible produced).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my bible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As to my being near the stall, that is a fact; I was bred up to the profession I had a writ to serve for a person who had employed me, I was there to serve the process from time to time; Mr. Mudie, says, that while he was gone this book was stolen; Mr. Hayes, says he bought it of me; the duplicates came into my possession from a man who could not pay me; as to my stealing the bible, there is no absolute proof; that they came into my hands, is certain, I did not see the bible at Mr. Mudie's; it is wonderful; just while he was out he says the bible was gone, and I was gone from the door.</p>

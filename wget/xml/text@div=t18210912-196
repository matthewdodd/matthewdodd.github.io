On the 27th of August, I was up stairs looking out of window, and saw a man looking at a Bath stove which stood at the door; my mistress went to the door, the man was gone then, and there was a mob round the stove.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who took it - A. No; I was examined before the Magistrate, and told the truth there - I do not know who the man was, he went away after I missed the stove, he was looking at it, and when mistress went to the door, he was gone - I found the stove up the court by a house, it was not covered over.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you - A. I am going on for fifteen. There was nothing on the stove, I never said that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you run down to your mistress, and tell her the stove was gone - A. No; I did not tell the Magistrate where it was taken; I do not know who dropped it; I did not tell the Magistrate who did. Nothing was read over to me before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. I caution you, you are fifteen years old, and old enough to know what you are about; you must tell the truth, and nothing but the truth; I want to know if you ever said at any place, or before the Magistrate that you saw a man take the stove - A. No; I never did - I did not go after any body or overtake any body, I saw nobody drop it, I did not run after the prisoner; I never told the Magistrate that the prisoner was the man who took it, and that I saw him take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mind what you are about, I caution you again to tell the truth; you will be committed and tried unless you do; I ask you whether you did not swear before the Magistrate that you saw the prisoner at the bar take the stove, go away with it, that you went after him, overtook him, and asked him to bring it back - A. No; I never said it nor swore it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was taken in custody that day - A. I do not know rightly who was the man, I saw nobody taken in custody - nobody has been talking to me about this prosecution - I recollect going before the Magistrate at Worship-street, I was examined, but did not give evidence against the man; what I said was taken down in writing, it was not read over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now boy, let me caution you to speak the truth, look at this (the deposition) do you remember putting your mark to it - A. Not as I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the officer is here who heard the paper read to you, saw you put your mark to it, and while it was being written down, heard the statement which is put on that paper come from your lips; do you mean to say after that, that it was never read over to you, and that you did not state and relate what is written in that paper - (No answer).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know you put your mark to it - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you a pen in your hand - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who has convered with you about this business - A. Nobody; the prisoner's friends nor my master never spoke to me about it - I did not see the prisoner nor any body take the stove, nor ever said that I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You were at the two pair of stairs window when you saw this going on - A. Yes.</p>

            . On Monday the 27th of August, between twelve and one o'clock, as near as I can recollect; a little boy in the neighbourhood, named Frank Groom, told me the stove was taken away; it stood outside the door. I went out, the prisoner was pointed out to me. The stove laid on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go before you got up to him - A. He turned the corner towards Finsbury-market. I think I went about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a man drop the stove - A. It was on the ground when I came up. I did not see him drop it, he stood close to it. I was sworn before the Magistrate, and what I said was taken down. I put my mark to it. I spoke the truth then the same as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him drop it - A. He was stooping over it just as if he was laying it down; it was too heavy for him, he being in liquor. I brought him and the boy brought the stove back.</p>
               <p>Q. What boy - A. Kelly. He got up before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him when the man put the stove down - A. He was with the man before I got to him, he saw more than I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner was drunk - A. Very drunk indeed, I do not think he could carry the stove further than the twenty yards. I had seen the stove at the door an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before the Magistrate</p>
               <p>"I ran round the corner and saw the prisoner drop the stove now produced" - A. Yes, I did say it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why not tell us the truth here - A. I am sorry to see a man of those years -</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by his dropping it - A. He had it in his arms - he laid it on the ground. The first information I had was from a strange boy. I saw a man named Hawkes there - he is a man I would not trust. I said at the time that the prisoner would not have been there, if Hawkes had not brought him. I sent for a constable - the prisoner went away and came back again; the stove is not worth much - there was more valuable things, and a good deal better stoves. I have not seen Hawkes since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Am I to understand you saw him place the stove out of his hand on the ground - A. When I pushed the mob away it was on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him place it out of his hand on the ground - A. Yes.</p>

The prisoner certainly was extremely drunk.</p>

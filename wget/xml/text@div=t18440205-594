                  </hi>. I am shopman to Richard Harris, of Portman-place, Edgware-road. On the 13th of Jan. the prisoner came to the shop, and said, "Send 31bs. of sperm candles, sixes, to Mr. Johnson's, No. 77, Hamilton-terrace"—I tied them up, and gave orders for them to be sent—Mrs. Harris executed the order—she is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Harris. Mrs. Harris gave me 31bs. of sperm candles to take to No. 77, Hamilton-terrace—as I was crossing the road at St. John's-wood I met the prisoner—he stopped me, and asked whether I was going to No. 77, Hamilton-terrace—I said yes—he said he was going to our shop for 3lbs. of kitchen tens, and asked if I should go for him—I said just as he pleased—he said, "Well, you run, and I will take these"—he took them of me, and I went back to the shop—he was brought there by the policeman, with the candles he had taken from me—these are them.</p>

About seven o'clock on the evening of the 13th of January, I saw the prisoner in Edgware-road—I crossed to him, and said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "Some candles"—I said, "Where did you bring them from?"—he said, "Down here," pointing towards Kilburn—I said, "What house?"—he said, "A house down here"—I said, "Where are you going to take them?"—he said, "I am going to take them to a house here, to change; I ordered them in t mistake"—I said, "What house?"—he said, "I will show you"—I walked along with him, and when we got opposite Mr. Harris's he said, "This is the shop"—I went in with him, and he said, "These candles were ordered in mistake"—the mistress and young man said, "Why, you ordered them a little while ago"—he said he thought they were a mistake, for he had given another order for 31bs. of kitchen tens—I detained him while the boy went to Mr. Johnson's to see if it was correct—he returned, and said he had seen Mr. Johnson's servant, who said no candles were ordered there—the prisoner then said he had met a friend, a footman, in Oxford-street, whom he had been in the habit of playing billiards with, and he said, "Will you oblige me by ordering 3lbs. of sperm candles," and he did it to oblige this man—I said, "Who is the man?"—he said he knew nothing of him, only meeting</p>

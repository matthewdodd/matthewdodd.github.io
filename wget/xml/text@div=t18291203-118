On Saturday, the 28th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Tothill-street - my daughter was with me; I have known the prisoner five years - her parents once lived in the house with me; she is a girl of the town - she said to my daughter, "How do you do, Mrs. Robinson? your mother don't speak to me, but I hope you will;" my daughter said, "I shall not" - I went home - she followed me up stairs, and came into my room; my daughter went out for a candle in about ten minutes, leaving her there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire her to leave the room? A. Yes - I do not turn her out, as she is such a character she would insult and knock me down, and my daughter had her child in her arms - I do not think she was at all in liquor; while my daughter was gone for the candle she pushed me down on the bed, jumped on me, and got her knee on my breast, put her hand into my pocket, and took out two shillings - I could not call out, for she squeezed my throat; I got round, and saw her take the cruets, a tumbler, and loaf - she went out of the room; my daughter was coming up stairs - I called out, "Stop her, she has robbed me!" I could not follow her, I was so ill, and did not know where she lived - I told an officer, who took her on Sunday; it was all done in a moment - the two shillings were wrapped in a piece of newspaper; she did not take the tumbler away.</p>
               <p>ANNETT ROBINSON. I am the prosecutrix's daughter. The prisoner did not appear to me to be drunk - she followed us up stairs - I went out for a candle, and on returning my little boy was crying violently; when I entered the room the prisoner was on the bed on my mother, but the candle was out - I lighted it, and took her off; she said my mother had thrown her on the bed - my mother said"No, she threw me on, but I have kept my hand on my pocket;" that is all she said - I then went out for some porter, and as I came back met the prisoner on the stairs - my mother called out, "Stop her! she has taken something;" I called to the landlord to stop her, but he could not find her - I had left her in the room with my mother; it was not my place to turn her out - she went out for something to drink before it occurred.</p>

            . I am an officer and apprehended the prisoner - she denied the charge; but on taking her to the prosecutrix's room she acknowledged having been there, and said she was in liquor; Robinson gave me a glass, and said she took it out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She asked me to go and have some liquor when I met her, and afterwards asked me up to her room; I went home, and heard nothing of this till Sunday - the tumbler was never out of the room, but she said she saw me take it from my pocket, and put it on the shelf. <rs id="t18291203-118-verdict620" type="verdictDescription">

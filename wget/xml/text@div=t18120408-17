Nicholls the officer produced me the things that had been taken from my trunk on the 9th of March.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. On the 9th of March I had a search warrant delivered to me; I went with the warrant to No. 8, Upper Marybone-street; I went up to the two pair of stairs back-room, I there saw the prisoner and the woman that belonged to the room; the prisoner lodged there with the woman that rented the room; I asked the woman whether she rented the room; she said she did; the prisoner was present and heard it. The woman said her name was Robinson; she told me the prisoner lodged with her; I asked the prisoner how many boxes she had in the room; she pointed to two boxes and a hat box; I searched her boxes, the keys laid upon the boxes, I asked her whether them were the keys, she said, yes; I opened the boxes, I found several napkins, the gowns were in a bundle behind the bed; six handkerchiefs were in the box.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any petticoats - A. Not in the boxes. Mrs. Woodward has part of the property, they have been delivered up to her by order of the magistrate. I have the three gowns here, the prisoner produced them herself, they were behind the bed, and six petticoats with the sattin one.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. We understand that part of the property was delivered up to you by order of the magistrate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the articles, how many gowns are there - A. Three, and a petticoat; the napkins and handkerchiefs were delivered up; I can swear positively to these articles, they had been in that box two or three years, I had not made any use of them for that time, and every thing that I lost was from that box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mistress came for me at the House of Correction, and offered to take the sum of four pounds to pay the expences of the Bow-street officer; I told her that I had not got the money, but would consider of it; she asked if I had not got a friend that I could send to to give her the money; a friend of mine went to speak to her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

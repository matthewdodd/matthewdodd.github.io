                  </hi>. I am a glass-cutter. I was in Drury-lane on this evening—I saw the two prisoner in company with another, and saw them walk behind Mr. Watson—Campbell took a handkerchief from the pro<lb></lb>secutor's pocket, which appeared to be a Yellow one, and handed it to Wat<lb></lb>son, and they all ran away; there were three in company—I am certain as to Campball taking the handkerchief—I pursued him—there was a per<lb></lb>son named Neale in company with me—I sent him after Mr. Watson, to ask if he had lost any thing—he said he had lost a handkerchief—I par<lb></lb>sued, and took Campbell up a turning in Drury-lane—I brought him down to Drury-lane, intending to take him to the station, as I could not see a constable—he said, "Do not take me to Bow-street, take me to Hatton-garden"—I took him to the nearest, which was Bow-street—I went up Drury-lane afterwards, and saw the prisoner, Watson, with nine or ten more—I got a police-constable and brought him there, and we saw Watson with a handkerchief in his hand, which the policeman took from him—it appeared to be the same that Campbell received from Watson, but there are many of the same sort.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Drury-lane—I went there—Mr. Hibbert is a butcher, I believe, but the shop was closed—there is a butcher's shop next door—I saw nothing to make me think it was a butcher's, excepting his dress—I did not make any offer about money, it was offered, and I refused—I went to Mr. Neale to know if he would go with me, and we went in company—Neale made the offer and I not heard—I was there all the while—he might have made the offer and I not hear, because he spoke to Mr. Hibbert after we bad been to have something to drink—we went to the public-house after the money had been offered, and I refused it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you went in consequence of some message? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a lad brought a message, and I went to Neale to ask him to accom<lb></lb>pany me to No. 112, Drury-lance—the offer was first made in this court, on Saturday, by Mr. Hibbert, and I went to Neale's Yesterday morning—Mr. Hibbert said, "what case are you in here?"—I said, "Campbell and Watson"—he said, "That is the very case I am here on, come outside, and have something to drink"—he said, "This can all be settled for a little money"—I said, "I am bound in a bond of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this"—I would not listen to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Doane <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the first of this took place in this Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes' and the first I heard from Hibbert was about this offer—I had not then ben to his shop—he asked us to come Yesterday—I said, "I do not think I can"—he give us his name. and I think he told us what he was.</p>

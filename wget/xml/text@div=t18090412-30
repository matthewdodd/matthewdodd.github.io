            . I am shopman to Mr. James. On Thursday the 21st of March, between four and five o'clock, Mr. Bingham gave me information. I saw the prisoners going down Middle row; when I got near Jordan I saw a bulk under her apron, I caught her by the arm, and said, now, ma'am, walk back; she immediately replied, I did not take it, a woman in a beaver hat gave it me; I brought Jordan back. She took from under her apron a piece of blue printed cotton; I took it from her. I saw the person with a beaver hat on standing near the prisoner Jordan; I put my hand on

                  </hi>. I am foreman to William Austen, who is building East<lb></lb>bourn-terrace, Paddington. He finds the lead and other materials—they are his houses—on the morning of the 25th of Jan. I observed one of the houses had been stripped of the lead gutters, which were fixed to the house—I had seen it safe three weeks before—a portion was left—the constable showed me some lead, which I compared with what remained, and it fitted in every respect.</p>

On the 25th of Jan., about six o'clock in the evening, I was at the back of Eastbourn-terrace, and heard something in the building—I stood for a minute or two, and heard something very heavy fall a few yards from me like lead—I got down on the ground that was dug out, went by the ladder, and saw the prisoner coming out of the second floor window on the ladder—I stood back against the doorway—he came down, looked round, stopped and picked up something very heavy and dark, put it on his shoulder or head, and walked past me round the building—I was close after him, within a yard or two—he got out into the road—I followed close behind him, and was going to take him by the collar—he heard me kick against a stone or brick, turned round, dropped the lead, and ran—I picked it up.</p>

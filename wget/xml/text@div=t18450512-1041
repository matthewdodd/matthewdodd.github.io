On Saturday, the 5th of April, I went on board the ship, and found the after cabin door broken open, by apparently an iron instrument—the lock was forced—I missed nothing from there—in one of the side fore-cabins I had a chest of drawers—the lock of one drawer was burst—I missed rwo gold watches from the middle drawer, and from the top drawer I missed a bag, containing thirty-eight dollars—there were marks on several of the dollars—I have since seen four, one that appeared to have a mark on it resembling the dollars I missed—I cannot say there were marks on all—I have seen nothing of the watches.</p>

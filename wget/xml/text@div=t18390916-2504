                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Red Cross-street, City, About ten o'clock on Saturday morning, the 24th of August, I was called in by the prisoner to see a child—the prisoner told me the child had fallen from a chair, and struck its head against the bed-post—I found the child in an insensible stupefied state, screaming out on being removed—I ob<lb></lb>served a contusion on the left temple, and a slight laceration of the cheek<lb></lb>bone, and a contusion on the right temple—it remained in that state till about nine o'clock—the contusions appeared to be recent—I saw it from time to time in the course of the day, and about nine o'clock in the evening it partially recovered its senses—it was about two years and a half old—I saw it next morning—it was much in the same state—it had passed a very restless night in that insensible state—it continued getting worse on Sunday, and I saw in the evening that it was getting weaker—it died on Monday night, about twelve o'clock—I examined it after death, on the Wednesday, the day of the inquest—I examined the head—I dis<lb></lb>covered opposite to where the bruises were on the temple, between the scalp and the skull, extravagation of blood corresponding with the bruises, and on the left side of the head I observed another quantity of extravasated blood under the scalp on the bone—the others were on each side the tem<lb></lb>ple—on cutting through the bone, and removing the scull-cap, opposite to where the extravagated blood was, I observed very extensive inflammation opposite the bruises on the temple—the bone was not at all fractured—there was inflammation of the membranes of the brain, with effusion of pus, or matter, and serum—I likewise observed an extravasation of blood on the surface of the brain—there might probably be an ounce altogether on the surface, and between the hemispheres of the brain—those were all the appearances about the head—the extravasation of blood on the brain would, operate as a pressure, and would be sufficient to account for all the symptoms, and produce death by pressure on the brain.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not that the way apoplexy destroys life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—by a vessel breaking, and the pressure of blood on the brain—the inflamma<lb></lb>tion and the effusion of pus and serum would likewise produce pressure—pus is one of the terminations of inflammation—there must have been pre<lb></lb>vious inflammation there—inflammation sometimes terminates in suppura<lb></lb>tion, very quickly—I do not think all the symptoms could have originated the day before I saw the child—I consider the injuries might all have been produced at the same time—that is probable—I ascribe the extravasated blood to injury recently received.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>originated from a fall; I saw the situation of the chair and the bed-post, and noticed it, and supposed it probable the blow on each temple might have originated in that way, but the blow at the back of the head, on the left parietal bone, I was totally unable to account for—a blow inflicted three weeks before might have assisted to account for the appearances; but, in my judgment, they were owing to recent injuries; that is mere conjec<lb></lb>ture; I cannot imagine that all the injuries I saw could have been pro<lb></lb>duced by one fall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Chiswell-street. I saw the body of the deceased the day after the head had been opened by Mr. Ponder—I examined the body also—I conceive death must have arisen from some blow it received on the back part of the head, from the extrava<lb></lb>ated blood I found—I mean some external injury, coming in contact with some very hard substance—there was slight extravasation of blood on the left temple, and the membranes of that part were considerably inflamed—I did not observe any extravasated blood on the right temple, and there was very slight inflammation—the stomach was in a healthy state, and the lungs and heart—I have no doubt it died from the injury on the head—I agree with Mr. Ponder generally in the judgment he formed.</p>

I know the prisoner—he is a boot-maker—I saw the child in question when it came to the house with the mother, Sarah Martin, about five weeks before its death—it came to live in the same house as I did—the prisoner and Martin occupied the second floor back room—she was not married to him—I have heard noises in their room—I heard what I supposed to be the child beat against the floor, or thrown against the wall but I did not see anything—I heard the child first beaten with a strap—my room was underneath theirs—I heard the prisoner call the child a d—d stinking little b—r two or three times—the mother was not at home at the time—the child cried as if its tears were stifled—I think it cried continually from five o'clock to about half-past seven—that was on the 5th of August—it was three weeks before the child died that I heard it, as I supposed, knocked against the floor several times—I asked to see the child next morning, but did not—I heard it beaten afterwards, but it did not cry so much as it did on the 5th of August—I did not hear any blows given to it on the 24th—I heard it crying before eight o'clock that</p>

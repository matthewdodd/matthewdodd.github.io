I was called up a little after six o'clock on that morning, and asked if we had lost any meat. I then went into the slaughter-house, where the meat was the night before, and missed a quantity. I then went to the watch-house, and saw the meat tied up in a bag in Furzman's possession - there was a fore-quarter, a shoulder, and a neck of mutton, and a fore-quarter of lamb. I knew it to be my master's by its appearance - I had cut up the lamb myself, and my master cut up the mutton - it was worth about 15 s.; it was taken to the watch-house, and then returned to my master.</p>
               <p>JESSY WILLIAMS. On Wednesday morning last, about five o'clock, I was taking a walk, and saw the two prisoners loitering about the corner of Lion-street, which joins the market. I determined to watch - I went on this side of Bloomsbury-square, and down Southampton-street, then turned to the right, and saw them again - they advanced towards the prosecutor's premises - I passed them, and got into Holborn - ran to Broad-street to look for Green, the beadle, but not finding him I returned the back way, and saw Clancy in Castle-street with a bag on his shoulder. I went up to him and asked where he was going - he said he did not know; I said he must go back with me, for he had robbed some house in the market. I took him to the watch-house - Chambers was not with him then - Clancy was about three hundred yards from Gower's when I stopped him - a girl came to the watch-house to him; we followed her to Bainbridge-street, where we found Chambers at his lodgings. I had not seen them go into Gower's house, but saw them close to the grating. Burton saw the meat at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper. About half-past five o'clock on this morning I was called up, and Clansey was brought in by Williams, with a quantity of meat - I locked him up, went up stairs and dressed myself; and Williams and I followed a girl (who had been to the watch-house) to a house in Bainbridge-street, and she called out</p>
               <p>"Chambers," as soon as she got into the passage on the stairs - I got close to her, and heard a man's voice say</p>
               <p>"Where is Bill?" she directly answered,</p>
               <p>"He is taken." The man said</p>
               <p>"What, meat and all?" I answered</p>
               <p>"Yes, meat and all," and at that moment the man ran up stairs, hearing my voice - I followed, and took him on the top landing-place, it was Chambers. I brought him down - Williams pointed him out, and said he was the man he had seen with Clancy. I took him to the watch-house - Clancy said, as we went to the office, that he was very sorry, and that it was his first offence. I went to Bloomsbury market, and saw Burton at Mr. Gower's. I found the area rails had been wrenched up - the meat is kept in the cellar, which they call the slaughter-house.</p>

             re-examined. The slaughter-house is under the shop, even with the kitchen - I saw the meat there the night before - they got in by forcing the grating, and could then get down the steps into the area - the grating was fastened the night before. I went to bed soon after ten o'clock - my fellow servant and the maid servant slept in the house - I believe my master was gone to market at the time.</p>
               <p>JESSY WILLIAMS. I first saw them near Gower's house - I do not know at what time the grating was forced.</p>
               <p>CLANCY'S Defence. I was passing there, the railing was up - I happened to see the meat hang up - I stooped down and got it - but Chambers is innocent.</p>

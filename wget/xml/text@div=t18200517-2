            , by the potatoe-house, and two of Mr. Southgate's men came for some tar out of the potatoe-house. Harvey said to me</p>
               <p>"D - n me if I don't have a good ton of potatoes out of here, for the women to take away tomorrow morning." He went to the back of the potatoe-house, and pulled off the thatch from between the two rafters - it was about five o'clock on a Monday evening. He got in, took out about a sack of potatoes, and took them home. I saw him sell two pecks of them that evening - his house is about a mile from the barn. I went home with him the back-way across the fields; he carried it all the way himself. The sack held about five bushels, and he returned a good many times. I went to work with him next day, and that evening, about nine o'clock, all the prisoners and Boreham, went in and got three sacks out between them, and brought them home to Harvey's house. I met them about a quarter of a mile from the barn with them. They said they had been to Mr. Southgate's barn and got a quantity of potatoes. I did not go home with them, as I did not live with them then. On Wednesday night, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170004"></xptr>them all again about eleven o'clock, just by the potatoe house. They had each got nearly a sack.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you out so late that night - A. I was coming from Enfield, the road goes close by the barn. Harvey said they had twenty-one bushels out that evening, but they had not got them all with them. On Thursday evening, I saw them with a quantity more about half-past ten o'clock, in a lane coming down by the Bell at Edmonton - they each had a load. And in the morning, when I went to work, I saw Harvey cover up the hole in the thatch. There is a foot-path across the field, but the hedge hides the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you inform Southgate of this - A. About two days ago.</p>

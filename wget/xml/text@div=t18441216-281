               <p>to go on board the schooner—I was walking down the street, in a direction to the stairs, and saw Fitzgerald—he said, "Well, old chap, are you going on board?"—I said, "Yes"—there was another person with him, whom I could not recognise—he said he would see me safe on board, and come on board and have some supper along with me—he went with me towards the stairs, and the other man with us—before we got to the stairs we called in at Mrs. White's—when we got on to the wharf one of the two men knocked me down—there was nobody near me but Fitzgerald and the other man—he gave me a blow behind, and knocked me down—it must have been with his fist—I had a bat on—when I was down one of them ran away—. I had a watch with me—I do not know what became of it—the blow made me insensible—I was not conscious of missing anything at the time—my mate came from the vessel, and took me on board—he undressed me, and asked if I had lost anything, and I missed my watch, with a gold chain, seals, and key attached, and all my money, which was about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was a double-cased silver watch—I had felt it safe not above five minutes before—Fitzgerald had come on board with me—the schooner lay alongside the wharf—we only had to walk over a lighter to get on board—when I missed my watch I accused Fitzgerald of it—I said either he had robbed me, or he knew who had, he knew his name—the mate went on deck, leaving him with me; and then Fitzgerald ordered me out of bed, and abused me very much—the mate, hearing a noise, came down, and Fitzgerald directly said to him, "I will give you as much"—a policeman was at last sent for, and he was given into custody—I also lost a pocket-handkerchief, which I have since seen in the possession of the policeman-nothing else has been found—I had seen Fitzgerald on board my ship before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate of the schooner. I remember the captain going ashore on Sunday evening, the 24th of Nov., at half-past six o'clock—he was sober then, and had no bruise or blood about his face—he had his watch, chain, and seals safe then—about a quarter after eight some body hailed the ship—I went on deck, and saw the captain, and two men with him—Fitzgerald was one—the captain was lying on his back—Fitz gerald stood on one side of him, and the other man on the other side—I sung out to them to let the man alone, I would take charge of him—I went up to him, and found he was the worse for liquor—the other man ran away—Fitz gerald remained—I assisted the captain on board—Fitzgerald came on hoard after him—I observed that the captain's face was all over blood and mud—I helped him into bed, and as he was undressing I noticed he had not got his watch—I said he had not got it—Fitzgerald was in the cabin at the time—the captain said Fitzgerald had either got the watch himself, or his companion had it—I went on deck after that, and heard a noise in the cabin—I went down—I had left the captain in bed—I found him on</p>

               <p>Mr. Cooper. On the 29th of October, about three in the Afternoon , coming down Ludgate-Hill, between Mr. Ashley's Door and the Rainbow Coffee-house, I was attacked by the Prisoner and 3 or 4 more. They jostled and pushed me backwards and forwards, and at last pushed my Servant from me. Then they held up my Arms, and that very Man at the Bar ran at me, in Order to take my Watch from me. He got hold of the Chain, and with the first pull he broke one of the Links of it , upon which I spoke to him, but notwithstanding that, he pull'd a second Time , and then got it , and I saw it in his Hand. He was taken presently and carried to the Watch house, and from thence to Bridewell, and before I could see him, he had chang'd his Dress.</p>
               <p>John Hall. On Lord-Mayor's Day, I was walking in Procession with the Haberdasher's Company, and just as we came to Mr. Ashley's Punch-House, I heard an Out-cry of a Pick-pocket. I saw the Prisoner stooping under the Pole of a Coach , and this Watch thrown under the Horses Legs. I took up the Watch and carried it into Mr. Ashley's, where Mr. Cooper describing it , I gave it him, and I believe it has been in his Possession ever since.</p>

            . I was standing over-against Mr. Ashley's to see the Armourer's Company go by, and heard some People cry, Stop Thief! Immediately the Prisoner try'd to push under the Pole of a Hackney Coach; I took hold of his Collar, and he made great Resistance , but a Soldier coming to my Assistance we secured him, and carried him to the Watch house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley confirm'd Part of Mr. Hall's Evidence.</p>
               <p>Pris. Last Lord-Mayor's Day I happened to be upon Ludgate-Hill, and about 5 Minutes after the Man on Horseback was gone by, there was a Cry of Stop Thief! Presently a Man rushed by me, and that Man (Blay) said he would lay hold of me.</p>

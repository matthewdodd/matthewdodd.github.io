             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I did keep a green-grocer's shop, in Fenchurch-buildings: On the 12th of July, about eight o'clock in the morning, my daughter informed me the kitt of salmon was gone; in consequence of information, on the Monday following I went to the prisoner's house in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is his house from your's? - A. About a quarter of a mile; Mrs. Beattie went with me; I saw, on the outside of his window, some thin salmon in a kitt, and on the window board, inside, I saw another kitt, the top of which, I believed to be mine; I went in to look at it, and asked the prisoner if he had no salmon thicker than that out of doors; I don't know that he gave me any answer; I lifted up the lid and saw some thick salmon under it; I knew the lid to be mine, it was a very remarkable one; I believe the salmon kitt and all to be mine, but that I do not swear to; I said to my lodger, good God, this is my lid; I was rather flurried, and I begged to sit down a moment; I then turned round to the prisoner, and said, good man, how came you by this lid of the kitt of salmon? it was stolen from my door last Friday morning, by seven o'clock; I said, I would not swear to the salmon, nor to the kitt, but if I were on my dying pillow, or in the East-Indies, I would swear to the lid; he made no reply; he then called a boy from some part of his house into the shop; he said to the boy, take this lid over to Issac's, the owner of it, of whom I borrowed it; I said, the lid was my property, and should not go out of his shop; the boy then got the lid out of the shop, and I was going to run after him; the prisoner laid hold of my arm to prevent my going after him, and said, go to hell and be d-d; I followed the boy across Petticoat-lane, and up an alley, nearly opposite the house; I followed him to the end of the alley, which brought me into the broad-way, then I lost sight of him; I was frightened, and could not run any farther; I was then surrounded by a very large concourse of Jews, three of them had the civility to take me into their house, and in about a minute or two, a number of Jews brought the lid to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had that lid? - A. About fifteen months; I have no doubt of its being mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You lost it on the Friday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found it on the Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, there was all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for him to have purchased that lid of any body else? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was admitted to bail for this offence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he has surrendered here within this half-hour to meet his trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Lord-Mayor commit him to take his trial? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, upon your oath, he was admitted to bail by the Lord-Mayor? - A. I suppose so; I have received four notices of bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he was indicted at the September Sessions for a misdemeanor, only for receiving this cover, when the City chose to indict him for felony? - A. I suppose so, I don't understand it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had this cover fifteen months - be so good as tell the Jury the marks upon that cover? I can only describe it as an old cover, as being cracked in a great many places; there is no particular mark upon it, there is a little brass knob at the top of it; I used to wipe it myself, for fear my daughter should break it, it was so much cracked; it is not like the modern lids, they make the glass clear, but this is a much thicker glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see a salmon kitt with a thick glass cover before? - A. I never saw such a one as that before.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Vaillant. I lodged at Mrs. Taylor's house, in the month of July; on Monday the 3d of August, I went to the prisoner's house with her; Mrs. Taylor went in, and asked him whether he had got any other salmon than what he had there? I believe he said, he had not, when looking at the lid, she said, that was her's, she could take her oath it was her lid; she insisted upon having the lid, he took it from her, and said, is this her's and be d-d to her; here, boy, go and take this lid to Mr. Isaac's, where it belongs; I said, Mrs. Taylor, you ought not to let the lid go; he then put his hand out to prevent her going out; the boy then ran up the alley, opposite Mr. Abrahams's house; I lost sight of the boy, but saw the lid a few mi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280026"></xptr>nutes after, at the top of the alley; several people gathered round, and some Jews asked us to walk in, which we did; the lid was brought to us after we were there, but by whom I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This cover was lost on the Friday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner admitted to bail by the Lord-Mayor? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not committed for receiving, and is now indicted for a felony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. She cannot know that, we will admit that he was committed as a receiver, and he is now indicted as a principal.</p>

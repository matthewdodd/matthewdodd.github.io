            , and Jane.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us the manner in which you were alarmed? - A. The girl came with a letter into the parlour, and three men came in just at her back, we asked what they wanted, they said</p>
               <p>"money and watches."</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the faces of these men? - A. No, they were disguised; there was one had a crape over his face, and two of them, I think, had handkerchiefs; I gave them my watch, and what money I had in my pocket, it was only a metal watch, I gave them my purse, it contained only one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your sisters give them any thing? - A. Yes; then they asked for colonel Waugh; they said we had nothing to fear if we were quiet, but if not, we must be tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any arms? - A. Yes, they had all of them pistols; the man who stood over us said that colonel Waugh had done him an injury in the West-Indies, but he would be revenged that night; one always stood by us, two went up stairs, and one staid in the passage.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You could not see the face of those persons, can you describe the dress of that person that stood over you? - A. No, I cannot, I was so much frightened; we staid about an hour in the parlour, while they were bringing down the things, and when they had brought them down, the person who stood over us said, ladies you must now go into the back kitchen, till we get the passage clear, and the things carried out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go into the back kitchen? - A. Yes, and my sisters with me, and the servant, the man accompanied us.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - A. I think near about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did you see any property taken away? - A. I did not see them, I heard them pushing and forcing the things open, drawers and other things, some time after the person left me; I don't know whether they left the house together.</p>
               <p>Q. After that person left you, did you hear any other person in the house? - A. I think they went all away; we staid a good while in the kitchen, because we were not sure they were gone; there were four boxes belonging to colonel Waugh, that were packed that day by colonel Waugh's servant and his brother.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you tell me what property you lost? - A. I lost two trunks, I can tell some of the property, but I cannot tell the whole.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 7, New-road, St. Pancras, I am a housekeeper: On Wednesday, the 31st of January, I had occasion to go to Mr. Woodroofe's, the Acorn public-house, Bridewell Precinct, on business, between one and two o'clock; the landlord not being at home, I waited for him; while I was waiting for him, a hackney-coach came up to the door, and four men came into the house, part of them from the coach, with four boxes or trunks, I was sitting in the bar; the coach being so near, I observed the number to be eight hundred and twenty-one; they endeavoured to go backwards to a back parlour, rather retired; all seemed, apparently, confused to get backwards to this parlour; the landlady asked them, where they were going; they said, into the parlour; she made answer, I am not going to have my parlour made a warehouse of; there is a room for you, if you like to sit down; it was a room on the left hand, at the side of the bar, they went in there, and called for a shillingsworth of rum and water, and they threw the door to; there they remained some time; one of them came out to have the second glass filled, he went away, and brought the same coach off the stand again; the landlady and I had a strong suspicion, she sent for her husband, she found her husband was at the Harrow, a little way off, in Water-lane; just before he came in, one of them came out of the room, and put a box into the coach, the coach got about ten or a dozen yards from the door, when a second came and brought a box out, and called to the coachman; then the landlord went out and looked at the coach and number, and the men that were in the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. When the landlord came back, what did you and he do? - A. After he had taken notice of the coach, he went into the room, his wife requested me to go; I followed the landlord into the room, and there was one box standing upon the table, and as much paper torn to pieces as I could hold in my two hands, on the table; the landlord questioned them about the paper and about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140071"></xptr>the trunk, he imagined they did not come by it honestly, he told them so; the prisoner at the bar replied, that he was a gentleman, that they were his; the other man was dressed somewhat like a servant, with a striped jacket; he unstrapped the trunk, and shewed us the contents; he shewed us some men's wearing apparel and breeches; he said, he would go to shoemaker-row, it is not far off, to fetch a person; we let him go; just as he went away, the landlord went into the bar to serve some liquor, and left me and the prisoner in the room; after his companion was gone, he endeavoured to make his escape, he wanted to follow; I laid hold of him by the collar, I was towards the door-way, he was innermost in the room; the landlord said, in the bar, don't let him go, he shall not go till his friend comes back; he directly made a push to get away, I laid hold of him by the collar to prevent him, till such time as his friend returned; he then drew a brace of pistols from his pocket, and he gave me a violent blow on this finger, and cut my knuckles with the pistols, I was obliged to let go my hold; he held the pistols to my face, and to the best of my recollection, he expressed, "come on now, come"on;" I drew back a little, and I called out for the poker, when a coal-heaver pushed in to my assistance, and laid hold of him, he pushed him to the further end of the room, I followed him; the coal-heaver wrenched the pistols out of his hand, and we held him there till such time as an officer was sent for from Bridewell Precinct, to search him; at the time we held him, before the officer came, he offered us half-a-guinea, if we would let him go; I made a reply to him if he would give me one hundred, he should not be loose; when the officer came, he searched him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he find? - A. He found a telescope in a leather case. The officer belonging to Bridewell, me and the landlord, lodged him in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Who took charge of the trunk? - A. The officer belonging to Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who took the telescope? - A.Weaver, the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When he was searched, there was nothing found upon but the telescope? - A. Nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at the door preventing him going out, it was then he presented those pistols? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not loaded? - A. I did not open them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. How was the prisoner dressed? - A. The prisoner had a light brown great coat on, and a pair of pantaloons of a white colour, tied down like a marine's, they were made of canvass.</p>

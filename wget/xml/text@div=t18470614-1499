                  </hi>. I am in the service of the East and West India Dock Company. On the 14th of June I stopped the prisoner going out of the Docks—a person with him was carrying his hammock, which was very heavy—I asked what was in it—the prisoner said his bed and his wet clothes—I put my hand in, and found they were dry—I slacked the lashing, pulled up the bed, and found this bag, with 17lbs. of raw sugar in it—he had got a pass for his things, from which I found he came from the ship <hi rend="italic">Codrington</hi>—I went to the <hi rend="italic">Codrington</hi>, and took the prisoner with me to Captain Huxtable, and in his presence showed the sample of sugar, and asked how he could think of taking that from the ship—it was part of the cargo—he said he did not know anything about it—the captain said he had nothing to do with it, and told me to do as I pleased—I took the prisoner to my superior, and then to the Thames Police-office—he was remanded—next day I examined some casks—there was one on the dock which had similar sugar in it—it had a great hole chopped in it, and a quantity of sugar taken—I examined it with what I found in the hammock, and found they did not agree—I then examined some casks on the quay, which I had just seen come ashore from the ship—I had seen them come over the ship's side, and know no others were there—I did not see them all landed—I examined the sugar in them, and it corresponded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the captain's name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> James Huxtable, I believe—I said it was William at the Police-office—I was told so by one of the seamen, but afterwards ascertained that it was James.</p>

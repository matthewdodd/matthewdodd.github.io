                  </hi>. I conduct the business of the Crown and Anchor Tavern, at Woolwich—on Friday, the 9th of April the prisoner and Dybell came into the house three times—they behaved very abruptly indeed, abused the people at bar, and very much "annoyed" the business—about five minutes after eleven o'clock at night we refused them any liquor, and they were going into the tap-room—I called the policeman to turn them out—he said he could not come into the house unless he saw an assault made—I</p>

               <p>then desired the prisoner to walk out—he would not—he struck me and threw me against the wall in the passage—the policeman then came in and took the prisoner—Dybell then served me in the same way-the policeman took the prisoner out of doors—I did not see what happened to the police<lb></lb>man—Dybell gave bail, and has not surrendered.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 267.) About eleven o'clock at night on the 9th of April, I was called to the Crown and Anchor—I heard there were disorderly persons inside, but I did not think it my duty, accord<lb></lb>ing to our instructions, to go inside—I then saw Mr. Thorn attempt to put the prisoner out—the prisoner took him by the collar and threw him against the wall—he then followed him, took hold of him again, and threw him on the table—I said I should take him into custody—he was very obstinate, but I succeeded in getting him outside—the moment I got him outside he hit me with his clenched fist in the eye, and knocked me down backwards, and commenced kicking me while I was down—he thrust his fingers into my throat and pressed my head to the ground—he very much hurt my throat—I had two black eyes—he fell on me with his knees on my cheat while I was down—I got on my knees and struck him with my staff—he knocked me down a second time and hit me in the eye—Dybell then came and kicked me in the side twice, while I was down—he then caught me by the thumb and pulled it back and very much injured it—I called for assistance while I was on my knees—I lost my senses, and when I came to my senses again the prisoner and Dybell were on me—I still had them by the collar—two <hi rend="italic">civilians</hi> came and sprang my rattle—the prisoner was taken on the spot-Dybell made his escape, and was taken the next morning—I was unable to attend to my duty for five days, in consequence of the injuries I received—I was obliged to have medical attendance—I have been since put on lighter duty.</p>

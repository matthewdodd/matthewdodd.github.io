On the 19th of November, the officer came and apprehended him, while he was at dinner - he found a watch in his fob; he asked him where he got that - he said he bought it of Mr. Hythe; he then took out of one of his trousers pockets about 14s., and out of the other about 34s. in silver - he had been in my employ about five months, at 20l. per annum, but I had not paid him any thing; when I saw the silver I said "That is some of to-day's;" he said "Yes, (or something of that kind, very low) but upon my word, Sir, I have destroyed no tickets of to-day's;" upon balancing that day's account, I found about 25s. deficient - we then went up stairs, and found the money in his box; he said he had been young and thoughtless, and he hoped I would be merciful.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You will not undertake to give us the words he used? A. Not particucularly, but it was something affirmative, as it was followed by the assertion that he had destroyed no tickets that day; he had before told me that his uncle gave him the watch. I heard him say, at the public-house, that James had been robbing Mr. Cassell for years.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did he say up stairs that the money was your's? A. Yes.</p>

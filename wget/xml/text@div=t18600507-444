                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, residing at Duke-street, Man<lb></lb>chester-square—in consequence of communications I had received, I called upon the prisoner on 31st March, at Twyford's-buildings, in reference to a promissory note for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some conversation passed between us—the name of Nash was on the door—I asked for Mrs. Nash, and the prisoner came forward—she represented herself as being married—some conversation passed as to her husband—there was some difficulty about dealing with the note—she wanted to deal with it without the assent of her husband, and I told her that that would be impossible; without the husband's indorsement nothing could be done with the note—on the Monday afterwards, 2nd April I think, she came to my house—she said she had spoken to her husband, and that he had consented to indorse the note—I had not then seen the note; only a copy—I then told her that it would be necessary to ascertain the genuineness of the signature—she said that she had several letters from Mr. Twyford, with which I could compare the signature to the note—I told her that if she would bring me the note and the letters, I would then see further into it—in the evening she brought me this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the note ia dated "February 16th, 1858;" and signed "Samuel Twyford"—she said, when she brought these, that she had brought me the bill, and a letter from Mr. Twyford; that she could not find any more—the promissory note is for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable by two instalments—she gave as a reason for the genuineness of the note, that she had received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it, from Mr. Twyford, and had indorsed the receipt on the back of the bill—she showed me this indorsement—during this conversation she constantly referred to Mr. Twyford as the ex-Magistrate of Bow-street, and she told me that if I went to Bow-street I could easily ascertain that the signature was genuine—she said that she and Mr. Twyford were cousins, I think, and that after her mother's death, Mr. Twyford had informed her that he had 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., belonging to her mother, in his hands; that she should not have known it had not Mr. Twyford told her Bot and that he gave her this note in discharge of it; in settlement of the matter—upon looking at the letter I saw at once that it was a vulgar forgery; that the person who had written it, could not spell—I told her if she would leave it I would make further inquiries, which I did.</p>

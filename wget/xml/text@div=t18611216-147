On Wednesday, 20th November, about 7 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in South-street, Greenwich, and saw the prisoner go into a marine-store dealer's shop, kept by a Mr. White, in South—street—he had a bag under his arm, containing something apparently heavy—I followed him in, and saw him put some lead piping into the scale—there was three—quarters of a cwt., it was weighed by the marine—store dealer—I asked the prisoner where he got it—he said, "I brought it from a house in London-street, Greenwich"—I said, "Where did you bring it from?"—he refused to give me any further account—he said, You know me; you know where I live"—I said, "If you don't give a satisfactory account of this lead I shall take you to the station"—he then said, "I found it in my yard on some litter, covered over with a sack—I said, "You have told two different tales; unless you give a satisfactory account I shall take you to the police-station"—I took him and the lead to the police-station—there were eleven pieces of leaden pipe, of different lengths—that which has been identified by Mr. Hills' servant is here—I really cannot tell the lengths of them—I have two or three pieces here—they are most of them that length.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 72, st. james-place Church—street, Deptford, and am a plumber—I have been in the service of Mr. Frank Clark Hills, chemical works, Deptford, ever since 1834—the prisoner has been employed in removing straw and stuff from near those premises—he has been employed by the man, not by Mr. Hills—I should say that the rubbish and waste which he removed was between fifty and sixty feet from where he got this pipe—this piece of lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is three-quarter pipe—there are some of various lengths—it had been applied to the vitriol pans, for drawing off; applied as a syphon—the length of this piece is, as near as I can guess, about 3ft. 6in.—there is some 4ft 6in. and some 10 ft—the lengths I have mentioned apply to the various lengths of lead which were lying within fifty feet of the waste removed.</p>

               <p>one piece about 18 in. and one piece was less—I firmly believe that this is Mr. Hills' property by the use that these things are made for, and the work that it is used in—I do not know the date on which the constable came to me—I believe it was towards the end of November—after the police-constable came to me I looked at the large heap which was there—I did not miss any from it—I cannot say whether it had been pulled about or not, for the foreman has the looking over the warehouse—I believe this to be Mr. Hills' property, which formed part of the heap—this lead is the same size and weight as that on the heap—by the weight, I mean so much to a foot.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a large fruit merchant and gardener in the Green<lb></lb>wich road—I have been there for from twelve to fourteen yean—I pay the prisoner one shilling a week for a portion of the yard—we can always go in there when we like, and my boy has been there sometimes as early as 6 o'clock in the morning, and as late as 11 at night—there is a cart standing there sometimes; sometimes more—I think there is hardly any fastening at all to the place, I really do not know—I do not go there myself—he can always get in—you can easily climb over, it is not very high—I have known the prisoner about seven or eight years, I should say, during which time I have found him honest; I have now and then lent him a trifle of money, and he has always repaid me—I never knew anything against him—I know his wife, she is blind, and has been so for, I think, about six months—I cannot say exactly—she can walk about the house.</p>

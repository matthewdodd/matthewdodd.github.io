                  </hi>. I am a collecting clerk in the service of Messrs. Barber, ironmongers, of Stanhope-street, Clare-market; I have been in their service fourteen years; I live at No. 20, Cecil-street, Strand. On 4th Nov., I was out collecting for my employers—I collected about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I forget the exact amount—a few minutes after 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane, and went into a urinal in Vinegar-yard, by the pit door of Drury-lane theatre—there are eight compartments to it, and an entrance at each end; there is a passage, so that persons can pass behind the compartments—at the time I was in, it was lighted with a gas lamp in the centre—there was plenty of light to see all over it, it was very light—there is an oyster shop immediately opposite, which is very brilliantly lighted—the outside lamps of that shop are considerably above the urinal, and they reflect a light into it—the stone which separates the urinal from Vinegar-yard, is higher than a man—I went into the second compartment from Brydges-street—there were other persons in some of the other com<lb></lb>partments; I should say at least three—when I went in there was no one in the first or third compartments, nor in the fourth; there was a man in the fifth, that was the prisoner, and there were one or two persons in the others—whilst I was standing in the second compartment, I heard some one say, "I have just left work," and on looking round, I found that the prisoner had moved from where he was to the next compartment on my left, the third—I am sure I saw him in the fifth when I went in; I could not be mistaken—he was standing up as a person would who was using the place—I did not see him move, but I found him in the third compartment when I looked round—he said, "You can give me what you like, but I sometimes get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "What have I to do with giving you money?" nothing more was said—he buttoned himself up and left—he was unbuttoned at the time; he was standing with his face towards the urinal; he turned his head round in addressing me, his person was in the compartment—he passed me, and went out at the Brydges-street end—I still remained in the second compartment; I am afflicted with a stricture, which causes me to be a long time; I staid I should think six or seven minutes after he had left—during that time he returned, and passed through the place, but took no notice of me, or I of</p>

               <p>him; there was no room for him then, ail the compartments were full—he merely passed through, and never spoke to me or to any one; I came out at the Brydges-street end—that was the way he had gone out—I cannot say which way he came in the second time, but he went out at the Brydges-street end both times—I went into Brydges-street, which is merely three or four paces from the urinal, and as I was about crossing, the prisoner collared me, and said he would give me in charge for indecently assaulting him—I made him a reply, but in my agitation I cannot tell what I said, whether it was, "You scoundrel," or, "You vagabond, I never saw you," I really can<lb></lb>not say; it was something to that effect—I had seen him—when I looked at him as we were going along, I could see it was the same man—in less than two minutes, I should say, 100 persons gathered round; rather a rough lot—the prisoner was looking about for a policeman, and no policeman being in view, I said, "If you want to give me in charge, take me to Bow-street"—it was close by Bow-street—no policeman came, and I walked quietly with the prisoner to Bow-street, without any policeman at all—he held me by the collar all the way—there were several policemen standing at the door of the station—I walked into the police office—the prisoner gave me in charge at the door for having indecently assaulted him in Vinegar-yard—I did not while I was in the urinal, or at any other time, in any way indecently assault him, or touch him—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoners state<lb></lb>ment before the Magistrate was read as follows:</hi>—"All what I wish to say is down on the deposition I gave before at this Court, and which has just been read, that is the truth; I did not say that he hurt me so that I could scarcely draw my breath; every word the gentleman has spoken is quite false; two or three of the words might be right.") (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of the prisoner above referred to was read as follows:</hi>—"Robert Patrick Golding upon his oath says, I live at No. 18, Bennett's-court, Drury-lane; I am a porter; about 6 o'clock on Saturday afternoon last, 4th Nov., I went into the urinal in Vinegar-yard, Brydges-street, Covent-garden, in the second division; the moment I had taken down my trowsers, and before I had commenced making water, the defendant, who was in the next division to me, put his hand round the Corner, and laid hold of my privy member, and squeezed it very hard; I hallooed out very loudly, and ran out, and spoke to a man at an apple stall, and then returned to the urinal, and waited for some time until the defendant came out; his coat collar was turned up, and he walked smartly away; I followed him, and laid hold of him, but seeing no policeman, I brought him to the station at Bow-street.")—it is not true that I laid hold of him at ail; I did not touch him in any way whatever-—I heard no one halloo out—there were other persons in the place—it as raining at this time—I had the collar of my coat up in consequence of the rain, before I went in there—it was not done in any way to conceal my face; it could not conceal it—it was merely to protect myself from the rain—I gave my name and address at the station, and the address of my employers.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 24, Russell-court, and have an apple stall at the Brydges-street corner of Vinegar-yard, within nine or ten yards of the urinal—I was there on the Saturday evening, 4th Nov.—I saw the prisoner; I did not see him till he came out of the urinal—he said, "There is a dirty beast of a fellow in there who caught me by the privates, and held me so tight that I could scarcely get my breath"—he said, he</p>

               <p>Q. What were you paying your pressmen for work - A. Sixpence for two hundred and fifty sheets, if they worked the small size, or, as the pressmen call it, the hour: that what they call the hour is performed in twenty-five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the defendants at any time make any application to you for an increase of wages - A. Not to me directly, nor in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they, any one, or all of them leave your work - A. They all left my work on the 28th of May; I believe there had been notice, I believe given to the publisher of the paper, that they would leave on such a day, I understood on that day they left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this occasion you any inconveniency of the paper - A. A very great inconveniency</p>
               <p>Q. After they had finished the publication in the morning of the 28th of May about ten or eleven o'clock, at what time should you have wanted them for the paper to go to press in the ordinary course - A. About five or six o'clock. They all left me; the compositors had quitted me two days previous to the pressmen, at least; some of them staid; the pressmen all went on the same day, Westray, Simpson, and Wentworth, they went on the 29th, the day after the pressmen went.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they had given you any notice to quit - A. I received their notice through Westray; nine of the compositors had given warning on the 12th of May, the pressmen had given warning on the 10th. Westray said he was solicited by the companionship to whom he belonged, to enquire whether I intended to raise their wages; this was on the 14th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the parties among those that are indicted that formed the companionship to which Westray belonged - A. Simpson and Wentworth are two, there were six in the companionship, but only three indicted. I told them that; I could give no answer whatever, however, I told him afterwards I had no objection, if eighteen pence a week upon their former wages, these were compositors, and the compositors are paid by the week; he stated that he would communicate it to the rest of the companionship. On the following morning he stated that he had communicated it to the men of his companionship, he said they were not satisfied with that answer, and therefore he was authorized to give warning for them all. I thought he was not disposed to go; however, a few days afterwards, on my addressing himself particularly, he said he must go along with the other men, and he did so go.</p>

               <p>Q. You have a boy of the name of Abrey - A. Yes, he is a fly boy, he has not worked for me four months; I sent him into the country to keep him out of the way of my men, by the advice of persons who knew better than myself</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you whether the striking of these men put you to any inconveniency - A. To an extraordinary inconveniency, I could obtain no others a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney; I am Counsel for all the compositors. What are the names of the proprietors of the Times, are they (excepting your father) a brother-in-law, and a sister, Mr. Cartlon and Mrs. Rate, do they appear as partners to the world - A. No; they have in proportion to their share, they are equally interested with my father and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. It is carried on for their benefit as well as yours - A. Certainly so; my father and myself print the paper alone, and make a charge to the firm, they certainly pay for a part of the printing, we make a weekly charge for printing the paper, and the profits of the paper are divided between the whole firm.</p>
               <p>Q. You have made use of the term companionship, I believe there is nothing illegal in the term - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Westray was the foreman of his companionship - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the regular course of things, he was the medium from whom you should expect to receive warning - A. I should judge so.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Crow of another companionship, from whom you thought to receive warning for the other men. - A. It was so.</p>

               <p>Q. Westray came to you and told you that he was desired by the men of his companionship to request that you would rise their wages - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave no positive answer - A. No; I told him it was undetermined what price we should give to the duplicate men.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, what should be given to the principal men were undetermined - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a meeting of the masters this year upon the occasion - A. There was three or four meetings: we had a committee, it lasted about a fortnight or three weeks. I stated to Westray, that I thought it was a threat on their part.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Westray tell you he had no thought of leaving you that way - A. He did; it certainly was thought he rather wished to stay than otherways, he wished to know how he was to act, he was to call on me the next morning, I then told him I should take their warning, and if they meaned to go they might go. Westray came about ten days after they had left, he said if I discharged the apprentices he would get me men. In the companionship, of which Westry was foreman, the wages were thirty shillings a week for five hours labour: from twelve to five.</p>

            . I am employed by Mr. Walters as publisher of the Times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect on the 14th of May, or about that time the pressmen making any application to you, and what nature. - A. Prior to the time stated, Hurley, Gee, Howlett, Scott, Clifton, Warwick, Burn, Pasquin, and Kidd, they applied to me to speak to Mr. Walter, for some advance for their work which was one halfpenny per hour, I did, Mr. Walter was willing to accede the halfpenny on one part of the work, but refused to the other; after their first application they continued working about two or three weeks, but on the 14th of May after they were off their work, I received a message sent down stairs to me from the overseer of the press, his name is Delany, in consequence of which I went to the men. I put a question, who answered for the whole, none chose to answer for the whole, they were all perfectly silent, there were only seven up stairs, Hurley, Gee, Howlett, Scott, Clifton, Warwick, and Burn.</p>
               <p>COURT. Point out the persons - A. They are all present but Warwick, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Warwick was again called and came in Court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Warwick must stand by.</p>
               <p>Street. There were seven of them there, they said they would answer individually, and they did, Pasquin and Kidd I met as I came out of the door, I requested them to remain, observing they were well paid, and begged of them to consider it, that they had pledged themselves to consider of it, and that they had placed themselves in an aukward situation; I believe it was Hurley observed that he did not conceive there was any thing wrong in their proceedings, or something to that effect. When I met Pasquln and Kidd, as I was coming out of the door, I asked them if they gave warning as well as the others, they said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any calculation of the wages these men earned - A. About three pound fifteen shillings a week a man, independent of extra work. I have more than once remonstrated with them not to leave their work.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp When a person means to quit a printer, is fourteen days the usual warning - A. It is, and in my situation I should receive it through the overseer, the overseer has the warnings of the men communicated to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And then his duty is to communicate it to you - A. I should consider it so, and then it is communicated to the master.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given an account that the pressmen's weekly wages are three pound fifteen shillings, what would the advance of an halfpenny per hour be upon the master, upon an average a week - A. Six shillings. I have known eight men to have had divided between them thirty-four pounds a week. Mr. Baker's would give the advance on the larger paper, on the smaller he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard of these men not working of a Saturday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310071"></xptr>night, but on the other days there work is a greater part of the night - A. One part of the work is fifteen or sixteen hours, and the other part ten or eleven; the persons that do the heavy work on one night, do light work the other, and so alternatively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. And when there is a pressure of business must not they work eighteen or twenty hours - A. Yes, most part of the night.</p>

               <p>Court. We cannot hear that. In consequence of what Brockett came about did you converse with these defendants - A. I did not. The whole of the defendants, Woolley, Mackenzie, Craig, Chapman, Simpson, and the others, with the exception of Westray, all gave warning on the 14th of May, each one for himself, they came altogether, and successively gave warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give you a reason for the notice to quit - A. No, none of them; I could not help expressing my regret; I said, I was sorry that they were about to go, I was loth to part with them; I said, the measure was precipitate and rash; I cannot say that they made any answer, I wished them to wait for the masters. They all went away on the 26th and the office was left without a man. Mr. Flint was kind enough to offer assistance through his men and apprentices. None of the defendants returned to Mr. Walter's work before the indictment was preferred.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the defendant Howlett - A. Yes; in May last, Howlett came with Hurley to me, I was working at the press, they said I had applied to Mr. Baldwin for work; I said, I had not; they told me there was a resolution passed, that no man should take a newsman's situation in any of the papers for six months to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where that resolution passed - A. At the house where the society is held, the Coach and Horses, Water-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason why that resolution was passed - A. Upon the account of the advance being made by the men of one half penny per hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that advance been granted by the masters - A. By part, it was resisted by Mr. Walters and others. Howlett or Hurley requested me to attend at Mr. Merrits, the Coach and Horses, Water-lane, on Whitmonday. I went to the Coach and Horses, Howlett, Scott, Gee, Clifton, Warwick, and Burn, were there; Howlett wished to have two men impressed, and knowing that I knew a press master, they wished me to introduce them to him; these two men were Fitzgerald and Miller, they were then working for Mr. Walter: Howlett said, he was fully convinced that Fitzgerald and Miller had not the advance that the other man demanded, the other men all agreed to it I accompanied them to the press master, who is a relation of mine; Howlett, Gee, Warwick, and Clifton, Warwick was put on shore at Billingsgate, Howlett, Clifton, Gee, and myself, only went to the press master; I saw my relation, they gave the necessary information, that Fitzgerald and Miller were both deserters from the navy. Mr. Fare, the press master, said, he would come and take them; after some more conversation between the parties, he was given to understand the house was in the city of London; of course, he could not act in the city, that prevented their being impressed; he made no other objection and we came away. Howlett said; provided a warrant could be obtained of the Lord Mayor, and the press gang brought in the night, would answer their purpose; they wanted to stop Mr. Walter's publication of the newspaper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from any of the defendants at the bar, whether there were any allowance for the Times men, as a compensation for leaving Mr. Walter's employ - A. They received a pound a week-per man, I saw it paid by the landlord, John Moult, at the Coach and Horses; I saw four or five pound paid to six men.</p>

I did, more than once; I believe they struck on the Monday, on on the Sunday I saw Howlett, I asked him to return to his master's service; he made a scoff, and said, I could not get any one else to work it, we must keep the old hands, we could get no others to work; the next man I saw was Hurley, I said, well my lad, do you mean to stop, Mr. Walter is fond of some of you, but them that cannot do their work he does not mean to keep; he said, if you do not keep us all you shall not keep one, this was after they gave notice, but before they left. When Mr. Walter's was out of town. Hurley came to my house, said he had been ill treated by the companionship; he asked me to employ him at the risk of my own situation; I did; Mr. Street came and said I did not do right; I gave him some money, and told him I would give him some more at my house, I believed him to have been led away by the rest.</p>

I attended two of the meetings at a public house, up a court, opposite Somerset-house; I do not recollect any of them were present the first meeting; at the second meeting Coy was there, there was a resolution passed respecting the advance of wages, it was agreed that every one should give a fortnights notice, as is customary in the trade.

               <p>Q. For what purpose were these meetings held - A. For the advance of wages, I know of no other purpose; I sooner than lose my situation should have been satisfied with the price given, but I must say, I should have given the preference to an advance; I did not say so to the men, I thought so in my own mind. I left the same time as the rest did for the advance of wages, no one persuaded me to do it. There was no limited time to return to our employ.</p>

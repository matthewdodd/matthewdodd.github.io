            . I am a servant, and live in the Almonry. I was at the Nag's Head, public-house last Sunday, between nine and ten o'clock, and asked for a pot of beer at the bar; Ridley went into the cellar for it - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220006"></xptr>saw Thompson asleep in the room, and the prisoners on each side of him - I am sure it was them. Freeborn put his hand into Thompson's pocket, and took something out in a bag, he gave it to the other. Ridley came up - I said nothing, but went home, and was fetched back in about ten minutes. The prisoners were searched and four shillings, two six-pences, and 3 d. was found on Freeborn in a leather purse, which was in a leather bag.</p>

I went down to the cellar, to tap the beer; when I came up somebody said the soldiers had robbed the man; I sent for Powell, and for the constable; they were searched by Hill, who found a bag of money on Mowbray - Thompson claimed it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for and searched the prisoners - I asked if they had two bags of money, they denied all knowledge of it. I found the bags in Mowbray's inside coat pocket - he appeared confused. Thompson claimed them. Before I searched them, Powell said she saw them take the purse which was inside the bag.</p>

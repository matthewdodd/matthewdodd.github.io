               <p>On the 24th of August last, I was robbed by the prisoner at the bar, in a street called <placeName id="t17820911-5-crimeloc24">Reynard-street, near Crouch-end, Hornsey</placeName>

Says the Alderman, can you see them, I said no; Harry is in the way, that was his servant: the coach was immediately ordered to stop, and one came on my side, which was the prisoner Davis, he demanded my watch, money, and pocket-book, used some illiberal language. The other who calls himself

            , was on the other side, I was much alarmed, I gave Davis my purse, containing 16 s. in silver; as I took my purse out, I meant to have taken care of my watch, but dropped it by the side of me. I satisfied the prisoner, who calls himself Davis, that I had no watch or pocket-book, and that I had given all my money; from which period to the time of their leaving us, Davis behaved exceedingly well. I think it my duty to state every circumstance; they had each pistols, but I was not under the least degree of apprehension from the prisoner Davis, his behaviour was exceedingly proper under such circumstances; after I had given my purse to Davis, Airey was exceedingly outrageous, he had robbed the Alderman of three guineas, and the other gentleman of about 14 s. he put his hand in to search the Alderman, and made use of a very improper expression; he put his hand upon the Alderman's thigh, and said he had more money; he said it was only a penny, or three halfpence; he behaved in a very unbecoming manner indeed, saying he would blow our brains out, blasting us, demanding our pocket-books and watches, I believe he saw my watch, he blasted, me, with his pistol in his hand, and put his head a little further into the coach, and he took my gold watch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask Mr. Allen what information he gave to Bow-street when he was first robbed? - We gave information to Bow-street that we thought</p>
               <p>'the prisoners</p>
               <p>'short people, they might stand on the</p>

               <p>'as a dark man, and about 25 or 26 years of</p>
               <p>'age, they were both as much exposed as any</p>
               <p>'of the gentlemen here, Davis put up a</p>
               <p>'white cravat to his mouth, it was down in a minute, the other with a silk handkerchief the same, it was impossible to mistake them considering the length of time they were with us, they were differently dressed at the justices but I had no difficulty about them, it is is very disagreeable to me to be under the necessity of prosecuting, I did not swear to them on Monday because it was agreed we should all attend together.</p>
               <p>ALDERMAN KITCHEN sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you in company with Mr. Allen at the time of this robbery? - I was my Lord, but Mr. Allen has related it so very particularly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110008"></xptr> I do not think any thing can be added to it, I am sure the prisoner is the man, but I cannot be so positive to Davis, as to Airey I never heard such a number of oaths in my life, I gave him three guineas, I asked him to return me one, he would not, he then seized my pocket, says he, damn me why did you not give me all, that was only three bad halfpence, I cannot swear to the other man, the other man leaned quite over me.</p>

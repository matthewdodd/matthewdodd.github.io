            . I am a constable of the Mansion-house. On the 11th of January, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was waiting opposite Mr. Turner's premises, on the watch, and saw the prisoner turn off the step of the door, with a paper parcel across his left arm - he turned up Princes-street, but was not out of my sight; I followed him across Bridgewater-square, down Fan-street and Goswell-street; he turned down Allen-street, and knocked at No. 40 - a boy opened the door - he said something to the boy, I could not hear what; I then went up and touched the bundle, and asked him what he had got there; he said, "Lead, for Peter, the burnisher;" I asked where he brought it from; he said, "From myself;" I said, "From yourself?" he said, "Yes, he is my brother-in-law, and we travel the country, Brentford, Isleworth, and all those places, and buy up all sorts of metal;" I said, "How came this piece here, then?" he said it was left at the White Horse public-house, Fan-street, opposite his house, the night before, or opposite where he lived - that he took it home, and had brought it from home; I said,"That story won't do for me; I have followed you from Princes-street, myself," which he denied; I took him to the Compter, and informed Mr. Turner; the metal has had a piece cut off it, to be assayed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he carrying it quite openly? A. Except the paper being round it - he gave this account very readily - he called it lead, and I could not tell it from lead myself.</p>
               <p>MR. TURNER. On the 11th of January, about 12 o'clock, this bar of metal was produced to me, we have a great many more - it is coarse metal, with a very small portion of silver in it - it is the refuse from refining silver; the prisoner was not allowed to collect metal; he was never absent from our business - he could not have been travelling; this is not likely to be found any where but at a refiner's; it is worth 24s. or 25s. - there is no refiner nearer to us than Foster-lane; I never knew the prisoner in possession of any bar: there may be probably twenty bars of one sort; they are not always so poor as this one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any particular mark on it? A. No; I could have sworn to it any where, for here is the ingot it was cast in - it is not an uncommon size; I could not ascertain the quality without its being assayed - it has been assayed at Johnson's, in Foster-lane, but not in my presence; I can tell, from its appearance, and from cutting it, that it is not pure lead - it is mixed metal, composed of lead, silver, and, I dare say, a portion of copper; I know that from the assay master.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say that it is mixed metal, of your own knowledge? A. It is; I have been forty years in the business, and have no doubt of it, though I cannot tell of what it is composed, except from the report of the assay master.</p>

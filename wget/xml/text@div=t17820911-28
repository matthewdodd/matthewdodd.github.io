               <p>I was left in care of Mr. Whitebread's house; on the 20th of July, the prisoner and two more came to look at the house, which was to be let. The prisoner went down into the yard, and I went with the other to shew him the house; while I was going up stairs, he came up, and went into the parlour, and took the things mentioned in the indictment: I saw the watch that instant, I missed it directly. I went out and cried stop thief, and two men took them.</p>

               <p>- King, beadle of Mary-bone produces the watch, which he found on the prisoner, and has been ever since in his custody, and which was deposed to by the prosecutrix, her name being engraved upon it.</p>

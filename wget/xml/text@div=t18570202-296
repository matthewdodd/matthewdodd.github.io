                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of West Drayton. On Monday, 19th Jan., between 12 and 1 o'clock, Felton and Rook came in, and asked me if I wanted any writing paper—I said that I would have 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth, and gave Rook a shilling, which I am sure was good—he said that he had not got change, gave me back a bad shilling, and went away directly—I told Felton that it was his mate who had changed it—he said that he had not, and he was sure it was not, for he had got <hi rend="italic">ne'er a one</hi> about him—Felton went away, and on the Wednesday following I gave the shilling to Hone, a constable—Jones stood outside the shop, and I believe he was there when Felton went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones.</hi> You said before the Magistrate that you send the shilling to get it changed by a little girl five years old. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes—I am sure she brought me back the same shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Frederick Collingridge; we are vinegar manufacturers, and live at Camberwell. The prisoner was in our service as town traveller since last May—his salary was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week—he was to go about collecting orders, and to hand me or my partner a list of them, with their residences—on the morning of the 2nd of April he</p>

               <p>handed me this list of customers and their orders—here is in it the name of Thomas East, Goldsmith-row, Hackney-road, half a hogshead of 22 vine<lb></lb>gar—we designate the quality of the vinegar by numbers, from 16 to 24—this was well known to the prisoner—the price of this vinegar to East would be about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the cask—he had no authority to sell it for a less price than that—I handed the list to my partner, that it might be executed.</p>

Potter and Collingridge as our solicitor—he called Mr. East, on the part of the prosecution, but he varied much from what he stated to me in the first instance—there have repeatedly been complaints made of orden having been obtained by the prisoner, and the persons afterwards refusing to take the goods—I have blamed the prisoner for it exceedingly—we never told him to the effect that if it happened again he should be at the cost of the articles, nor conveyed that to him—we blamed him for getting fictitious orders when the people would not take them in, and he had not seen the people—we took him last May—we exacted security from him to the amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>for us, and has increased our business considerably—he brought his con<lb></lb>nexion with him, and may have obtained us sales to the amount of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—that is quite the outside—I state that from recollection—we know all his connexions now—we have employed a party in his stead, and at the same salary—we do not mean to give up his connexion now we have got it—six months is the usual credit we give to our customers.</p>

               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When you tell us what he said, I believe you have omitted one part of what he said - did he not say he found them loose upon the floor, without any pocketbook? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 7th of March, and the weather cold? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken your great coat with you to the I heatre? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left that great coat in the care of the door-keeper? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, at the time, suspect you had left your pocket-book in your great coat pocket, and go back to search it? - A. Mr. Larkin suspected it, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in consequence of Mr. Larkin's suggestion, you did go back and search the pocket? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was sitting in the same box that you were, at one part of the entertainment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your party consisted only of yourself and Mr. Larkin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several others in that box in which you were situated? - A. The door opened in the centre, and there could not sit more than one or two at most behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the box was full? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time a great part of the audience had come away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner therefore had had an opportunity of leaving the house if he had been so disposed? - A. I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet it was nearly an hour, from the time that you missed your pocket book to the time that you apprehended him? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There were only two persons in the seat behind you? - A. That was all that I could at that time distinguish.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. On the 7th of March I went to Drury-lane to see the enterainment; I took my seat in the second tier of boxes; it was very warm; I went out to take a little air, and kicked some papers before me several times; at last I picked them up, and found them to be Bank-notes; I intended to put them into my inside coat pocket, but they had shipped inside my waistcoat; I went back into the box, and staid till the entertainment was over; when I was coming out, I saw Pickering, whom I knew; we spoke to each other, and as I was coming towards the door, Limbrick laid hold of me; Mr. Swan said, in his first examination, that he took his seat at the top of the house, and that it was there that he missed his notes, and now he swears that he was in the second tier of boxes, which is two stories from the top; as to robbing Mr. Swan, I am intirely innocent.</p>

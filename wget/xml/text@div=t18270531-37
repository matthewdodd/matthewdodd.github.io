About the latter end of September I delivered to the prisoner a box, containing the articles stated in the indictment, to take to his father, for safety (having lodgers), who lives in Tyson-street, Clerkenwell - he had promised to take care of them. I found them all except the sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure you sent them to his father on account of having lodgers? A. Yes, that was my only motive; I do not exactly know the month I delivered them to him in - I think it was the 8th of January - and about a month after that I saw his father about them.</p>

            , SEN. My son never delivered me a box containing these articles - I suppose it was brought to my house; there was a box put into my bed-room the latter end of December, I think - I do not know who brought it into the house. I opened it, but did not look at any thing in it. I gave him in charge on the 21st of April; I presume the box belonged to my sister - I cannot tell what was in it - I did not send it to my sister, and have not seen it in her possession. I have seen no duplicate in my son's possession.</p>
               <p>MRS. WHEELER. The box was brought to me by a gentleman whom I sent to inquire after it, and that gentleman brought me a duplicate.</p>

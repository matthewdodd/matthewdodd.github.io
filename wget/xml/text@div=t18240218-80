On Saturday, the 14th of February, between seven and eight o'clock at night, a pawnbroker called on me, and produced a pair of coral ear-rings, two pencil-cases, a ring, and other articles, which were mine, and had been taken from my window. I did not miss them till he produced them. I had taken stock five weeks previous, and they were safe then - the male prisoner was in my service.</p>

            . I apprehended the male prisoner at his master's - went with him to his lodgings, and in a tin box found the duplicates of the property produced. Before he knew what I came about, he told his master how sorry he was that he had taken the property from the window, but that it was through distress, and said he had employed his wife to pawn them. I found a quantity of duplicates for childrens' clothes which had been pledged before these things.</p>
               <p>MR. M'PHAEL. He had 24 s. a-week. I have since learnt that he has four children, and was in a most deplorable state.</p>

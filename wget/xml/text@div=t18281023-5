            . I am a tailor, and live in Well-street, Oxford-street. I slept in Mr. Witham's house on this night, by his consent - he was out of town; the housekeeper was there - Mr. Witham is a single man and has a house in Gower-street; I believe he rents the whole of the house in Boswell-court - Ross had to sleep in Gower-street and asked me to sleep in Boswell-court, as there was no male there: I went to bed at ten o'clock, and slept in the top room - the housekeeper slept on the same floor; I saw the doors and windows safe - I came down about a quarter to six o'clock in the morning; it was then light - I was the first person who came down (we had both gone to bed at the same time) - I found the back door open, and the sash of the kitchen window taken out altogether; I had left my boots down stairs, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROSS re-examined. I left the house about eight o'clock in the evening of the 16th, and left five sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and some silver of mine in the house, and all my clothes; I went next morning at eight o'clock and missed two blue coats, a pair of trousers, two waistcoats, a pair of silver sugar-tougs of master's, and several other things, which I know were safe the night before; I found the window out, and some table-cloths spread on the floor- I saw a blue coat and a waistcoat, which I knew to be mine, on James' back, at Bow-street, on the Friday, two days after the robbery, and the boots which James had on I was convinced were Fisher's - the coat had not been altered.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I belong to Bow-street. I received the coat from Ford; I have also a waistcoat, which I took off James myself two days after the robbery, and a pair of half-boots, which I took off his feet.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROSS. This is my coat and waistcoat.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM FISHER. These are my boots - I had left them down stairs.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HARRIS. I am a watchman of Carey-street and Boswell-court. Ross came to me about nine or ten o'clock in the morning; I had seen the prisoner James with another, about his own size, about ten minutes before five o'clock, run down Yates'-court, not very fast - they did not look suspicious; I saw nothing with them, and let them pass: James and another came down first, and then Ryan, who was a third, came after them - it was quite day-light.</p>
               <p>JAMES' Defence. I bought the clothes of a Jew in Petticoat-lane, the morning before I was taken: he had the coat and waistcoat on his arm and the boots in his hand - I asked the price of a black coat; he asked 10s. for it, and said "I have a coat and waistcoat here, which will just fit you;" he took me into a public-house - I tried them on, and bought them: he then produced the shoes, and they exactly fitted me - I gave 23s. for the whole; he said "As you have not bated me much, we will have a glass of gin."</p>

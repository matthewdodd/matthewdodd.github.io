                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and live at 4, Eliza-place, Kingsland-road. On Sunday afternoon, 29th June, about half-past 3 o'clock, I was playing with the prisoner and some other boys in the Hackney-road, throwing orange-peel at each other—I threw some at the prisoner, and he threw some at me—I do not know that I struck him—I saw a piece, which another boy threw, strike him in the face—he ran after me—I said it was not me, and he said he would show me—I thought he was playing, and stopped—he struck me on the shoulder, and flung something away; I did not see what it was—about a minute after that I found my shoulder bleeding—I gave him into custody—I saw the policeman bring a knife to the station, which I know is the prisoner's.</p>

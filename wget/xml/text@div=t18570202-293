                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. James Meacock, a gas fitter, No. 7, Snow-hill. The prisoner had been in his service, but had quitted him about a week previous to the robbery—on Wednesday evening, 14th Jan., the prisoner came about 6 o'clock—I went to the door—he asked if my master was at home—I said, "No"—he asked if Robert or George were in—I said, "Yes"—I went to the bottom of the stairs, and called Robert, and my mistress answered—I went out of the shop, and went over the way, to see for my master—I came back, the prisoner was there—I said, "Has not Robert come down?"—he said, "No"—I saw my mistress in the lobby—she said something to me—I heard the drawers of the gas room open, and heard the unions clash—I looked through a broken square of glass, and saw the prisoner in the gas room, taking the brass unions, and putting them into his back coat pocket—I rushed into the room, and laid hold of the prisoner—he put them down, and rushed out of the shop—I rushed after him, brought him back, and called for assistance—I saw the policeman take eleven unions out of the prisoner's pocket—they were worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. apiece.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 704). I was on duty near the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's that night—I saw the prisoner loitering about in front of the house—I saw him afterwards go into the house—I was away but a very few minutes, and when I came back I had lost sight of him—I waited, and saw him come out of the shop, quickly followed by the last witness—he took him back into the shop—I heard the last witness speaking loudly—I went back, and saw the witness with something in his hand, and he said to George Meacock, "See what he has been doing"—they were speaking very kindly to the prisoner, and I said to him, "These people seem very kind to you, if you have anything else give it up"—he said he had not—I searched him, and found these eleven unions in his pocket, and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and other things—the prisoner said he was in distress, and he took these things only to get a night's shelter, as he had no lodging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was employed by Mr. Meacock, and I went to his shop for my money; he offered me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I declined to receive, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I asked him for more, and he said he would see me d—first; I went to the Sheriff's Court, and it was to be heard on the 13th; I went to the shop this night, and Bromley opened the door; I asked for Mr. Meacock, and he said he was not at home; I asked for Robert, and he said, "Come inside;" I did go inside, and the conversation we had was, he said, "I think the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> means to serve me as he has done Blackhall and French;" they were two men whom he had discharged on the Saturday night, and not paid them, and Blackhall's wife came on the Saturday night</p>

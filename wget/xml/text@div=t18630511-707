                  </hi>. I was lodging at 127, Caledonian-road—I am now stopping at a coffee-house, opposite the Clerkenwell Police-court—at half-past 1 on Sunday morning, 13th April, I was in Pentonville-road—I saw Cole—I asked him the way to the Caledonian-road—he said he was going that way, and would show me, and we walked along together—I told him I was a stranger—when I got to No, 127, he asked me for something for showing me the way—I told him I had not any money; then he said you have enough to pay 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a glass of beer—I told him I had not—then he pressed me and said he would stand two glasses of beer, and after a great deal of pressing I went—he led me up-some turning leading to a square—Mathews immediately ran up and pretended to fight—Cole asked me to assist—when we got to the top of the road, one of them, I cannot tell which, struck me on the breast, and knocked me on the ground—then they took my hat, cigar-case, and ring—Mathews put his hand in my pocket—I called out "Murder!" and he put his hand over my mouth, then they ran away, and I after them, crying, "Stop thief!"—I saw them about ten minutes after, when they were caught by a policeman and two other people—I am quite sure they are the two men—before they did this I bad taken no part whatever in the fighting.</p>

I live at 213, Caledonian-road, and am an engraver—about 2 o'clock on the morning in question, I heard a rattle, and saw the prisoners running—I stopped Cole—he said, "If you do not let me go, I will give you something," and struck me on the side—I saw Mathews stopped by a friend of mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cole's Defence.</hi> I had been to a concert, and as I was coming home this young gentleman says, "Can yon tell me the way to Caledonian-road—I said, "Yes, I am going there, I will show you where it is"—there were three females standing with him, one had her arm round his neck and the other had hold of his hand. When going up the Caledonian-road, I asked him whereabouts he lived. He said, the first house over the bridge, and I took him to the door. He had been drinking, and was the worse for liquor. I asked him to give me something for showing him home. He said, "No; I should like to have something to drink." I said, "You cannot get any<lb></lb>thing to drink." He says we can get some ginger-beer. We went to get some, And turning round the square, I said, "You might give me a trifle for bringing you home?" He look off his coat and says, "I will give you some of this," and he took off his hat in mistake. We were both the worse for liquor.</p>

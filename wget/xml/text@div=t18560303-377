I was stationed at Walworth, and sergeant Newell also—about 7 o'clock that evening I was in Eyre-street, and saw the prisoner come out of a butcher's shop—I suspected and watched her—she went in front of the shop, where a woman was standing with a child in her arms, and what she did with that woman induced me still to watch her—she left that shop, and went down Eyre-street, into High-street—I followed her up Beresford-street to the railway station—she went in, stopped two or three minutes, came out again, and I followed her into Green-lane, and into Flower-street, then into Mr. Tipley's, a large grocer's shop, where there were a number of people, and went in and out two or three times—she then went in front of the shop, where there was a lot of salt pork for sale, which two or three other women were looking at—she held a piece of pork in her left hand, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> herself against the prosecutrix, then held the pork up, and said something to the shopman about the price, and said that it would not do—she then <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> her left hand towards the prosecutrix's dress, and it came up with her elbow towards her person—she came across the road, and I saw her with a purse in her hand—she crossed the road, and went as fast as she could towards the railway station—I followed as fast as she went, and Newell was on her right side—I caught hold of her hand as she was putting 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver into her pocket, and asked her where she got it—she said that it was her husband's hard earnings—Newell was holding her other hand—I did not see the purse at that time—I took ber to the station, and after the money was token from her, the inspector asked her if she had got any more money—she said, "No"—after that I was going across the station yard to the room where females are searched—the female searcher was with her, and she commenced scuffling, and a half sovereign dropped from her—another purse with 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver was found in her other hand—the inspector asked her her address, and she said, "18, Brick-lane, Whitechapel"—I went there, but could learn no tidings of her.</p>

On 16th Feb. in the evening I was on duty with the last witness in Eyre-street, Woolwich, and saw the prisoner—I afterwards saw her coming out of Tipley's shop—she went to a board where some pork was lying for sale, stood by a female, and appearw to be feeling her dress on the left side—she had a piece of pork in her right hand—we followed her a short distance, and saw her emptying some</p>

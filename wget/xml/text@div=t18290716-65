            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. I was sent for to take the female at Mr. Mathews' - I locked her up, and went to her lodging, No. 4, Philip-lane; I then asked her where she got these stockings; she said her husband gave them to her, and that he was a hawker - I asked where he was; she said he was in the country, and had bought the stockings in the course of business; I locked her up, and went to her lodging with Mathews - they both said they lived there; the female said she lived at No. 4, Philip-lane, but I found it was No. 4, Bird-court, Philip-lane - the male prisoner came in while we were searching; Mr. Ward was sent for and gave charge of him - I told him it was on suspicion of robbing Mr. Ward; he made no reply, but asked if he might change his clothes - I said, Yes; I found in the lodging some night-caps, stockings, braces, cuffs, sheetings, and bags; Mr. Ward identified them - the prisoner said nothing while we were finding them, but on the way to Guildhall he exclaimed, "Oh, my God! What shall I do? it will break my poor father's heart; bad company has brought me to it - I did it to extricate myself from a little trouble;" he then asked what he must say before the Justice - I said he must act for himself; he was remanded - he asked me if Ward and Brittle had sworn to any of the property; I said they had - he then said, "Recollect, the nap coating don't belong to them - I bought the coating and my wife bought the cotton."</p>

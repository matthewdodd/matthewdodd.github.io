               <p>I am a wheel-wright. I work in Church-lane. The prosecutor's house faces my garden; I got up and went to the window to see what weather it was; I saw the prisoner and another woman coming down the walk; the other woman had this bag under her right-arm; it was empty. As they walked past my house they seemed to go a-tip-toe; when they got round the house I saw them again at the back window. They went to Mr. Brown's door, and I saw the other lift up the latch of the street door; they went to the next door and tried the latch of that. They went to Mr. Batty's; there they tried the latch; it was bolted. They came back to Mr. Brown's, and the other went in at the garden door; they got into the wash-house, where these things were. The prisoner stood on the outside while the other was packing up these things; the prisoner went into the wash-house to her; I saw them both come out. I came out of the door and called out Mr. Brown, you are robbed. He did not hear me for some time; I then came out to stop them, upon which they carried the things to the place they took them from, and came back empty-handed; I stopped them and asked them if they had got any thing? They said no. They went away. A person went after them and stopped them, and they were put into Whitechapel watch-house.</p>

               <p>To Scotcher. Was it light at this time? - Yes, I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

            . My father has eight houses opposite of Mr. Mayor's building. On Saturday, the 27th of August, I saw a man come to the area of one of Mr. Mayor's houses; I saw him draw a fir joist out of the front area; he put it on his shoulder, and carried it away; I followed him into the Edgware-road; he took it into Watts' premises; Watts was on the premises. I heard nothing that passed. Watts sells wood and coals. I gave information at Marlborough-street office. I knew Shackell to be the man that took the fir joist out of the area, and carried it to Mr. Watts' premises.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KRENE. I am a servant to Mr. Markey. I saw Shackell come and take the joist out of Mr. Mayor's front area of one of his houses. I am positive to his person. I saw him draw the joist from the area; he then put it on his shoulder; I followed him; he took it to Watts's yard; Shackell left the joist at Watts's yard.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HORNEY. I am a constable. I apprehended Watts in his own yard; I saw the joist there, there were six joists there I apprehended Watts on this charge. I told him he must go before the magistrate with me; he said, where to; I said, Marlborough-street. He said he would endeavour to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140058"></xptr>find out the person he bought the joists of. I and Watts were going along Oxford-street together, Shackell came up to him; Watts then said, this is the man I bought the joists of. I told Shackell he must go with me; he said, I had no business to take him. I shewed him my staff; he set off running. Mr. Watts then laid hold of him, to prevent him going away; Mr. Watts and I took Shackell to the office. At the office, Watts was bailed, and surrendered here this morning.</p>
               <p>Watts called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

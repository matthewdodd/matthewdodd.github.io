            . I live in Henrietta-street, Hackney-road. On the 26th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, I met with the prisoner at the corner of Golden-lane; she asked me to give her something to drink, I did; she then asked me to give her something to eat; we went into an eating-house in Golden-lane, we staid there about twenty minutes, we then proceeded along towards <placeName id="t18100606-84-crimeloc463">Old-street</placeName>

After she had passed the watchman, I told him what she had done; she was taken and searched, and nothing was found; the prisoner was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your note and your purse again - A. Yes, in about an hour and a half after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, while you were in this court with her that your dress was in the same state as it is now - A. No, not in the exact state.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Jekyll—we live in Oxford-street, Chelsea—I keep a laundry—I have employed the prisoner five years—I found a handkerchief in pawn, and gave her into custody—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) had been given me to wash—this is the handkerchief which I missed on the 11th of Sept.—it would go through her hands as ironer—I missed this shirt, it was sent to me to wash—the prisoner would have an opportunity of getting these things.</p>

            . On the 9th of January, I sent a quantity of goods in a basket from my house, in the Borough, by the van, to my shop at Brighton; they were worth 38 l., among the rest were eighteen pair of women's boots - on the following week I received information that one of my shopmen was in custody; and on the 17th, I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, Cirencester-place, Fitzroy-square; the officer asked if she had any boots or shoes in her possession - she said not; we found a pair of boots in her drawer. She then said she had bought them in Cranbourn-alley. When we got to the office, I asked to see the boots she had on, and they were also mine - she then acknowledged receiving them from my shopman; these were not taken from the basket - but those found at her lodgings were.</p>

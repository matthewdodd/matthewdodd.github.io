On 29th January Westwood and I began watching the prisoners in the morning and saw Holden and another man outside the Throe Crowns, Old Jewry—I went inside and Holden and Dow came in and drank (Dow has been discharged)—they went out and Frost joined them—they had a truck there—Holden and Frost went in again and had some beer with Dow and came out and went away—I followed Frost to the Guildhall Tap, Guildhall Yard—he went in and joined Moore—they had some conversation and drank together, and Frost came out—on Wednesday, the 30th, I saw Moore and Frost at the Guildhall Tap in the morning, and in the evening at the Poulterers' Arms, Cheapside—I was with Westwood on the 31st, and saw Holden and another man in the Old Jewry with a <hi rend="italic">trolly</hi> and some baskets—Holden</p>

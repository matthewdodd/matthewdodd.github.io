I saw my things safe on Wednesday, the 1st of December, at five o'clock in the afternoon, and at eight next morning I missed them; the trunk had been forced; the prisoner slept on board that night, but I had slept on shore. When I returned in the morning, at eight o'clock, he was gone. I saw some of the things again on board the ship, in possession of the officer; he had the jacket, waistcoat, two pairs of trowsers, and the handkerchief; the prisoner was then in custody. The ship lay in the Export Dock.</p>

I observed that he looked bulky, and asked what clothes he had on; he said none but his own; he had three pairs of trowsers on, two pairs of which were claimed by Green - he had two jackets - one of which Green claimed. He had three waistcoats, and in the jacket pocket there was a handkerchief, and a pair of braces; the prisoner said they were all his own - but I did not believe him. I asked what ship he belonged to; he said the Posthumous; I took the things, and went on board the ship. Green swore to them. I saw the chest in the forecastle, which had been broken open, and an iron instrument lying near it, which corresponded with the marks on the chest - in the long boot, by the side, there was a red night cap, which Green claimed; also the shoes on the prisoner's feet; the shoes in his hand were his own.</p>

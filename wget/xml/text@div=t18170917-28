On the 18th of August, I received a letter inclosing a 10l. note - I cannot read-the prisoner came into my room and read it for me. I put the note into a tin box with a gold ring; the prisoner breakfasted in my room-as he was removing I accommodated him with water; he then went out and returned in about an hour and a half, saying he was going to fetch a broker to sell his furniture-The broker took the goods; the prisoner went out with him; he returned again saying, he was ill, and asked me to give him some water for his tea, which I did; he stopped a long time; it was geting late and rained very hard; he went out to buy some stockings, I went with him, and returned; he supped with me and seemed to stop a long time; I took the note out and put it in again; the prisoner said he wished he had a 10l. note. I then asked him to go home, he said it rained very hard and he had the tooth-ache, and I was a hard-hearted woman to turn him out of doors, as he did not know where to go for he could not get into his lodgings, and if I would let him lay on a chair in my room, and make a fire, he would recompense me. I could not get him out, and let him sit up on a chair, I had told him he should not, but he would. I took my pocket off and put it under my pillow. In the morning, about four o'clock, I felt his hand under my pillow, I asked him what he was doing, he said he was raising my head as it was too low (my husband is at sea), I told him I always laid so, he said he wished it was day-light; I told him it was light. He then said he had to go over the water. I believe he went away about five o'clock - He said he would return at nine o'clock. I got up at eight o'clock and found my pocket untied, and the box, with the note and ring, gone; I gave the alarm. The prisoner was no acquaintance of mine - He would stop in the room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. My husband is at sea. I did not want him to stop; there was nothing wrong between us; I do not cohabit with him. The money had been left me by my uncle.</p>
               <p>ELIZA LANKINALL. On the 19th of August, the prisoner came to my house at eight o'clock in the morning, and paid me 2l. 12s., which he had owed me for five years, he gave me a 10l. note, saying, that if I would change it he would pay me. I gave the same note to Croston, to get it changed at Anderson's.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CROSTON. I received the note, and took the same one to Anderson and changed it.</p>

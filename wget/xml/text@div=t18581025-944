                  </hi>. I am a card-cutter of 53, Old-street, St. Luke's. On Monday evening, 4th October, about half-past 8 o'clock, I was going home with a pair of boots under my arm—I began to run; when I arrived op<lb></lb>posite No. 3, somebody came behind me and pinched my throat, so that I could not breathe; he snapped at my guard and ran away—I was close at his heels—a witness captured him; somebody else rescued him—I went with a policeman and my father, but could not find him—but on Sunday I pointed him out—he worked at Waterlow's cutting-hall, and I work at the paper-hall—I have known him three or four years, and am quite sure it was the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 100, Old-street—I was in the street, heard a cry of "Stop thief" and saw the prisoner running; I followed him, and he was caught at the corner of Baldwin-street, but three or four more</p>

               <p>came and rescued him—he started again, and I caught him at the top of Baldwin-street, and held him three or four minutes; but three or four men came up; one of them punched me in the neck and the prisoner escaped—I am sure he is the man.</p>

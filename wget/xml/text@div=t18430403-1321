                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and was lately employed on board a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Barrett, Jun.</hi>—I was discharged from her in China, and received a paper for my wages—I lost the paper and my clothes on my passage home—I arrived in England about ten weeks ago, in the <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi>, a merchant vessel—on my arrival I applied to Mr. Soames, the owner of the <hi rend="italic">Barrett, Jun.</hi>, for my wages, and they would not give them me on account of the loss of my paper—they desired me to get two securities, and an affidavit—I went to the Thames police to make an affidavit, and there I saw a man named Kelly—he touched me on my shoulder, and took me to a public-house—he took me that night to the prisoner, who is landlord of the Black Horse, at Cock-hill, Ratcliffe-highway—I went with the prisoner and Kelly before the Lord Mayor, to make an affidavit—I was then lodging at the Black Horse—Kelly was to have come with me as security to Mr. Soames, but he got to high words with Soames, and Soames would not take him—the prisoner showed me a paper which he had signed, with a Mr. Johnson, a person whom the prisoner had obtained to put his name to it as security—I went with that paper, and the prisoner to Mr. Soames's office, in Ratcliffe-highway, not far from the house where I was stopping, on the 18th of Feb., and Mr. Soames's clerk paid me a cheque—I signed my name on the cheque—I was going to take it up myself, and the prisoner took it up before me—he took it from the hand of Soame's clerk—I then went with the prisoner to Williams's, the bankers in the City, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he had the cheque, and when we got to the banker's door he jumped out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> directly, and said nothing to me—he went to the bank directly, and I stopped in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> a bit—I did not know which was the bank—I thought it was a public-house, or something—after a while the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man said, "Why don't you go in and get your money?"—I then followed the prisoner in, and when I got in he was just coming out, and putting the notes in his pocket-book—he said to me "It is all right, my lad "—the cheque was for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had not given him permission to put in</p>

            . I am in partnership with John Sloane and others. The prisoner had been in our employ seventeen years. In consequence of information I went to his lodging with Avis, and found this bacon, cheese, and eggs - Avis said to him, "How did you become possessed of this bacon?" he made no answer; I then said, "Who does it belong to?" he said, "I suppose to you, Sir," - there had been no threat or promise made to him - he was taken to our house, and asked where he had taken the bacon from - he said from behind the counting-house, the cheese from the front-board in the shop, and the eggs from the baskets - he bore a good character before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you a partner of the name of Leadham? A. Yes, it was in his house we took the prisoner. I did not see any thing given to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was present when Mr. Wells had this conversation with the prisoner, and when he was taken to the warehouse he begged for mercy - I cautioned him not to tell any thing - Mr. Leadham said, in my presence, that he was very sorry he was one who had been robbing them as he had offered him 10l. to impeach others - he said, "Take a glass of ale, but I must serve you as I do others."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brighton-street, Cromer-street. On the night of the 23rd of Nov. I met with two females, who were tried in this Court—I went with them to the Crown, and had a quartern of gin—we then went to a house—I sat on the bed, and went to sleep—I had a handkerchief and ten shillings in my pocket, and a hat on my head—when I awoke and came out of the room, they were all gone—I have known the prisoner for years—I saw him in the room when the policemen awoke me—he came into the room, and said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi>, have you been touched up?"—the women had not been lying on the bed with me, I had been by myself, and my mate was by the side of me, sitting in a chair—I saw the prisoner after I was robbed, and the girls had left.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to the house with Cooper—the two girls were there—I locked the door, took off my coat, and was going to lie down—the door was burst open, the two girls came in, and laid down on the side of Cooper—the prisoner was in front of two other men, at the door, when the girls robbed Cooper—that was immediately after the door was burst open—I saw the girls rob Cooper, and the prisoner swore he would break my b—head if I said a word—the girls shut the door after they had robbed Cooper—I went in a short time, and got the policemen—they awoke Cooper—the prisoner ran in, and said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Cooper, have you been touched up?"—I am sure that when the girls robbed Cooper, the prisoner was at the door.</p>

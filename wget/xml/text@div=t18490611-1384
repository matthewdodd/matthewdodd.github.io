Last Tuesday week, about a quarter-past two, he sent me out with five watches; one was put into each waistcoat pocket, and three into my trowsers pocket-just as I got to the railway arch in Bermondsey-street I saw the prisoner sitting under the shade of it, and just as I got up to him he struck me on the shoulder, and knocked me down—he had not said anything—he tried to get at my waistcoat-pocket; my jacket was not buttoned—I <hi rend="italic">called</hi> out," Police"—the police came round the corner, and he ran away—I had seen the pri<lb></lb>soner before, and kneu him well by sight, being up and down Tooley-street—I went back with the policeman to my master's.</p>

On the 1st of September, between nine and eleven o'clock in the day time, I met the prisoner and another woman in the street; we went to a public-house, and had some liquor and some coffee. I was not quite sober; I laid my head on the table, and went to sleep. I awoke in about an hour, and the prisoner was then gone; I missed my handkerchief out of my hat; also a key, a tobacco-stopper, and 3s., from my pocket. I saw the prisoner again on the 3d of September, in Tottenham-court-road, with the handkerchief round her neck; it has not my name on it, but I knew it by this mark, which had been made in my presence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met this man with another woman; we went to a public-house at the corner of Charles-street, and had five half-pints of gin between three of us. I was perfectly sober, but the other woman was very sick, and she went out; he lent her that blue handkerchief to wipe her face with - we then went to another house, and when I got out I found the handkerchief in my hand, but I was in liquor before I parted with him - he went to the bar to change a sovereign, but the landlady said he had got silver in his hand.</p>

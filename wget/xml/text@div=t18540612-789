                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 74). On 16th May I was on duty at Norwood—about a quarter past 2 o'clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner going by the side of the road—I was in uniform, and was twenty or thirty yards from him—I saw him drop from his hand a purse—I went to him and asked him what he threw in the ditch—he said he had not dropped anything—I told him I saw him drop something, and told him to come back—he refused at first—I took hold of him and brought him book to the spot—at that time sergeant Marsh came up, and he saw the puree lie where I saw the prisoner drop it—sergeant Marsh picked it up and opened it—it contained three counterfeit shillings and four counterfeit sixpences—I asked the prisoner how he became possessed of it—he denied knowing anything about it—he afterwards admitted that he found it; that he picked it up at some little distance down the road—he said he lodged in Gray's-inn-road, but he could not tell any persons, names, or any court or row—this is the puree and money.</p>

On 7th April the prisoner came, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I served him with half a pint of porter and a screw of tobacco—he laid down a shilling—I looked at it, and told him it was bad—I bent it double, and gave it him back—my father asked him to let him look at it, which he did, and my lather said he should keep it—the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

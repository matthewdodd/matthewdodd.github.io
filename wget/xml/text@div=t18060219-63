               <p>Q. How soon. - A. Not more than five or six minutes; I verily believe the prisoner at the bar is the same man that took the cloth, and that was brought back to my shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the whole house. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the man again. - A. I did not see the face of the man, but from his height, and having an apron on, it is like him.</p>

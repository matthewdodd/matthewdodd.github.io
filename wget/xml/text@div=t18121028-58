I met the prisoner Bays on the foot pavement; she took hold on my arms, and Bailey came before me, and took the watch out of my pocket. I extricated myself from the woman that held my arms, and ran after the woman that took my watch she went into No 4 I followed her in, and the woman that keeps the house asked me where I was going. I told her that a woman had gone into that place that had robbed me of my watch. She told me there was no such thing. I left the house, and took the number of the door; there was a crowd, and some one asked me if I knew the woman, and they would make a search. I said, wanted to know the house, to get a proper officer to make a search.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these women before - A. Yes, by eye-sight. I go by Dyot-street three times a day, sometimes to go to work. I am quite sure these are the two women.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch - A. No. I went to Bow-street, and reported it to the officers. I watched for two or three days to see it I could see them. On Tuesday evening, I went into the Maidenhead public-house. I saw both the prisoners in the tap-room I went directly for an officer, and we took them in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did either of the women live there - A. I do not pretend to say whether they did, or did not. I have seen them many times in Dyot-street. The prosecutor was very drunk; he said she had run out of the back door, and there is no back door to the house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was not drunk. I told him I did not know them, because I would get a proper officer, that would do me more justice than he would, and that is the reason.</p>

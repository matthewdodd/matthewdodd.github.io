             is the landlord of the house, and lives in it, we have the front-room on the ground floor - the prisoner lived in the front-room first floor, over me. On the 3d of November, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I put my watch safe in a little box, on the table by my bed side, and then went out, double-locked the door, and put a nail over the latch - my husband went out before me. I returned about a quarter after eight o'clock, and found the door locked, but the staple drawn out, and the nail also drawn out from over the latch - anybody could draw the nail out - it could not easily be seen - I could not find it. My husband had not come home. I found the staple lying on the ground, and the little box lying on the ground, and my husband's watch gone - it was silver. The prisoner had been in my room the day before, and asked what o'clock it was, I took the watch out of the box, and said it wanted a quarter to eight - she saw me put the watch back into the box. When I missed it, I ran up to her, and asked if she had heard anybody break into my room. She said</p>
               <p>"Oh dear, Mrs. Allen, No, that I have not" - she was in bed. She got up, and persuaded me not to go to any pawnbroker's, as she said, she once lost a pair of sheets, and went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020032"></xptr>look for them, but could never find them, and it would be useless going to any pawnbroker's. She lived only in the house nine days - Simpson was at home at the time. The prisoner is a married woman, but her husband did not live with her.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Pelham-street, close to Allen. I am a weaver, and work for Messrs. Jeffreys and Cox, St. Paul's Church-yard. On the 3d of November, I went there, and found the prisoner at the scales, waiting for work. I had known her about seven months. She passed me and went to the door, returned and called me out, and said it would be a long while before it came to my turn to served, as several people were waiting. She desired I would ask what colour her cane was to be, as she wanted to go out for half a day's work, and asked me bring it home for her. I said I would. I went and had a pint of beer with her, at the Swan with Two Necks. She then said she had a watch which belonged to her first husband, and if I would buy it, I should have it for 30 s. I said I would give her 10 s. then, and 1 l. next week. She gave it to me. It was then half-past eleven o'clock. When I got home, I heard of the robbery. I shewed the prosecutor the watch, and he claimed it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 3d of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, I took the prisoner into custody, at her lodgings. I searched, and found 6 s. 2 d. on her. I asked how she got it, she said it was part of the money she sold the watch for. I asked how she got possession of the watch; she said she met an old woman picking up bones in the street, and she gave her the watch to pledge for her. I asked her why she did not pawn it; she said she went to one pawnbroker's, where she saw the prosecutor, and turned out again. I asked her what became of the old woman; she said, when she came out she was gone, and she saw no more of her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter, and live at 9, Mare-street, Hackney—On 3d April, about 12 o'clock at night, I was passing along Bishopsgate-street—the prisoner accosted me and asked me to go down a turning—I went a few yards, and I felt her hand inside my breast pocket—I put my</p>

               <p>hand in my pocket and missed my pocket-book—she ran away and I ran after her—I fell down—when I got up I saw her in the arms of a policeman—there were nineteen sovereigns in the pocket-book—I had a half-sovereign and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my waistcoat pocket—when I got up to them she put the pocket-book into my pocket again—I was sober—I never saw the prisoner in my life before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 615). On 3d April, about 12 o'clock at night, I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street—when I came to the corner of Great St. Helen's, I saw the prisoner run round a corner about twenty-five yards down St. Helen's—I heard something drop which sounded like gold—I ran after her, took hold of her arm, and asked her what she had been doing—she said "Nothing"—at that moment the prosecutor ran round the corner, and the prisoner then put the book back in his pocket—I am perfectly sure that I saw her do that—the prosecutor asked me to count the contents of the pocket-book, because the prisoner had robbed him of a pocket-book containing nineteen sovereigns—I counted, and there were but sixteen in it—I went down about ten yards lower, where I had heard something drop, and there I found two sovereigns, making eighteen altogether—I found nothing else—I took her to the station house—there was a florin and a half-crown received from the female searcher—the prosecutor appeared to be sober—he was in a very flurried state; trembling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you or another officer pick up the two sovereigns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; there were no other persons near when I saw you run round the corner and drop the sovereigns, but after you were taken, there were some other people passing, as there generally are—I never told the other officer that he was a fool to let two other women go, because you were all three together.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on my own property on Blackheath-hill. I was at the Swan public-house on the 7th of Feb.—I waa sober—I do not exactly know who I met at the public-house—I saw the prisoner there—I did not drink with him—I did not tell the Magistrate that I got drunk with the prisoner—I deny that charge altogether.</p>

I keep the Swan at Greenwich—I remember the prosecutor being there on the 7th of Feb.—I gave the prosecutor change for a sovereign—the prisoner was then sitting on the left-hand side of the prosecutor—I did not see him do anything—there was a policeman in the house, and I called his attention to what was going on, as I thought the prisoner was sitting closer to the prosecutor than he ought—I then went into the tap-room—I cannot say that the prosecutor was sober—he was the worse for liquor.</p>

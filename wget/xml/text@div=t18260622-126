On the 19th of May, when I went to bed, I took off my clothes, and this money was in my pocket; he got up next morning about half-past five o'clock, and when I got up my money was gone from my pocket; I saw him about half-past seven or eight o'clock that morning, at his mother's; I asked him if he was not ashamed to take the money from a poor boy like me - he seemed astonished, and swore a great many oaths that he did not know any thing about it; he came to his lodgings soon afterwards, and I sent for a constable, who felt his pockets, but could not find it; when he was gone people advised me to go for him again, and when he came I stripped him, and half-a-crown was found in his shirt tail, which he said he had saved up to buy his Sunday dinner; at last he owned it was mine, and that he had paid 2s. at a public-house - he said if I would wait till Monday he would pay me the rest.</p>

I was sent for; this half-crown was found on the prisoner; I took him to the watch-house, and asked him where the purse was that the money had been in; he said he had thrown it away at the corner of George-street; I happened to be there about an hour afterwards, and looked down an area, where I found this bag, in which the money had been; he said he had paid away part of the money at a public-house in Little Newport-street.</p>

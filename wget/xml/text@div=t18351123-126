I am a policeman, The prosecutor lived in Duck-lane with the prisoner, who, I believe, is his wife—I heard the cry of "Murder" on the morning of the 13th of November—It appeared to be in No. 2, Duck-lane—I went to the prisoner's house, and saw her in the street—I said her, "What is the matter now?"knowing the noise pro<lb></lb>ceeded from her room—she said, "Why, nothing, only the old man drunk again"—I stood listening for five or ten minutes, and heard the cries get fainter—I went up stairs, and found him lying bleeding—he was all over blood—I asked him what was the matter—the prisoner was not present—I came down stairs again, and saw the prisoner—I said to her, "You have been stabbing him again"—she said, "Serve him right, he had no bu<lb></lb>siness to throttle me"—I took her into custody, and afterwards took the man to the hospital—the prosecutor is not here.</p>

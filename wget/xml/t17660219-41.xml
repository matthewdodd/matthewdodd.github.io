I went into the room, and there found 14 pictures, which just before were hanging up in their places in the room, lying on the table, packed up ready to be taken away. The prisoner said two boys put him into the room, that they would have beat him, and he got in to screen himself: after that he said his hat was thrown in, and he got in for it. The room had been washed, and the sash was put a little way up, so that he could get his hands under it, and sling it up: it was quite up when I went to see what was missing in the room.</p>
               <p>Ric hard Thame. About half an hour after 5, on the first of this month, I was going to see what o'clock it was; I saw a lad standing opposite to the prosecutor's window. I went to the window, and saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards in the room: he came up to the window to me and said, what do you please to have sir. I went about four yards farther to call my fellow apprentice. The prisoner jumped out at the window, and ran up the lane. I pursued and took him about 20 yards from the place: he told the prosecutor some boys were going to lick him, so he got in there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman 69, G.</hi>) I was on duty in Old-street at half-past 12 at night on the 23d August—I went past the prosecutor's bouse—it was quite secure—I went round my beat and in about half an hour I returned again—I then tried the doors, and on trying the middle door, which leads to the bar, it went open, and immediately I heard some one moving—I said "Halloo, ma'am, I thought you was gone to bed"—I was answered by the prisoner who said, "It is all right, I have only come in for a glass of ale"—there was no light, it was all dark; I stood just inside the door—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there and she again repeated that it was all right, she had only come in for a glass of ale—I called and the landlord came down—I asked him if he knew the prisoner, he said, "No, I never saw her in my life"—he gave her in charge and I took her to the station—the house is in St. Luke's parish.</p>

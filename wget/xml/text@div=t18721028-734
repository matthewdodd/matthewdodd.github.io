                  </hi>. I am a plumber of 18, Suffolk Road, Dalston—about 3.45 on the day in question, I cannot say the date, I was in St. Thomas's Passage, and heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> between the prisoner and Georgina Peel—Mrs. Peel was the worse for liquor of the two—they had both been drinking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280017"></xptr>
               <p>together in the morning as well as in the afternoon—Mrs. Peel called the prisoner a b—y rotten liar, and the prisoner shoved her up against a high fence with her hand, and. said "I ain't rotten, and never was rotten"—she did not fall, she only rolled against the fence and then walked away—the prisoner followed her, struck her, and she fell against, a barrow—she got up and said "Pray don't strike me any more, I am too drunk"—the prisoner hit her again on the head, and she fell against the upright flag stone of the urinal at the public-house—she then rolled over, and never moved or spoke afterwards—two men picked her up and took her into her own house—the prisoner lives in the same house in the front parlour—as the deceased was being carried in the prisoner was rolling her sleeves up, and she said she would kill her or anybody else that called her out of her name—two men who took some brandy to her said that she was dead—I saw no more.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They both lived in one of my father's houses—they were always on the best of terms—the prisoner Is a widow and a tailoress; she has one child—Mrs. Peel gave her mind to drink very much, and when drunk she was very quarrelsome—she induced the prisoner to drink with her sometimes—Mrs. Peel did not strike at the prisoner; she wanted to get away—she did not hold up her fist—the deceased was not rolling about, but she had had as much as she could manage to walk along with—she was not very steady.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 2, Duke Street—on Monday afternoon, 16th September, there was a quarrel between the prisoner and deceased about a man named Taylor in St. Thomas's Passage, and, after the quarrel, Mrs. Peel called the, prisoner a rotten whore—the prisoner said she would not be called such, names by her or any other, woman, and struck her twice—I cannot tell where the blow fell, it was so quickly done—Mrs. Peel ran behind a barrow, and said "Don't hit me, Moore, because I am drunk—she reeled from behind the barrow, and the prisoner hit her again; it appeared to me to be on the side of the head, and she fell down flat on her right side heavily—she did not speak or move—I thought she had fainted; the blow seemed so slight you would not think she was dead—she was tipsy—they were always good friends, and she lived in the house—they had been friendly to half an hour before—the deceased was married.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She has one son married—she is a respectable woman in her way, and very well conducted, not quarrelling with people—I have known her to be up at 4 0'clock in the morning at needle work—Mrs. Peel was of a quarrelsome disposition, and used to get tipsy—the prisoner never got tipsy except when Mrs. Peel coaxed her to drink—she said that morning "No, Peel, I have got to get my work done; I cannot come out"—the window was open—followed the deceased into the house, and the prisoner Had her hand in hers—she said "No, Mrs. Horley, I have seen her so before; I am sure she is not dead"—she was trying to do her all the good she could—she appeared to be very sorry; tears were rolling down her eyes—the deceased may have fallen from drink, the blow was so slight—I live directly opposite, and saw it.</p>

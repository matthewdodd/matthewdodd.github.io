                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, and live in Wapping. On 9th Oct. there was a disturbance in Wapping-street, about five minutes before 4 o'clock—there was a crowd, and they were abusing a gentleman named Hoare—the prisoners were taking the greatest part in the crowd—I did not say anything, except asking them to go away, and George Carter immediately struck me three blows in the right eye—they were heavy blows, and cut my eye—Robert Carter immediately followed it by three other blows, one on my head, one on my neck, and one on my eye—they were heavy blows, and knocked me down—the prisoners were sober enough to know what they were about—before I could get up they ran away towards the entrance of the London Docks—the bridge was at that time open to admit vessels going in, being high water—I followed the prisoners, with a view to speak to the foreman of the bridge, to tell him to keep the bridge open till I could get assistance—I had an opportunity of seeing the prisoners well, and I can swear to them—on my following them they took me round the waist, and threw me on the flat of my back, in the middle of the road—I got up, and ran away into Mr. Oliver's, an ironmonger, in Wapping, for protection—I went through the gates into the centre of the warehouse—the prisoners followed me—Robert Carter came behind me, and took me round the waist, and George Carter came before me, and took hold of me likewise, and while they had hold of me I felt my watch going out of my pocket—I grasped at my watch, to try to save it, and the guard broke—I saved a small part of it on my watch—the other part I felt drawn off my neck, and that was gone—the prisoners then ran away—I cannot say whose hand the guard was in—it was a gold one—the larger part of it went—it cost 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I looked on the ground, but could not find it.</p>

HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the other part of the guard here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I could not swear who took the guard—when I got up to the prisoners I did not see any fighting—Robert Carter appeared as if he had been fighting; I cannot tell with whom—Mr. Hoare was there, and he is here to-day—he was examined before the Magistrate—I know him—he is an extensive wharfinger—there was a considerable crowd there, so as to stop the thoroughfare—I went up to tell them to go away—I had business to transact opposite the house, and seeing Mr. Hoare there I said to him, "What is the matter?"—Mr. Hoare said, "Some of those fellows are fighting again"—the two prisoners were afterwards pointed out as being the persons who were fighting—I merely advised them to go away—I said, "Why can't you go away?"—I did not push them—I did not observe that any one else did—they were in the middle of this crowd—one of them struck me—I did not return the blow, I had no time—I do not say what I might have done—I was compelled to fall down, they having knocked me down—they were compelled to run away—this might be from eighty to a hundred yards from the bridge—the crowd made way for the prisoners to go away—the crowd followed them—I went up to them again, and was taken round the waist, and thrown on my back, just before we came to the bridge—that might be fifty yards from Mr. Oliver's warehouse—I came back this fifty yards, and got to the ware house—the prisoners followed me in—the crowd did not follow in—Mr. Oliver's man saw what was doing, and he called other men, and</p>

               <p>stopped the crowd coining in, but they were not in time to stop the prisoners coming in—I did not call for assistance, it was no use to call out against a mob—Mr. Oliver was there himself—no others came in-—they were stopped by a body of Mr. Oliver's men—he keeps a great many—after the prisoners had done all this they ran away—they had to run perhaps 300 yards to the public house where they were taken—we followed them for some time round the neighbourhood with the policeman—we went into the public house yard—I believe it was the Ship and Punch Bowl—there was a struggle between them and me in the warehouse, when I felt my watch going—I did not go into the warehouse after the prisoners; I went in, and they followed me—I had had a bit of a squabble with them at the iron bridge—I was knocked down, and I took refuge in Mr. Oliver's warehouse—there was a person named Case there—he was in the crowd.</p>

I and another officer took the prisoners into custody, in the rear of the Ship and Punch Bowl, at Wapping—George Carter was just outside the door of the water closet—Robert asked what I was taking him for—I said for assault and robbery, and he said, "Oh, I did not have his chain"—neither Mr. Jolly nor we had said a word about the chain then.</p>

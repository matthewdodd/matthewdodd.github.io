I am footman in the service of the Colombian Minister, and reside in his house; I was called upon on Friday morning, the 14th of March - I know the room which is called the office; I had put the shutters of that room too on Wednesday evening, but did not put the bar up - it was sometimes fastened and sometimes not; the sash was only down, and not fastened; it was not open at all on Thursday to my knowledge - I went to bed on Thursday night at about half past twelve o'clock; the house was all secure at that time - the plate was in its usual place; I was called up at six in the morning by the watchman, and examined the windows of the office as soon as I had an opportunity - there were marks on a small brick-ledge outside, by which it appeared persons had entered by that window; on examining the plate-closet the plate was gone, and a clock was gone from the mantel-piece, the plate was not in my care; I have seen some of it since at the office.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is in North-street, City-road, and Pump-row. On the Friday morning in question, between a quarter and half-past three o'clock; I heard the sound of a hackney chariot - I proceeded towards it, and saw the prisoner get out of it at the corner of the Vinegar-ground, City-road; that is about three miles from the prosecutor's house - I did not observe anybody else in the chariot; I permitted him to pass me, and noticed him well as he passed - I made an accurate observation of him, and as he turned the corner of North-street, I proceeded after him; before that, I saw Herrington, an inspector of the watch, and beckoned to him to make him notice the prisoner and the chariot; the prisoner turned the corner - I lost sight of him just while he turned the corner; I was round immediately, and pursued him instantly, and came up with him as he knocked at the door of a house - I had not lost sight of him after he turned the corner; I secured him, and took him to the watch-house - I saw him searched; I myself took from him the cruet-stand which he was carrying in his hand, wrapped in this blue handkerchief; I left it at the watch-house till we went to the office - the watch-house-keeper produced it before the Magistrate; I am confident it is the same as I took from him - I left it at the watch-house in the blue handkerchief, and it was given to me in the same state - I saw him searched by Thomas Earl, the constable of the night, who found in his pocket a fish-slice, and a broken soup-ladle; all this plate was found in some part of his person - here are several forks; on questioning him how he became possessed of them, he gave me no reply.</p>

            . I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in; Townley produced the cruet-stand, with the handkerchief - this is the same; I searched the prisoner, and found in his right-hand pocket fifteen silver forks - these are them - it was about half-past three o'clock in the morning when he was brought in; I searched him immediately, and left all the articles I found on him in the care of John Brown; I also found on him four silver teaspoons, two soup-ladles, and one broken soup-ladle; the plate was in his right hand coat and breeches pockets; I also found a fish-slice, doubled up, and bent in two - I did not mix any other articles with them before I left them with Brown; I also found part of a spoon, and a pair of sugar tongs on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is all false; Brown is the man who searched me, not him. Witness. I searched him myself - the watch-house-keeper was sitting down.</p>

He stopped there about ten minutes; there was a cry of"look out;" he immediately jumped out, ran away, and escaped.

            . This is the Minister's plate; I am sure it was all safe when I went to bed on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was accosted by this man, he asked what I had got; I directly told him I did not know; that my employer was in the coach - he directly called out, "Look out," and another man went to the coach, spoke to the man, searched the coach and came away, letting my employer escape; he then comes to the watch-house, leaving the coach about a mile off, and said he supposed the coach was coming to the watch-house. On my return home from Battle-bridge, where I had been drinking at a public-house with a friend or two till twelve o'clock, and on going home to Molineux-street, Paddington, two gentlemen asked me to get them a coach; they asked me to go to the corner of Old Cavendish-street, to wait and look out for a coach till they came back to me - one of them returned with a bundle under his arm; he called the waterman, who opened the coach door; the coachman took the cloths off his horses, and the gentleman told him to drive him to the Vinegar-yard: he said to me,"I have no money to pay you - will you go in the coach with me?" I got in, and the other man followed me. It is very unlikely that I or any man could go to a house of that description, get in at the window, and go to where the plate was deposited, by themselves; it is evident that some men belonging to the establishment are concerned in it, and have brought me here for it - it is very unlikely that the shutters should be left unfastened unless they had some foresight of it. I was taken at a quarter-past three o'clock; the door must have been open then, and the watchman had seen it safe before that [After his Lordship had recapitulated the evidence to the Jury, the Prisoner added,] After I returned from the Friend-in-Hand public-house, a young man who had fallen out with another fought in the New-road with him - he was taken to the watch-house; two young men and I went into the watch-house and spoke for him; it was one o'clock when I left the watch-house, which was the reason I did not go home - and there is a man here to prove it - his name is Philip Webster.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Snow-hill, and am a butcher. On the 6th of Oct. I went to supper at the Horse and Groom, at the corner of Leather-lane, in Holborn—I left the house about one o'clock in the morning—the landlord paid me three half-crowns, and I put them into my right-hand coat pocket—I had been drinking—when I came out the prisoner and another female accosted me—I agreed to treat them, and we went to the King's Arms in Holborn—we had a quartern of gin—I paid 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and changed one of the half-crowns—I am sure I had the other two in my pocket then—in coming out I was urged by the prisoner and the other to go with them—I said I should not—I had my suspicions, as I had lost 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. once before—I felt my breeches' pocket—I found it was unbuttoned, but I had my purse, containing gold and silver, safe—I then put my hand into my coat pocket, and the half-crowns and the rest of the change was gone—I took hold of them, and said, "One of you two has robbed me"—I gave them into custody.</p>

             when we lived in Red Lion-court, but did not know her by name then - I had seen an old woman in her company, who was related to her, and I believe slept at her lodgings in Red Lion-court - she used to carry a basket about the street; I have seen matches in it, but I do not know what else - on a Friday in August I saw that old woman in our room; I know it was Friday, but don't know the day of the month; I remember Ann Buton coming to my father's place to inquire about the old woman, I think that was the same day as she came, but am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time on Friday did the old woman come? A. I first saw her in the afternoon - I come from school at five o'clock, and believe she came afterwards; whether she had been there while I was at school I do not know - my mother and father were in the room; they had some beer, and afterwards some coffee; I believe it was about nine o'clock, but am not quite sure - we sometimes have coffee and sometimes tea, and generally have it about five or six; I believe the old woman had one cup of coffee, and after that she went and laid herself on the bed, which is on a bedstead; I did not notice whether she went to sleep or not- I used to sleep with my father and mother, in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. After she laid down on the bed, tell us what you saw anybody do? A. I saw my mother come (she had then been on the bed about half an hour); my mother went and clapped her hand up to the old woman's mouth - she kept it up to her mouth I dare say for half an hour; she kept one hand on her mouth and the other somewhere about her chest - she continued to do that for about half an hour; she then took her hands off - she was standing up, leaning over towards her, while she did this.</p>
               <p>Q. While your mother was pressing her in this way, did you not observe the old woman's eyes? A. I walked towards the window where my father was looking out, and did not see her eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the woman's eyes while you walked towards the window? A. Yes, I saw the woman's eyes rolling - I believe that was after my mother's hands were on her; I never saw her move nor heard her speak after my mother left her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain it was after your mother took her hands off the woman, that you saw her eyes roll? A. Yes, it was when my mother took her hands off; I did not hear her speak or see her move after that - I have seen two or three dead persons; they were not in that house - the old lady appeared to me to be dead.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your father go to the window? A. I believe it was before mother put her hand up to the woman's mouth - he was sitting by the fire before; I believe he had some coffee with the old woman - I saw her go to the bed, and believe it was before that that my father went to the window; it was open, and he was looking out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open while the coffee was being had, or afterwards? A. I believe it was after; my father opened it - he had his elbows out of window; I could see him while I was looking at my mother by the bed - I was not looking all the time; I was standing with my back to the fire - the bed was opposite me, and between me and the window; when I saw my mother at the bed I could see the window - the bed is not very high from the ground; while this was doing, I heard my mother say something about some hospital, I am not quite certain which; I believe she was then speaking to the old woman, but do not know whether it was to her or my father - neither of them gave any answer; my father said nothing that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place next? A. Some time after, my mother carried her down stairs; I believe my father came towards the fire - he must have come round the bed to get to the fire; I think it was about half an hour after he came to the fire that my mother carried the body down - she lifted it off the bed herself; I did not see any body assist her - she carried it loose like a baby in her arms; I believe my father remained in the room when my mother carried the body down - I did not see her return any more that night; I went to bed about twelve o'clock - my father came to bed after me; I awoke in the night, and heard some screaming - I do not know whether it was Friday or Saturday; I did not see any one at home that night - I got up about seven o'clock in the morning; I believe my mother was in the room, but do not recollect seeing my father - my mother was up: I go to school at eight o'clock - I went down into the cellar a few minutes before eight, towards the privy; I went to look for some ducks, as I had been told there were some in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you heard there were ducks in the cellar? A. I believe it was some time before that - I looked about the cellar; there was some light there - in looking for the ducks, I came to the corner of the cellar where the stairs are - it is a sort of a hole made by the stairs turning round; it is rather darker there - I saw the sack there in which the old woman was: I could see nothing but the top of her hair; the top of the sack was just as if a string was tied round it, but not close - I am sure it was the head of a person that I saw; I believe the hair was something black and grey - I have since shown Mr. Harris the bed that was in the room at the time; I think I saw my mother take a sack from under the bed - I am not quite sure whether it was that night or afterwards; I did not notice what she did with it - the sack was just as if it was turned inside out; I believe I saw the same sack in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Saturday night, the night after this, did you see your mother carrying any thing down Goodman's-yard? A. Yes, I believe it was between eleven and twelve o'clock; she was carrying a sack across her shoulder; it had something in it - I was taken by the officer, when my father and mother were taken into custody; I first told of this to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050023"></xptr>my schoolmaster or the Magistrate, I do not remember which I told first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How old are you? A. Twelve years last Christmas; I went backwards and forwards to school till I was taken into custody - I saw my master and school-fellows: I have been a prisoner in the House of Correction since I was taken - I have been in the same cell with Hawkins, the gallery-man; he is a prisoner, and minds the things there - my schoolmaster has questioned me about this in the gaol; I do not remember anybody else - Hawkins questioned me the first time I came there; I do not recollect his asking me after that - my schoolmaster examined me once or twice; I do not remember anybody else except the steward - he is a prisoner; I have often been examined in the presence of the Magistrate, and Mr. Lea might ask me a question coming along - I was examined by some persons in a room; not before the Magistrate - the solicitor for the prosecution was one of them; I do not know whether there were four or five persons there - I do not recollect that any officer questioned me besides Lea.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this happened in August? A. I was at school; I think it was August - I believe two or three families live in the house; there were persons in the house at the time the old woman was there - I saw some people on Friday; I did not mention to any body what I had seen - I my father, and mother, were all taken up on the same day: I went to school on Saturday morning, and had a half-holiday in the afternoon - I believe I got to school as the clock was striking eight; it is not far from Goodman's-yard - I think Mrs. Buton was at the room when the old woman was there; I did not see her - I first saw the old woman some time after five o'clock; I believe my mother fetched the coffee - I think I had a little white mug full; I am not quite sure whether the old woman took any - she placed herself on the bed; I was not far from the bed - I could not tell whether she was asleep or not, nor whether she was awake when my mother approached her; I do not know at what time the body was carried out - I did not speak to my father; a boy named Shields said the ducks belonged to him before the Magistrate - I did not know it before; I went into the cellar, to use the privy, which is there, but did not use it - I did not go to look for the ducks after what I found; the place where I saw the sack is dark, but I could see it, and see that the hair was partly black and partly grey - I could see plain enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when your mother went out on Saturday night with something in a sack? A. I do not know; I think I was up stairs, and saw it from the window - there are three flights of stairs; Goodman's-yard is wide - there is no watchman there; I have seen a Policeman close by there at times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Do you talk to the children of the families in the house? A. Sometimes; there is only one cellar and one privy to the house- they all use it; all who want to use it must go down stairs - I spoke to nobody about Mrs. Walsh before I was taken up; I believe Mrs. Buton asked if I had seen her, but I am not sure; I believe it was dry weather and warm - we sometimes had the window open, and sometimes not; I had my eyes on my mother while I stood by the fire - I said nothing to her; I did not examine the sack in the cellar - I believe I touched it, and ran up to school.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. If you had gone straight from the cellar stairs to the privy and back, should you have seen the sack? A. No; there is a window to the cellar, and a shutter, which opens outside - I think the shutter was open when I went down there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw Lea, the officer; did you not say to him that on the Friday night you had bread and cheese for supper, all of you? A. I do not recollect it; I think I said coffee - I do not recollect telling him that we all went to bed at eight o'clock, nor that my father came to bed to me, and the old woman made her bed in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the old woman's countenanee while she was having her coffee? A. I think I have said she was sleepy; her face seemed to me just as if it was brown and yellow - I think that was when my mother had her hand on her mouth, but I am not quite sure; I have seen two little children dead next door to us - I do not know how long ago it was; they used to come and sit at our door -I have played with them, and taken them out a walk; they were younger than me.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the old woman's eyes rolling about, did you see any alteration in the colour of her face at any time? A. Sometimes it might be red, but I think it was brown and yellow after her eyes rolled; it seemed dirty when she was drinking coffee - I did not see any difference in her face from what it was when she was alive; I think I told the Magistrate I had not used the privy, but I am not certain - I was examined three or four times, if not more; I did not tell the same story at first - I told the Magistrate the woman was alive on Saturday morning, because I did not like to tell; I told the true story to the Magistrate afterwards - I told nothing till after I was taken up.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Prescott-street. I have heard the account the last witness has now given of the manner in which the woman was treated; a hand being held on her mouth and breast for half an hour was quite sufficient to produce death by suffocation; the appearances of the eye mentioned by the boy might be produced, and most frequently are.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that effect be while the hand was on the mouth, or after? A. The motion of the eye is generally considered the last action of life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. If a person was destroyed in this way, would there not be a material change in the appearance before and after death? A. It is not a matter of course; suffocation generally produces an effusion of blood, but that might be modified by age; it is difficult for one who has never seen a person suffocated to state what would be the appearance; I have never seen one suffocated, but have seen them afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Would there be less appearance of change after eighty years of age? A. It depends very much on the constitution.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would suffocation be more readily produced on a person of that age than one younger? A. I should think decidedly so.</p>

            . I am a surveyor. I have made a plan of the premises in Goodman's-yard - here is a correct representation of the locality of the place, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050024"></xptr>plan representing the attic where the persons live; the room is eleven feet broad from the fire-place to the window, and thirteen feet long - I have since measured the bedstead which the boy has pointed out - it is six feet long, and four feet two inches wide; if it stood between the fire-place and window there would be four feet three inches between the bedstead and fire-place, and three feet six inches from the bedstead to the window; here is a correct model of the cellar, which I have prepared; there is only one aperture which throws light into the cellar; the privy is in the corner, by the light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The ray of light would be thrown almost perpendicularly? A. It would; the place under the stairs would only have the reflected light; when I had been down there some time I became accustomed to the light, and could see better than at first; the part under the stairs is certainly darker than the other side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When you had been there some time, were you able to see any thing under the stairs? A. Yes, before I had been there long.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Would a person going to and from the privy be likely to see any thing under the stairs? A. No, I think not; if they were looking about for any thing I conceive there was light enough for them to see a sack there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she take the body down with the clothes on? A. I did not see her take any of them off; I do not recollect seeing her go out of the room before she took the body down - whether she mentioned the London-hospital or Guy's I do not know; I do not recollect what it was she said about the hospital - I think I told the Magistrate she said something about an hospital, but nothing more.</p>

            . In August last we kept the house, No. 7, Goodman's-yard - the prisoners lodged in the garret; we occupied the ground floor, and have three children - the eldest is eight years old; Mrs. Shields lived on the first floor, and had two sons, one about twelve and the other fourteen years old - Mrs. Steel, a lone woman, lodges on the second floor- the privy for the use of the house is in the cellar, but it is not much frequented, as there are a great quantity of rats in it - there is another close to the house on the ground, which is mostly used; the cellar is moderately light - the window is generally open about seven o'clock - one of Shields' boys has ducks in the cellar. On Friday, the 19th of October, I perfectly well remember seeing an old woman come to the house; she was tall - I did not see her face; she had on a black stuff gown, a light blue shawl, and black willow bonnet - her feet were through her stockings, and she had men's shoes on; I said, at the first examination, that it was an old dark shawl; I did not say it was black - I have now charged my memory better, and recollect it was blue; I observed her particularly, on account of her looking so very poor - I rather supposed, by her carrying a bundle, that she had come to lodge there; she had a large bundle, tied in a rug - it was about ten o'clock in the morning; though poor, her things behind appeared tidy, but I did not see her face - she went up stairs; Mrs. Buton came afterwards to make inquiries if I had seen an old woman go into the house - I think it was the next morning, but am not positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you go into the cellar on Saturday? A. I cannot tell; I at times put greens down there, but whether I had any then I cannot say - I never went into Cook's room while they lodged there; I was at home on Saturday night - I am always at home at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When did you first recollect that the shawl was light blue? A. I cannot say - I strove to recollect after I was first examined, and remember it well; I did not hear Mrs. Buton examined, nor heard a description of Mrs. Walsh's clothes; she was shabby altogether, but tidy.</p>

             was my grandmother; she was eighty-four years old, and a very tall, hearty woman; I never knew her ill but one week for the last six years - she did not stoop, but was very upright; she got her living by selling tapes, lanes, &amp;c. about the street, which she carried in a basket, and she took alms, if they were given to her, and got sometimes apparently more than she wanted; she used to get out between ten and eleven o'clock in the day - she was very comfortable, and clean in her person; she washed her hands and face every morning. On the 19th of October I saw her; she wore a black gown and a light blue shawl, with a border to it, nearly a quarter of a yard wide - it was a very tidy shawl for a poor person; I would have worn it myself - some of the colour was washed out; she had a black willow bonnet on; it was broken in the crown, and pinned with two pins - she wore a purple figured stuff petticoat; it had a kind of leaf on it - and an old shift, very much pieced, but a good colour - she had a pair of grey worsted stockings, which I had knitted for it; they were quite different from what are sold in the shops - they were very much broken at the heels and had not been mended; she wore a pair of small sized men's shoes, which were too large for her, and by their wearing the heel the stockings got broken - I made the pocket for her which she wore on the 19th of August; I had shortly before obtained her a lodging with Mrs. Shaw; I saw my grandmother in Houndsditch, on the 19th of August, at twelve o'clock in the day; she lodged at Shaw's then, and had lodged there for a month - I saw her again at five in the afternoon, in Cutler-street, and found out, by what she then said, that she was going to move to the prisoners'; I had called myself, about twelve o'clock that morning, at Cook's, and saw a bundle tied up in a corner of the room, between the two windows; I did not see Mrs. Cook - I opened the bundle, and found it contained my grandmother's night-gown and night-cap, her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050025"></xptr>small mattress, rug, and sheet - I saw young Cook there when I went; I know it was the 19th of August, because my sister's little boy went to Norwood to be nursed - young Cook had been in the habit of seeing my grandmother almost every day for nine months - she had lived with me ten or eleven months, when I lived at No. 2, Red Lion-court, and then Cook lived next door to me - when I went to Cook's at twelve o'clock, I left a message for my grandmother; when I met her at five o'clock I did not stay long with her, for I was rather angry with her for going to Cook's - I tried to pursuade her all I could not to go; when I saw her at five o'clock I appointed to call on her at Cook's next morning, and told her not to go out till I came; she agreed to that appointment - Mrs. Cook had several times told me she wished my grandmother to lodge with her; she knew I was her grand-daughter, for she was a very inquisitive woman - she said she should like her very much to come and lodge with her, and I said I had got her a lodging - I have never seen my grandmother since I parted with her in Cutler-street;

             is my sister - I saw her that evening after I parted with my grandmother, and learned something from her about my grandmother's going to Cook's - I went to Cook's next morning - the clock struck nine after I got into the room; I found Mrs. Cook there, but nobody else - I looked towards the fire-place and said, "Where is the old lady?" Mrs. Cook said, "She is just gone out;" I said, "Why, I am very much surprised that she should go out when she expected me here the first thing this morning; she said the old lady had told her she expected me; I said I was surprised she should go out so soon?" - she said she had gone out soon, to be home soon; she said Cook was very partial to the old woman, and they had a jolly good supper last night - I said, I was very glad they had enjoyed themselves, and should take the liberty of asking what they had for supper; she said they had potatoes and meat, and that Cook went out and got a drop of something short, to make the old lady comfortable, that Cook seemed very partial to the old lady, and she slept on the bedstead last night; I was very much surprised, and said, "I never knew her sleep with any person, and that she had her own bed to sleep on; her bed laid there the same as I had left it the day before - I had tied it up after examining it, and it appeared to be in the same state as I had left it; when I said I was surprised, she said Cook doubled up that piece of sacking last night to put the old lady on - I saw a piece of something coarse laying on the bed at the time, and said, "What do you mean, Mrs. Cook?" she said Cook doubled it to put underneath the old lady - she said the old woman had got no shift on; I said,"she must have had a shift on" - she said she had none, but if I would give her one she would wash it for her; I said if she was in want of a shift I would give her one, but I did not think she was in want of one; I had taken her a clean shift and cap on the Friday or Saturday before - I said, "Mrs. Cook you must have examined the woman very close to know she had no shift in one night;" she made no reply to that; she said "You have got a small tub, a frying-pan and coffee-pot to give the old lady" - I said I would bring them as soon as I saw her; I had taken those things from her the day before; Mrs. Cook was going out, and asked if I would give her a drop of gin; I said I would give her some beer; she said she could not drink beer - I came out with her, and having my suspicions, I went with her to Bishop's gin-shop; we each had a glass of gin, then went from that house to Brown's public-house, in the Minories, and had two pints of beer; I said it was very strange the old woman should go out when she expected me; she said, "You seem to think from what you say, that we have murdered the woman" - I said, "I hope not, Mrs. Cook;" she said, "From what you seem to say, you think we have destroyed her at our place;" I said, "Mrs. Cook, you put the words into my mouth, but what I think I don't speak now, but you will know of it hereafter" - she wanted me to go to her house to have something to eat; I said I had business to attend to, and would not go - she said she had some cold meat at home; she asked me so often to go that I gave her 3 1/2d to get a 1d. loaf and some cheese; she was to bring it to Brown's, and we were both to have it there - she went out with the 3 1/2d, I stopped there about two hours, and she never came back; I went in search of my grandmother for three-quarters of an hour, about the streets and places where I knew she used to go, but could not find her - I then went to Austin's in Houndsditch, and pawned a gown in the name of Walsh for half a crown; I then went to Anderson's in the Minories: he is another pawnbroker - I afterwards went to Cook's lodgings; I got there between five and six o'clock in the evening - both the prisoners were in the room; I said, "Mrs. Cook, has the old lady come home yet;" she held up her hand and beckoned, as if to tell me not to say anything - she gave me no answer; her husband was sitting in a chair; he stood up as I went in, and went towards the window - these signs were made behind his back; he stood at the window two or three minutes, and she whispered to me very softly, and said, "You must not tell Cook that I have been in your company, or drinking with you" - Cook went down stairs in a few minutes; he said nothing - after he was gone Mrs. Cook told me that Cook had beat her most unmercifully - she had marks round her face, and was quite red; I asked why he beat her - she said he had beat her so, through going out with me, that he said she had no business to go out with me, looking after the old lady - that he said she had no business to go out, in case anything should drop about the old lady; I went several times to Cook's to enquire for my grandmother, and to some prisons, hospitals, and poor-houses - Mrs. Cook went with me to one poor-house; I could hear nothing of her, after searching on Sunday and Monday - I went to Cook's room between six and seven o'clock on Monday night; they were both in the room - I told them where I had been looking for her, and what I had been doing; Mr. Cook said I had better wait till the month was up, and very likely I should hear of her, dead or alive then - Mrs. Cook asked me eight or nine times to stop there that night and sleep, as I was so tired; Cook was sitting in a chair, cleaning his boys boots, and could hear what she said - the boy was in the room - she asked me so many times I said, "I have a sister's house to sleep in, and do not want your lodging;" she said I might sleep on my grandmother's bed, and perhaps while I stopped there, my grandmother might come home.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe then you made some complaints at the Police-office? A. Yes, it was not till October that Lea took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050026"></xptr>this matter up; I heard the female prisoner say something about hot or cold, but that was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How old are you? A. Twenty-nine; I lived with my grandmother for about a year before she went to Shaw's - she lodged there a month all but two days; I saw her almost every day - I was never a week without seeing her; I saw her after giving her the shift, on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she had on the patched shift on Friday? A. She put it on while I was in the house, and could not take it off till I took her another; I gave her the shift the week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mrs. Cook say Cook had beat her numercifully for getting drunk with you? A. Yes, she said so, but she did not get drunk with me; we only had two pints of beer and a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you look at the sacking? A. I did not take it in my hand; I saw there was sacking there - I never knew such a thing to be put on a bed; it laid on the bed, folded up as a blanket or sheet - I did not open it; it was new canvas - it was more like what is used to carry coffee in; she went out readily with me, to look for my grandmother.</p>

            . I am Buton's sister - my husband is a boot-closer; I am Mrs. Walsh's grand-daughter. On Friday evening, the 19th of August, between six and seven o'clock, I went with her to Mrs. Cook's lodging, in Goodman's-yard - it was the day my child went to Norwood; I went up to the door of the garret with her, and left her there - I heard Mrs. Cook's voice, but did not go in; I saw my grandmother go into the room - she was then in her usual health, and had on a black willow bonnet, rather broken in the crown, a blue shawl with a border, the colour rather washed out, a black stuff gown, a purple figured stuff petticoat, a pair of grey knitted stockings, and a pair of rather small men's shoes; I had a child in my arms, fourteen months old - as we went to Cook's my grandmother turned up her gown, put her hand into her pocket, and gave the child a biscuit - her pocket was between her gown and petticoat; I could see it - it was a pocket which I had seen Mrs. Buton make her I am certain; I noticed an iron mould on it - this was at the top of Houndsditch; we continued together till we got to Cook's - I had given my grandmother the shawl which she wore; there was a stain on the shoulder of it; when I left her at Cook's door she had her basket in her hand, which she usually carried about the street - she was then clean in her person and her clothes; I was on very good terms with her, and if anything had happened to her I should have gone to her immediately, if sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Had she ever been a pauper in any workhouse? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you know Mrs. Cook before? A. I had seen her, but never spoke to her; I have heard her speak, and knew her voice.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. About the 16th of October a gentleman named Simpson came to me with Buton and Basey - in consequence of what they said I went in search of the female prisoner; I went to White Horse-court, having heard they had moved there; it is close to Goodman's-yard; I went there on Friday, the 28th of October, and found Mrs. Cook coming out of the court - I followed her to Rosemary-lane; Mrs. Buton was with me, and pointed her out; I did not know her before - I went up to her, and told her she must go with me before a Magistrate, respecting the old lady who had been at her house in August, and had been missing - she said the last she saw of her was on the Saturday morning - that the old lady gave her a halfpenny to go and get a halfpenny worth of sugar, and she had given the old lady her breakfast about seven o'clock, before her husband came home, as she did not want him to know she breakfasted there; she said she left the pot on the hob for Cook's breakfast when he returned: I asked her what time Cook got up that morning - she said between four and five o'clock - she then said, "Have you got Cook?" I said No - she said, "Go and get him directly;" I asked her where he was - she said he was at work in letter C warehouse, St. Katharine's dock, and said, "Go for him directly" two or three times over - I asked what time she went to bed on the Friday night - she said they all went to bed about nine o'clock; I asked what she had for supper - she said cold meat and coffee; Mrs. Buton, as we went along, said,"You know, Mrs. Cook, what you have done with the old woman;" she said if she had done any thing with her God would burn her soul in hell flames - she said that after she gave the old woman her breakfast she (Cook) went to the Tenter-ground, and left the old woman and Cook smoking by the fire, and when she returned she found the room swept up, and the old woman gone; I then locked her up - she said, "Make haste - go directly for Cook;" I went to the docks, and called him out - Mrs. Buton was with me; I told him a young woman wanted to speak to him - he came out; I said, "That is the young woman. I suppose you know her;" he said he did - I said he must go with me before a Magistrate, respecting an old woman who had been at his house in August last, and was missing, and there was a great mystery about it; he said very well, it was very proper it should be inquired into - I asked him what time he went to bed on the Friday night the old woman was there; he said the old woman was there on the Friday night, and she had made her bed in the corner of the room; I asked what time he went to bed - he said at a quarter-past eleven o'clock, as near as he could recollect; I asked what he had for supper - he said hot meat, and to the best of my recollection, tea; he said they all went to bed at that time, and he saw the old woman in the morning at breakfast - he said he got up very early that morning to look for work, and he thought it might be about seven o'clock when he returned; he could not recollect whether the old woman was gone before he returned or after.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050027"></xptr>Q. Do you mean that he said that, at the same time as he told you he had seen her at breakfast? A. Yes; I locked him up in a separate cell from the woman - his wife asked when I returned if I had got him; I then went to Aldgate charity school, and took the boy - I told him his father and mother were in custody about an old woman who was missing; the prisoners were in three separate cells- the man was in the middle cell, between the woman and boy, and I heard a conversation between them; the woman began it - she called out Ned, and said, "Ask little Ned who told him to say what he has been saying about me;"- the man called out, "Ned, your mother wants to know who told you to say what you have been saying about her?" the boy answered Nobody - the man returned the answer to her; she then called out "Ned, ask Ned how he came to say what he has been saying about me;" the man repeated the question, and the boy called out very lond, "Why because she did it;" the woman said, "What does he say?" the man told her, and she then said, "Oh, Lord Jesus, that we should suffer for this, what we know nothing about;" the man said, "God knows I had no hand in it," and then he said again, "Never mind, there is nothing in this world that we wish to live for - there will be forgiveness by God in the last moment;" that is all that passed then. On the 22nd of December, as I brought them to Newgate in a coach, the man said I had had a great deal of trouble in this business - I said Yes: the woman said, "With all your trouble you have not found the old woman's body;" she said that all the things she sold, the grand-daughter had brought to her in a bundle - she did not say which grand-daughter; she said, "That was the old woman that was taken to Bethnal-green work-house."</p>
               <p>Q. You mean Mrs. Walsh? A. Yes, she alluded to her; the man corrected her, and said it was Hoxton work-house - she said, "That was the woman that died in the London-hospital;" the man then said if he should suffer for it, as no doubt he should, it would all come to light who had done it - I produce a pocket, which I received from Mr. Elder, of the Tower, also a basket and jug, which I got from Mrs. Tibbles - a sack, which I found, cut open, on the prisoner's bed; (they had nothing else to cover them,) and a cap, which Mrs. Buton gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The first information you received was in October? A. Yes; I had not seen the boy before I took him - what he said to me was while he was in custody; the grand-daughter might be a yard and a half behind us when I had a conversation with the male prisoner - Mr. Wilmot was in the coach with me- I have heard the woman had three grand-daughters, but one has been dead some time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When you locked them in separate cells, had they the means of knowing you were listening? A. No; I was on the steps of the office - it was about the second or third examination.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You have some black stuff in your hand? A. Yes, two pieces; I found them in a corner of the cellar in Cook's house - one of them appears to be the cuff of a gown - it is bombazeen, and the other is a piece of black stuff, apparently a piece of the tail of a gown; I found them about three weeks or a month after taking the prisoners, up in a dark corner, near the privy - I had not said a word about the woman's clothes in the coach, when Mrs Cook said the grand-daughter had brought them - there had been no examination that day; they were merely called in and committed - the witnesses had been examined a fortnight before, about the clothes; she also said, if any body had put the old woman away, the granddaughter must have done it.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What did the boy tell you about the old woman making her bed? A. He told me when I first took him that the old woman made her bed in the corner of the room, and they had bread and cheese for supper - that was when he was considered a prisoner under this charge, as being concerned with his father and mother- he said they went to bed at eight o'clock, that the old woman made her bed in the corner of the room - that he went to bed first, his mother next, and he did not see his father come to bed at all; he afterwards said he was very much frightened, and was a great mind to run down stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The conversation with him was before he was examined at all? A. Yes, it was after he was admitted an evidence that he said he was a great mind to run out of the room, and he was very glad he had told the truth.</p>

            . I am a widow, and carry on business in the clothes line, in Rag-fair, Rosemary-lane; I know the female prisoner quite well. The first thing she brought to me was a pair of stockings; that was about the middle of September - she asked if I would buy them; I looked at them; she said they were a very good pair of home made stockings, and asked 6d. for them, saying they were well worth 8d.; I gave her 4d. - they were what I call lead colour, made of worsted, and had been worn; I sold them the same day, and have not seen them since - the heels were darned with white worsted, which appeared lately done; they were knitted, and different to what are sold in the shops - she brought me a cap a very short time afterwards, and asked if I would buy it; it was a cap of this kind -(looking at one) - I looked at it, but did not buy it; I cannot say whether it had thread or cotton edging, but it was a cap like this; she brought me some darning cotton in skeins, and something else, either tape or stay-laces, I do not recollect which; they were wrapped in paper - I think it was the day after she brought the cap; she brought me, a day or two after, a parcel, wrapped up, and asked me to buy it; I unfolded it - there was a petticoat of a plum colour with a figure in the pattern, and there was a linen shift, which was a very good colour, but mended, by pieces being put on; I did not buy these things, or the tapes, &amp;c. - when I went to look at the things she said, "Put them down by the side of you, I don't want any body to see what I am selling you;" a day or two after she brought me a shawl, which I did not buy; I looked at it - it was blue, and the middle was plain; there was a light border five or six inches deep - Mrs. Cotton, who sat next to me, bought it; the colour was very much washed out, and there was a place on the shoulder which seemed to be a stain; after Mrs. Cotton bought it she left it in my possession for two or three days - she also brought a rush basket to me; it was not like the one produced - she offered me a pocket, which Mrs. Channel bought; (looking at one) - this is it; I know it by this iron mould.</p>

            . I am nurse at Tibble's house. I remember an old woman being brought there on the 20th of August; she spoke like an Irishwoman, and said she had got no relations at all - she was in a very dirty, filthy state, and very lousy; she had no shift on - her clothes were burnt, on account of their filthy state: she had on an old narrow-striped blue washed out gown, and a little bit of a shawl, which was snuff-colour, and a black silk bonnet - I am sure it was not willow: she had a pair of old black stockings - they were not knitted; I saw her feet - she had very filthy and dirty long feet, and her hip was broken - I did not notice corns on her feet; she was sent to the London-hospital in a few days - her great state of lousiness must have been a long time contracting; Mr. Parkinson saw her on the Sunday.</p>

            . I am a surgeon - I attend Tibble's farm-house. On a Sunday, about four months ago, I saw a woman who had been brought there in a coach the night before: I found her in a very exhausted state - her body very much emaciated; I should say she was between sixty and seventy years old - I did not perceive any vermin when I saw her; I should think the emaciation had been of slow progress - my attention was not called to the fracture till two or three days after; that was of recent standing - I did not notice her teeth; I could hardly judge of her complexion, she was so very filthy, covered with dirt - when I first saw her I thought she was merely exhausted for want of food, and ordered what was necessary - I afterwards saw the same woman in Mary's ward, at the London-hospital.</p>

            . I am nurse in Mary's ward, London-hospital. I recollect an old woman being brought there the latter end of August; she was in a very filthy state, and had a fracture in the hip - she told me her name was Catherine Welch, and that she came from Waterford; I made a memorandum of her name at the time - she told me she was sixty-one years old, and had no relations whatever; a gentleman came to see her - I do not know whether it was Mr. Parkinson; she had no front teeth - her hair was grey; she had very little in front - it was entirely grey, quite white; I recollect her dying - she had her hair on then.</p>

            . I am assistant nurse in Mary's ward. On the 25th of August I remember an old woman being brought from Tibble's; a gentleman came to see her- I cannot say whether it was Mr. Parkinson; the woman was in a dirty state - she had clean linen on, but had vermin about her; we took her clothes down into the burying gound, and they were destroyed there, they were so filthy - we asked her several times where she came from; she said from Waterford - she gave us no other name: she was as dark as a mulatto - I am certain of that; I washed and cleaned her, and noticed she had two toes, one lapped over the other in an unusual way, and she had bunions on both feet; I fed her, as she was too exhausted to feed herself - she had two teeth only in front, in the top jaw: she had two front teeth in the bottom jaw, but I did not notice any more - I only noticed two teeth in her upper jaw, and two in her under jaw: she died there; I was present afterwards when her grave was opened, and her body taken up - it was shown to Mrs. Buton and Basey; I recognized it as the woman I have spoken of - I had tied a cotton roller round her face, and found that on the body then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You do that to most who die there? A. Very seldom, only if they have nothing else; other persons were dug up in consequence of this - she was a very dark brown woman, not red in the face.</p>

               <p>Ross' Defence (written). I am innocent of the dreadful offence with which I am charged; I trust you will excuse me, and not think me wanting in parental regard and affection towards the principal evidence in this melancholy circumstance and case, but I cannot help repeating that my son's statement is false throughout, but I leave my unfortunate case in your hands, and most earnestly pray that God will pardon my child, and that he may ere long he brought to confess that I am innocent of the charge - I calmly resign my case to your hands.</p>
               <p>Cook's Defence (written). I can only repeat what I have before stated at the Police-office, Lambeth-street, that I am entirely innocent of the horrible crime laid to my charge; I again repeat also that my son's statement is one tissue of falsehood and lies - I shall throw myself upon the attention and discrimination of an intelligent Jury and merciful Judge, and patiently and calmly resign myself to their decision.</p>
               <p>Ross. I left her at the fire-side, smoking her pipe; this woman knows she was dirty, and the colour of a Portuguese - she had nothing on but rags: I told this woman of it - she said if she gave her a shift she would go and sell it for tobacco; she never would let her sleep in her house without throwing her things down in the cellar: I know a gentleman sent to my child in prison, and told him to lay the blame on me, to clear himself; I blame the school-master for corrupting my child, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Cook. The boy left the room and went to school, leaving the old woman and me in the room; she swept the room up, smoked her pipe, put some matches into her basket, and said she should go out, but not stop long; that is all I know of her, so help me God.</p>

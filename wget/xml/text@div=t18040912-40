                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120049"></xptr>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen him twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to you first? - A. On the 6th of July, near eleven o'clock in the morning; he called for half a pint of porter, and gave me a shilling, which at that time I supposed to be a good one; afterwards it turned out to be a bad one; I gave him a sixpence and fourpence three-farthings change, and he went away; I laid the shilling upon the mantle-piece under an image; I found it to be a very bad one, by rubbing it, the moment he was gone. On the Friday following, to the best of my recollection, it was the 13th of July, he then called for half a pint of porter; there was a person in the bar with me then, and I said that was the person that offered me the bad shilling; then he offered me a bad shilling, but I gave him no change for that, supposing it was a bad one; I took the shilling, and compared it with the other on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be a bad one? - A. Certainly; I turned to the prisoner, and told him that he made a trade of it, that he might be content with giving me one in a week, without giving me the second; he said he did not know it was a bad one, and that he had never been in my house before; I told him I would send for a constable, and have him searched, for I thought he had more about him; he made no answer, and I sent for a constable, who is now in Court; I gave the two shillings to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You keep the Mitre; pray do you know a person of the name of Dyer? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not like to pry into secrets; have not you the good fortune to be married - no private marriage? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell me upon your oath you are not married? - A. I am not.</p>

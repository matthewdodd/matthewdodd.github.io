                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, at 37, Mitre Street, Aldgate—I have a workshop on tne ground floor—on the 9th of this month, I was working there; about 5 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and spoke to me in a most familiar way as if he had known me all his days—he said "Shopmate, how are you?"—he was an entire stranger to me—he said "How is business?—I looked about as I rather suspected the man—perhaps I told him how I was off for work—"Have you got a job?" said he—"Not more than I can do myself," and I turned to take a little article off a shelf when I immediately missed the shoes and the prisoner, too—the shoes were at the doorway, hanging near where the prisoner was—I called out to him to stop—he was running away—I ran after him and overtook him at Smith's Buildings, and saw the shoes lying close to the pavement—when I got there I found them in the hands of George Howell, a carman, who stopped him—the prisoner said nothing, but he tried to trip the police and the man that took hold of him—I charged him with stealing the shoes, he said nothing.</p>

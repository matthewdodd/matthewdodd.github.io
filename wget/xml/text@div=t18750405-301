At 8.45 p.m., on 5th March, I was with Dales in Lambeth, and saw the prisoner leaving the Peasant public-house, he went across to the Mitre, and I went after him and took him by one hand and Dales by the other in front of the bar—his left hand was clenched, I told him that I was a detective officer and had suspicion of him—he said "I have got nothing"—I said, "No, you have dropped it"—I had pressed his wrist and he was bound to let it go, a man named Clamp picked it up and gave it to me; it contained forty-one bad sixpences in a piece of rag," just twisted round—I took him to the station—he said "I did not have it.</p>

I live at 4, Crosier Street, Lambeth, and am a private inquiry officer—I live about 100 yards from the Mitre—I was there on 5th March—I had been there two or three minutes, and was leaving when I met the two officers; they asked me to go back, and I did so, as I knew them before—they seized the prisoner, and I noticed something drop from his left hand, which I picked up and handed to Davis; it was a small rag containing sixpences.</p>

I missed the things mentioned, out of my room, on the 13th of June; on that day the prisoner came to me, as I was in the hospital, and asked me to take a walk to Knights-bridge: we went there, and had a dinner of cod-fish. I perceived he wanted to get me in liquor. When we parted, I sent word by him to my wife, I would be with her in the morning. In the morning, my wife came to the hospital, crying, and told me the prisoner was gone away with all my cloaths: he came to me, and seeing her, ran down stairs, and I never saw him from that time, till the day after Christmas-day. I got to be an out-patient in the hospital, and made it my business to enquire after him, and was informed that day, he was at the Red Lion, in Chandler-street. As soon as he saw me, he whip'd up, and ran away, but was soon taken; he then had a suit of cloaths of mine on: we took him before Justice Fielding: he told him he bought them of a Jew, and that he never knew me. He had often been at my house, and passed for a lawyer, and I have since found, he passed with others for a doctor. I came acquainted with him by his lodging at my brother's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Oake. On the 13th of June, the prisoner came to my room, about 8 at night (he used to come every day): he said he had been to my husband, at the hospital, and my husband was pretty well: he said he was hungry, and gave me 2 s. and desired me to go and buy him a rabbet, and fry it; I gave him one again, and went and bought a rabbet, and fry'd it for him. While I was frying it, he went down stairs, and I never saw him again, till about a quarter after 10; then he came and asked me ten thousand pardons; he went and ordered a pot of beer; he was all in a sweat, and look'd confus'd; then he eat the rabbet; sometimes he had no money, but at that time he had money: he went away about a quarter after eleven, and I missed my husband's cloaths in about an hour after, (mentioning them by name.)</p>

            . Mr. Oake came to me about the 12th or 13th of June, and asked if the lawyer was there? he was not; he then had lodged with me for about three quarters of a year; from that time I did not see the prisoner for two or three months. When I saw him at a public house as I was going to North-Audley-street, I asked him for the money he owed me, and told him he was advertised; he pulled out a guinea. I said, I'll take you to a public-house, and change it, and send for Mr. Oake; he would not go there. I gave him half a guinea; he said he would call on me for his change the next day ( he owed me 7 s. 6 d.) but he never called; I owe him his change now.</p>

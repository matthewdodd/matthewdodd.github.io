             sworn. I am one of the patroles of Bow-street, on the 7th of October last, about half after five o'clock in the morning, I was standing at the corner of Red-Lion-street-Holborn, the prisoner at the bar passed me; I stopped him, and took him into a liquor shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing about him. - A. He had the nails in a bag on his back; I asked him how he came by them, he said what is that to you; when he was brought before the magistrates he said he found them on a butcher's block in Newport Market.</p>
               <p>A. How came he not to be tried before. - A. He was kept till the 14th, and then he was discharged, we could not find any owner to the nails; I have kept the nails ever since, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. On the 7th of October was the Monday, the 5th was on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Court. (to Mr. Gill) Was it on Saturday your premises were robbed. - A. It was; that bag is not mine, they were emptied out of the bag, and the bag was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined the nails before. - A. I have, there is eighty seven pound, and from a general knowledge of the nails, I believe them to be my property, they are worth a groat a pound, they are valued at 10 s. in the indictment, they are made in the same tool with what I use, I should know the nails any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the value of them would be about twenty-seven shillings; you are quite sure they are made in the same tool as those were in your manufactory; and you believe them to be yours. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what weight of nails you had in your manufactory. - A. I had two hundred weight in on the 27th of September, there had been none of them used on the night of the 5th of October, one bag was nearly emptied.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the nails lost correspond with the quantity found. - A. As near as my ideas can recollect; I do not believe there is another nail among them, I have examined the bag carefully.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. That is they are as near as you can guess, it is a common cart nail. - A. It is a common cart nail.</p>
               <p>Q. You have them from the manufacturer, which manufacturer supplies other wheelwrights of course. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found these nails about one or two o'clock, in Brook's Market, Brook's street.</p>
               <p>Jury. (to Jones) Which way was he coming from. - A. From Brook's-street, I took him at the corner of Red-Lion-street, coming from Brook-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, Hickling Street, Rotherhithe, and was until lately a letter-carrier—on 7th April, at 11.30 p.m., I was in York Street, Westminster, when the prisoner and two other men knocked me down—I could not swear which one knocked me down—I was hit on the cheek, and my head knocked the kerb—I was then robbed of some coppers—a police constable came up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. It was gas-light—I was going peaceably and quietly home, and did not interfere with any one—I was sober—I had had quite enough to drink—the prisoner had corduroy trousers on, and I noticed his features—I saw them for a few seconds—I had never seen him before—I next saw him at Westminster police-station when he was taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I found a knife, but couldn't find no penny—I was about 20 yards off when I saw the prisoner holding the prosecutor down—it was not particularly dark—there was a lamp just opposite.</p>

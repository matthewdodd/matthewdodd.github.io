            . I am an officer. On Friday the 19th of March, I was standing at the Bulls Head tap, Petticoat-lane, about nine o'clock at night I observed the prisoner come in with something under his arm; he put it on the stairs; he called for a pint of porter; he stopped about five minutes. I thought there was something not quite right; I felt the parcel that he put down; it contained something heavy. I asked the prisoner, what he had put on the stairs. He said, cheese; he said he got it from his masters warehouse, in Whitechapel. I took him in custody. He took me to a warehouse belonging to his master; he knocked at the door; he said it is all shut up. I said, this not where your master lives; this may be the warehouse. He then dropped two of the cheeses against the door, and made an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070083"></xptr>attempt to get away; he still held one of the cheeses in the wrapper, and the other two a gentleman took up. I took him to Mr. Larking, and asked if he knew that man; he said yes, he was his carman. I asked him if he had sent him out with any cheeses. He said, no. These are the three cheeses.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are our cheeses, all of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The warehouseman gave me these cheeses, and desired me to take them to the Bulls Head tap, and to put them on the stairs; accordingly I did.</p>

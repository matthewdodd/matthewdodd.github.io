               <p>I am an apprentice to a Mr Riswell, a taylor. Last Thursday morning, I was standing the opposite side of the way, and I saw this Hannah Hall with something under her apron; I did not see her go in, but I see her go out with something under her apron, from my master's yard; my master lives at No. 1, Dake's-place; she was followed out by the servant, Mary Allen, who came back and told me that she had stole a quart pot, and that she had seen her at an acquaintance's of her's, Mrs. Jenkins's, in George yard, Whitechapel. We both went to this person's house, and she told me where, perhaps, I might find the prisoner; she told us, if we went to one Mrs. Neales, in Petticoat-lane, we should very likely find her there; when we came there, she told us the prisoner had not been there that day, but if we went to one Godfry's, in the same yard, in Whitechapel, we should find her there; we went to Godfry's, and she denied seeing her for several days; I went up there about half an hour after, myself, and I saw her there with two more women; she told me then that she knew nothing about the pot; then I insisted on her going with me; she said, for God's sake, don't hurt me, I will bring you out the pot; she went down in the cellar and brought it up half full of dirt. Then I took her to the Bull's Head, Leadenhall-street, and Mr. Wright took charge of her, and the pot was delivered to the constable.</p>

               <p>I see the prisoner Thursday fortnight the 3d of July, I saw the prisoner at the Mitre-court, Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her at all? - No; I was cleaning the parlour out, in the morning; I live with Mr. Riswell, a taylor; I set out these two pots at the step of the door, they were Mr. Goodman's; this was in the morning about eight o'clock, he has got a large yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160126"></xptr>and I saw the woman about the court for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these pots in that yard? - Yes, at the door. When the woman found I turned my dack away she opened the yard gate, and came, I perceived her, I looked up on perceiving a dark shade against the window, and saw the woman take the quart pot, and run away with it; I followed her till such times as I came to the corner of Shoe-maker-row; she was gone before I could come to her; I came and told our apprentice that I lost the quart pot, and I said, that I had seen her at an acquaintance's of mine in George-yard, if he would go with me, I should hear of her; we went together, but I never see her any more.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the apprentice to know her? - Mrs. Jenks, in George-yard told me her name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him to Mrs. Jenks's? - Yes, I went there because I had seen her about there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have known that young woman a great while.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my pot, it has my name on it; I have been in business a year and a half; I never sold any; I have had many stole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in Duke's-place to work that morning, close by that young woman, I saw her as I came along; I lodged with her aunt two years; she told me when she had a bit of broken victuals, she would give it me; I locked down the kitchen, and told her, I am going to take your pot to get some pump water, I will bring it again. I took the pot to Aldgate and left the pot with Mrs. Godfry, on the second stair. The girl knows me by living at her aunt's a long time, and told me if she had any thing to give she would as soon give it to me as any other poor person.</p>

               <p>Allin. I never gave it her at all; I never spoke two words to her in my life.</p>

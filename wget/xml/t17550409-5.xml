            . The prisoner, myself, and one John, a tea-chest-maker (I don't know his surname) were together in Whitecross-street; the prisoner bid me go over the way to the poulterer's shop, and take the two ducks that were lying there, saying they would serve us for dinner. I went and took them, and ran away; but hearing them cry out, stop thief, I dropt the ducks, and a young man came and took them up, and carried them back to the shop, and another ran and took me, and they carried me before justice Withers, and I was admitted an evidence there.</p>

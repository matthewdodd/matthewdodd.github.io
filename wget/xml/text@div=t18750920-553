                  </hi>. I live at 10, Benhill Road, Brunswick Square, Cam<lb></lb>berwell, and am single—in January, 1874, I was employed at a restaurant, where I made the acquaintance of the prisoner's wife—they were occupying a house, No. 3, Dane's Road, Denmark, Street Camberwell—at the end of January I hired two rooms of them, a parlour on the ground-floor, and a back bed-room upstairs—the parlour was unfurnished, the bed-room was furnished—I was to pay 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the prisoner let me have the use I of the furniture in the bed-room; I furnished the parlour—I bought a carpet at Layman's, in the Borough, for which I paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200159"></xptr>
               <p>wards went with the prisoner to Mr. Bourne's furniture shop, where I bought a couch, an easy chair, six chairs, a table, some stair carpet, oil cloth, and a rug—the prisoner's wife was with us also—the prisoner also bought a bedstead and a palliasse—Mr. Bourne asked the prisoner if he should make out two receipts—he said "No, one will do"—Bourne said "What name?" and the prisoner said "May"—I paid for all but the bed-stead and palliasse; I am positive of that—the prisoner paid for that all bat a shilling—he had not sufficient to pay—it was rather more for the bedstead than he expected, and he asked me to lend him a shilling, which I did—the things were sent home and put into my parlour—the prisoner never claimed ownership to these things until my return from seeing my sister—I asked him to buy a chimney glass, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for it, and also the money to pay for a timepiece—I also bought a pair of vases and a jug which were in my room—in April, 1874, I changed my bed-room for a larger room, for which I was to pay another 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the furniture was not lent me then; that belonged to me—a gentleman named Martin bought it for me—in May, this year, I owed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for rent, and on the 24th I paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and ultimately a claim was made against me for rent up to the 12th August of a balance of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he seized my furniture in the bed-room, when I consulted Mr. Fullagar, my present solicitor, and I went with him to the prisoner—Mr. Fullagar went to see what it was that May claimed, and he said if the rent was paid he would give the goods up, and the goods in the bed-room he would give up on receiving a letter from Mr. Martin—Mr. Martin has been on intimate terms with me—May did not say one single word at that time about the goods in the parlour belonging to him—I had a receipt of Bourne when I bought the goods, and also a receipt for the timepiece and looking-glass—it was in September, 1874, that I went away to see my sick sister—I then left the receipts locked up in a small work-box in the cupboard in the parlour; the cupboard was not locked—I came back in January, and the receipts were then gone—the work-box was there; it had been forced open—they were produced by the prisoner's advocate before the Magistrate—I never gave him authority to take the receipts—I afterwards attended before the Magistrate and gave my evidence, and got my goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I acted as barmaid at the restaurant in Token house Yard in 1873 and 4—I was on very good terms with the prisoner's wife—she was in the kitchen department—Mr. Fullagar represented me when I was before the Magistrate—the solicitor who appeared for the prisoner was a little the worse for liquor; he was very obtuse and stupid—at the time Mr. Lushington made the order for the goods to be delivered up, he put Mr. Fullagar into the witness-box to prove the perjury against the prisoner, and ordered the latter into custody there and then—it was the act of the Magistrate—when I first went to live at the prisoner's house, I had a smaller bedroom, a back room upstairs—I knew Mr. Martin then—I did not buy wedding dresses and go away to be married—I did not say so—the baby was born in January, 1875—I did not wear a wedding ring—that is the truth—Mr. Martin did not pass as my husband—he bought a lot of goods from Maples, to put into the bedroom I occupied—that was for my confinement—I don't know that Maples got back their property because they were not paid for—I don't know where Mr. Martin is—I know now he is a married man—I did not buy a wedding outfit, or represent that I was going away to marry Mr. Martin, or come back and say that I had married him—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200160"></xptr>
               <p>May reproached Mr. Martin as a married man for having connection with me, it was because I showed Mr. Martin my bill, and he said I had been overcharged and he would not pay a farthing—the rent for the small room was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I changed to a larger room, and Mr. Martin used to come and visit me—I never deceived Mrs. May—<hi rend="italic">Mr.</hi> May never said anything to me about it—before I went to them I was going to advertise for a room" and Mr. May said "We shall be obliged to make <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> change on account of my Bon; we want a larger house, would you like a room or two?" it was not arranged that they were to provide the furniture and I was to select it according to my own taste—the son was not with us at Bourne's—I do not know that the prisoner borrowed 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a person named Pilkington to buy the furniture at Bourne's; it is not the fact that he purchased 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth at Bourne's, and that I said I had some money to make up—Bourne was making out the bill when I put the money down; it was not 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I put down—I think he bought a pair of curtains for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the bedstead and palliasse were for the son's room; the curtains were for my room, where they were put up—I only claimed what belonged to me—I selected all but the bedstead and palliasse—Bourne suggested that we should have two bills, and May said "No, one will do"—after this I wanted a chimney-glass bought; I claimed that—I gave the money to the son to pay for the time-piece, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the money for the time-piece and chimney-glass was my own—I cannot say exactly the date that Mr. Martin last called; not after May of this year—the furniture for the larger room was sent in from Maples'—when I left the lodgings, I was staying at my brother's for a little while—Maples' goods are at Mr. Lloyd's now—they are not Maples' goods; they were given me by Mr. Martin—I know nothing of any claim by Maples—they have not been to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Martin seduced me, and the result was that a child was born in January—it was in April, 1874, that I took the larger bed room—Mr. Martin gave me the furniture for my confinement, and, as far as I know, it is now in the hands of Mr. Lloyd, who is a broker, who was entitled to recover all my furniture for me—I believe it was in the latter part of April or beginning of May of the present year that Mr. Martin spoke of the overcharge made by the prisoner—until then no observation was made by prisoner about Mr. Martin coming to the house—I never attempted to deceive the prisoner or his wife into believing that I was a married woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 198, Camberwell Road, and have a large business in general furnishing—I remember the prisoner and Miss Eversleigh coming to my shop—the date is not on this paper—it was the 17th January, 1874—I have my book to prove it—by looking at this bill my memory goes back to the transaction perfectly well—Miss Evers<lb></lb>leigh purchased the bulk of goods entered on this invoice—there was a bedstead and palliasse purchased by the prisoner—Miss Eversleigh paid for the goods, with the exception of those two items—there was a remark made about Mr. May wanting a bedstead, and Miss Eversleigh offered to lend him an amount—I cannot say how much, whether 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw some money pass between them—I asked if both transactions should be put into one bill, and they said "Oh, yes, Mr. Bourne, it makes no differ<lb></lb>rence," and as Miss Eversleigh was standing by I thought it didn't matter, though I don't usually do transactions in that manner—I made out the bill as it now stands—the total amount was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I next asked "Where hall I send these goods to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—May said "Mr. May's, 3, Dane's Road"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200161"></xptr>
               <p>and Miss Eversleigh was standing by, I thought it would make no difference sending the goods to Mr. May, if I put "Mr. May" on the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was asked to be a witness when the question of detaining the goods was before Mr. Lushington—I think it was about the first week in August that Miss Eversleigh applied to me asking for another bill—there was a party with them when the goods were bought—who it was I don't know—three parties altogether. (<hi rend="italic">Alfred May was called in</hi>). I do not think I have ever seen that lad before—I did not give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to my knowledge that night—he had nothing to do with the purchase, and no gratuity was given him—there was something said about Miss Eversleigh going to live with, them—she selected the articles that were to be used in her room—the curtains are scratched out in my book as not had—they were purchased, and afterwards drawn through—I see the curtains are required to make up the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I certainly must admit that I didn't know the curtains were in here—if my book is allowed to be produced, it will be found that they are scratched through—I never knew Kiss Eversleigh before she came to my shop on this occasion—I saw nothing of her between January, 1874. and August, 1875, when she applied to me for a second bill—I never saw Mr. Martin till I saw him in Court in my life—who is Mr. Martin?

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I understood at the time they would leave the curtains—whether they were run through and they had them afterwards I can't say—they may have done that—they paid me gold and silver only—I could not swear how much of each—I will not say how much money was produced from the pocket of the prisoner—I know the greater bulk came from Miss Eversleigh—I am positive—the money was handed from off the table to my desk by the hand of May, but it came from Miss Everleigh's purse.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my father—I am sixteen years of age—I recollect Agnes Eversleigh coming to live at our place in January, 1874—I remember her speaking of her marriage—I recollect in January going to Mr. Bourne's shop with my father, mother, and Miss Eversleigh, who had only just come there—the bed-room was not then furnished—my father, bought some furniture on our going to Bourne's, viz., a couch, table, chairs, bedstead, and other things—I think only the bedstead went into my room—father took the other things—the palliasse went into my room—some went into my mother's room—the curtains went into Miss Eversleigh's room—I cannot remember what articles went into my mother's room—my father produced the money to pay for them—he had not got quite enough, and said "I shall not be able to pay for all the things now," and Miss Eversleigh said "I have got some more money," and she pulled out two pieces of gold—I cannot say whether they were half sovereigns or sovereigns, and placed them father's hand, and he gave the money to Mr. Bourne—she did not produce more than two golden coins on that occasion—6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was given to me by Mr. Bourne for showing the man where to take the goods to—I am sure he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

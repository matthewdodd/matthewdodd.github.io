               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, on Saturday six weeks ago the came about eleven o'clock in the morning; I told her the people was gone and she should have the room, she had spoke before for the room; she had been four times before about these lodgings; she said she took in ladies linen to wash, and her husband was a gentleman's servant at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did you agree to let her have - A. The lower back parlour on the ground floor furnished; about five o'clock in the afternoon, I agreed with her to have the room; she brought two small bundles with her, and asked my leave to put them into the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay in the house - A. Not above an hour or three quarter's in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. After having made the bargain at five occlock, are you sure there was any bed linen - A. Yes, she took the dirty sheets off the bed, and I brought her down clean linen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130040"></xptr>Q. Did she come to sleep there that night - A. No, I gave her the key of the street door, and shewed her how to come in, in case I might be out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her again the next day - A. No, last Saturday week was the next time I saw her after that I examined the room finding she did not come home, and missed the sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the sheets again - A. Never, I saw her in Spitalfields watchhouse, she was not taken up on my charge. The two bundles she brought in was hay in one bundle and grass in the other; she emptied the contents of the handkerchiefs in the room, and took the handkerchiefs with her, and the key of the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the sheets - A. Four shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave her the dirty sheets, I had no clean sheets at all; the bed was very dirty, and there was no lock to the door.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am very sure I put down a pair of clean sheets, she said she liked the room very well, and I am sure there were neither hay or grass in the room before she came in.</p>

On the 12th of October I went into my bed room about five minutes to twelve o'clock, the windows were down, the curtains of the window not being drawn I drew them, it is a sash window in the gallery, I found there were no fastenings to it, afterwards I put the candle upon the table immediately under the window, placed my coat and waistcoat upon a chair close to the table, at the corner of the window, and went to bed. Somewhere about three o'clock in the morning I thought I heard something move like pushing up the window, I heard it rain very hard, and therefore conceived it might be the wind and rain that deceived me, I went to sleep again: I heard it the second time, but had the same impression, I thought, as I supposed, for some short time I heard my coat move, I also heard something fall, at that time it appeared to be like the sound of a small tea-spoon, but it turned out to be my pencil-case, I also heard my money rattle, I had two dollars and a shilling in my waistcoat pocket. I listened for some time, but I could not hear the foot of any person, I heard the mewing of a cat, I thought there might be a cat in the room, or a rat, or something of that sort, that might move my coat, I got out of bed, I looked round the room as well as I could, it was dark, I could see nothing, I had no idea of the window being opened, the door I knew to be locked, I considered myself in a very respectable house, therefore I had no fear, and got into bed again, it was still raining and very dark. When I awoke in the morning about five or ten minutes past eight I observed the curtains of the window moving gently, as though blown by the wind, I got out of bed and saw that the window was open, I looked at my coat and waistcoat, and did not find them in the situation that I had left them at night, I immediately searched my coat pocket, I had put my coat and waistcoat on the back of the chair. When I got up in the morning the coat was on the chair, not upon the back, the coat was upon the seat of the chair, and the waistcoat upon that, but not as I had left them. I searched for my money, but it was gone.</p>


               <p>Q. What was it you lost. - A. Twenty-five pound, three five pound notes, two twos, and six ones, Bank of England notes, I for some time considered whether I should mention it to Mr. Glover, he being a particular friend of mine, I was afterwards so determined. I knew the notes when I saw them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You did not try the window. - A. No, I am certain it was down.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been dining at the house. - A. Yes, I was perfectly sober I assure you.</p>

            . I am a waiter at Mr. Glover's, the Green Dragon Inn. On Saturday, the 12th, the prisoner came into our house, between the hours of two and three in the day, and asked whether he could have some dinner in the coffee room, it was served to him according to his orders. About an hour after dinner he called for the bill, when he discharged the bill, he asked whether he could sleep at our house after he came from the theatre, having at that time the appearance of a gentleman I told him yes, he came between the hours of ten or eleven, he had his supper and went to bed.</p>
               <p>The next morning about seven o'clock he got up, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300020"></xptr>paid me his bill in the coffee-room and went away, I am sure as to his person.</p>

            . Q. You are a city marshal. - A. I am. On the Sunday morning I was going down Bishopsgate Street, about the hour of ten or a little after, Mr. Piper was on one side of the street and I on the other, he beckoned me to come to him, he had something to communicate, he then told me that he had been robbed at a house, which of all the houses in London he respected for punctuality and good conduct, he wished me to come before Mr. Glover to investigate this robbery, after some few minutes I requested the waiter might be sent for from thence, I had every clue that caused me to do what I did, that is to apprehend the prisoner. I went round to the different coffee houses and inns in London to give information that if a man, answering the description, that they would be good enough to give information, so that we might be able to see if it was the man that slept at that inn that night. I received information on the Monday morning that induced me to take him into custody, I instantly took him into the coffee-room at the Four-Swans, Bishopsgate Street, where I apprehended him. He made a strong resistance before he would suffer me to search him, upon searching him, in his breeches pocket I found three five-pound Bank of England notes, with other things that he had about him, which I now produce. I went on Monday evening to the prison, and took four one-pound notes from the person of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor.) Look at these five-pound notes. - A. They are mine all three of them, there is on them the person's name I had taken them of the day of the month, the date of the year. The four pound notes are mine, I knew them again.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can Mr. Piper say that he had the property about him when he went to bed. - A. Yes, when I was in Mr. Glover's bar I put my hand in my pocket, and felt the notes two minutes before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I changed a thirty-pound note in a gambling house in Oxford Street, I lost five pound there, that was on the Saturday night. On the Monday night I was taken up, I was as liable to take them in change as any body else, on Thursday night I slept at the Green Dragon.</p>

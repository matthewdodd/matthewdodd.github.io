                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Ransom, of Long-alley, Moor<lb></lb>fields. On the 17th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the pri<lb></lb>soner came for a quartern loaf, a quartern of cheese, a pennyworth of to<lb></lb>bacco, and a quartern of dripping—it came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me a half-crown—I gave him the change—he went away—as soon as I saw him go by the window I remarked something about the half-crown—I then rubbed my thumb over it, and found it was bad—I followed him—he turned into Ball-alley—I went back, and left a man in my shop, got a policeman, but could not find the prisoner—the half-crown was in my left hand—I then put it on a shelf till my husband came home between six and seven o'clock, and then gave it to him—I am positive it was the same—the prisoner came again near upon eight o'clock on Sunday evening, the 21st of April, for a halfpennyworth of tobacco—he paid a halfpenny for it—he then asked for a penny box of matches—he said he had got but a halfpenny—I took them away—he said, "Don't put them away, I will have change for half a crown"—I told him he had better not change half a crown for a box of matches—I recollected his person—I saw the half-crown was a bad one, and gave it to my husband—he gave it back to me directly—I went with it in my hand for a policeman, and when he came I gave the half-crown to him.</p>

On the 17th of April, my wife gave me a bad half-crown—there was a mark just in front of the nose on the head side—it has never been out of my possession since—this is it—I saw the prisoner about eight o'clock in the evening of Sunday, the 21st of April—my wife gave me a bad half-crown then—I told her to fetch a policeman—I gave the half-crown back to her as soon as I looked at it—she fetched a police<lb></lb>man, and gave it to him.</p>

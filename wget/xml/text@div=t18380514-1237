                  </hi>. I am servant at the Yorkshire Grey public-house at Hampstead. The prisoner was pot-boy there—on the 17th of April he went out with some beer—while he was out I went to get a shovel of coals, and on coming back I saw a piece of paper op the stairs—on picking it up a small jewel box fell from it, which had a pair of ear-rings in it—I searched under the stairs, and found a pair of scissors, and a glazier's dia<lb></lb>mond—and under a great deal of dirty sand I found this mahogany box—I gave the things to my mistress—I went after the prisoner with a book which he had forgotten—I said to him, "You know all about Mrs. Gar<lb></lb>van's box, don't you? but I have got it now."</p>

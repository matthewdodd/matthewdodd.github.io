            . Not the prisoner. I pursued after him that had the hat, and the prisoner and another ran after me; when I was within about twenty yards of the person that had my hat he turned again into the market-house: then the prisoner took hold of me and said, this is he. I was pretty near the Harrow alehouse; there stood a watchman; I called him to my assistance, and we took him and another person (knowing them to be of the company that took my hat) to the watch-house, and they were committed: I do not pretend to say the prisoner was a confederate; I never got my hat again.</p>

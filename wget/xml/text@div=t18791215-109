                  </hi>. I was cook and steward on the ship Coringa, a British North-American vessel—on 3rd November we were in the Channel off Start Point, on our voyage from New York to Antwerp—there were about 20 men in the ship—the captain's name was Robert Gibson, and prisoner was chief mate—Graham was the second mate—the prisoner was in command of the port watch, which consisted of John Backiers, William Konstead, James Henry, John O'Connor, a man called Bill, whose other name I do not know, Edward Macfie, and two others—on the 3rd November I came up on deck about 10.30, and saw the second mate fighting with a man named Mike Kearney—the captain was standing on the poop, about six yards from them—the prisoner was not on deck—I parted them—a few minutes afterwards Cutting came up on deck with this hatchet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at that time no one else on deck was armed—the captain told Kearney he was</p>

               <p>going to put him in irons because he had threatened his life—Kearney said he would not go into irons, and tried to make his way forward, farther away from the captain—the captain followed him up, and told him he must put him in irons—O'Connor and Ronstead told the man not to go into irons—the captain then ordered the port watch below, but they did not go—the captain was going to put Kearney in irons, and had a revolver, which he held out in his hands—I saw Ronstead with a hatch-bar in his band—it is about six feet long and several inches broad—he was some distance from the captain, and could not have struck him without ad<lb></lb>vancing—the prisoner came alongside the captain with the hatchet in his hand—the deceased told Kearney to go quietly into irons—Henry was then going towards the captain, having his hands on the waistbands of his trousers, holding his trousers up—he had nothing in his hand—I saw prisoner with the hatchet raised, and said "Mr. Cutting, what are you going to do with that hatchet!"—as I said that he advanced and struck Henry on the forehead with the blade—the blow cut him right through the bone—I heard the captain say "My God, what did you do that for!" as soon as he was struck—the captain took him to Graham's cabin—I assisted to sew up the wound—he remained in the cabin till he died, on the 6th—I did not hear Cutting make any answer to the captain's remark—there was no row after that—Kearney went into irons afterwards.</p>

I am a native of Sweden and was able seaman on board the Coringa—I joined it at New York on November 3rd—I was asleep down below and was awakened by a noise—I went on deck and saw the second mate and Kearney fighting—I saw the captain come along from the poop with a belaying pin in his hand, but when he had got down two or three steps the fighting had ceased, and he turned back again—the second mate said to Kearney "Well not fight any more"—a short time afterwards I saw him with a carpenter's maul in his hands—about 15 minutes after I heard a noise again on deck, and when I was standing at the door I heard the captain say to Kearney "I am going to pnt you in irons"—the captain had a revolver in his left hand—the prisoner had a hammer in his left hand and a hatchet in the other—I saw Kearney run forward into the midst of the port watch, and saw the prisoner try to cut him—Henry was walking towards the captain and mate, about five feet from the captain and three feet from the mate—he said to Kearney "It would be best for you to go into irons"—I saw prisoner strike Henry with the axe—Bonstead had a natch bar—he was about five feet away from Henry when he was struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain of the Coringa—I sailed with her from New York on the morning of the 3rd—I saw Kearney and Graham quarrelling, and ordered it to cease, and ordered the port watch below—they did not obey the order, and said they were not sleepy, or something like that—they urged Kearney on to give it to the second mate; I asked Kearney what he meant by creating such a disturbance in the ship—he said he was not raising any disturbance—I told him I had had him logged before for threatening my life—he said he did not care, and I told him I would put him in irons—he said "I will go in"—I said "All right," and went down to get the irons—as I was going down I heard them say that we could not put him in irons, or something like that—the mate was in his room, and I said to him "We must put that man in irons"—I got two or three pairs of irons, and put my revolver in my pocket; I passed the irons to prisoner, and took another pair as I was coming out of the cabin; prisoner followed me on deck—the port watch were all standing on the forecastle, and Kearney was down ait the poop by the mainmast—I called him to go in irons peacefully, and the port watch sung out to him not to go in irons—I followed him, and told them to go below, and two or three of them, especially Ronstead, remarked "We are not soft enough; we are not sleepy enough"—they did not go below; Kearney retreated into the port watch—I said "If you do not come I will shoot you"—he said "Shoot away," and I pointed my revolver at his legs; I was watching him—I heard some one say "Look out, captain!" and then I saw the prisoner strike Henry—Ronstead had a hatchbar in his hand—as soon as the blow was struck Ronstead gave in—I believe the whole of us were in danger, and that prisoner's intervention in my behalf at that moment was necessary—as chief officer it was his place to protect me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were 20 men on board all told—14 sailors—I did not see the prisoner with the axe in his cabin—there were five of the men standing by me—I did not see Ronstead with the hatch bar till just as the blow was struck—my revolver has seven chambers; three loaded with ball cartridge—I suppose Kearney meant it in earnest when he said "Shoot away"—after the blow all was perfectly quiet—that settled them—the crew had never complained to me of the prisoner till 13th October, when they said we had brought this man on board to knock them about.</p>

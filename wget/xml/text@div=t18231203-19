On the 2d of November, between seven and eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my house, with a party of eight or ten, to practice ringing the bells, which are my property. The prisoner asked for them two or three times - they continued ringing for two or three hours, and when they were gone I missed the bells; some went out at the front, and the others the back way. I took the bells with the lease of the house. I value them at 3 l.</p>

            . I live in Millbank-row, Westminster. On Sunday evening, the 2d of November, I was at the Ship; the prisoner was there, with three more; others were there, but not in his company; his party had the bells brought in, and used them - I left them there, and on Monday, the 10th, I went and found the prisoner at work in Gravel-lane, and said," I suppose you know what I am come about; the landlord of the Ship has lost his bells." I asked where they were; he said he believed they were in pawn; he took me to two or three pawnbrokers' shops in Gray's Inn-lane, and at Kendrew's we found them.</p>

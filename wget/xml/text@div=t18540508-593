                  </hi>, Esq. I am a Barrister of the Inner Temple. I am in the habit of going to Westminster of a morning, during term—it has been my usual practice to change my coat before I put on my wig—on 21st Jan. I went down at the usual time, in a coat that had a breast pocket within; I had a porte monnaie in the pocket containing 2 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, a check for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, a check for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, a sovereign, a half sovereign, and some silver—the checks were both crossed "&amp; Co."—I went into Howard's robbing room, the prisoner waited upon me—he was about to take out my other coat, but I told him I would wear the same as I had on; I took it off for the convenience of tying on my cravat, and I believe I handed my coat to the prisoner, who put it on a chair—I was in conversation with some gentle<lb></lb>men, and afterwards found the prisoner holding up my coat with both hands for me to put on—I was hurried that morning as some one was waiting for me, and I went down stairs—I saw the person who was waiting for me in the lobby, and as I was going through the passage to the Court of Exche<lb></lb>quer, I buttoned up my coat, and missed my Porte monnaie—it was then about 10 o'clock—I immediately went upstairs, made known my loss in the room, and addressed the prisoner as he had assisted me, and had to do with my coat, and no one else; I asked him if he had seen my purse, he said he knew nothing about it—I had always been in the habit of taking my purse out of my pocket and laying it on the table to place it in my other pocket, and the prisoner has often seen me do that; but on this occasion as I was going to wear the same coat, I left the purse in the pocket—I went upstairs again, about 12 o'clock, and saw the prisoner; I complained of my loss, and he asked me if the checks were crossed, I said, "Yes"—I received the Bank notes from Minson, a clerk of Messrs. Roberts, Curtis, and Co., they were part of a check for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Exeter bank, of which they are the correspondents; I had received three 5/.-notes, and had given the preceding note to these to Mrs. Kingdon on the preceding night—there was no mark on them, they were new notes.</p>

Mr. Harriss received a letter; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I know the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing, and I should say that it is not his—the "Ingdon" and "Turner" on this note is the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Pitt-street, St. George-Row. I for<lb></lb>merly lived in Marshall-street—I am an accountant, and have been so eleven years—I have known the lad at the bar about five months; he came to lodge with me about the middle of Feb.—he left Mr. Howard's situation eight or nine days or a fortnight afterwards—on the day he left, 21st Jan., he came home earlier than usual, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon; I said, "Halloo, Robert! how is it you are home so early to-day?"—he said, "The Court is up, and I have got a holiday for a month"—his father lives in the New Kent-road—a night or two after this I was at his father's place; I saw Mr. Howard there, making inquiries—I afterwards said to the prisoner, "Mr. Howard is making inquiries after you and wants you to go back to your work; how is it you told me a lie?"—he said, "I shall not go back any more"—I wanted to know the reason, and he said he had too much bother, and too many masters—this letter, signed "Richardson," (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one which he employed me to write to Messrs. Howard and Harries for him—the envelope is also my writing; I gave it to him to post—he remained with me two or three days afterwards—in consequence of seeing his married sister, Charlotte Coleman, I said to him, "I was speaking</p>

               <p>to your sister, and she told me that Robert gave her a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to change; that she asked you where you got it, and you said that Mr. O'Brien gave it to you to take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it, as you had not change"—I asked him why he said so, and he did not give me any answer—about three or four days after that I told him of a report about some money having been taken from the place where he was employed, and that, as he had left the place, there was a suspicion upon him—he gave me no answer to that—some time after he left, I heard a person say he threw the checks over Westminster bridge; I cannot say who the person was—on the Saturday after the prisoner left, I saw him in possession of a sovereign, a half sovereign, and some silver—I think it was on the Saturday night, and on that Saturday evening I think it was he brought home some new trowsers—I asked him who made them; he said his brother, and that he gave 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—he asked me to go with him to choose a pair of boots—I asked him where he got the money—he said his single sister gave him two sovereigns the night before—he bought a new hat that night, and a new jacket—I afterwards saw his single sister, and from what she told me I afterwards said to him, "I was speaking to your sister Charlotte, and she says she did not give you two sovereigns; she gave you a half sovereign"—he made no answer, but only turned on one side.</p>

               <p>such friends—I did not introduce him to any bad houses, but he asked me once to go and have a woman with him—I introduced him to a house, near the Elephant and Castle, kept by a very respectable woman; but a woman who I had very frequently seen standing outside spoke to me, and he spoke to her; I told her he was a young man stopping with me—I have often been to her house, and spoken to her, but I will swear that I never knew her more than by speaking to her—I never had anything improper to do with her—I knew perfectly well that she was a woman of the town; and when I met her I mentioned this young man to her; that is introducing him—I understand she is called <hi rend="italic">Irish Kate</hi>—I have said, more than once, that I introduced him to the woman; but I told him not to go with her—I have frequently been with him to her house, after he went to stop there—it was not to see if he was getting into mischief, for I think the woman was very kind to him; but I was in communication with his friends—I have never played at cards at <hi rend="italic">Irish Kate's</hi>, or at anything; that I swear—I have never been married—the prisoner told me that his sister had 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw her one day when I was with him; she called him to her and talked to him, in my presence, but I walked away—I heard him say he would come home to his family—I did not notice that she seemed a great deal distressed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the lad come back, and did you advise him not to go home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath, I advised him to go home; he went with me—while he slept at home, he slept with me; I never slept with him at any other place but once, when we were late, and went to a coffee shop and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a bed—we had been at the Globe coffee shop, eating, drinking, and reading—he read very little.</p>

               <p>Mr. - Levi. I had this note of Mr. Morris at Mr. Cardineaux's, in his presence.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom was the application made with regard to this note? Was you employed as attorney for Mr. Cardineaux?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; I applied to him to get possession of this note; I heard it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore went to Mr. Cardineaux?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No money was paid on it then, I believe?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes; I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell Cardineaux?</p>
               <p>Levi. I desired he would give me the note.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190023"></xptr>Q. For what purpose?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe I told him no purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. An attorney go to Mr. Cardineaux, desire a note of 100 l. and not tell him for what purpose?</p>
               <p>Levi. I asked Mr. Cardineaux, when coming away, if he would be willing to prosecute Bolland? he said, he would; but desired three or four days time to consider of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard it was a forgery?</p>
               <p>Levi. I had; and in the course of conversation with Mr. Cardineaux, I believe it was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave Mr. Cardineaux a receipt?</p>
               <p>Levi. I gave Mr. Morris one.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of it?</p>
               <p>Levi. To deliver it up, or be accountable for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear of this note at all?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe I was informed of it by Mr. Pritchard.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been concerned for him?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes, seven years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew of very considerable dealings between them?</p>
               <p>Levi. I am sorry to say that there should be; it was against my advice.</p>
               <p>Q. To a great many thousand pounds, I believe?</p>
               <p>Levi. God knows; it was a great deal in the bill way. I have a good many in my pocket, if you think they would be of any service to your client. I believe I asked if he was desirous to prosecute this forgery; he desired three or four days time to consider of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Something must have passed with regard to its being a forgery?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe it was mentioned by each of us in the back parlour of its being a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cardineaux did not know it at that time, I believe?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe he did long before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by Mr. Pritchard's order you went to get this note?</p>
               <p>Levi. It was by his desire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not, tell Mr. Cardineaux it was a forgery?</p>
               <p>Levi. To the best of my recollection, Mr. Cardineaux acknowledged it to be a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not, tell Mr. Cardineaux it was a forgery?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe not; he had given a collateral security for it. Cardineaux and Morris refused to give it him. I went and asked for the bill. In the course of the conversation the forgery was mentioned, whether by Cardineaux, Morris, or me, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not say you did not mention it?</p>
               <p>Levi. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any one word mentioned by you, that you was taking this to carry before a magistrate?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; not a word, I believe, was mentioned about a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you propose to return the money?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; I was to return the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was not concerned for Cardineaux, but for Pritchard?</p>
               <p>Levi. No, as a friend; not as an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you, by a receipt, gave him to understand that you would return it him again?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes; to Mr. Morris.</p>
               <p>Q. In Cardineaux's presence?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then Cardineaux gave you the note, and you carried it to the magistrate?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; some time after that, Cardineaux and Morris went with me to Hickes's-hall, to find a bill of indictment for this forgery. It was the adjournment day; the jury did not sit long enough; they were gone. Then Cardineaux appointed me to meet him at Sir

               <p>Levi. I heard there was no defence; he has recovered 1490 odd pounds. I was informed by Pritchard's attorney that there was no defence, Pritchard being a bankrupt, and no assignees being chosen; I had the evidence in my pocket, and could have controverted that fact.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you took it up as the prosecutor, without Mr. Cardineaux. Upon the faith and conscience of an honest man, has there been any quarrel between Bolland and you?</p>
               <p>Levi. On the faith and conscience of an honest man and a christian, I have not the least prejudice, or owe him the least ill will in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any personal quarrel with him?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; but he has done some of my clients great mischief, two eminent merchants in London; I shall not mention the circumstance unless the prisoner's council desires it.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray be a little particular respecting the conversation that passed between you and Cardineaux, when you gave him this receipt?</p>
               <p>Levi. I cannot really recollect any more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, for what purpose did you get the note of him?</p>
               <p>Levi. For the purpose it has answered; to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Cardineaux that?</p>
               <p>Levi. I think not. What passed at Mr. Cardineaux's was, I said, are you willing or desirous to prosecute this man?</p>
               <p>Q. That was afterwards?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; at that meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen Mr. Cardineaux till that time?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cardineaux. This was the bill delivered to Mr. Levi at my house, in my presence.</p>
               <p>- Jesson. I had some business with one Mr. Lilburne, who appointed me to meet him at the George and Vultur tavern, Cornhill, on the 13th or 14th of October. I went about three o'clock; I was shewn into a public room; Mr. Lilburne and Mr. Bolland were there. I immediately asked Mr. Bolland when he would settle a note of fifty guineas of his, which I had discounted, which was due, and laid unpaid, as the person that held it was very desirous to settle it. He produced this note, and desired me to discount it, as he was out of cash, I read it; I knew Bradshaw, being a neighbour; and I knew Pritchard. The 50 l. note I had discounted was on Pritchard. This note was endorsed 
               <persName id="t17720219-46-person400">

                   Bolland

            . I told him, that his name being on the back of it, I could not, or would not negociate it. I said, I looked upon Bradshaw to be good; but did not chuse to be on the same paper with Mr. Bolland's name, or to offer it indeed; and, I believe, I threw it down upon the table. Upon that he said, I can take off my name; and Mr. Lilburne took up one of the table knives, with intention to erase all the name. I believe, when he had erased all but the B, for he began at the latter end of the name, Bolland said, Don't scratch it all out, for it may disfigure it or cancel it, by scratching a hole in it. He said, he would think of some other name that begins with a B; and immediately filled it up with anks, which made the name of Banks; and when that was done, returned it to me. I did not like the transaction, it rather staggered me; but looking on Bradshaw to be a very good man, and Pritchard bore a very good character, as far as I could find, I thought I might as well take this security; it might be a means of getting the other matter settled; therefore I put it in my pocket. The next day I asked Mr. Cardineaux to discount me a note of Mr. Bradshaw's, of Charles-street, Covent-garden; he was a customer of Mr. Cardineaux's. He said, he would take it, and would probably do it on Friday, which is the day he did his business at his banker's. I left the bill with Mr. Cardineaux; and next day (Thursday) having some money to make up, I asked Cardineaux to let me have 15 l. 16 s. and if he did not discount the bill, I would return it him. He gave me a draft upon his banker for that sum; this was Thursday or Friday. On Saturday morning Mr. Bolland came up to my office; (I keep a lottery-office under the Piazza, Covent-garden) to enquire whether I had done the business or no. I told him, I had left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190025"></xptr> bill in the hands of Mr. Cardineaux; and he might enquire who Cardineaux was, as I could not go into the city then. I understood Mr. Bolland, that he saw Mr. Cardineaux; however, in the evening Mr. Handsforth came in, and told me, Mr. Bolland desired to see me in the Piazzas. I went out; he insisted upon having the bill or money; for he was greatly pushed for money, and must and would have it immediately. I believe he told me that he had seen Mr. Cardineaux in the city, and he would call upon me. I told him, if he would go to any public house in the neighbourhood, I would come to him. Upon that, he and Mr. Handsforth went to the Rainbow coffee-house in Queen-street, to wait for me. I sent down one of my clerks to Mr. Cardineaux, and he came up to the office soon after. I told him, that the person I had the note of, was gone to the coffee-house, and was anxious to have it settled. We went together to the Rainbow coffee-house; we went into a back room. I told Mr. Cardineaux, That is Mr. Bolland, the owner of the bill of Mr. Bradshaw's, that I left in your hands; and I shall be glad if you will settle it with him. Mr. Cardineaux said, he had never a banker's check in his pocket, and did not like to give a draft upon plain paper. He began to enquire who Mr. Pritchard and who Mr. Banks were. While Mr. Bolland was satisfying him who Pritchard was, I told Mr. Cardineaux, that rather than have the trouble of another meeting, I would go home and fetch him a check. Mr. Cardineaux gave me his keys, and I went down to his house in Craven-buildings, Drury-lane. I delivered the keys to Mrs. Cardineaux, and she gave me a banker's check. On my coming back, I found Mr. Bolland had satisfied Mr. Cardineaux concerning Banks and Pritchard; and he produced another bill for 10 l. which Mr. Cardineaux had agreed to discount for him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the George and Vulture in Cornhill, was any thing said by the prisoner who Banks was?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I believe I omitted that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. That is in London.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly; and if an uttering is not proved in Middlesex, what passed in London to be sure is nothing; but what happened in London does make a part of the general story, and can't be omitted.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. I am aware of that.</p>
               <p>Jesson. When I had it, after the name of Banks was on it, I put it into my pocket. I said, I shall give it to a particular friend of mine, and he will undoubtedly ask me who Banks is. He said, Banks is a publican or victualler, and lives near or in Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note produced then at the Rainbow coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Jesson. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed there then?</p>
               <p>Q. Jesson. I think the prisoner told him at that time, that he was a publican or victualler, in or near Rathbone-place; and I think he added, that he was a man of good character; a responsible man is what I mean by it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. At the George and Vulture you applied to Bolland about some money?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a bill was produced?</p>
               <p>Jesson. This bill was produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it proposed by the prisoner to have that bill negociated in the state it then was?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes; he offered it me as it then stood.</p>
               <p>Q. You objected to taking the bill with his name on it?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I did; and he proposed to take his name off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing at that time meant or intended by Bolland, or you, or Lilburne, more than to take Bolland's name entirely off, and to leave it on the credit of Bradshaw and Pritchard the indorser?</p>
               <p>Jesson. It was my opinion that it should be taken off; and Lilburne took it up to erase the name entirely off, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Bradshaw then?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a man in credit and character?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes, and credit; and Pritchard was in credit at that time. I had discounted a bill on Pritchard; I had enquired, and had a very good character of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you or not, an intention to pass this bill with Cardineaux on the credit of Bradshaw, at that time a good man?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the intention was to take the name entirely off?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190026"></xptr>Q. And not to put any thing on it, thinking Bradshaw's name enough?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Bradshaw and Pritchard.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe you would have taken it to Mr. Cardineaux, to discount it on the credit of Bradshaw and Pritchard, without any endorsement further?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I believe I should; but I should have taken an engagement of Bolland, to secure the money if it was not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, or not, before you had the bill of Bolland, at any time mentioned to Cardineanx, that you had a bill of this kind drawn by Bradshaw, and indorsed by Pritchard?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I do not remember that I had; I took it out and shewed it him, and said, Will you, Mr. Cardineaux discount this bill? I think I gave him the bill into his hand at the same time. I put the bill into his hand, and said, Here is a bill of Mr. Bradshaw's, will you discount me this note? or to that purpose. He said, At present it did not suit him to do it; probably in a day or two he would; this was, I think, Wednesday, and that Friday was the day he did business with his banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Cardineaux, you said, was enquiring after Pritchard, when you went home for a check to his house?</p>
               <p>Jesson. He was enquiring about Pritchard when I went for the check; the name Banks was mentioned either before or after.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an apprehension that it might be mentioned?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I am certain it was mentioned that he was a publican or victualler, or some such thing, and lived near Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure Cardineaux has not told you so since; or that you heard him?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I am sure I heard him tell him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect whether that note in your hand was produced at the Rainbow, or not?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I think it was; but am not clear.</p>
               <p>Court. How happened it that the names of the endorsers were known or remembered, if the note was not there? Was there any memorandum produced?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I think the bill itself was produced, to the best of my recollection; I got as far as Mr. Cardineaux said, It did not suit him to give all in cash; and he agreed to give so much cash and his own note, payable at the same time this bill should become due. I think he gave him his draft for 44 l. and his own note for the remainder of the money, except the 15 l. 16 s. which I paid to Bolland, reckoning that as so much already accounted for. Cardineaux left us; and Bolland said, Do you want this 15 l. 16 s. for any time? I said, it was just the hurry of our business; money is serviceable to us just at the drawing of the lottery; I will give you my note for a month. He 
               <persName id="t17720219-46-person401">
                  drew

                  </persName>
             the note himself, and I signed it; and I paid it when due.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Bolland, or had you any discourse with him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Jesson. When I saw in the paper that Bradshaw was a bankrupt, Mr. Cardineaux came to me, and said, You must take care of that 100 l. note of Bolland; for it is a hundred to one but my banker will return it to me immediately; I believe it is unusual to keep a note after a man is a bankrupt. I told him, I would take an opportunity to see Bolland. I was going that day into the city, and called at his house; he was not at home; but I saw him afterwards at the Sword-blade coffee-house. I said to him, That note of 100 l. of Bradshaw's, which I got Mr. Cardineaux to discount for you, will not be paid, for Bradshaw is in the papers to-day; he is a bankrupt; you must take care of it against it becomes due. Upon that he looked at me: What note? says he. I said, that note that I got Mr. Cardineaux to discount for you. The note was discounted the 18th or 19th of October; and I believe Bradshaw became a bankrupt between a fortnight and three weeks after. Upon mentioning this to Bolland, he said, What note are you talking of? I said, Bradshaw's note, payable to Pritchard; you must take care of it. Said he, Is my name upon it? I said, No; your name was upon it, but Banks's name is now upon it; you stood in his shoes, and must take care of it. He said, indeed, he knew nothing at all of it. I said, you know Mr. Lilburne was present, and you must take care of it. He said, indeed, he knew nothing of it, nor should. I said, very well; then I will let Mr. Cardineaux know immediately the circumstances, and your putting of Banks's name on it; upon which he laughed or sneered at me, and said, I'll forgive you all you can do upon that account. I told him I would acquaint Mr. Cardineaux of the transaction, and on my return home I called upon Mr. Cardineaux; he was not at home; but he called upon me next morning, and at the same time Mr. Handsforth came in, and I immediately acquainted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190027"></xptr> Mr. Cardineaux with the transaction of the ank's being put upon the note, and that it was not likely that he would get any satisfaction of Bolland.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You said Bolland must stand to it; then you considered the name of Banks as the indorsement of Bolland?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes; I knew he had the money for it, and it was nothing but right that he should pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was liable to pay it?</p>
               <p>Jesson. Yes; and if he had paid it when it became due, nothing of this I believe would have happened.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Jury. At the time the erasement was made, and the name of Banks added to it, in what light did you take it, by way of giving more credit to the note, or by way of filling up the erasement?</p>
               <p>Jesson. I looked upon it he did it to make the bill negotiable; for a person would hardly take a bill in payment after a name is erased, for they imagine there is some reason for its being scratched out.</p>
               <p>Q. Council for the prisoner. Do you know how Mr. Lilburne came to stop at the letter B? was there any fold of the bill?</p>
               <p>Jesson. No; it does not go to the fold.</p>
               <p>Q. From one of the Jury. I imagine you looked upon it to be a mere fictitious name at that time?</p>
               <p>Court. No; he gave an account who this Banks was.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Mr. Cardineaux, please to tell what passed about that note when Jesson brought it to you.</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. Jesson came to me with this note, and asked me if I could discount it; and that the person would lend him 15 l. if I would do it; and he said, I should do him a service. I told him I knew Bradshaw very well, but did not know Pritchard nor Banks, therefore could not discount it till I was satisfied of both the indorsers. Jesson said, he knew Pritchard very well, that he was a dealer in horses, and as for Banks he did not know him. I desired him to enquire, and I would till then keep the bill by me. He went out and brought me in writing the direction of Banks; that he dealt in wine and brandy, and lived in Rathbone place. I kept the bill by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at either of these times tell you whom he had the bill of?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. He did not then. And I kept the bill till the Saturday; then Mr. Jesson told me, that Mr. Bolland was the proprietor of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Bolland at that time?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. No; I had never seen him. On Saturday, I was at the Edinburgh coffee-house near the Exchange; Bolland came there, and asked me, whether I would discount the bill Jesson gave me. I told him I had not had time to enquire about the endorsers; that I knew the drawer very well. He said, Pritchard was well known by every body; that he was a dealer in horses, and a man of great property, he told me Banks was also a man of property, and dealt largely in wine and spirits in Rathbone place, and I told him, I would consider about his bill. He wanted the money he said. I told him I had the bill of Mr. Jesson, and must see him before I accounted for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Bolland to indorse the note?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. No; I went to Jesson: upon my enquiring why Bolland's name was not upon the bill; he said that Bolland, though a man of property, it was better that his name should not appear upon the bill, because he was formerly a sheriff's officer, and that I could not pass the bill properly to my banker with his endorsement, therefore his name was not on it. I was afterwards sent for by Jesson; he and I went to the coffee-house in King-street Covent-Garden; that was Saturday: I found there Mr. Bolland and one Mr. Handsforth; Mr. Jesson came with me there. I took the bill out of my pocket. I had not had time to enquire about Pritchard and Banks. Bolland told me, that they were men of property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more about Banks?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. He told me Pritchard was a man of property, well known to be so, and that Banks was so, and dealt largely in wine and spirits, and lived in Rathbone place: upon my telling Bolland, it was not convenient for me to give him all in cash, he said he would be contented with half in cash, and he took my note at two months for 50 l. Not having any check with me, I gave Mr. Jesson the key of my beaureau, and he brought me a check. Mr. Bolland shewed me another little bill of ten guineas, and asked me to give him cash for it. I said I would; so I had the two bills, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190028"></xptr> made 110 l. 10 s. and I gave him a draft upon my banker for 44 l. 5 s. 10 d. - 15 l. 16 s. I had before given to Mr. Jesson; that, with my note of hand for 50 l. and 9 s. discount, made up the money.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you advanced the money for these notes, did you apply to Bolland to indorse it?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. No; because Jesson said it was better his name should not appear on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or any body in your presence, desire him to indorse it?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. No; some time after Bradshaw appeared in the Gazette; that made me uneasy, because I did not know the solidity of the endorsers; not knowing where Bolland lived, I went to Jesson's and got a direction to him; I went to his house, but he was not at home; then I went to Jesson and told him to go to Bolland, and tell him that I must have a security from the endorsers. I forgot to mention that when I paid the money, Bolland desired me to make the draft on my banker, in the name of Handsforth; as I said before, I could not meet with Mr. Bolland; I went into the City at last about business, to the Hamburgh coffee-house. I saw Bolland there. I said, that bill I discounted for you will not be paid: he, with an air of astonishment, said, what bill! I said the bill I discounted for you at such a coffee-house; said he, I never discounted a bill with you, sir, you mistake me, my name is 
               <persName id="t17720219-46-person402">

            , I never saw you in my life, nor you have no bill with my indorsement. Upon which being informed by Mr. Jesson, previous to that, that he did alter the name, I went to him privately in the coffee-house, and said, Mr. Bolland, you must not deny the thing, for I know all the transaction; I know who wrote Banks upon the bill. Upon that, he said, make yourself easy, the bill will be paid when due, and signified that I should prove the debts against Bradshaw, and what ever I received, he would pay the residue. I said, no, I would not; my business was with Mr. Pritchard and Mr. Banks; upon which I went out of the coffee-house. I told Bolland another time, that if he was not in present cash, if he had any good bill I would take it in payment, but he had no bill to offer me that I could approve; and he put me off, and said I must go to Pritchard, that he was going to sell part of his effects and would pay me. I did, but could get none; I left the bill with Mr. Morris, and desired he would call upon Mr. Bolland for the money; for the bill was then due; since that time I have never seen Mr. Bolland: after Mr. Bolland was taken, a person brought the 100 l. in the name of

               <p>Cardineaux. The same day that I knew of Bradshaw's bankruptcy, Jesson told me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was at the Rainbow coffee-house, Covent Garden, you pulled the bill out of your pocket in the course of that conversation with Mr. Bolland?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. Yes; I had had it for two or three days in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it, when this money was paid, that you did not deliver up the bill?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. Because I delivered it to Mr. Morris; and he delivered it to Mr. Levi, who gave him a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What! a promise to give it up?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. Yes; to give it up upon demand.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the receipt?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the reason you did not deliver the note up?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. Yes; if I had had the bill, I should have given it up. I said it was in the hands of Sir

               <p>Cardineaux. To be accountable for the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with Bradshaw?</p>

               <p>Q. What circumstances was he in?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. I thought him to be in good credit, he was a man in credit as far as I knew.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190029"></xptr>Q. For what purpose did Mr. Levi apply to you for this note?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. I told Mr. Pritchard of the forgery; and he told Mr. Levi. Mr. Levi came to me, and asked me if I was willing to prosecute Mr. Bolland. I said, if I thought it was the duty of an honest man to do it, I would do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think it the duty of an honest man or not?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. I thought it was. I looked upon my money to be lost. Pritchard was then a bankrupt as well as Bradshaw.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned, that besides this bill of 100 l. there was another of 10 l. 10 s. Who was that note made to?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. To Mr. Handsforth by the desire of Mr. Bolland.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that note been paid?</p>
               <p>Cardineaux. No; it was in the hands of Mr.

               <p>Q. Was there no money paid at all?</p>
               <p>Storer. Not that I recollect; it was only mentioned in account; there were various notes; therefore I cannot particularize this.</p>

               <p>Storer. Yes; for the purpose of paying Mr. Williams part of a 200 l. note, on account of the marshal's place, which money was raised for Mr. Bolland.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Then this receipt was a draft upon Bolland's banker for to pay a 100 l. due upon a 200 l. note?</p>

               <p>I never in my life forged with intent to cheat or defraud any person in the world. Please to ask Mr. Cardineaux, when he applied to me if I did not desire him to prove his debt under Bradshaw's commission and I would make good the deficiency; so I could have no design to cheat: there were two 100 l. notes to Pritchard; one he took back; I gave him a draft upon Sir

I wish it had been so now; I must leave the rest to my council; I don't understand the case.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. Mr. Bolland on the 17th paid a 100 l. to Pritchard by a draft on his banker.</p>
               <p>Court. You must take that together with the evidence of Pritchard's clerk, who tells you this particular 100 l. was paid for a particular purpose.</p>

I could have proved by Mr. Handsforth every transaction at the coffee-house. I never saw the bill since I saw it at the George and Vulture tavern, till this day.</p>

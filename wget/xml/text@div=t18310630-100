On the 25th of May I saw the prisoner at the Duke of York public-house, Chelsea. He wanted to sell his stockings, as he had no money - I gave him a drop of ale not to sell them; I went to the Snow Shoes, and he came in there -I fell asleep with my head on the table; I was drunk, and do not know how much money I had - I had changed a sovereign; the prisoner was setting at my side; I was awoke, and two knives shown to me, one of which I claimed.</p>

            . I am a labourer. The prosecutor and prisoner came into the public-house; I saw the prosecutor asleep - the prisoner put his hand into his lefthand pocket; I took hold of his hand, and he got up - I said,"What have you in your hand?" he said, "D-n you - what do you want to know for?" I said I would know - he said I should, and let a half-crown, two shillings, and a sixpence fall out of his hand - he was given in charge; the knife and 4s. 2d. was found on him.</p>

               <p>PATRICK CLENCH. This is not my knife, nor is it the one which was produced at Queen-square; the Policeman had two knives.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON MILLS. The prisoner's serjeant took the other knife, as the prosecutor could not say it was his, but this knife he swore to; I swear it is the same as he saw before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>PATRICK CLENCH. (Looking at his deposition) I signed this before the Magistrate - it was read over to me, but there was no flaw in the knife I swore to there, no hole - I had bought it the day before - this knife was not shown at Queen-square at all.</p>

            . There was nobody with them - they called for ale; the waiter wanted the money for it - they would not pay, and the waiter was going away; the prisoner said, "I have 2 1/2d. if the prosecutor will pay the rest;" they were in a box alone; I saw him feel Clench's pockets on both sides.</p>

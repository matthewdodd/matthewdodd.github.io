               <p>I lodge at Mrs. Baker's, in the room adjoining where Mrs. Harrison lays, I was coming through the passage and heard high words, and the prisoner at the bar refused to shew what she had in her apron; so I called another man and turned these things out of her apron, I am sure to the prisoner, we took her to the watch-house directly.</p>

               <p>When I went up to this person I trod upon these things, I picked them up, and would have come down to have shewn them to this gentlewoman in the parlour, she would not let me; the things were taken out of my lap by force; I trod upon them by accident, I came to see Mr. Smith of High-street Marybon; I never was nigh the room nor in the room; I was searched, I know nothing of the things.</p>

               <p>Was there any body there but her at this time? - Nobody but her, and I am sure I locked the door, I tried it after, and I took the key out.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mess. Bateman; I know the prisoner at the bar; on the 2d of May last, while I was up in the shop, I saw Mr. Hazard take some silver out of his skin, put it in some paper, and then into a box over his head; he turned the key; this was between the hours of eight and nine: after that I observed him take it from the box and put it into his pocket; it was wrapped up in paper: I looked into the skin, and finding it was gone I informed my master. After he left the shop there were three or four people left in the room. I don't know any thing more that passed that evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Do not the workmen's coats usually hang up in the shop? - Yes; but this was in a bag.</p>

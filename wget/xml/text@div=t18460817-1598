               <p>the left, where the fire was—I eventually got in, and found some loose books in the corner of the floor, in the back-room up stairs—they appeared to be waste paper—a few were packed up in the corner, the others distributed about the floor, round the corner, principally in the corner—the room was about nine feet by eleven—I went into the front room, which is a bed-room about the same size, and there found a sofa bedstead, a counterpane, a quilt, and a squab, and a sheet, nothing else—there were two boxes, one containing wearing ap<lb></lb>parel, and the other nothing—the prisoner was not in the house—I called him up from among the crowd, and asked for his policy of insurance—he said it was in the back room, in a desk—I said, "Very well, that is not burnt, then"—we proceeded down to the back room, and found no desk there—he then said it must be in the front in the counter, or by the counter, I do not know which he said—we went, and in front of the counter, where the wood was, found a desk partly burnt—there were some papers partly burnt there, and while looking at them, I saw him take something from his pocket, which he gave to the fore<lb></lb>man of the fire-brigade, who gave it to me—it is the policy which has beeu produced—I afterwards examined the shop—the counter was burnt—a por<lb></lb>tion of it was left—I produce eight pieces of twine similar to what wood is generally tied up in—they were mixed among the wood—some of the wood was loose and some in bundles—the pieces of twine laid in a heap on the floor—they had been scraped together by the fireman before—I found 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a silver watch in the house.</p>

On the 29th and 30th of April he was tipsy, and on the Wednesday I complained of his conduct; he was excessively abusive - I desired an officer to be sent for, and while the officer was sent for he left the house; this was at my house in Bond-street - the plate was taken from my house in Regent's-park; I searched my plate chest at my house in Regent's-park on the following day; I searched minutely, and on the first day I missed a pair of silver candlesticks and some table-spoons - how many I could not ascertain, because in the inventory of the plate there was something put over the number of spoons; I could not see the number - this was on Thursday; I missed dessert spoons and table spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Having searched in your pantry and plate-chest, was it possible for these candlesticks for instance, to have been in the place without your observing them? A. Certainly not. On the Saturday morning on my getting up, Kirby showed me the candlesticks and the rest of the plate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had he lived with you? A. He came to me in May last; I did not desire him to leave the house on Wednesday - he went away when I mentioned sending for the officer - he was drunk: I did not then suspect any robbery.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Savory's service. Wright left the house on Wednesday - I and Mr. Savory searched the pantry and plate-room minutely and attentively; these candlesticks could not have been there. On Saturday morning between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came and rang the bell; I was getting up - I opened the shutters and saw him in the area with a bundle under his arm; I asked him where the candlesticks were, and said there was a great piece of work about them; he said they were wrapped in paper in pantry; I said it was impossible for them to be there, for I and master had searched every place; I opened the door, he came into the kitchen, stood about a minute, and then went into the room adjoining the pantry, where the plate was kept; he stood there a minute or two and then went into the pantry - my fellow-servant came down - the prisoner then came out of the plate-room into the pantry with this pair of candlesticks; he put them down and returned to the room again without saying anything; he returned into the room and brought the tea-pot, wine-strainer and other things, which were not there when we searched; he produced a mug, some spoons, and other things - he then asked my fellow-servant Elizabeth, if that was all right; she said No, there was a table-spoon still missing - he turned round, went out, saying he would go and see if he could find the spoon; he took no bundle out with him - he said he would not see master till he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290004"></xptr>found the spoon; he returned between two and three o'clock in the afternoon and brought the spoon into the kitchen and gave it to me. I am certain this plate was not in the house before he came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you still in Mr. Savory's employ? A. Yes - I am his groom; I did not see the prisoner open his bundle - the plate-room is darkish - there is only one closet it it; I am sure I made accurate search; Mr. Savory was not at home when he came in the afternoon, and I did not detain him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When he went away in the morning, did he mention at what hour he would return? A. No, not to my recollection; he said he would go and see if he could find the spoon.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Gofton, a pawnbroker. On the 18th of April the prisoner pawned a pair of silver candlesticks with me for 3l. 10s. 4d.; I believe those produced to be the same; he had before that pawned a table and tea-spoon for 11s.; I know this to be the table-spoon - I asked him if they were his own property - he said they were, and that he wanted some money; he gave me his right name and address; I observed the prisoner's initials on the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think the letters T.F.S. corresponded with A. Wright? A. No. He said they were all his own, and he wanted 3l. 10s. on the candlesticks, just for the present - he redeemed the table-spoons in April, the candlesticks on the 3rd of May: we live in Guildford-street, Oxford-street, about a mile from Bond-street; the candlesticks are worth about 14l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. These were separate pledges? A. Yes. He pawned the candlesticks on the day he took the spoon out; silver is worth 5s. an ounce; I include the manufacture in the value of the candlesticks; 10s. 6d. or 14s. an ounce is at times charged for fashionable articles.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday, the 4th of May, I apprehended the prisoner at No. 23, Cirencester-place; I watched there two days for him; he denied the charge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that his character was unexceptionable, and at the time he was apprehended, the prosecutor was in possession of all his property.</p>

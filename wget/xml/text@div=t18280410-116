On the 21st of March, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I received information, and went to a neighbour's door - I saw the prisoner near my shop-door for some time, she made two or three attempts to take this gingham, which was just inside my door; she at last got it down and went as far as the second house - I went and took her with it under her shawl; she said she had got nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You have a great many customers? A. Yes; she had been drinking; this gingham hung on a line - I have enquired about her, and find she is a widow and supports her own child and her mother; she told the Magistrate's she was so tipsy, she did not know what she did.</p>

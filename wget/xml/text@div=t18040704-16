               <p>Q. What did you observe upon her being taken ill? - A. I did not know what to think; she got out of bed, and sat on the bed; I heard a noise, like the cry of a child; I asked her what was that? she said, it did not concern me, I was in bed; immediately she asked me for a light, I got out of bed, and struck a light; then she asked me for a towel, I gave her a towel.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had given her a towel, what then? - A. I saw it was full of blood; then she went down stairs, and when I thought she had got down stairs, I went slyly down, and walked after her, to see where she went to; I saw her take a stick, and go into the vault.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay there? - A. I believe it was about ten minutes; when I thought she was coming up stairs, I came up slyly, and went into bed.</p>

             at dinner time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You live in this house with this little girl - is she a girl that you would believe one word she said upon her oath? - A. I cannot say I could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Mrs. Lewis.) Q. Whether you have seen any children recently after birth? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever attended any ladies, so as to know what is called by a surgeon a caul? - A. I have seen such things.</p>
               <p>Q. What children have on their heads - a thing of that sort prevents the child from crying? - A. I have heard so; I did not examine the child; I saw a caul afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mrs. Gibbons.) Q. You are the wife of that gentleman who has been examined before - you have had children? - A. I have been the mother of ten children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this infant after your husband took it out of the privy - had it any caul? - A. It had not then; the caul was left in the prisoner's shift; I examined the child, and from the child's head to its feet there were no marks of violence on it; she had not gone above seven months; there were no toe-nails, and the lower parts were not perfect.</p>


               <p>Prisoner's defence. I put it down there to hide my shame; I knew it was born before its time; I thought it was a miscarriage.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Gibbons.) Is the privy dark? - A. It is under the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Must she have a light to go there? - A. It is very dark.</p>

That a Man assaulted him as he was going up Stairs into his Chamber about Eleven a Clock at Night, drew his Sword upon him, and would have Robbed him, as he thought, but he had no Evidence to prove it, only he called his Fathers Man and Maid to prove what time he went to Bed the Night before the Murther was done, which was about Eleven a Clock; but he was alone when he went to Bed, and the Maid had the Key given to her by the Prisoner, for the Man-servant to come to Bed, who lay in the next Room, but was at that time waiting upon his Father at his House, some distance from the Chambers, so that the Man did not see him that Night, nor speak to him: He offered also several other frivolous pretences by way of Extenuation, which did not tend at all to his Advantage.</p>

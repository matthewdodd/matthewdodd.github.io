               <p>LOUISA SMITH. I am an unfortunate girl. I never saw the prisoner before the night in question - on Whit-Monday, the 27th of May, I was in company with two or three more girls, about ten minutes after twelve o'clock, we were two or three doors from <placeName id="t18330817-9-crimeloc46">Old-street</placeName>

I paid one shilling for liquor, and lent a person a shilling-the prisoner was at the house, and a person of the name of Day - They saw me change my note. I was not quite sober, but knew what I was about - They pulled me about in the house. I told them not to rob me, but to keep their hands out of my pocket, and if they wanted a shilling or two I would give it them; they made no reply but tore my coat, and almost stripped me in the house-others assisted them. I knew them before, and had seen them there before. When I left the house the prisoner and Davis both followed me for about a hundred yards, they came up and hustled me-Davis took my silver from my pocket while the prisoner held me behind; Davis got about fourteen shillings, and a two-foot rule, out of breeches-pocket - They knocked me against the railing and stunned me, I was senseless for sometime. I knew their voices well. It was a moonlight night - I saw them-there was a woman passing at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. I was at the public-house the greater part of the afternoon, and between ten and eleven o'clock at night, there were a great many people there. I fell down in the tap-room when they pulled. It was not necessary for me to be conducted home. I saw the prisoner next day, but did not take him - He was not taken until the Tuesday following. I have not seen Davis since.</p>

            . I live at Lisson-green. I knew the prosecutor by sight - I saw the prisoner and Davis with him on the 16th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night; Davis had his hand in the prosecutor's pocket - I heard the money jingle when he pulled it out; they struck him, he reeled against the pailing and fell down. I went home, but said nothing to any person. The prisoner held the prosecutor behind.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 19th. When he saw the prosecutor he said, "He does not know that I robbed him, only from what the woman told him." I had not told him the charge. I cannot find Davis - He has been away from home ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prosecutor did not tell me he had seen the prisoner the morning before; he applied to me to take him on Tuesday morning.</p>

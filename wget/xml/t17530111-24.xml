               <p>My husband was killed in a battle abroad where this gentleman was, I knew him there, he was an officer's servant, I met him about six o'clock in the park, and he called me to him, saying, come and oblige me, my dear, and I'll do you a favour; he said he knew me very well; I told him I lived at the Green Canister in St. Martin's-lane, and that I was not a common person in that way, but was reduced very much, and a little money would be of service to me, but I would not take any body home; he said, I'll give you a crown to morrow if you'll be agreeable, as we know each other, but I would not, so went away; then he called to me again, and said he would leave his watch with me, and be back again in about eight days time, so I obliged him, and after that he wanted his watch again; he came to me after that and said, what, are you going to pawn my watch? I said, you are dishonourable to make use of my body, and then to want it again without the money, this other woman heard him, I gave it her to secure it, so he took hold on me like a little bundle, and jumped me over the rail, and confined me. I sent a letter, to Mrs. Thompson to bring me the watch again, for the gentleman; after this he promised to give me half a guines, but instead of that he put me into a dark hole.</p>

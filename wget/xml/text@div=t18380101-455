I had the care of his sheep—I counted them over on Saturday, the 9th of December, in the afternoon—there were seventy altogether then—I counted them again about eleven o'clock on the Tuesday morning following, and one was deficient—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the service of Mr. Holcombe, whose grounds join my mas<lb></lb>ter's—I saw him in Mr. Holcombe's ground, and called to him—I asked if he had a stray sheep in his flock, as I had lost one—he assured me he had not, and said he had lost one the week before, and I had better look the ditches round—I understood him to say he had found his own sheep near Lee or Brockley—I told master of my loss, and went to a butcher named Smith, in New Cross, next day, with master—I heard master make some inquiry of him, and after that I saw a sheep-skin, with Mr. Burford's mark on it, in Mr. Holcombe's house—master's sheep were marked with a brand on the rump, a "B" in the middle of a circle, and the tar had run—the skin I saw had master's brand-mark on it, I am certain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at New Cross. In November last, I bought fifty-nine sheep of Mr. Holcombe—I was to take them ten a week—the prisoner was in his service—I used to fetch the sheep—it was not the prisoners' business to bring them, but on the 12th of December he came to me between twelve and one o'clock, and told me he had got a sheep ill, and he thought it had better be killed—I asked him if it was one of mine—he said it was—I said I could not fetch it that day, for I was going out, and could not fetch it till to-morrow—he said he thought it had better be killed—I asked what was the matter—he said it had lost the use of its fore legs, as it kept pitching on its head—he brought it to me in a barrow the same day, all dirty, and three of its legs were tied—he said, "It is no use to untie its legs, as it will not stand"—as I was going out, I killed it in the shop—I asked him if the sheep would not eat—he said, "No, it would eat nothing for the last two days;" but on slaughtering it, I found the stomach full of food, and it was in good health—the prisoner came to me again in the evening, and asked me what I thought the value of the sheep was—I asked him why—he made no answer—I said, "I do not think it worth as much as the others by 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and asked why he asked—he made no reply—I asked him if it was my sheep—he said, "No"—I said why was that—he said it was one he had fetched out of Mr. Holcombe's other fields, that he had lost two of mine last week and brought that instead, and what was deficient in that, he would make good—he said two of mine had strayed away—I was not satisfied with this, and went to Mr. Holcombe next morning to make inquiry—I sent my boy Marlow to Mr. Holcombe with the skin—I afterwards saw the skin when it had been cleansed, and it was marked with a B in a ring—the fifty-nine I bought were not branded in that way—I have killed them all except ten.</p>

               <p>Mr. Holcombe's for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in Smithfield-market—he made his accounts up and Mr. Holcombe, if he will trace his accounts back, will find where he missed the cow in the summer—the man killed the sheep as it had the fly, and since I have been in custody, I believe Mr. Holcombe has seen when the sheep was buried—I have not a doubt the sheep I found was put there on purpose to be sent away with the sheep that were sold, and I have not a doubt but the second sheep, belonging to Mr. Burford, was put on the premises for the same purpose as the first one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I have found the carcase of one of my sheep, buried—that would have made up the proper number—it appeared to have been in the ground for the last five weeks, I should think—that was before the prisoner came to that situation—he had been at work for me before, in the hay-harvest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what interest could he have to substitute a sheep sold to the butcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appears that Hall delivered to him, on his leaving me, 110 sheep—Hall is the person who lived with me before the prisoner—it was reported to me that Hall had 111 sheep, and when he lost one, he brought forward this one, which he had kept back before, and delivered to the prisoner 110, and one of that 110 is missing—I do not know that he had more than 110, but Hall admits it—I had only bought 110—the prisoner had 110 sheep left in his possession, by Hall—I do not know that this was not one of the 110—I did not see the 110 delivered to the prisoner, but he admits receiving them from Hall—I left home on the 4th of October, and the prisoner came to me three days before—I came home about five weeks after—the prisoner was in possession of the sheep at the time I was absent—Hall counted the sheep over to the prisoner—he is not here.</p>

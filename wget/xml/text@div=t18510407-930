                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at an Insurance-office. I lived at the prisoner's house, 57, Beaumont-street, Marylebone, with my family, for three months—there was no male person that I was aware of in the house: but a relation of the prisoner's, a widow, did the down-stairs work—on 8th Feb. I got home to dinner about six o'clock—I remained there a very few minutes, as I bad to go out to our chambers—I returned in a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner asked me if I had seen any man going out—I said, no, I had seen no one near the house—she said as she was in the kitchen she thought she beard some one in the passage, and thought it very likely there had been a robbery committed—she said, "It is very pro<lb></lb>bable there is a man up-stairs now"—I desired some persons passing by to fetch the police—the prisoner said, "I will go for a policeman myself," and went outside for four or five minutes—I remained at the door the whole time, and no one passed me either way while she was gone—I saw the other woman coming down-stairs with a light in her band—she said she thought there was a man under the bed up-stairs—she seemed rather flurried; her hair was falling about—at that time the police had arrived—we immediately went up-stairs—the prisoner pointed to a cloak on the floor, and said, "There's your man"—the drawer of my daughter's dressing-case was under the cloak—the place was in disorder, and every<lb></lb>thing lying about—I missed articles of jewellery and wearing-apparel, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-notes—my loss altogether was between 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the least.</p>

I was frequently with the prisoner in Beaumont-street—she has been in bad health until the last three months, and has been staying at another part of the town—on the day in question we both came down-stairs together screaming—I was not out of the house after the robbery was committed—the prisoner fetched a policeman—no one left the house after five o'clock that night—Mrs. Hillman went out before dinner—I do not remember that Mr. Hillman went out after dinner—there was no objection made to the house being searched on the Tuesday following—the prisoner immediately went to her bedroom, and unlocked a desk, and even the secret drawers of it—everything in the place was examined—there was not a particle of stolen property found—the prisoner was up-stairs with Mrs. Hillman till eleven that day—I remember Mrs. Hillman saying she did not know what she had in her dressing-case, except a dia<lb></lb>mond ring—Mr. Govett was in the house a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes—after he left she came down-stairs to me, and remained there—I asked her to prepare Mr. Hillman's lunch—she prepared it and took it up, and she did not leave the room again till after we had our meals—she was not out of my sight all day, except while speaking to Mr. Govett—James Sanderson never lived in the house—he is my cousin—I went to him according to the prisoner's request, but he is not here.</p>

I ran out, and met the prisoner by Barratt's-court with a piece under his great coat. I took it from him, and said I did not think it belonged to him - he said it did. I was going to collar him, but he up with his fist, and threatened to strike me. He ran away, but I pursued and secured him; I took him to the watch-house with the linen. I think I have seen him about the window - it was taken off a pile of goods near the door.</p>

            . I was coming along Duke-street, and saw two persons coming towards me; they crossed over, and I crossed with them. I suspected them, turned back, and saw one of them had crossed again. I saw a person take something from the prosecutor's shop, and run off to the right with it; I gave information at the other shop, which is about twenty yards off. The man was like the prisoner, but I cannot positively swear to him.</p>

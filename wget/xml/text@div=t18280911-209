               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not say to him "Deal fairly with me, tell me the truth, and you shall not be hurt? A. No, I asked him how long he had been robbing me; I cannot recollect that I told him he should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he been in the habit of selling you phials at times? A. Yes, he had occasionally; he was not a kind of salesmen - he had not sold me more than two gross; I believe he generally brought them from a Mr. Crichton, where he formerly lived servant - I never went to Mr. Crichton; I was not threatened with a prosecution for receiving goods - it is customary for persons who are ill to give phials to their servants; I do not know that Mr. Crichton was ill - I had noticed in the morning that some of the phials had white labels on them; I used to have a great many come in - I gave the prisoner 1s. a dozen for phials; he brought some phials to me which I did not like, and told him to go to Isaacs, as he would buy anything - Isaacs is a bottle merchant.</p>

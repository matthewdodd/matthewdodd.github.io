On Saturday night, the 14th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop, or it might be later; I knew him before - he said he came for change for a cheque for 6l. 6s. for his master or mistress, I do not know which - he said that without my asking him who it was for; he produced a cheque to me, which I afterwards gave to the officer - this is it (looking at one); I told him the name was not spelt as I had seen it spelt before - he said, "The reason you think that is, because you never make the bill out in the right way;" I gave him six sovereigns and six shillings - I had repeatedly given him change for cheques for Mr. or Mrs. Fonblongue; he was in their service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then you knew him to live with Mr. fonblongue? A. Yes - I am sure that when I remarked about the spelling he did not say he knew nothing about it, as he got it from the cook; he said it came from his master or mistress, but in the hurry of business I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come to you afterwards with his father, when he heard there was something said about the cheque? A. He came with a Police-constable - he came with his father on the Friday night; Mr. Fonblongue and all were present - he was not in custody; I did not say if his father made up the money nothing would be said about it - I said nothing of the kind, and never heard it said; I understood the father offered to do it - they went away about their business; I am sure he did not tell me that he got it from Elizabeth Barrett - the only remark he made to me was, that I did not make the bills out properly; we live three quarters of a mile from Mr. Fonblongue, but he dealt at our shop.</p>
               <p>ABANY FONBLONGUE. The prisoner was in my service for three months, and quitted on the 16th of May; I think he had warning about a fortnight before, and was to quit on the 16th, when his three months were up, as I was dissatisfied with him - (looking at a cheque) this is not my hand-writing; I did not send him to get change for it - I have frequently sent him with small cheques, as I give Mrs. Fonblongue a cheque every week for current expences -I may have sent him seven or eight times with cheques, and on those occasions he brought the money to me, or generally to my wife; on Saturday, the 14th of May, about three o'clock, I sent him with a cheque for four guineas -I have my cheque-book here with the margin on it; I have entered here, "14th May, Mrs. Fonblongue, 4l. 4s., No. 85;" I have occasionally left my cheque-book out, and I recollect that it was left out on the Saturday, for I took it off the dining-room mantel-piece to write this cheque - I find there is a leaf torn out very close to the binding; I discovered that on the morning of the 21st, the day after this forgery was made known to me - the cheque uttered is No. 86 - I have seen the prisoner's hand-writing, but never saw him write.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your lady here? A. No - my Christian name is Abany William, but I always sign my name Abany; I have dropped the William some time - I sign deeds as Abany only; I do not remember signing the name of William for many years - I have at some period of my life; the Police-officer came to me on the morning of the 23rd, stating that the prisoner had surrendered.</p>

               <p>RICHARD WILLIAMS. I am an inspector of the Police. On the 21st of May I was in Lower-street, Lisson-grove, and saw the prisoner - he said that he had come to point out a fellow-servant, who gave him a forged cheque; her name was 
               <persName id="t18310630-15-person243">

            , who had been his fellow-servant in Mr. Fonblongue's employ - I took him with me, and apprehended Barrett; before I went to her lodgings I took the prisoner to Mr. Cowderoy's, and there saw the cheque; on seeing it the prisoner said the name was spelt wrong, it was not spelt as his master spelt his name - he said he got the cheque from

            , between nine and ten o'clock on the previous Saturday; that she desired him to go and get it changed for his master - I asked him how his master did spell his name; he spelt it over so quick I could not understand it - I gave him a piece of paper, and said, "Write it down as he spells it," which he did - this is it; it being so similar to the writing on the cheque I took him into custody - in my opinion, the hand-writing is very similar to that on the cheque; I afterwards apprehended the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He wrote it for you without the least hesitation? A. Yes; he came to me of his own accord, to assist me in apprehending the woman; it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - he met me in the street; he had been to the station-house with his mother and father.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BARRETT. I was in Mr. Fonblongne's service at the same time as the prisoner, and left the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300028"></xptr>day as he did - I was taken up by the Policeman, and discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the prisoner that cheque on the Saturday evening, to get change for your mistress? A.As I hope to see the Almighty God on his throne, a paper, black, white, or red, I never gave him; on my oath I did not give this paper to him, nor did I ever know Mr. Fonblongue write papers for money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you never saw the cheque-book laying about? A.Never, so help me God; I used to go into the parlour at times - I cannot write, not at all.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHANNER. On the Friday night before the Monday that the prisoner left Mr. Fonblongue, he told me Mr. Fonblongue's book and cheques were laying about loose on the table - he told me this at the gate; he made no proposal to me about the cheque.</p>
               <p>Q.What led to this being told you? A. I am a pot-boy, I was bringing the beer, and he began the conversation with me; that was all he said - I was not examined before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Nor before the Grand Jury? A. No - he came out for the beer, and said this, but nothing more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Are you sure no proposal was made by you or the prisoner about the cheques? A. No.(Cheque read, see indictment.)</p>

               <p>Q.Now, on your oath, can you not both read and write? A. On my oath I can do nothing but scribble; I can just read my Prayer-book - I cannot write my name.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that, do you? A. No, not as it ought to be - I never gave a receipt, nor ever wrote in Miss Huggett's presence.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot even scribble? A. No - as God is on his throne, I cannot write; I never forged a bill or note, and never had any thing to do with it - I cannot write, to call it writing; I suppose I make an attempt to write, but am not a writer - I never in my life wrote a letter to a friend, not with my own hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by swearing you could scribble a little, when I asked if you could write? A. I had no meaning for it - I cannot write, and never took part in the bill; any child may scribble - I cannot write, (a pen and paper were here handed to the witness, upon which she began to make a mark); I cannot write indeed - I cannot do any thing in the writing way; I did not swear I could scribble - you cross-examined me; any body can scribble - I write nothing that any body can make any hand of; I never wrote a word in my life - I do not know any thing about writing, and that is all I can say.</p>

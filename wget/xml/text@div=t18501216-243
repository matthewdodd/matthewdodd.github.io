On Monday, 9th Dec, I went to 2, Norwich-court, Testar-lane, and took the prisoner into custody—it was his mother's lodging—I told him it was for forging several wine-orders—he said, "I know nothing about any wine orders, though I have lived at both the places"—he did not say what places—I had not men<lb></lb>tioned any places to him—I said, "You have been accused of this before?"—he said, "I have, but I know nothing about any wine orders"—I then searched a box, and found these two letters—I said, "Whose hand-writing are these in?"—his mother answered, "They are in my hand-writing"—I asked her to sign them, as I was going to take them away—she said, I am so agitated that I cannot do it.</p>

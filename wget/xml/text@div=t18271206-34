On the 9th of November I left the stable as the watchman was going past eight o'clock in the evening - all was safe then; I returned about twenty minutes after eight, and found the door bolted inside; I had not left it bolted inside, but had locked it, and taken the key with me, leaving every part of the building safe. I could not get in - I got assistance, forced the door open, and got in - I did not examine the lock afterwards; I am certain I had locked it; we searched the stable, and found nothing- we went into the loft, and found nobody there - but in a sort of cock-loft, over the room in which I live, we found both the prisoners; they were perfect strangers to me, and had no business there - I never saw them before, to my knowledge - we secured them. I looked at my box, which had contained three shirts, six pairs of stockings, three neck-handkerchiefs, three towels, three shifts, two waistcoats, and a gown - they had all been moved out of the box - I found them in a basket in the same room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does any body else sleep there besides yourself? A. Only my wife. - The things were in a box in the loft adjoining the room where I sleep. The prisoners were in a cock-loft over my room; my wife is not here - I might not have seen the things for a day or two before: I had been to the box on the Wednesday - this was Friday. I had seen the box every day.</p>
               <p>Q. For what you know, the things might have been moved into the basket before? A. I saw the basket the same evening, before I went out - there was some wet linen in it, but none of these things - I will swear there was no dry linen in it; I had seen it ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I went out - my wife went out with me: there are windows to the place - there is a stable and coach-house door - I had fastened them both about eight o'clock, and fastened all the windows: I am certain none of them were open. I missed the linen directly I found the prisoners there, but did not examine particularly what articles they were till we took the prisoners to the watch-house - nothing was found on them.</p>

Yes; the prisoner came to our house on the 26th of November, about two o'clock; he brought a plate, and left a note in the plate; he said he was going down the market, he would call as he came back again; a young man took the note to Mrs. Woodhouse to ask her if it was her hand-writing; she said it was not. He came again in about ten minutes afterwards, and I asked him what he wanted; he said, the things that were in the note; when the young man came back from Mrs. Woodhouse, we stopped him, and asked him where he came from; he said, Token-house-yard, from Mrs. Woodhouse; the young man told him that note did not come from Mrs. Woodhouse, he had just been, and she denied the writing it; we then sent for an officer; it is not the first time.</p>

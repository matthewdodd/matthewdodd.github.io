I am a gardener for Mr. James Smith, of Denmark Hill—on Friday, 9th August, a little after 4 a.m. I was going to my work—I have the key of the mews at the back, which runs into the main road—when I went into the mews I saw two men behind the gate—I asked them what business they had there—they said they had been out for a lark in the night—I told them to come out—they went down Denmark Hill towords Cold Harbour Lane—a policeman followed them—there is no outlet at the back of Mr. Astle's garden—any one getting there from the mews would have to cross a field and get over several field gates—the shorter man was lame—the other had tight canvas shoes on.</p>

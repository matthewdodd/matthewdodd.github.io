                  </hi>. I live at 12, Westbourne Park-villas—on Saturday, 27th November, 1858, about 5 o'clock, I had the clock which has been produced—it was on the mantel-piece in the drawing-room—on returning to the room after dinner, about 8 o'clock, I missed it—it cost</p>

Between 6 and 7 on the night of 21st October, I went to the prisoner's house, 6, Judd-street—I found him there—I asked if he was the landlord of that house—he said he was; I then asked him what part of the house he occupied—he said, the shop and parlour and two rooms up stairs—I then said, "I am an Inspector of police; I have called on you in reference to some plate which you sold to Mr. Snell some months ago"—at the police-station I said to him, "That clock we have traced into the possession of Mr. Robinson of Judd street, and he states that he had purchased it of you"—he looked stedfastly at the clock and made no reply—I found at the house another clock, several books, some electro-plated spoons and forks, a workbox, and some shells, and several duplicates relating principally to jewellery and wearing apparel.</p>

On 27th November my establishment con<lb></lb>sisted of two female servants—they continued to live with me after the loss of this clock, till within this last month—the windows of the drawing-room had been opened—the kitchen was underneath, but the blind was down—there is a very short space between the balcony and the drawing-room win<lb></lb>dow—the bolt between the sashes had been pressed back, and the window raised—there was nothing but a very light table in front of it, which they pushed away, and then very deliberately carried away the clock, because they moved some china vases to get at it.</p>

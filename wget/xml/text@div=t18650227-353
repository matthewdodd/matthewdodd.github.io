I live at 3, Leyden-terrace, Peckham—on 3d February I went to bed about 10 o'clock, leaving the house safe, and the front parlour-window also—I was aroused between 3 or 4 o'clock by the catch being put back, but I did not think it was that—I struck a light; I vent down-stairs between 7 and 8, and found the front parlour had been entered—I missed two silver table-spoons, a clock, and a silver thimble—the window was wide open—there was some tallow on the cill, and a match partly burnt upon the carpet—I gave information, and the clock was afterwards brought to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), to the best of my belief—here are a few scratches at the place where it is wound up, and I have the key in my pocket, which fits it.</p>

I examined the prosecutor's premises on 4th February, and found footmarks in the garden, also on a sofa in the room—the window-frame was marked as if by some sharp instru<lb></lb>ment being put up between the sashes—this knife would do it—I found it in Whiffin's pocket, although it does not close—on Sunday evening, the 5th, I went to Davis's house—Sergeant Hann asked him if he had a time-piece in the house—he denied having one—he asked if he had any duplicates in, his possession—he denied having any—Hann took him in custody, and I searched the place, and in the back room, on the mantel-piece, I found this time-piece—I then searched a cupboard, and found twenty-one duplicates, an iron chisel, and this short stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

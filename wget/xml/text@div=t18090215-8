               <p>Q. Is that in Middlesex - A. Yes; I saw the gelding about three or four o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th; I missed it about five the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it - A. Fifteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not lent it to any body - A. No, it was standing in the field. On the Wednesday following I saw the horse again at Hanwell, in the custody of Trott, an officer of Hatton garden office; he brought it me to look at; I am sure it is my own horse; it is a very remarkable horse, he had a good many white hairs in the tail; he had a cut tail.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on the 4th of this month - A. I did, in Cow cross, in the parish of St. Sepulchre; about half after six o'clock at night, as near as I could judge; he had a horse with him; what occasioned my curiosity of stopping was, his being in conversation with a person we call a knackner, that buys horses to kill; he was trying to sell it; I went to him and asked him the price of the horse; he told me he did not know what he could take for him at that present moment, if I would let him have two guineas, and when he called again to London I was to let him have the remainder what I thought it was worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he fixed no price did he - A. No, he did not; I asked him if the horse could draw; he said yes, very well, it belonged to a person of the name of

               <p>Q. Had you made any promise to him that it would be better for him to tell - A. No; nor threatened him. I went with him into another room, he then told me that he took the horse from a field near Hanwell, who it belonged to he could not tell: I asked him then if any body was concerned with him; he said there was not. I took him before the magistrate: he was committed. On the Wednesday I took the horse to Hanwell, and there I saw the prosecutor, he owned the horse, and there was a great number of people that knew the horse about the place; they all told me it was Mr. Pilkington's horse.</p>

I asked him if he had not some other business; if he had not some property about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179209120031"></xptr>him that did not belong to him; he said no, he was ready to be searched; I did search him, and under the waistband of his breeches was a handkerchief with sugar; I told him to take it out; he did so; I asked him where he got it; he begged to be forgiven; he had never done any thing of this kind before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What coat had I on? - It appeared to be a loose surtout coat, a round hat, and a red handkerchief, the same as those in which he was taken, as I think.</p>

               <p>I was with the last witness when he was robbed; returning home, three men came up, one behind, and two in front; the one behind confined my brother's hands, while the two before robbed him; the prisoner was one of them, the two in front run away; he that was behind remained some time, and from the good light of an adjacent shop, we could know him again; I am sure the man that stood behind was the prisoner; he did not take him then, because I begged him not, for fear of ill-usage, I am perfectly sure the prisoner was one of the men; my brother never got any of his property again.</p>

               <p>I have belonged to Bow-street sixteen or seventeen years. On Monday the 23d I received information from the prosecutor of his being robbed in Newtoner's-lane, I told him to come at eleven, and we went to the Red Hart, and the prosecutor picked out the prisoner, and said he was one that came behind him.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that a house of rendezvous for these sort of men? - I cannot say, there are several such houses in that neighbourhood; the prosecutor said he had no doubt of the man, but he would fetch his sister, who had a better sight of him than he had; the sister came, and I took her in without speaking to her, and she picked the prisoner out again a second time. I found no property upon him.</p>

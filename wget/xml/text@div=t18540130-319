I am a baker, at Blackheath-hill The prisoner was in my employment as a journeyman for about eight weeks—he had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and his board and lodging—he left me on 22nd Dec. when I gave him into custody—I missed a watch of my son's about the second week after the prisoner came into my service—my son is about twenty years old—he was taking care of the business at Peckham, the robbery was not at my place of business, but at Peckham; he manages a business of mine there—I also missed two shirt pins, one was a Union pin, and the other a straight pin—my son's watch was kept in the parlour—he had lent it to the men down stairs I believe the previous night to his losing it, but they had returned it—it was not kept at my house, or the shirt pins either—they were all lost from Peckham—I did. not miss them, my son did—he is not here, I did not know he was required; he was not before the Magistrate, my son told me that he missed money from time to time—I said nothing to the prisoner about the things till I gave him into custody, on 22nd Dec—I then told him that I had missed my son's watch and pins, and money from the till at various times—he denied all knowledge of either—I gave him in charge—he again denied it at the station, but after he was locked up he wished to see me—I went into the cell and he then said he had taken the money, but knew nothing of the watch or pins—I had made him no promise, I know nothing of anything being missing except what my son told me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>), I took the prisoner on 22nd Dec—he was given into my custody by the prosecutor, charged with stealing a silver watch, three gold pins, and several sums of silver from the till—he said, "I know nothing about it"—this was in the shop—he asked per<lb></lb>mission to go into the bakehouse to change his coat—I accompanied him; I did not see him put anything away, but it was rather dark, being under<lb></lb>ground—Mr. Urry's son followed, and said that one of the men had pointed out the purse—I cannot say whether the prisoner heard that—Mr. Urry brought the purse and these two keys—the purse contained four sovereigns—I asked the prisoner if the purse belonged to him; he said "Yes"—I asked him if he knew anything of the keys—he said, "I took one of them off a ring that master lent me to wind up a watch"—he did not say why—I searched him, and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, there being two fourpenny pieces, and sevenpence in copper; also three other keys</p>

               <p>—I put him into the cell—I did not make him any promise, or speak to him again, till he said, "Can I see master?"—I said, "What do you want to see him for? you could have spoken to him when he was with you"—he said, "I shall tell him all about it" (I had not said it would be better for him)—Mr. Urry came to the cell, and the prisoner said, "I acknowledge taking the money out of the till, sir; but I know nothing about the watch and the pins"—I accompanied the prosecutor to his house, and tried two of the keys which Mr. Urry brought with the purse; one opens the door leading into the shop, and the other unlocks the till—young Mr. Urry was not before the Magistrate, because Mr. Urry, I believe, being the principal, they could not both leave the place—the two men in the bakehouse are not here; they did not touch the purse, they merely pointed it out.</p>

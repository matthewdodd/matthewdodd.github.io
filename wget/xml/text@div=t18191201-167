               <p>Q. Did you keep any other servant - A. A very short part of the time - the prisoner was servant of all work. I left them in care of my house in September when I myself was absent. I afterwards disposed of my house and furniture. Some time before November I lost many articles of linen, such as pillow-cases, neck-handkerchiefs, and shirts. About the beginning of November I began to suspect that the prisoner was dishonest, but took no notice, having matters of importance to call my attention, as I was about selling my house at that time. About the 14th or 16th of November, I missed two salt, one mustard, and a table-spoon. I communicated it to Mr. Want.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate it to the prisoner - A. I did, and in reply she told me. in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Want, and Miss Butler, that when she engaged with me, she did not engage to pay for losses. I took no farther notice then, but sold my house, and gave possession to Mr. Arnot, who was of the same business a myself. The prisoner was not in the house then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were her boxes in the house - A. I believe they were, but I never saw them. The morning after I had given possession of the house to Arnot, I called and told him that I had sold the furniture to Mr. Want. He then handed me over these spoons, which I had missed some days before; he said he had taken them from a small box, which he conceived to be the prisoner's, and to the best of my recollection I had mentioned to him that I had lost them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010078"></xptr>Q. Did you lose two boxes - A. I lost various articles, but do not know the extent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at last take the prisoner before the Magistrate - A. I did. She was to have called upon me next morning to take away her boxes. She was to have gone to Want's house, in Russell-place, for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see her afterwards - A. At Marlborough-street. I lost printed furniture, two books, and other articles. I made a complaint there.</p>
               <p>Q. On that occasion I believe the Magistrate dismissed the complaint - A. Yes. I went again before the Magistrate, and she was committed,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been in business in Charlotte-street - A. To the best of my recollection about three years - the prisoner had lived sixteen months with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that though she was a servant, she was a girl very respectably connected - A. I did not.

             lived part of the time with me - she is here.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not brought her here - A. I have not; she lived two months with me, to the best of my recollection. I had been unfortunate in business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the furniture given over to Want for the benefit of your creditors - A. When speaking of being unfortunate, I do not admit of being unfortunate then. I mean fourteen months before, when I called my creditors together.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave up business was it in consequence of being unfortunate - A. It was in consequence of believing that I could do better out of business.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give up your property to your creditors - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold it to Want - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>A. I believe you had been arrested on the morning of the 15th of November -

            Possibly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you arrested in bed that morning, or has it happened so often that that you do not remember it - A. It happened more than once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not leave the house then for two days with the prisoner and another person in it - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect quitting your house for one day - A. I never left my house for six hours.</p>
               <p>Q. There cannot be any doubt in your mind; which am I to take as an answer - A. I was arrested I know, but do not remember the date.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Was you not taken out of your bed - A. I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not indebted to the prisoner 15 l. or 16 l. at that time for wages - A. I was not, on my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you owe her - A. To the best of my recollection 10 l. or 11 l.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did not you and Want offer a joint promissory note, at two months, for the 15 l. claimed as her wages, if she would not proceed in an action - A. I have no recollection of it. It was not offered by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Want told you it was offered to her - A. In our joint names? No. No one offered it to her by my advice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it offered by Want - A. As he tells me. This was before I charged her with felony.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect coming home after you was arrested, and the prisoner came and asked you for her wages, and you committed an assault upon her - A. I do not recollect it. On my oath I did not assault her; she took me to Bow-street, and charged me with assaulting her. I was ordered to find security to appear at the last Clerkenwell Sessions. Want was my bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Last Session you was to find bail, and you had her in custody so that she should not appear against you - A. It was not for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not several days after she made the charge against you, that you charged her with the felony - A. It was not. I believe she charged me with the assault on the 15th or 16th of November.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you charge her with the felony - A. To the best of my recollection about the 20th of November.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have sworn you did not assault her, on the oath I ask you, when Clark, the officer, took you into custody, did you not tell him you was sorry you had beat her, for she was a very excellent servant - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not charge her at Marlborough-street with the robbery of a shoehorn - A. Not on the first charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on your oath, was not that the property of another person - A. On my oath I believe it to be mine. I did not charge her with stealing an old pair of trowsers. There was a pair produced - it was not proved that they belonged to Mr. Slim.</p>
               <p>Q. She was examined first on a Thursday - A. I believe she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not detained on a representation that you was in the country - A. I cannot tell what passed in my absence. I attended the first examination, which I believe was on Saturday. On my return to Dr. Want's, where I resided, he told me he had taken her up, I believe on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know from Dr. Want that the examination was put off from Thursday to Saturday, on the ground of your being in the country, which was false - A. I believe it was. I gave evidence on Saturday, and she was dismissed. She was taken up on this present charge on the Monday following, to the best of my recollection. Her box had been removed from my house to Want's.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was discharged she left her box where it was - A. At the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, do not you know that Want opened her box with a key which he provided himself - A. On my oath he did not. The constable had keys, with which I believe he opened it at the watch-house. I do not believe it was opened by his key or mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you suspected her long before, why not charge her with the robbery when she charged you with the assault - A. I had a multiplicity of things to attend to. I do not know how it was that I did not; though I had reason to suspect her I had not proof then, and did not chuse to go further in the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was taken up on the second charge, the Magistrate said she should be admitted to bail, and you resisted it - A. The magistrate put it to me, and I said she must not.</p>
               <p>Q. Here are two boxes in the indictment, which belong to a dressing-case, and are like tea-caddies - A. They may bear some resemblance. I do not know that she drank her tea with the cup and saucer - the spoon is mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010079"></xptr>Q. What are the stockings - A. There are three lamb's wool and four cotton, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. She was acquitted by the Magistrate, and might have had her box from the watch-house, but did not - A. No. she was not present when it was opened - the property was all found in her box at the watch-house. The constable was present when it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Before her box was taken to the watch-house it laid two or three days at Want's house - A. I am told so. It was at his house three or four days while I lodged there - she was not there then. I did not charge her with stealing the spoons at the first examination. I did not know they were lost.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why not inform the Magistrate about the spoons - A. I did not then wish to prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why charge her with stealing any thing - A. I missed several things.</p>

             with me - we saw the prisoner there. I went up stairs, and Miss Butler went into the kitchen. I went down soon after, and saw the prisoner there - I was surprised at seeing her there, knowing the circumstances under which she was discharged; this was on the 20th - she was discharged on the 16th. I mentioned my suspicions to Miss Butler that she was after no good; she appeared to be rummaging about the kitchen, and we determined to speak to Arnot to send her out of the house. He was up stairs; I informed him of my suspicions, and told him Wilmot had lost various articles, and Mr. Arnot was aware of the spoons that had been lost. He said,</p>
               <p>"If you think it right to send her away do it." I went down, and expostulated with her on the impropriety of her being there when she had been discharged. She said she would not go without her boxes, and wanted to send for a constable to remove them. I said,</p>
               <p>"No, they shall not go without Mr. Wilmot's permission." I was induced to say that in consequence of having seen in her hand, a pie-dish wrapt up ready for removal, and a table-cloth, which I supposed was going away - it was by her box. I took the table-cloth away from the conviction that she was going to remove it, and saw it was marked W. After some altercation the boxes were taken up, and examined in the presence of Miss Butler, Arnot, myself, and the prisoner; there were two boxes, and three or four little bundles; a variety of articles were taken out, and put into a bundle, which appeared to be Wilmot's property, as they were marked 
               <persName id="t18191201-167-person1690">W. </persName>
            - they were put by until Wilmot made his appearance. On the following day the boxes were removed to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You took out what you conceived to be Wilmot's - A. Yes, and other things, which we thought were her's, but what she said were her's we left. The boxes were received by him, with the furniture, but not by my desire. A few days after - I do not know the time exactly, the prisoner applied to me in the morning for her boxes. In the mean time Wilmot had stated, that as far as he had seen the contents of the bundle, they were his, from the particular circumstances were stated with respect to the stockings and other articles, and he said he would have her taken to Marlborough-street. The boxes and bundle were brought into the parlour in her presence; she opened the bundle. The table-cloth which was taken from her had been put into the bundle in moving.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. That was put in by you - A. I cannot say who put it in - it was mentioned to her that there was no intention to charge her with it. She took out the tablecloth, a piece of printed furniture, and a pair of pantaloons, which she said were her master's. She afterwards went out for a coach, to remove them from my house. Wilmot had desired me to get a constable. We sent for one, followed the coach, and took her to Marlborough-street. The constable took the box, bundles, and all to the watch-house. I asked what we were to do, as the prosecutor was not there? The watch-house-keeper said we had better take her to the Magistrate for his opinion. We did so, and the Magistrate remanded her till the prosecutor could appear. This was Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Wilmot then - A. He was gone into the City, I believe, on business.</p>
               <p>Q. By what authority was she taken up at all - A. By Wilmot's authority.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Wilmot and you appeared on Saturday - A. Yes; and on hearing us the Magistrate discharged her.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. She was apprehended and brought before the same Magistrate on Monday - A. Yes, on that occasion she was committed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Her boxes and all were before the Magistrate on the Saturday - A. Yes. A new charge was made on Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you a surgeon and apothecary - A. Yes. I have been long acquainted with Wilmot.</p>

            Are you in the habit of bailing each other - A. He never bailed me. I have bailed him, perhaps three times, for civil actions. We did not accommodate each other with bills.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath, has not Mr. Jeffries, the chief clerk of the Common Pleas, a bill of yours now in his possession - A. I will explain that. Dyer is the drawer, and I am the endorser. It is six months over due.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any more bills out, jointly issued by you two - A. I think I may venture to swear not, but you take me by surprise.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought Wilmot's furniture - A. Yes; I gave him about 98 l. for it, and paid him in money about the time Arnot took possession - it is now in my house in Clarendon-square. I had no bill of sale. I was at Bow-street when the prisoner charged the prosecutor with an assault - it was about the 14th of November. I do not recollect the date that we made the charge against her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that was he arrested at the suit of the girl - A. In the evening Wilmot requested me to see the girl. I saw her, and gave her 10 s. She was surrounded by a party, who persuaded her to say the 10 s. was given her as part of her wages, and not in discharge of the assault. Wilmot was not present. I advised him to put in bail, and put in no answer. The robbery was not committed for three or four days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go to the prosecutor's after the charge was made at Bow-street - A. Wilmot went to the door and bolted her out.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010080"></xptr>Q. Her boxes were locked in and she out - A. Yes. I think Arnot took possession three or four days after that.</p>
               <p>Q. She had no access to her boxes - Miss Butler and Mrs. Want were there - A. No; she was confined to her bed. I believe the greater part of the things were taken out. She said the boxes of the dressing-case were hers.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, were they produced before Miss Butler - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not state to the Justice that the property was found in her possession - A. I did not then know they were Wilmot's. She stated so confidently they belonged to her tea-caddy - they were not mentioned to the Magistrate till the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Want swear to a shoehorn - A. I did not hear him swear positively to that.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was discharged on Saturday, were you not told that you and Want should be indicted for a conspiracy in bringing her there - A. Certainly we were told so by the attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not the prisoner (when you offered her to take her boxes away) say she would not take them till she could have all her property - A. I believe solemnly that she was not offered.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it did not pass - A. I cannot recollect. I did not see her boxes from the time they came to my house till she called.</p>

               <p>Q. Who gave her 2 s. to get a coach - A. I did. I wished to ascertain where her residence was, but could not. I had not asked her, but I suspected she would not tell me. I did not put a man into the coach with her - I sent Jones to follow it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ran after the coach with a pair of pantaloons in his hand - A. Not me. I believe the constable carried them. I desired him to take the pantaloons and the printed furniture which she had left behind.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been to the watch-house between the Saturday and Monday - A. No. I had no key that would open her box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to Mr. Jeffries about the bill, and tell him the girl was discharged, though fifty pair of stockings were found in her possession - A. I do not recollect the precise number. I will not swear I did not, but I think not. There was a considerable quantity of stockings marked</p>
               <p>"W." I am sure there were thirty stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. If any one had said there were only five single stockings of one sort and four of the other, it is an untruth - A. I should think he had stated an untruth.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, when the girl had arrested Mr. Wilmot, did you not propose to give her your joint acceptance for 15 l., to put an end to it - A. No, not at the time of the assault. When the warrant was issued, she said she only wished her wages. I pointed out to her the impropriety of taking her master to Bow-street, and said, if that was all she wanted I would see her wages paid. She was surrounded by persons, who said they would have good security for the wages. I said I would undertake to see furniture put into her possession. On the night of the final examination she attended at my house about her wages; and it was distinctly understood that she should have them in a few days. I said I would give her a bill of exchange for the wages. 13 l. was at first named. She afterwards claimed 15 l. - it was to be my own bill. I recollected nothing about a joint bill. Wilmot did not know of it. Some of the persons round said, they knew nothing of me; and I said she should have furniture. I do not believe he assaulted her.</p>

            . I succeeded the prosecutor in the house in Charlotte-street. I bought it of him, and was in possession of it after he left. The prisoner was not in the house then - her boxes were. I found the spoons in a small straw work cabinet belonging to the prisoner. I gave them to Mr. Wilmot. I found them on the Tuesday morning when I took possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present afterwards when the prisoner's boxes were searched - A. Yes; the prisoner, Miss Butler, and Want were present. Those things, which Want and Butler considered doubtful, were put aside. The boxes remained in my possession till Monday, when the men took them with Want's things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Whatever was found, was found before the examination at Malborough-street - A. Yes, they had the opportunity of charging her with the spoons then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The cabinet was not locked - A. No, it stood in the kitchen window. Want ordered me not to let her have the boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Want inquiring if they could charge her with stealing cheese - A. Want asked my shop-man if the cheese could be sworn to.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Monday, the 29th of November, I examined the prisoner's boxes at St. Pancras watch-house, Cleveland-mews. Wilmot and Want were present, and part of the time Jones, the watch-house-keeper. I produce the things I found; they were produced before the Magistrate. I have also a basket, which was given me to-day by Want.</p>

             re-examined. The printed furniture is mine; and the two boxes belong to the dressing-case, which they fit. The stockings I know by being marked</p>
               <p>"W." Here is a pair of silk stockings, which I believe to be mine; I suppose the prisoner has worn them, or given them to some one to wear for her. Some of them are not marked. The five I swear to, to the best of my belief. Here is a corkscrew, which appears to be mine, and a shoehorn, which, to the best of my belief, I swear to be mine; and some waste paper, which I believe to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. She was discharged by the Magistrate for the cotton - A. No, nor the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. You certainly would not wear such old stockings as those - A. Yes, under boots. I never gave her any. I did not put them into her box. She was to have 14 l. a year.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger. The shoehorn is mine. I will take my oath of it, by this mark. I left it at the prosecutor's when I left his place. The prisoner was his servant. I remember his giving her old stockings, aprons, and other things, at different times. She has requested me to ask for her wages; and since I have left she has come crying to me, saying she had no bread to eat for two days together.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Where do you live - A. At No. 11, Tottenham-street. I lived thirteen months with the prosecutor - he paid me my wages. I have not seen the horn since I left till to-day. There was no other in the house - Wilmot always used mine.</p>

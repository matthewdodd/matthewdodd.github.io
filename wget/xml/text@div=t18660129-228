                  </hi>. I live at 22, John-street, Cannon-street, St. George's-in<lb></lb>the-East—on the morning of 7th January, I was in Holborn about 1 o'clock—the tallest prisoner seized me by the throat, and the other by the wrist—one of them kicked me on the knee—Kellard took 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my pocket, which I had safe about a quarter of an hour before—I knew what I was doing.</p>

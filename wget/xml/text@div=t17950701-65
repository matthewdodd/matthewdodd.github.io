On the 13th of June, having received information that gave me reason to suppose that the prisoner at the bar robbed us of soap frequently; I ordered Mr. Rutter, our clerk, to mark the soap in such a manner as he would be able to swear to it, and to watch the prisoner at the bar. I should also mention that I ordered him to mark both ends of the soap. They were marked (I saw them afterwards) at both ends with a key, which one of the witnesses has in his possession. On Tuesday morning, the 16th of June, I see him go down into the cellar; I told Mr. Rutter, our clerk, of it; and he went down after him. When the prisoner came up again out of the cellar, I employed him unpacking a bag of sugar; when Mr. Rutter came up, in consequence of something that Mr. Rutter had said to me, I told him that I was told that two cakes were missing, that I suspected he had them; I felt in his pocket and found he had half a cake, before I searched he denied having any about him; he produced the one half cake, and said it was the only soap he had ever taken from me; I told him it was marked with a key pointing to the end, and I was convinced he had the other half about him; he absolutely declared he had no more. I stroked the other pocket down, and I thought I felt something, and I told him it was there; he said it was a bone; he put his hand in, and he pulled the other half out; I told him he had another cake about him, I told him that the constable was sent for, and he must find it when he came. He pulled off his apron and pulled out half a cake from each side of his breeches, which was marked in the same manner that the other cake was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You told the prisoner that if he did not confess to you he must when the constable came? - I told him if he did not produce the soap then he must be searched when the constable came; I told him that if he would confess, so that I might prevent such things in future, he might expect mercy. This was before the constable came. He would not confess, he still continued to deny it.</p>

               <p>Q. You live servant with the prosecutors, Messrs. Noton and Eade? - Yes, I do. I marked some soap, on the 13th of June, I marked twenty two bars in one chest, I put the letter N with a piece of stick at the top, and I marked it with a key at the end of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the soap that was afterwards taken from the prisoner? - I was present at the time. I am sure it was the same soap.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property is that soap? - Noton and Eade's.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure from looking at the top that it had these marks you yourself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010152"></xptr>had put on it? - Yes, the same soap; I went down and counted, and missed that quantity that he had on him, two bars; they weigh very near five pounds; it was mottled soap. I missed five bars the day before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is common mottled soap? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not have known it without marking it? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. But with marking you can swear to it? - Yes, I can.</p>

               <p>Q. You were sent for by Noton and Eade this day, did you take the prisoner into custody? - Yes. I see him take a cake of soap out of his breeches; I afterwards searched him and found nothing on him. There were two other pieces laid before him; it was all sealed and put into my custody.(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Rutter. This is the same soap, I have no doubt in the least.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Rutter has sworn as false as God is in Heaven; at the time the soap was produced he was not in the parlour. The soap was given me because I had a family, a wife and four children, and it was given me because the distress that I was in to help in washing.</p>

            . I am ostler at the Sun; in Gray's-inn-lane. I took the bay gelding in of I believe, the prisoner at the bar, a fortnight yesterday, the same which the prosecutor and has evidence came and owned. I know it was the prisoner at the bar that came and owned him the next morning; he wanted to sell him to my master, and they talked about it: I believe they had made a bargain, but am not certain. I heard the prisoner say, he had rode him 90 miles that day. I asked him where he came from, he said from Market-Harborough.</p>

            . I keep the Sun in Gray's-inn-lane. The horse was in my stable. I was not at home when he was brought in. The next morning I saw him. The prisoner came and ordered him to be fed: he said the horse was to be sold, and that he would take him to Smithfield market. On the Friday he came about noon, and said he had changed his mind; he would not take him to market, he would go first, and see how the market went, and if it would not do, he would send him into the country. On the Saturday morning we agreed for the horse. I was to have given 7 guineas and a half for him; then he said he would take him away, but I believe he had not money to pay for his standing. I went to fetch the money, and the ostler brought me the Advertiser, where I saw such a horse described. I took the paper to the stable, and examined the marks of the horse, and found it to be a proper description of that horse; then I sent for a constable, and had the prisoner secured: after that he persisted in it that he had bought the horse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I lay at Oakham, at the Magpye, the last day of the old year. I set out for London by times in the morning, and a gentleman overtook me on this horse 2 or 3 miles on this side Oakham. I walked by the side of him about a mile; he asked me if I had a mind to buy a horse, and said he was short of money. I asked him what he asked for him: he asked 8 guineas. I bid him six. He went about a quarter of a mile farther, and said I should have him. I paid him 6 guineas for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live on Saffron-hill. The prisoner was in my employ as a shoe-closer—he had no access to my leather, without it was given him to close by me or my foreman—he had been with me three or four months, and was paid by piece-work—on the 18th of August he left my premises without notice—some of my men told me he was gone—I went up to his room, and missed six pairs of uppers which had been given him to close, and which he should have brought to me after he had done them—I found him working for a Mr. Peacock—he said if I would forgive him, he would make up the money for them—I said I could say nothing about it, he must go before the Inspector—I took him there, and he told two different stories—I have not found the leather—I believe it was a drunken <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—some of the rest had part of the money, and they persuaded him to take them.</p>

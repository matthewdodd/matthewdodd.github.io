                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was out of a situation, and advertised in the papers; a person named Gleed answered it, and asked me to meet him. he told me he was an agent for trimmings, and asked me to take this order to the warehouse; it was inclosed in an envelope; I presented it to a gentle<lb></lb>man at the top of the landing, who told me where to go with it. Gleed said that he had an office in the City, and could get me a very good situation as light porter. He had a person with him who said, "What about that order from Se ward's; we had better send to Hat ton's and get them in; send them one. "I went, and after waiting some time I said that I would not wait, they had better send them, and the goods were sent Gleed is in custody, and if he had been charged with me he would probably have been honest enough to have stated so; we were brought up together at Guildhall with a man named Thompson, who I should like to call.</p>

"and he went with the order—Gleed said that he would sell the goods, and the prisoner should have one-third of the proceeds—I was to have the other third I do not know the writing of the order.</p>

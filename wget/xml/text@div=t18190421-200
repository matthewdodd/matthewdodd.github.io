On the 28th of March, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was drinking with the prisoner and some more at the Two Sawyers, public-house, in the Minories; the prisoner and I then went to a cook-shop, from there - I was tired - he took me to his lodgings <placeName id="t18190421-200-crimeloc1112">near the Tower</placeName>

I fell asleep on his bed, awoke about ten o'clock, and found he was gone; I missed my pocket-book and money. I found him that night at a house in Wentworth-street, and gave him in charge; about 1 l. in silver, and the duplicate of a coat was found on him, with my marriage certificate.</p>

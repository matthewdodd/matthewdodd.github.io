I don't think your sister has had a glass in her possession some months; and I told him, if he did not tell me where he got them, I should take him to Bow-street; he refused, and I took him to Bow-street; they were with frames when I found them, what I lost had frames; I cannot swear to the property of the glass, but I'll swear to the horse-cloths; there are two letters on them, one was torn in two, to make a pair.</p>

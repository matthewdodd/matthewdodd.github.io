                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 276). On 12th April, between 6 and 7 in the evening, I was on duty in Thornton-street, Southwark, and saw the prisoner there very drunk—I took him in custody; he kicked me very violently, and wanted to get his hands loose—I took him to the station with some diffi<lb></lb>culty, though I had a sergeant to assist me—I searched him at the station, and found in his left-hand waistcoat pocket 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wrapped separately in fine paper, and in his right waistcoat pocket, five florins in similar paper—I took off his coat and waistcoat, and found in his left waistcoat pocket another counterfeit shilling loose, which I had not noticed before—in his trousers pocket I found a purse and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, good money, loose—he gave his address 25, Weston-street—that was false; but he was drunk—I gave the money to Sergeant Butler.</p>

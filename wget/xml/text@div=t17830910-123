            ; I lost a pair of worstead stockings on the 8th of August last, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner with two more men came to my shop and asked me to look at some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed him several, the prisoner said it was the other young man that wanted them, and asked to look at some worstead stockings; I shewed him some; I turned round to look for some more, and as I turned round I perceived the prisoner had put something into his coat pocket, but could not tell what; I then told the prisoner he had got something of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100155"></xptr> mine; he first took up another pair of stockings which he said he would have, and was going out of the shop; I told him he must not go; a gentleman that lodged with me came in, and the prisoner pulled out the stockings out of his pocket.</p>

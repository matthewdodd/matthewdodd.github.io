On Saturday week my servant was at my door; the prisoner spoke to her, and walked into my lodging - he walked into the parlour, and while he was there I was called into the passage by the servant; the prisoner and I then went up stairs; while we were there my comb fell out of my hair, and the prisoner was moving it with his foot, to push it under the bed-curtain; I then recognized him as being a person who had robbed me once before; I got up, opened the door, and found a paper which had been in my purse - I went down stairs; the prisoner followed me; I begged him to give me my purse -I told him there was no money in it, only bills - he then went into the parlour, and threw it on the table - I thought he had something else, and I went out into the street after him to try to get an officer; a gentleman detained him while I got an officer, who took my thimble from the prisoner - it had been on the parlour mantel-piece, and my purse had been on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Had you had no dispute with him? A. No; we had made no agreement - he had not given me any thing; we were not up stairs more than five minutes; I was sitting by the side of the bed when the comb fell out of my hair - he did not pull any of his clothes off - my servant was in the kitchen when the prisoner went out - he opened the door himself.</p>

             (Police-serjeant D 12.) I was in Quebec-street, and heard the alarm - I went up, and saw the prisoner running; I took him; he said it was for a bawdy-house row, and he was pursued by the bully to get money out of him; I found on him this thimble, a very indecent picture, and some other things - he refused to give any account of where he lived; the prosecutrix owned this thimble, and said he had stolen the purse, but did not take it out of the house; he was very loathe to let me search him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

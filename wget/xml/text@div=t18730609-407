                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 1, Midford Place—on Saturday night, 24th May, the prisoner's wife, who lives in the room over me, came up outside my door and said "You b----whore's son, come out, you bastard"—there is not a night when she is intoxicated that she does not annoy me—I went out and asked her to go away from the door; she had a fire shovel in her hand and hit me with it—the prisoner then come down with a hatchet and said "Leave him to me, Peggy"—he hit me on the head with the hatchet; my head bled all over, and I became insensible and laid down on the stairs—I was stunned for a time—I used no violence to</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on the Saturday the prisoner's wife was on the landing, abusing my husband; she called us all manner of foul names—my husband went out and asked her to go away—she said she had as much right to stop there as he had—she went up and came down again with a small fire shovel in her hand, and began abusing him—he went out to tell her to go away, and she struck him with it, and the prisoner came down with a hatchet in his hand and said "Leave him to me," and struck him on the head with the back part of the hatchet—blood streamed from the wound—I went to take the shovel from the wife, and she said "You b----cow, I will serve you the same."</p>

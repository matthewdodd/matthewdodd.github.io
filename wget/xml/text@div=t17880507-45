               <p>Look at the prisoners? - I am very certain they are the men that robbed me and my wife and daughter; I am very sure of it, as sure as I am of my own children that was born of my wife, as true as God is in heaven.</p>

               <p>You were frightened was not you? - It rather daunted me.</p>
               <p>How long were they with you? - No great matter of time, it might be ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What should they be doing ten minutes; your fears made you think it long, I suppose? - I don't know but it might.</p>

               <p>Describe again where they stood; one was at the horse's head? - Yes; and the middle man was on the shafts; and the other man held the pistol over us all the time.</p>
               <p>Explain a little how you could distinguish three people, and one of them at the distance of the horse's head; you said, somebody pulled the hat over your face; how soon was that done? - Immediately upon their coming up; when they took the money out of my pocket; they bid me get upon my legs, and then I could see all the men.</p>
               <p>You did not know either of these men before? - No.</p>
               <p>You know the lives of these three men are at stake; do you mean to swear positively to three men, to their persons, under these circumstances, frightened as you was, not knowing them before? - Their faces were so perfect in my mind, that I am sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>What sort of hats had they? - I cannot pretend to say; I was in a fluster and flurry, that I cannot tell what sort of hats they were; they might be such as mine.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of William Frost, we were coming to town on the morning of the 16th of April last, about four o'clock; we were stopped in the Edgeware road by three men, who asked us for our money; we told them we had not any; they told us to let them have what we had in a minute, or they would blow our brains out; one of them, Cobcroft, held the pistol to me, I said, gentlemen, you may have what we have, don't use us ill; I pulled out three pence and my thimble, he turned my hand into his.</p>
               <p>Who did? - Wood, the man in red, when Cobcroft held the pistol to me, he got up the wheel the off side of the cart; I was very much frightened, he went away then.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners? - I am certain they are the men that robbed me, this man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070045"></xptr>took my money, that man held the pistol, and the other man held the horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you quite sure of the person of the man in the green coat, Fubbs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you always sure as to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you then to tell the Justice you verily believed Fubbs was one of the men that robbed your husband? - I swore to the man when he was present.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say you believed he was the man? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Was you equally certain to Fubbs as you are now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Always? - Always; I am certain sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>How much is your husband to have of this reward? - We have been robbed very often before, but we never took any before; he has often been robbed upon that road.</p>

               <p>Was you ever with him when he was robbed before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you come out that night in order to be robbed? - Yes, to be sure I did, because I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you come out that morning intending to put yourselves in the way of being robbed? - No, we had no such thoughts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your husband had been robbed several times before, but you never had the good luck to catch any before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with any body about having been robbed before this happened? - Yes, to a great many gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Did any body tell you, that you was out of luck that you did not catch some of the robbers, that you might have got forty pounds apiece for them? - Gentlemen said, it would be a good thing if some of them were taken.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you it would be a good thing for you? - No.</p>
               <p>Were not you frightened at this time? - Yes, very much.</p>
               <p>Had you in your fright leisure to observe the persons of those three men so as to swear to them? - Yes, safely.</p>

               <p>Which stopped the horse? - The man in green, (Fubbs) the middle man (Cobcroft) got upon the shaft and cocked a pistol at my mother and I, and robbed us, and the man in red (Wood) asked for my father's money.</p>

               <p>What made you set out at that time in the morning? - My father was going to market.</p>
               <p>Did not your father go and tell Mr. Herrington to take the prisoners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might these men be with you? - I don't know, they bid us be quick.</p>
               <p>You was a good deal frightened? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath have you ever heard that there was any reward? - I never did hear it, I did not come here for a reward.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath have you never heard there is a reward? - I did not come upon that.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070046"></xptr>Upon your oath you never heard there is a reward if these men are convicted? - I have said what I have to say.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath have you never heard any body say it? - I have.</p>
               <p>Who have you heard say it? - I cannot pretend to say that I ever heard any body say it.</p>
               <p>Have you not heard Mr. Herrington and your father talking about the reward? I have heard Mr. Herrington.</p>
               <p>Did you call at Kilburn-wells for him when you came to find the bill and come with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it first that they talked about it? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Who began the conversation? - Mr. Herrington.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How many forty pounds did he tell your father there would be if all these men were convicted? - I do not know, three I believe.</p>
               <p>Tell all that he said about it? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>It is not three days ago you know; tell it honestly? - I do not know; I never heard him say any thing about it, more than what I have said, for I did not come upon that.</p>
               <p>Did not Mr. Herrington say, that if these three men were cast, there would be three forty pounds? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Your father and mother were both present? - They might be for what I know.</p>
               <p>What answer did your father give to Mr. Herrington? - He said, he did not want any thing but his own property.</p>
               <p>What did your mother say? - She said, she never wanted a farthing but her own property that she lost.</p>
               <p>I suppose you said you should like to have a silk gown out of it, did not you, what did you say? - I never wished it; I said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did not your father say it was very lucky he had got these men, that he had been robbed very frequently but never got any thing for it before; was that in the same conversation? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>What was it? - The three forty pounds.</p>
               <p>You are sure that was all that passed? - Yes; I never desired a farthing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. When your father said he did not want any thing but his own property, it was in answer to Herrington telling him of the three forty pounds? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Both your father and mother said, they did not want any of the reward, but only his own property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Frost. When was it you had a conversation with Herrington about the reward? - I had none at all.</p>
               <p>You never heard Herrington say any thing about the reward? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Never at no time? - No.</p>
               <p>You never heard him say there were three forty pounds if these three men were cast? - Never.</p>
               <p>You never told him you did not want any reward? - I have told people so.</p>
               <p>But did you ever say so to Herrington? - Never.</p>
               <p>Then if any body has ever said that you said so to Herrington, it is not true? - I never heard him say any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true, if any body, let them be who they will, has said so? - It is not.</p>
               <p>You never told any body that you did not want any of the reward, but only your own property? - We have told other people so, but not Mr. Herrington.</p>
               <p>You never heard Herrington say any thing about the reward? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was you talking to then? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that the people you heard talking about the reward were total strangers? - I cannot tell the people's name.</p>
               <p>I have not asked you that; I asked you if they were total strangers to you? - I do not know that I had ever seen them before; I have heard them talk about it since we have been waiting in town across the way,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070047"></xptr>here, but I don't know who it was, not of those men, but I have heard there was a reward so much to a prosecutor.</p>
               <p>How much for each man? - I cannot pretend to say how much.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you never hear how much? - Yes, I don't know but I have in town.</p>
               <p>Was that to day that you heard it? - I don't know, we have been in town ever since Monday.</p>
               <p>When was it? - I don't know whether it was not at Hickes's-hall, on Tuesday; it was talked of in court at Hickes's-hall, by people as I stood by.</p>
               <p>They said it would be a good job to you? - No, not to me, they did not mention these men; they said, every man that was prosecuted there was forty pounds a man; they did not say it to us, but we heard it.</p>
               <p>Was that forty pounds for prosecuting them, whether they were convicted or not? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, don't you know that if these men are acquitted you won't get a halfpenny? - I don't want any thing.</p>
               <p>But do not you know that you won't get a halfpenny if the men are acquitted? - I have heard them say so; but I don't want any thing.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Kilburn-wells, I have kept the house seventeen years next Christmas; on Wednesday, the 16th of April, I was called up a little after four o'clock by Frost the fisherman, I threw up the sash, and asked him, what was the matter; he told me, he had been robbed on the Edgeware road; I desired him to let his wife and daughter go to the turnpike-house, as I had no fire at my house; I found I had never a saddle, I went to the Turnpike-house, and borrowed a saddle and bridle; I got my great coat and a pair of pistols; there were some waggons going by, I enquired if they had seen three men; they said, they were gone to Edgeware; I went to the Black-lion, West-end, and called one Scott up, and desired him to follow me to North-end; Scott came, but it was after the prisoners were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - One Smith and Milkin went with me, and another man, who is not here; I saw the three men coming just by the Bull and Bush, North-end; we went into a garden and hid ourselves, while they went by; Milkin made an attack upon Wood, he ran away, and made his escape; Smith and I took Cobcroft and Fubbs; Wood was pursued and taken and brought back by one Collins; I took them all to the Bull and Bush at North-end, and there we searched them; I found upon Cobcroft three-pence halfpenny, this pistol, and Smith found another in his pocket, and some slugs and powder, and gave them me; we found two shillings and four-pence halfpenny on Fubbs, and this pocket-piece upon Wood.</p>
               <p>(Producing them.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You keep a public-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have had the good fortune to bring several persons to justice? - I have.</p>
               <p>How many? - I can't say.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you can tell us how many of them have been executed? - I believe there have been three executed.</p>
               <p>Of course you know there is a reward upon the conviction of highway-men? - Yes, as well as that you are paid for pleading.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prosecutors of this indictment are acquainted with it? - They were never acquainted with it by me.</p>
               <p>You never told any of them? - I don't recollect that I ever did.</p>
               <p>Will you say upon your oath, that you have never mentioned it? - To the best of my knowledge I never did.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with them about the reward at all? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you can tell whether within those two days, you have had any such conversation? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070048"></xptr>Could you have forgot it? - I am most clear I never did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you not say yesterday, that if these three men were convicted, there were three rewards of forty pounds each? - Never in my life to my knowledge; I am clear I did not; I never did, nor never once dreamt such a thing.</p>
               <p>I ask you once more, will you bring yourself up to swear positively you did not yesterday? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - I am sure I never mentioned such a thing as three forty pounds.</p>
               <p>You never had any conversation about the reward? - Not to my knowledge; all I have said about it is, that when the bills are settled, you must all contribute to it.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that was not true? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you not know there would be nothing to pay, but a great deal to receive? - Not for expences.</p>
               <p>How much may you have received for conviction money in your time? - No great deal; I believe about seventy pounds.</p>
               <p>Whether those people told you at any time, that they did not want any part of the reward? - I never heard them say it.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Frost? - Since last Christmas, or else I have known nothing of him, except going up and down the road.</p>
               <p>This man is not rich I suppose? - No, people went a begging for him for relief, after he had been robbed, for him to go to market again.</p>
               <p>LIGHTOW MILKIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I went in pursuit with Mr. Herrington, after some men; we overtook them on Hampstead-heath; Wood ran away, I followed him 200 yards by myself, and Mr. Collins, a gardener, saw me follow him; he had a pistol in his hand; Collins took him before I came up; I assisted and we brought him back.</p>
               <p>They were searched in your presence? - Yes, and a bad shilling, and a thimble was found upon Cobcroft.</p>

               <p>Any thing upon the others? - Not to my knowledge; Mr. Herrington searched them all.</p>
               <p>To Hnrrington. What did you find upon Cobcroft? - One pistol, some slugs, some powder, and three-pence halfpenny, that was all.</p>

               <p>Was you by when they were talking with Mr. Herrington about sharing this money? - No.</p>

               <p>How much did Mr. Herrington tell you you were likely to get? - He did not tell us any thing.</p>
               <p>Who told you? - We were informed we should gain something by some men at Hampstead that had taken people.</p>
               <p>How much? - Forty pounds for each.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Frost and Mr. Herrington were talking about that, when Frost said, he did not want any thing but his own property? - Yes, just after we had taken them.</p>
               <p>The old man said, he only wanted his property back, the property he had been robbed of before and now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The old man and his daughter were by at the time? - I can't say.</p>
               <p>What had Mr. Herrington been saying to the old man to make him say that? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What did Mr. Herrington say to that? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do recollect what Mr. Herrington said? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>There was some more conversation about the reward which you forget? - There was.</p>

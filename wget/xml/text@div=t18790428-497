                  </hi>. I am London manager of Messrs. Duellin and Co., wine carriers and forwarding agents, Great Tower Street—the prisoner was in our service as Custom House clerk, from June, 1875, till July, 1878, when he was discharged—it was part of his business to pay duty to the Custom House to clear wines—with regard to champagne we keep a running account with the Treasury—we pay in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to meet calls, that is called prime entry—we pay the specific shipments on other wines on Custom House entry—when bills of lading came in it was the prisoner's duty to come to me for a cheque, which I always entered in this cash book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and before I gave him the cheque—there is no entry on February 6th or 7th, 1877—I was not in town then; looking at the entry on 8th February, I say that I paid out a, cheque for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that date—I gave it to Mr. Mensendorff, my brother-in-law; in my absence the firm obtained cheques from him, and this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is drawn in his favour. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th February</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">on the Union Bank of London, Princes Street;</hi> 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">"Bearer" struck out and "Order" substituted.

Received of <hi rend="smallCaps">T. H</hi>. Butcher 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the receipts are made out by the clerk who pays in the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I would not swear that no sum beyond 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was paid to the Customs on the 6th February, 1877—I know that other sums were paid on that date—I cannot tell the exact amount or whether we had a duplicate receipt on the file—we have not searched except for prime entry receipts—prime entry is for goods passed to our entry before the goods are landed—the payment of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for prime entry, the other for warehouse entry—no money goes to the Customs except in respect of duty, but we keep two separate accounts—payments to the Customs have nothing to do with pay<lb></lb>ments to dock companies or warehouse rent—the prisoner was our Custom House clerk and collector, and was the person who almost invariably had to pay the moneys to the Custom House for duties—I have never paid in there myself; practically the prisoner had the conduct of all the departments of that business for both branches—we received our goods by the Great Northern of France, and the South-Eastern Company, via Boulogne or Folkestone, and we had originally a through rate with the South-Eastern Railway Company for the carriage and delivery of all goods—this did not include duty—the South-Eastern agents passed the Customs entries—the company or their agents undertook to do all the necessary business to get the goods to London and we paid them—we did not want the Custom House clerks to pass entries at that time—we altered that arrangement and arranged with the General Steam Navigation Company to bring our cham<lb></lb>pagnes, and those consignments came to London by that company—it then became necessary to pass ourown Customs entries, and the prisoner was taken into our employ for that purpose—we considered it better that all consignments should be entered in the name of Butcher at the Customs House and not in our name—that was not in consequence of any canvasser oalling; those consignments were afterwards entered by the prisoner in the name of Butcher, by my orders—I know that this was a payment of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in addition to the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are duplicate receipts given in bundles by the Customs in this form, and not bound up in a book, and we can go to the Customs and receive a number of them—I do not know if they are given out in blank—this is the half which is filled up and left with the Customs; the duplicate is given-to the clerk—these would be put on a general file for all of kinds receipts and other documents—there are a great number of documents in our business—we had what is called a deposit account with the customs, like a deposit account at the docks—we paid an account to save sending every time, and it enabled us to clear at our convenience; 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a proper amount to be paid in for that purpose; and the prisoner would have the best knowledge as to the amount of duties required—he kept a small book in which he had to enter every day the pay<lb></lb>ments on account to the Custom House, and the duties he had to pay, so that he could see daily what balance we had at the Custom House—his duty was to see that the balance was correct every day—we have one deposit account with the Customs, but we keep two separate books—duties paid at warehouse would not pass through that deposit account—when goods are warehoused</p>

               <p>and entry passed by the Customs, we pay the fixed amount of duty upon the entry; therefore we have no account to keep with the Customs of that—I was absent on the 6th February, and did not draw this 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cheque—Mr. Mensendorff did not draw a cheque for that amount, he only drew the two cheques for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one on the 6th and the other on the 7th February—the prisoner passed the warehouse entries and he collected for us, and I am-charging him with embezzling a number of sums which he collected, and which are mentioned in the indictment—I am practi<lb></lb>cally the head of the firm here, and hare instructed the solicitor for this prosecution—this is in respect of the sum he is alleged to have received from Messrs. Black and Gayford—I have seen his receipt, and will swear he received that sum—I have no charges here against any other clerks—I have clerks here as witnesses—Mr. Gillingham is not here—I know something about the prisoner having been sent by my bookkeeper to collect from Black and Gayford 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which had been some time before collected by another clerk, but I don't know of my own knowledge—I know from what the book-keeper has told me there were two amounts of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a mistake—I do not know much about it—my business is mostly out of the office—I know there are amounts collected by the prisoner not accounted for—there were over 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we might bring 20 indictments—we have brought several indictments—he came into our service in 1875—my book-keeper is very careful, but there is great detail in our business, and a mistake might occur here and there—the collecting was done only on Saturdays, but he would have to do his Custom House work too, if any, or another clerk might assist him—he had not much Custom House work when he had to collect—there is a general book in which the collecting, clerk should enter the particulars of what he has collected—there is no book kept at the office for all clerks to enter money collected—the prisoner had strictly to pay over the money to the cashier, and if the cashier were out he would have to wait till he returned—I do not know if he would take the money away with him, but he has to account first to the cashier—if he found that a sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was required for duties, he would go to the cashier and say, "I want 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—we always pay in to the Custom house either 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or sometimes 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (rough diary) is the book in which he would enter all payments on prime entry—there is no<lb></lb>thing here but "Paid in, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—it is a record of what he receives and pays in—the book belongs to the office, and he has no right to carry it about with him—there would be nothing wrong in keeping it in his desk—his duty was to put down the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he paid it in—it would be irregular to enter the payment directly he receives it, because this book is a record of amounts actually paid in—the book was kept to ascertaiu the balance every day at the Customs—When he received the money it was his duty to go at once to the Customs and pay it in—he might have sent it down, but it would be his duty to go himself, and the receipt for the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in his own handwriting—other clerks have paid in deposit accounts, and they might do so in the absence of the prisoner—if he had a great deal of business to do I might have sent another clerk—it was his special duty to so down.</p>

               <p>have at present 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money, which I now hand over to you. I can hardly hope you will forgive me, but if you would allow me to repay the balance I have misappropriated I will faithfully do so. Oh! sir, for the sake of my father and mother, do not Jet them Know about this. The confidence which you have placed in me will, of course, cease, but I hope that some day I may be able to ask you if you will again rely on me, and that you will be able to answer Yes! The reason or cause of my taking the money was that at the time I entered your employ I had got into debt and did not get out of it, although I tried hard to do so. When I held the money in my hand I thought I would be able to repay it before you would press the Customs for it; but now you have said you were going to see Mr. Thorpe I must confess what I have done. If you would only allow me to remain in your employ and work to pay off the amount, you will save me from ruin in every way, body and soul. I could never look any one in the face at home. Again praying for your mercy, I am, your obedient servant, Thomas Hawkes Butcher."</p>

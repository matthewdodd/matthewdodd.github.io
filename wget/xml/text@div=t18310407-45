On the 16th of March the prisoner came to his shop, and had a few trifling articles; she then had a small piece of pork weighed, which came to 4 1/2d. - she said she had not money enough to pay for that; the Policeman came in at that time as a customer - while I was serving him I sent a boy to see what the prisoner wanted; when the Policeman went to look for his cheese which he had bought and paid for, he could not find it; he taxed the prisoner with it - she said, "Upon my soul, I have not got it," and ran away; he followed, and took her with the cheese, and this piece of pork, which I had put in the tray into the window.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I paid for some butter and cheese, and being rather intoxicated, I did not know whether I took my own cheese or not. Witness. She had the cheese which she had bought in her basket - she had not bought the pork; she had not paid for the pork she had a weighed - this cheese was about 3 ozs. larger than the piece she bought, and the pork was about 1 1/2 lb. more than what she had weighed; she was rather the worse for liquor - she paid 2 1/2d. for her cheese, and the constable's cheese came to 4d.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070038"></xptr>the shop to purchase some articles, and among the rest a 1/2 lb. of cheese - when I went to take the cheese it was gone; I accused the prisoner of it - she denied it, and ran off; I pursued, and took her - I asked if she had taken the cheese; she said No, and opened her basket to show the piece she had bought, but my cheese was under her arm under her cloak, with a piece of pork - she was a little intoxicated, but not drunk; she had been served at a different part of the shop, a short distance from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked him to go with me, and said I would show him where I bought the pork - he took me to the station, and I said I would meet him the next day. Witness. She was let go that night, as the prosecutor did not come, and she came the next day - she did not tell me where she bought it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I pawned my shawl to buy this bit of pork - I gave 8 1/2d. for it; I then went to the prosecutor's shop, where I bought a - lb. of cheese, and 3d. worth of butter; I took up this cheese, and did not know but that it was my own.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

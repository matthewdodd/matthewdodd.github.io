               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before? - A. Never; I took particular notice of a large scar upon his left check, I observed his dress in general, and at the time he committed the act, he had the waistcoat on that he now appears at the bar in.</p>

             sworn. - I am a glover, No. 11, Cheapside: On the 29th of June, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw two or three men place a trunk under Mr. Penny's window, they then left it under the window for the space of an hour and half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with it to take care of it? - A. Nobody to take care of it; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120032"></xptr>returned, and came to the door to thank me for taking care of the trunk; I told him I did not know that I had any trunk under my care; I then went to the door, and asked him who that trunk belonged to, he said it belonged to him; I asked him where he brought it from, he told me from the New Inn, in the Borough; I then told him I did not think he was the person that brought it, and therefore I should not deliver it up till the right owner came to claim it, he then said his master lived a great way off, and he wished the trunk to be carried to where he was going to take it to; he then lifted the trunk into the shop, and there it remained till half past eight, when the prisoner came, with another man dressed like a ticket porter, to demand the trunk; a friend of mine, of the name of Jones, was at that time standing in the shop, and he asked him from whence he brought it; the prisoner told him he brought it from the Nag's head in the Borough; Mr. Jones asked him where he was going to carry it, he said, to a Mr. Jones's, a hosier in Fleet-street; I then told him I should not deliver up the trunk till Mr. Jones came to claim it as his property; he then said, I might send any body with him to Mr. Jones's, in Fleet-street, and then I should be satisfied; my friend, Mr. Jones, said he would go with him, and accordingly they opened the door and went away together.</p>
               <p>- JONES sworn. - I am a coal-merchant: I called at Mr. Hill's, where this man was with the trunk; as my name was Jones, and lived in Fleet-street, and not knowing any thing of Jones, a hosier, in Fleet-street, I said I would go with him, which I did, and with the other man, who said he was a ticket-porter; as I was going through St. Paul's Church-yard, they whispered something about Pater-noster-row, and turned up Pater-noster-row, which I conceived to be the wrong way to Fleet-street; I then beckoned to a stranger to follow me, I suspected they meant to run away; and when they got into Pater-noster-row, they did run away; the prisoner pulled a knife out of his pocket, with which he cut a butcher's lad, who came out to see what was the matter; I attempted to stop him, he ran on to the corner of Creed-lane, towards Thames-street, a number of people were passing, which rather checked him, and then he was stopped, and I charged Johnson, the constable, with him, whom I saw in the crowd; I did not see the knife at first, but I suspected it was something of that kind, as I had seen several people who attempted to stop him, draw back again; the box remained in Mr. Hill's custody at his door, the prisoner had not the box with him. (The trunk produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Topham. I am sure this is my trunk, I know it by the mark on the outside; it was going on board a ship the next morning; it was put in the passage ready to take off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. It has been in my possession ever since.</p>

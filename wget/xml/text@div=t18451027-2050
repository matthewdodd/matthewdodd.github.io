                  </hi>. I live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. On Wednesday night, the 15th of Oct., I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock—I observed that the window was shut down—I had a waistcoat and blue handkerchief with white spots, which I took off and placed on a chair in the room—I had a coin in my waistcoat pocket—I missed them next morning, and two petticoats which I had seen in the room over-night—I did not notice the window in the morning—on the following night, when I went home, the prisoner was on the stairs—after I had got into bed I observed the prisoner's hand through the pane of glass, trying to push the button back—I went out into the yard, and caught him—I said, "I sup<lb></lb>pose you are the person that came last night and took my things away?"—he said he had come into the yard with some woman, that he had given given her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and did not know where she was gone to—I sent for a con<lb></lb>stable, and gave him into custody—he pulled a coin out of his waistcoat pocket, and said that was the only piece of money he had about him—it was the coin I had lost on the previous night—it was in the waistcoat, which I also lost—the prisoner said he had had it in his possession a long time—I am sure I had it the night before—the window is near the ground.</p>

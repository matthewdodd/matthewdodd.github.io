               <p>SARAH SIMMONS. I live at No. 6, Off-alley, Strand, and am a charwoman. I have known the prisoner these twelve months - she lived as <rs id="t18320517-65-deflabel374" type="occupation">cook</rs>

               <p>Q.What bundle? A. The child was in a bundle; I said, "Oh, cook, Oh, cook, you have hanged the baby;" she said, "Hush, hush, Mrs. Simmons, you will hang me- I shall be hanged; shut the door, and keep it secret from master;" Mr. Jones, the doctor, was in the house at this time, and he came into the room, looked at the bundle and the baby, and perceived a piece of tape round its neck - he took it away from its neck, and threw it by the window; Thomas, the inspector, has it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Had you seen a good deal of the prisoner? A. I am generally there on Saturdays, and when they are without a servant; she was mild, well behaved, kind, and good-natured - the child was wrapped in the prisoner's own night-gown and black apron; they appeared to be wrapped round the child - night-gowns have strings at the neck; she was agitated - she came down stairs into the kitchen for three quarters of an hour, after she delivered herself; there is no Mrs. Rhodes.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH EMMERSON. I have been housemaid to Mr. Rhodes, for three months, and have known the prisoner during that time - I slept in the same bed with her, and did so on the Thursday night. I got up about nine o'clock on Friday morning - she was in bed then; I had heard nothing particular in the night - she came down to breakfast, and I saw her up stairs about half-past one o'clock; she requested me to retire to the kitchen to my business, as she was very poorly with a bad head-ache - we were then up stairs in the room joining the bed-room; I went down stairs in about half an hour, went up again in five or ten minutes, alone, and saw her there; Simmons came up - we went into the prisoner's bed-room, and saw her apparently sitting on the pot; I saw stains of blood about her clothes; I asked what was the matter - she said Nothing, and requested us to leave the room, which we did - I requested Rhodes to send for a doctor, but before he came, I saw her - Simmons assisted to undress her, and the dirt in the room was cleared away - Mr. Thompson came into the room; the pot was shown to him in the next room - after he went away, we suspected all was not right, and requested her to open her box, which she refused - I left the room - I was called immediately after, and went up -I saw a bundle laying on the floor; I saw it opened by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170056"></xptr>Jones - it contained a baby - I do not think it had been opened before I went in - the prisoner desired me not to make a noise, to let Mr. Rhodes know it - I saw Mr. Jones uncover the baby, and take a piece of tape off some part of its body; I cannot say what part - he placed the tape on the floor - I left the room, and saw nothing more; I cannot say whether the prisoner is single or married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was she a kind, well-conducted woman, and very humane? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES THOMPSON. I am assistant to Mr. Jones, surgeon, of the Strand. I went to Mr. Rhodes' between three and four o'clock, and saw the prisoner in bed - I asked her what was the matter; she said she felt a violent pain in her stomach, but was better then - I inquired the cause of the pain; she said she had not been periodically unwell for two months before, but was then relieved, was much better, and thought she should get up; I left the room - one of the servants came out, and showed me the pot, which had a quantity of cloths, and blood on it; I went back to the prisoner alone, and asked if she had been with child; she denied it - I left, and did not see her again.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JONES. I am a surgeon. On the 13th of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went to Mr. Rhodes', No. 4, Fountain-court, Strand, and saw the prisoner laying on the bed - she said she was a great deal better than she had been, and had been down stairs, but feeling fatigued, she came up again; I left her, and was beckoned into the next room by the servants, who showed me the pot - it contained a quantity of blood, cloths, and water; I was then confident there must be a child, and recommended them to search the room: when I went into the room again there was a child laying on the floor - the bundle was untied, and the child laying on it, when I entered - I found a piece of tape laying on the child, some-where about the body; the child appeared to have been born some hours; it was not quite cold then - I noticed a mark round the neck, and left the further examination of it till next day, when I examined it with Dr. Lee and Mr. Beavan, about noon, and under this mark I found extravasated blood in the cellular membrane, under the skin - the child was well formed in every respect; its lungs fully inflated with air; in fact it had every appearance of having been born alive - of having breathed; there was a bruise on the back of the head, which I consider most probably occasioned by a fall; I do not remember any thing else which struck me, except that the after birth was unusually small.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not before the Coroner express yourself not quite so strong, and say you were inclined to think it was born alive? A. I most likely said so; the naval string was unusually short and small - it was not separated till I cut it; the impression on my mind is that the mark round the neck could not be caused by the navalstring - the mark was much smaller than I consider the naval string would have made; the tongue protruded from the mouth, and the left side of the face appeared more puffed than the other, and drawn up; the vessels of the brain were filled with blood, and there was a spot of extravasated blood on the left side of the brain; every thing induced me to think death had been caused by strangulation; I attended the prisoner afterwards, but had no conversation with her about this - previous to the dissection, when I mentioned to her the mark round the neck, she told me she could in no way account for it; the mark on the head might be caused by a pressure at the birth - the tape was a string of the night-gown: somebody applied it to the neck of the child - it appeared to correspond with the mark on the neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it within your knowledge, that a child may be strangled by natural causes in the progress of its birth? A. It frequently happens; that would be more likely when a woman delivered herself - I should think it often happens that they have an absence of intellect at the moment of delivery; it is frequently the case in deliveries that the head may protrude, and the child breathe, and yet death happen before the delivery is complete; the circumstance of the lungs floating in water, is an unsafe criterion to ascertain if a child has been born alive; I cannot say this child was wholly born alive - I think if the tape had been applied to the neck immediately after death, it would leave a mark, while the blood was warm - if it had been put round the neck, or had been round the gown, before the blood had ceased to flow, I think the appearances might have been the same; we tried the lungs, and they were perfectly inflated - there were no appearances on the brain corresponding with the bruise on the skin; no bone could be fractured in so young a child, it would give way; I always provide myself with thread to tie the naval string - I think it probable if the child was strangled in its birth, that the tongue would protrude - it is very difficult to come to any conclusion further than that the child had breathed - it must have breathed several times, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Dr. Lee and and Mr. Breamer, a surgeon, confirmed the evidence of the last witness, that it was not possible to decide whether the child had been completely born alive.</p>

             THOMAS. I am superintendent of Covent-garden division of the Police. I accompanied Mr. Jones the surgeon, to Mr. Rhodes' house, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - I saw the prisoner in bed; the child was enclosed in a night-gown and black apron; the night-gown was next the body - Mr. Jones pointed out to me a discoloured mark round the child's neck, close to the jaw, and handed me a small string which was discoloured with blood; in fact it was saturated through - here it is; I then examined more particularly the wrappers, and found the collar of the bed-gown had only one string on it, but there was a fragment on the opposite corner of the collar, which showed that a string had been torn away, or broken - the string appeared to agree with the fragment, as well as the state of it would allow; I turned to the prisoner, and asked how she accounted for the death of the child - she said, "I don't know any think about it; I cannot tell; I have not done it;" I asked if she had made any provision of clothing for the child; she said, no, she had not, for she had no money to purchase any thing - I asked if any one knew of her situation - she said she had never acquainted any one but the father of the child - she had informed him some months ago; that he was a long way in the country, and she would never say who he was; she subsquently told me his name was Harris or Harrison, and that he had lately married; she was inclined to say more - I said she had better not - I placed her in custody, and she had every care taken of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170057"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. Did you state before the Coroner that she said she had lately got married? A. I am not certain - I think I did, but I am sure she stated so; she appeared in an exhausted state, which was my reason for not entering into further conversation - I went to see her daily while she was confined to her room, and I found on my first visit she had entirely forgotten all that had passed at our first interview - she subsequently appeared unconscious of what had passed before; she said Harris had promised her marriage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the state of mind I was in, I was unconscious of what I said or did.</p>
               <p>MARY ARNOLD. I live in Herberts-passage, Beaufort-buildings. About three weeks before this occured, the prisoner desired me to purchase her a piece of diaper to make napkins of; she afterwards asked if I had purchased it - I said I had not; a piece makes a dozen napkins - she desired that my daughter should make them for her.</p>

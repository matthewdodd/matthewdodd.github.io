                  </hi>. I am an accountant, living in King-street, Cheapside. I was employed by the defendants' creditors to investigate the state of their affairs—I saw them both on 5th Nov.; they did not at that interview go into any explanation—I saw them, and they then stated that they had commenced busi<lb></lb>ness subsequently in Oct., 1850, with a capital of about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that has been corrected since—I learnt from them, and from an examination of their books, what their debts were—I had conversation with them afterwards about it—I found that their debts were within a trifle of 5,492<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they represented nothing to me about their assets then—their stock was subsequently sold—it was valued at the cost-price as given by the bankrupts to an assistant of mine—that might have been tested by reference to the invoices—I did not test it; we assumed it to be correct—the stock sold for 1,026<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or thereabouts—that was 45 per cent, less than the alleged cost-price—there were goods at Mun<lb></lb>caster and Wane's, the pawnbrokers; that was not in addition to the stock-part of the amount of the stock consisted of goods at Muncaster and Warre's—they were stated at that time to amount to about 789<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from which we deducted the advances made on the goods, amounting to about 546<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that left the available assets in the hands of Muncaster and Warre at about 832<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the bad debts ascertained at that time amounted to about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found a sum of money unaccounted for; as far as we proceeded, allowing for losses upon certain sales they had made, there was about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unaccounted for at that time; the losses on sales as ascertained from them and their books was about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—under the bankruptcy these items have been corrected—they told me that they had sold to certain wholesale houses at a loss—the deficiency between the debts and assets was about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the domestic and trade expenses and money drawn out by the partners was about 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as then ascertained, but finding that the estate was going to bankruptcy we did not follow it out—I state that in justice to the prisoners, that they could not account for it further, we stopped there.</p>

               <p>—they explained the pledging to me—I could ascertain in the books what goods had been pledged, and what goods had been redeemed—I have ascertained since the bankruptcy, that the money received is entered under the words "Loan," and "Borrowed," and the redeemings under the word "Silk," and "Silkman"—from those two words I have been able to ascertain what goods were deposited, and what redeemed—I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of that—the pledgings amounted to 1,624<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the redeemings to 1,105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the trade assignees sold the stock by private con<lb></lb>tract to a Mr. Myers, at 45 per cent, below the cost price—I did not test the cost price by the invoices, but I requested a creditor to go down and look at them—it would have been extremely difficult to test manufactured stock; parasols and umbrellas are made up of different things; I should have had to ascertain the cost price of the cane and silk, and the amount paid for labour—I believe the account the bankrupts gave of the cost price was generally correct—the stock was sold to Myers at 1,026<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods at Muncaster and Warre's were not included in that—the invoice price of the goods sold to Myers was 1,871<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as given by the bankrupts—I believe that included a quantity of cane that was on the premises—I found 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of cane on the premises—I cannot tell when it was bought, or whe<lb></lb>ther it was paid for—that is included in the 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—there was house<lb></lb>hold furniture and fixtures, independent of the stock; that I valued at 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not aware at what price that was sold—I put a medium price, what it was worth as it stood there—there were also some pianofortes there, which with certain trade furniture, was taken at 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods at Muncaster and Warre's I valued at 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. above the advances—there was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods at Messrs. Pick ford and Roberts—they have stated the amount of goods pledged at about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in their balance-sheet, instead of 789<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bad and doubtful debts are taken at 335<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the bankruptcy—the amount of trade and household expenses, and money drawn out by the partners was 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as then ascertained—it has been altogether altered under the bank<lb></lb>ruptcy—I have not made any inquiries myself since; I have not been at all employed under the bankruptcy, except to sell the stock—I put down about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for trade expenses; I believe Woolf drew out 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his private expenses, it was stated at 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and Mr. Lyons 359<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the application of it I do not know—Lyons has a family—the bankrupts gave me the names of the parties to whom they had sold at a loss, and guessed at the amounts; they did not refer at all to their books then—this is the list of the parties as they gave them to me (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), but I have ascertained that the losses there are greatly exaggerated—I did not refer to the books when they gave me that statement, to ascertain the profit or loss on each transaction—it has been ascertained from the books since, but not by me—I believe, under the bankruptcy, the loss has been ascertained at 1,360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you tell me if our figures are correct here to-day? How you make out a deficiency which you cannot account for of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because I make up just 5,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I take 187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the value of the goods, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as representing the value of the household furniture, 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the pianofortes, 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods pledged, 335<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for bad and doubtful debts, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for trade expenses, 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the private expenses of Woolf, 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Lyons, and 1,360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the losses on sales; that makes a sum of 5,425<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., does it not, taking the figures roughly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You have mixed in your statement two distinct accounts; you have mixed up the account that I give as to the state of their affairs when I investigated them, and the state of things as shown by the bankrupts' balance-sheet, put in under the bankruptcy—I will give you my account of it; I charge the bankrupts with a deficiency of 3,056<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the difference between thes</p>

               <p>debts and assets, and I charge them with 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which they then stated to be the amount of their capital; those figures together amount to 3,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then give them credit for 1,479<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expenses and sums drawn out by the partners, and for 1,008<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the losses then assumed to have taken place on their sales; that left, as I stated, 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time unaccounted for—that does not take in the bad and doubtful debts—it does include the pianofortes at their present value, the household furniture at 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the stock at 1,875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the pledged goods at 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the best account that the bankrupts could give at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us understand what your exact position was with reference to these persons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was called in on 5th Nov. by their creditors to ascertain the state of their affairs—I attended a meeting of creditors on 19th Nov., when one of them proposed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound; the creditors who had before stated they would make them bankrupts, then finally determined to do so, and did so, I believe, on that day—the business was taken out of my hands after that—I know of no variation in the account since, except that they have discovered that the amount of goods pledged exceeded what was stated—as regards the debts and assets, it agrees with their balance sheet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say they determined to make them bankrupts; it was not a hostile bankruptcy, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they gave an assignment, and also a declaration of insolvency, when the creditors wished it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am one of the official assignees of the Court of Bankruptcy. I was appointed assignee in this case immediately upon the adjudication, and have since had all the bankrupts' books in my possession—I have been in communication with them from time to time—I ascertained from them that they commenced business on 12th Oct., 1850, and carried it on up to 19th Nov., 1851—from their balance-sheet it appears that Lyons' capital on commencing business was 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Woolf's 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in addition to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. borrowed—money borrowed is not capital, but debt—the stock-in-trade at the time of the bankruptcy was valued by the bankrupts at 2,038<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the surplus on goods in pledge at 332<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the umbrella sticks and pianos are included in the stock—there was also 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in outstanding bills in their hands, which they delivered upas part of their assets—they represented their good debts at 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; doubtful debts, 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and bad debts, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no cash delivered up, either as being in their hands or at their bankers—the amount of creditors' debts due to parties is 5,476<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—that appears on their balance-sheet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want you to inform the Court how they account for the difference between 2,654<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. assets and the amount owing to creditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Losses by goods' account, 1,701<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; sundry losses, 212<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

               <p>within 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that discrepancy arises from the creditors holding security for debts owing by the bankrupts to them, amounting to 199<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the property, as valued by the bankrupts, in the hands of those creditors, 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they put down in their balance-sheet 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than the property was really worth—I cannot state when these losses on sales commenced, but taking the amount of the goods purchased, and from that deducting the amount of stock in hand, the loss would appear at 10 1/2 per cent, in the whole course of their dealing—their goods' account shows the price at which they purchased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You make that account after having investigated the whole of the hooks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the result of what they sold, what they manufactured, and what they bought—I took the cost price, the cost of manufacture, then the stock, and gave them credit for the expenses; and the general result of it was that during the whole time they carried on trade there was a loss of 10 1/2 per cent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk manufacturer, in partnership with my father and brother, in Spital-square. I know the two defendants—I first became acquainted with Woolf in Oct., 1850, I think, but I was acquainted with Lyons before—he introduced me to Woolf, and we had dealings with them in Oct., 1850, and Jan., 1851—in Oct. we supplied them with umbrella silk to the amount of 412<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; in Nov., 633<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in Dec, 713<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they paid in cash and bills for some of them, one bill by Burnell, which</p>

               <p>was afterwards taken up by them in the beginning of the year—I made in<lb></lb>quiries of themes to their capital—Lyons had told me when Woolf joined him that Woolf had brought in some thousands of pounds—they wished to refer a party to me in Jan. for me to vouch for their respectability, and I told Lyons I could not, unless I knew what capital they had—I then asked him if they had 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the business—his answer was, "Considerably over," and I gave them the reference they asked for—I told the party who was referred to us what they had said—we continued supplying them with goods after that—about that time I inquired of Lyons as to the amount of their capital, and he told me his partner had brought in some thousands of pounds and had more money, but he did not wish it to he brought into the business, as he, Lyons, did not wish to pay interest on Woolfs money—the amount they owed us in Feb., before the 17th, was 2,190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was only secured by their own acceptances, and not the whole of it—at that time they begged to have more goods, and we did not wish to increase the account; we told them we did not like to go any further—they then said there were certain bills running, we had no occasion to be at ait anxious about the account, the money was per<lb></lb>fectly safe; but if it would relieve our minds they would take up the accept<lb></lb>ances which were running—we took them two of the bills amounting to 711<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which they gave us a check, which was duly honoured—in the July following, as they had told me they were about taking stock, I said, "You have been taking stock, I hope it turns out to your satisfaction"—Lyons replied that it had turned out perfectly to their satisfaction, and they were in a better position than a good many men who held their heads a great deal higher than they did—the balance of the account at the end of July was 2,672<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and in Aug., 2,609<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is no Sept. account, it is all one with the Oct.—up to Oct. 16th here is a Balance of 2,312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they applied for more goods afterwards, but we did not supply them—the last balance I have mentioned still remains unpaid—about a fortnight before the bankruptcy Lyons looked out goods to the amount of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but we said we should not supply him with them without security—we did not supply them—they said they had been trying to get security, but could not—they told us two or three times they had, but they had not; and on 4th Nov., they both came to us together and told us they must stop payment—I spoke to them about what they had told us about their stock-taking—I required to see the balance-sheet of their stock-taking in July last—Woolf brought the papers, and I found from them that there was 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency—I said they could not be much more deficient in the three months up to the present time, Nov.—they said they did not think they were, but they could not tell—on 10th Sept. we sold them four pieces of goods, amounting to 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they must have been sold to Lyons, for Woolf never bought goods—to the best of my belief I sold them myself—I have seen two out of the four pieces at Muncaster and Warre's—they appear to have been pawned on the 12th—I next saw Lyons some days before 25th Sept.—he said he expected a buyer from Manchester, and requested me to send some goods on approbation; he said he would not buy them, but if he could sell any he would, and the rest he should return—on 25th, Fry, their clerk, came to the warehouse, and from what he stated we delivered him sixteen pieces of goods, value 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have seen seven of those pieces since at Muncaster and Warre's; they appear to have been pawned on 15th, 18th, and 20th Oct.—on 16th Oct. we sold the bankrupts a parcel of goods amounting to 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which I have since seen one piece at Muncaster and Warre's, which appears to have been pawned</p>

               <p>two days afterwards, the 18th—the defendants said they made the purchases for making umbrellas; they were umbrella silks, and were not fit for any other purpose—I should say we found somewhere about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of our property at Muncaster and Warre's, not made up into umbrellas, but exactly in the state in which it was sold by us—I was appointed trade assignee—I went over part of the bankrupts' stock at their shop, and saw what the character of it was—there were no umbrella silks at all there—a great portion of the stock was umbrella and parasol sticks and some little silk, a small portion of cane, and a variety of ivory and bone mountings, which were not very saleable—the value of the stock was certainly considerably less than that put on it by the bankrupts—I have not seen all the stock, but I went through all the items—I stand a creditor for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and odd.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">casting it up</hi>)—that is the total of goods sold to them; that, deducting for the debt, leaves 5,336<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid—in Sept. last they took goods of us to the amount of 507<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they paid us in that month 845<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which we realised—in the month of Oct. they had about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of goods of us; and they paid us 282<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not on 23rd Sept call at their place for the express purpose of telling them that I had got some silks which I thought would suit them, and request them to give me a look down; that was about the time they asked me to send them some goods on approbation—I might have said I had goods that would suit them—I cannot say whether I called on them on 23rd Sept., but I was there within a few days of the 25th—I should say I did not request them to come and see the goods, I will not swear positively—when they asked me to send the goods to their buyer, I might have said I had goods to suit them—I swear I did not go and invite them to purchase goods, because the account was heavier than we wished—it is the course of our trade to go and ask for orders—Lyons did not come to me to see the goods, he sent his man, Fry, on the 25th, saying their buyer was in London, and he wished the goods sent down to look at them—I have not seen the buyer from Man<lb></lb>chester, or ascertained that he came for the goods—I swear that the order for the goods which Lyons' man came to see, was not in consequence of my going there to tell them I had some goods which I thought would suit them—it is usual for umbrella manufacturers to order their goods in the autumn for the spring season—I did not engage in the autumn of 1851, to supply the defendants with goods for the spring season to the amount of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they gave me an order for them, and I booked it—I have no minute of it here, but to the best of my recollection it must have been shortly after their stock<lb></lb>taking in Aug.—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of goods which Lyons came to our ware-house and looked out, was not a portion of the goods for which I had booked the order for 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know that, because when we book an order we put by the goods for the parties; we did not put by these goods, they were goods which we had not agreed to furnish, but which we had booked on order for—Lyons said the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of goods would do to come out of his order, but we declined to furnish him with them—I should say it was then for the first time that we asked for security—Lyons told me he thought I was quite right to have security, and he would endeavour to get it for me—I saw him again three or four times—the security was to be for about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with reference to the general account—he told me on two different occasions he</p>

               <p>had not found security; he did not come and tell me so, I went there—he came and told me if we insisted on security he must stop business, that was a day or two before the assignment—when they came to say they were insolvent, we sent for our attorney—I went to their warehouse that day, 4th Nov.—Lyons and Woolf went from our house, and I went with one of their clerks to take account of their stock—an attorney did not go with us, or join us there—there was no one there with the exception of our own servants, that I know of—Ellis and Everington's man was not there, he came in about an hour or an hour and a half after—I had not sent for him—our solicitor had sent a circular round by post, I think, to call a meeting for the next morning "I did not send a young man for Mr. Pawson—nobody made offers to pur<lb></lb>chase the stock while I was there—I saw Ellis's buyer there, I suppose he came to purchase goods in the usual way of business—I do not think Mr. Pawson's buyer was there; but I do not know him when I see him—I told the bankrupts it was quite right they should execute an assignment for the benefit of the creditors, which was done at Mr. Pawson's—the assignment was not there already cut and dried—I saw it executed; I was one of the trustees—I went from the bankrupts' warehouse to Mr. Pawson's, and met there Mr. Pawson and Mr. Howell, who is one of Messrs. Ellis's partners—I did not ask the bankrupts to sign a declaration of insolvency—Mr. Paw<lb></lb>son, Mr. Howell, the two bankrupts, myself, I think Mr. Partington, Mr. Parker, and one or two others werepresent—I cannot say whether the bank<lb></lb>rupts asked leave then to send for their attorney; they asked at our place, and our solicitor said he did not think there was any occasion for it at the present moment—they did not ask permission to do so, they asked if they should send for him—the bankrupts' stock was sold for 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being 45 per cent, less than the invoice price—the bankrupts never lent us money, they gave us a check for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off their account, which I said if they wished back again they should have; I will undertake to say it was not to pay wages—I cannot say, without referring, whether we returned it—the goods sent on 2nd Sept. were on approbation—I made out an invoice of them, and sent it with the goods; this is the approbation-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is an account of all goods which go out of the place—we have no other book for booking goods sold—when they are returned they go into this book, if they are sold; and if they are not sold they go in here, and afterwards they are copied or posted into another—the purpose of keeping this book is to enter goods sent out on approbation—it is not a book I have been referring to before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time of the day was this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I can recollect about 4 o'clock—it was certainly in the afternoon—I should certainly say I had not been to Lyons' house the day before—I never was there but about three times in my life—I never but once in my life solicited him to purchase goods—that was some months before he failed—it might have been in July, August, or September—the goods he purchased on 16th Oct. were three pieces at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., three pieces at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one piece at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., they were all 24 inches—there were seven rolls—I recollect that he came to me without my having invited him before to come and see the goods—he came and asked for my brother first, and then offered to buy the goods.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I recollect going to Messrs. Foot's about Phillips's buyer—both the defendants were present when I was sent—they told me to say that Phillips's buyer, mentioning his name, Mr. Main-price, was there, waiting to look at the goods—I went and told them so, and brought back the goods—Mr. Mainprice was not there when I went with the message, he had just left—he came back again next afternoon—I believe a portion of the goods were sold to him—here is a sale entered—I cannot say what became of the rest, or whether I entered them under the head of "loan"—I do not recollect the date when Mr. Mainprice came—the transaction would not be entered on that day, because the goods would have to be made up—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Stansfield here stated that no account appeared in the books between 30th Aug. and 7th Oct.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Mainprice had been at Messrs. Woolf and Lyons' before they sent you to get the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. Foot paid for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> that was to take the goods from his place to our house—Mr. Mainprice did not come and select the goods that day—he did the next day—I did not see him go over the different articles and select them—I was not present—a portion of the goods I saw afterwards manufactured into parasols for Mr. Mainprice—they would not be entered in the books to the debit of Mr. Phillips until they had been manufactured—I should say these are the items; here is, "Oct. 15th, goods, 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" and "Oct. 18th, 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—Phillips is debited with them—they were manufactured between the time the goods were selected, and the time when they are debited in the books—Woolf and Lyons had about forty or fifty workwomen—a few of them worked on the premises—I should say they had that number in Sept. and Oct., and about twenty in Nov.—the manufacture of parasols was going on during Sept. and Oct., and goods were being sent out to the different customers—from the commencement of Oct. to the 30th, manu<lb></lb>factured goods were sent to Ellis and Everington to the amount of about 216<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—looking at the ledger I find that manufactured goods were sent out almost daily during Oct. up to the 30th—there were about 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth</p>

               <p>of goods sent out to Ellis and Everington in Sept.—in Sept and Oct. they were continually supplying Messrs. Pawson with goods, but not in Nov.—I remember on 22nd Oct. Pawson's people sending in a quantity of goods—I went and told them that they had sent about a hundred pieces more than were ordered, and requested them to take them back—they were not silks, they were printed goods—they said they would send on in the course of the day, and they did so—they did not take them back.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

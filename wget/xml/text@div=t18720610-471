                  </hi>. I was formerly in the service of Madame Riel, as house<lb></lb>maid, and had been so for about four months before this matter occurred—the household consisted of Madame Riel, her daughter, the prisoner, and myself; the prisoner was the cook; she came into Madame Riel's service in January last—on Easter Sunday, 31st March, Mademoiselle Riel went to Paris—the prisoner cannot speak English; I was able to understand her, by motions—she told me that she was going to leave on 21st April—on Saturday, 6th April, Madame Riel dined at home; a friend dined with her in the evening—after dinner the food was placed in the pantry on the ground floor, on the same floor as the dining-room and parlour—Madame kept the key of that pantry—after I had placed the food there, Madame locked the door and put the key in her pocket—it was her practice always to keep that door locked—there was an iron safe in that pantry—before dinner was over, on this Saturday, Madame told me to go down and tell the prisoner to come up, she wanted to speak to her—I told her, and she went up and saw Madame—afterwards, the prisoner had her dinner and went out; I think that was at 9 o'clock—she did not tell me what she went out for—she returned just before 12 o'clock—at that time Madame's friend had gone, and she had gone to bed; I was sitting up in the kitchen for the prisoner—she let herself in with the area key—she brought in with her some articles of food for the next day—shortly after she came in, she and I went up stairs to bed—my bedroom was on the third floor, and she occupied a separate room on the same floor; Madame's bedroom was the front room on the second floor, and on the first floor was the drawing-room and Mademoiselle Riel's bedroom—Madame, the pri<lb></lb>soner, and I were the only three persons who slept in the house that night—on the following morning, Sunday, the 7th, I got up at 7.30, and went down stairs into the kitchen; the prisoner was there—about 8 o'clock I went up to Madame's bedroom, to take up her breakfast, some tea and bread and butter—she was in bed—I lighted the fire in her bedroom and afterwards went down stairs—the prisoner and I were together in the</p>

               <p>kitchen—I went up stairs again about 9.30, I did not go into Madame's room then, not until about 10 o'clock—I went in once or twice—at two or three minutes past 11 o'clock her bell rang, I went up to her bedroom, and she was then up and dressed—she told me that I might do her bedroom—I proceeded to do it—Madame put on her bonnet and cloak, and said she was going out into the Green Park for a quarter of an hour, and she told me if a lady called I was to tell her she would be back in a quarter of an hour—she then went down stairs—she had a little dog which followed after her—I should think it was about 11.20 when she went down stairs—I remained up stairs doing the room; I went down just before 12 o'clock—while I was up stairs nothing attracted my attention, I never heard the least noise—when I came down to the ground floor I saw the dog in the hall—I went down into the kitchen, and on my way down I called out twice "Marguerite, where are you?"—the prisoner made me no answer—I went into the kitchen and saw the prisoner at the kitchen window; out-side; the window opens on to the front area—it is about a yard or more from the floor; it is a very narrow area—the area railings in the street are boarded up—when I got into the kitchen Marguerite told me that Madame came and shut the door as she was out in the area, and locked it and took the key, and had gone out—Marguerite then came into the kitchen with some coals—she came in through the window, and brought some coals with her—I looked at the kitchen door leading to the area and to the coal cellar, it was locked and the key taken away—I said to the prisoner "Madame has not taken the dog," she made no answer—Madame's regular breakfast time was 1 o'clock, at 8 o'clock it was merely tea and bread and butter—the prisoner said that Madame had ordered no breakfast, and she had gone out—about 12.20 or 12.25 the prisoner wished me to go and fetch some beer—I told her I could not get it before 1 o'clock, because on the Sunday the publicans were shut up—she made no answer to that—she asked me once or twice before 1 o'clock to fetch the beer, and I told her I could not get it before 1 o'clock—about 1.5 or 1.10 she got the jug and gave it to me—I went up stairs, and she followed after me to see whether the publican's was open—I went out at the front street door—the prisoner looked out at the door in the direction of the public-house, and said "The public-house is open"—it is on the same side of the way as No. 13, next door but one, in the direction of Piccadilly—I went there and got the beer—I was absent five minutes—when I got back to the door it was shut—I rang the bell, and could get no answer; I rang and knocked again two or three times—I should think I was outside a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—the prisoner then came to the door and let me in—I asked her why she did not come to answer the door—she said she thought it was Madame—I said if I had not been in the way she would have had to answer the door if Madame came to the door—she said nothing to that—we then went into the kitchen and had some beer—it was usual for me to fetch the beer on Sunday, I have to go for the beer—I did not notice anything in the kitchen, everything was in its place—I did not notice any difference from when I went out—I then went up stairs to dress—the prisoner followed me soon after to her bedroom—she remained up<lb></lb>stairs a long time, an hour and a half—I went to the kitchen stairs, and called out and asked her what she was doing, why did not she come down?—she made no answer, she came down soon after—I asked her what she stayed up stairs so long for—she made no answer—in the afternoon, after she had come down stairs, a French lady, a friend of Madame</p>

               <p>Riel's called; it was not the same lady who was there on the Saturday—she came before 4 o'clock; she came to dinner—she remained till about 7 o'clock in Madame's bedroom, and then left—the prisoner had not prepared anything for dinner, only the soup—I did not notice anything about the prisoner in the afternoon—she said that she should go out to church—there was a pair of gloves lying on the table, I picked them up, and said "Madame has not taken her gloves," but there was no answer—that was in the course of the afternoon—the gloves were lying on the kitchen table—when she said she should go to church I told her she had better not go out, because Madame would be very angry if she came in and wanted anything—she did not say anything to that—she had changed her dress before that—I should think she changed it between 5 and 6 o'clock; it must have been about 6 o'clock, I think—she changed it in the pantry; that is a pantry on the same floor as the kitchen, in the basement, next to the kitchen—she put on a green dress, and hung up the old one in the kitchen—the green dress was a satin cloth—I afterwards saw it before the Magis<lb></lb>trate—after she changed her dress she and I went up into the dining-room, and sat down—later in the evening she went out, about 8 o'clock, or a few minutes past 8 o'clock—she then had on a waterproof, the green satin cloth dress, and a bonnet—she said she was going to church, and she should not be late, she should be in by 10 o'clock—I did not let her out; I sat in the kitchen—I afterwards heard the door go—I don't know whether she took any luggage; I can't say—I did not see anything wrapped up anywhere—I know that her box was left behind—she did not return—I remained up till 12 o'clock, and then went to bed—next morning (Monday) I got up just after 6 o'clock—I went into Madame's bedroom on the second floor on my way down—Madame was not there, and everything in the room was undis<lb></lb>turbed—I did not go into the kitchen—I went into the drawing-room to move the things, and saw Mademoiselle coming—she returned from Paris that morning with a lady friend of hers—I expected her to return that morning; Madame had told me—the prisoner knew it—when Mademoiselle came I told her what had occurred—she was alarmed, and sent me out to get assistance, and shortly afterwards the police came—I did not see Mademoiselle open the pantry; it was opened while I had gone for assistance—Mademoiselle had a duplicate key of that pantry; Madame had one key and Mademoiselle the other—I afterwards went into the pantry, and saw Madame lying there—I did not disturb the body at all—Dr. Wadham came—I saw the body afterwards carried out into the back parlour.</p>

I had lived with Madame Riel five months—she had three servants during that time, one previous to the prisoner, no other—the other servant remained three weeks—No. 13, is in the narrow part of Park Lane, as you enter from Piccadilly—there are houses on each side, and opposite, and a public-house next door but one—the area of the houses is very narrow—the kitchen window looks out on the area, the cellar is under the pavement of the street—the area railings were boarded up before I went to live there—I remember the prisoner coming into Madame Riel's service—I was almost constantly with her when not engaged up stairs—I had not remarked anything particular, or out of the common, in her manner and demeanour, we got on pretty well together—Madame Riel was a lady of rather quick temper, a passionate person—she never used strong language I could not understand, she would speak very loud—she usually spoke in French—I do not understand French—her</p>

               <p>manner and gestures were that of an angry and passionate person—I have not been present when she has addressed the prisoner in an angry and passionate manner—it always appeared as if they were angry words, French people always do speak so in talking—the pre<lb></lb>vious cook left because she did not understand French cooking—she did not complain of Madame's temper—the prisoner has complained of it to me, and I have complained to the prisoner that Madame was of very bad temper—I did not complain without supposing that I had a cause—Madame was sometimes ill-tempered to me, very seldom—it was without a cause—men occasionally came to work at the house—I think Madame was once out of temper with a workman; I think that was on the Thursday previous to this occurrence, or about that time; she seemed very angry on that occasion—I only knew the man by sight, he was a painter, working for a Mr. Bernard—I do not know where Bernard's place of business is—I have seen the man since, he came to work on the Monday morning that Madame was found dead, he was going to paint the front of the house; I have seen him since this, I think he has called once since—I do not know where he is to be found, or anything about him—I don't understand French at all, whatever words passed between Madame and the prisoner I did not know what they were—the prisoner speaks very little English, only a few words—we com<lb></lb>municated more by motions, by signs—I can't say whether on more than one occasion Madame and the prisoner had high words, I could not tell what was said—it appeared to me that Madame and the prisoner on more than one occasion had high words together; Madame was rather of a sus<lb></lb>picious disposition; she suspected things that never occurred, and blamed persons unjustly in consequence, myself amongst others—when she was excited she was in the habit of gesticulating a good deal, she would throw her head up, and throw out her hands—I have observed that that was a habit of hers—she was rather short—I never noticed that when so excited, and throwing her head back, the muscles of the throat were very plainly discernible, and the working of them—on the Sunday morning I had been with the prisoner for some time in the kitchen, before I went up to Madame—I should think I had been with her twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour before Madame rang her bell; we breakfasted together—there was very little conversation between us—I did not notice anything remarkable in her manner or demeanour—Madame was not in the habit of going out very fre<lb></lb>quently in the morning—she would go out sometimes—I did not know that she was going out that morning, before she said she was going to the Green Park, and so far as I knew, the prisoner could not know it—I often fetched the beer on the week days as well as on the Sunday, not always at the same time, sometimes earlier and sometimes later, according to the exigencies of the house—the lady visitor came about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—about 6.30 in the evening I was in the dining-room with the prisoner—the lady was in the house at that time, she was sitting in Madame's bedroom, up stairs—I did not see the prisoner writing a letter in the course of that afternoon or evening, nor during any part of that day; I never saw her writing—the post-office is just at the corner, not very far off—the prisoner was out until nearly 12 o'clock on the Saturday night—there used to be a cord in the kitchen, over the hot-plate—I very seldom went into the prisoner's bedroom—I never saw any cord in her room—I don't remember whether she was out on the Friday night at all, she might have gone out, she could not have been out for half an hour without my knowing it—I</p>

I am the daughter of the late Madame Riel—I lived with her at 13, Park Lane—the household consisted of my mother, myself, and two servants, Eliza Watts and the prisoner—I can't say exactly the date when the prisoner came into our service, but about two months before my mother's death—about 20th March I gave her notice to leave; it was one week's notice, like in France—she said she wanted to stay the month, or to be paid at once—on 31st March I left London for Paris—on 8th April, I returned to London, and arrived in Park Lane about 7 o'clock in the morning—Eliza Watts opened the door to me—I asked her whether the prisoner was there, she said No, she had gone out the night before, and that probably she would return on that morning—she told me that mamma had said on the Sunday morning, at 11.30, that she was going out to the Green Park for a walk, and that since that time she had not seen her, and that she was in very much trouble about her—I fancied perhaps that she had gone to meet me some part of the way—I sent Eliza Watts out at once to fetch somebody to me—while she was out, I looked about the house to see whether mamma had left a letter for me—I first went up stairs, then I came down to the kitchen and the coal cellar, and at last the small place called the pantry, on the same floor as the dining-room; that pantry was always kept locked—there were two keys to it, one mamma had, and I had one—I had my key with me that morning; I always had it—I found the pantry door locked; I opened it with my key—there was an iron safe kept in that pantry; there were two keys to that, one I had, and one my mother had—she was also in the habit of carrying other keys about with her, on a keyring that she always wore—when I went to Paris, I took my key of the pantry with me; I always had it with me, and I had also a bunch of keys on a ring—when I opened the pantry door, the first thing I saw was the cloak of my mother, I lifted the cloak up, and then I saw mamma—I saw that the safe was open—I became very much alarmed, and ran out into the street, and then I recollected that 'Dr. Wadham was living next door, and I went to him—I had not disturbed anything in the pantry; I did nothing else but lift the cloak up, I did not move the body at all—Dr. Wadham did not come back to the house with me, but he came a very little time after—when I returned to the house, I heard that the police were there, but I did not go to see—I was sent for into the kitchen for the purpose of seeing whether I knew a dress that was there—I did know it; it was the prisoner's dress; it was shown to me by one of the police constables; it was a maroon brown dress, which the pri<lb></lb>soner used to wear—before I left for Paris, I had given my mother some bank notes, about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know whether they were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; I did not look at them; I gave them to her either on the Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, I can't say the exact day—my mother kept her money in the safe—I had got the bank notes from Lord Lucan, perhaps only ten minutes before I gave them to my mother—after the body was removed to another room, I saw that the safe was open, and there was no money in it—there was no key in the safe, there remained in it a little box containing jewels, some gloves and shares—my mother always carried a porte-monnaie—she sometimes wore rings, not generally—on Friday, 12th April, I again went to Paris to accompany the body over there—whilst I was in Paris, I was shown by the French police a porte-monnaie and also some other things—the little box that contained the jewels was locked, I had one key of it; I am not certain whether I did not have both of them, there were two keys;</p>

I have been in England several times, not consecutively, sometimes six months at a. time—I have been here since the war, September—I have resided in Park Lane since January, at the time of the war last year, since January, 1871—I am not residing there now—my servant, Eliza Watts, resides there, and I go there sometimes—it is always the custom in France to give a week's notice only, to domestic servants—I know that perfectly well—the prisoner was willing to go when we gave her notice, if we paid her her wages—she was paid her wages by the month, and sometimes she asked for Borne money in advance—she required a month's wages or a month's notice—this pantry or closet contained a safe, in which the jewel-box was kept—I was in the habit of wearing valuable jewels and keeping them in that box—the box is not here—my mamma always carried the porte-monnaie about with her—she sometimes wore a ring of value—I do not know whether she sometimes carried a ring or rings in her porte<lb></lb>monnaie—I received the notes either on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, I cannot say which, before I left for Paris—I gave them to my mamma imme<lb></lb>diately—she was in the house when I received them—I do not know whether she had a key of the jewel-box, she had it sometimes and that is the reason I state that I do not know whether at that time she had it—I cannot tell whether I had two keys at Paris, I did not pay attention to that—if my mamma had the key she would carry it on the ring on which she kept her keys—I have not looked, and for that reason I cannot say how many keys of the jewel-box I have now—I have several keys coming from the same warehouse, and I cannot say—one key I always had, and have now, but whether I have a second one I do not know; both keys resemble each other—I cannot say whether I had both keys, because mamma was in the habit very often to return me the other key back—I cannot say whether I have more than one key to that box now, but if I saw the box I could tell you by trying the keys—since my return from Paris I have not seen the keys which my mamma used to carry.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 194). On Monday morning, 8th April, about 7.45, I was on duty in Park Lane—I was called to No. 13—I saw a lady standing at the door, a friend of Madlle. Kiel's, who was with her—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what was said to me I went into a room at the end of the passage leading from the front door, and saw the dead body of a woman, dressed—her face was on the floor, her knees on the ground, and her legs sticking upwards so that you could see the soles of her boots—her head was against an iron safe fixed to the wall in one corner of the room, in the right-hand corner as you went in—I did not measure the room, but it was about 12 ft. by 6 ft., I believe—the feet were towards the door, as you went in—I removed the body about 18 in., as near as I can say, from the safe out towards the middle of the room—a rope was once round the neck, with a slip noose under the left cheek, the end round the neck was not loose, but there was about 6 ft. to spare, and the other part was hanging loose over the body, and the other end was twisted twice round the handle of the door of the safe, which was I suppose about a foot from the floor—the rope was tight round the neck, and was just put slack round the handle of the door, it would slip round—it was loose round the handle—I was there when Dr. Wadham came—I was sent to the station for the Inspector, and Sergeant Butcher came—we then, by Dr. Wadham's direction, removed the body into the back parlour—I had lifted the face off the ground before that to recog<lb></lb>nise who it was, and found it was the lady of the house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer C</hi>). On 8th April I went to 13, Park Lane, and found Dr. Wadham there—I saw Peek remove the body into the small parlour—when I got there the rope was still on the body—I have heard what Peek has said, it is correct—she was lying on her face, her feet were straight up, and you could see the bottoms of her boots plainly—I examined the pocket of her dress, there was nothing in it—she had one gold ring set with a diamond on this finger of her left hand—I do not mean two rings, she had not a wedding-ring on—I found some false hair in a bonnet, which is here, lying between her and the sofa—I took the rope off the neck, and then examined the safe, which was open, and there was a little iron cash<lb></lb>box in it—for a cash-box it was a large one, but it was a solid iron box and heavy—it would be a very heavy cash-box, but they call it a cash-box—it was about 8 in. or 10 in. long, and about as wide as this book—when I lifted it up I found it heavy—a key was produced—I did not find it there, but at the time I was there it was found—Madlle. Kiel had it—there were also in the safe besides the little box some papers, French bonds, or some<lb></lb>thing like that, but no money, only the jewellery—that was in the small box—after the little box had been found Madlle. Riel produced a key which opened it, and some jewels were found in it—the key of the safe was found—I do not know whether Madlle. Riel had one—she produced a key of the pantry—there was no key but her, s—I was not present when the bunch of keys was found.</p>

Riel—I did not see the body again till the day of the inquest—I do not know whether the ring was on then; she was then in the coffin, I have never seen the ring since—I saw the jewel box, I did not take an inventory of its contents—the minute it was discovered I went away to make enquiries out of the house, and left Hambling and another sergeant in charge of the case—I do not think it is the practice of the police in such cases to take a note of what is found, but only of property which is missing, things which are right in the house we should leave there—no inventory was taken of the jewel-case, to my knowledge—I can form no idea of the value of the jewellery—there was no sign of a struggle in the pantry—every thing was in perfect order, as far as I could judge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On Monday morning, 8th April, about 9 o'clock, I went to 13, Park Lane—the body of Madame Riel had then been removed into the back parlour—I proceeded to make a search, and on a shelf in the pantry, near the safe, found some false hair and a bonnet—I examined the hair and found in it some cinders and small chips of wood, and a small fish bone—there was a fire-place in the pantry, but the fire had not been lighted—some small pieces of charred paper were in the grate, paper which had been burnt and thrown into the fire-place—I found a hair-pin on the mat in the coal cellar, and another on the stairs leading to the kitchen—when I got into the kitchen, I saw the kitchen door which leads to the coal-cellar, it was locked, and there was no key there; it locks from the inside, you cannot lock it from the outside—I unscrewed the lock, removed it, and opened the door; it leads into the area or the cellar—when I got into the cellar, I found a hair-pin on the mat—I was present when a lady's comb was picked up by Inspector Pay—the mat is just at the entrance of the coal-cellar—there is a dust<lb></lb>hole there and cinders and chips—it is the ordinary dust-hole of the house—the chips were small pieces of wood, such as arise from wood, they were not burnt—I afterwards on that day received from the witness Watts, this 1 pair of gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and I found in the kitchen this dress hang<lb></lb>ing up—I examined it at the time; it was not torn, it was in good repair, but I found on the left-hand sleeve a spot which I believe to be blood—it was just inside the cuff, other spots have been cut out by Dr. Letheby but I observed them—I examined the safe, and saw a railway bond found</p>

               <p>there—I searched to see if I could find any keys, but found none at that time—I was examined as a witness at the Police Court—after the first day's examination, Inspector Druscovitch made a communication to me in consequence of which I went to the pantry where the body was found, and behind a beer-barrel, on a shelf, I found eight keys on one ring and two on another—I find that one of them fits the iron safe, and two are latch-keys of the street door—I also on that occasion tried four keys in the presence of Inspector Pay, which were produced by the French police, and found that one was the key of the pantry, in which the body was found, and the other, the key of the kitchen leading from the coal<lb></lb>cellar, the door from which I removed the lock; another was the key of a sort of press up stairs, where Madlle. Riel kept her dresses, and which I found locked, and the fourth key fits the padlock on the prisoner's box—on the Monday morning I went to the prisoner's box, in her room on the third floor; it is an ordinary servant's box—I forced it open, and found several pieces of her dresses and boots and paper, and a book with her name in it—there was no rope in her box, or in her room—I saw no appearance of any struggle in the kitchen or pantry—the prisoner's box was not packed at all, her things were lying in different parts of the room, such as under linen, and dresses were hanging on the door.</p>

I am an Inspector of Municipal Police at Paris—the first information that I had about this matter was from Mr. Druscovitch, the English Inspector of Police, who came over to Paris—on 11th April, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to 192, Rue St. Denis, where Bouillion was then living—that was the first time—I then saw Madame Bouillion—I took possession of this letter and envelope, the letter was in a little box which women use to put their thimble and cotton in, and the box was on a table in the lodging—I went there again the same evening, and then saw both Mr. and Madame Bouillion, and had a very long conversation with them—I did not take possession of anything then—at 7 o'clock next morning I went there again, and saw Mr. Bouillion, and arrested him, and an hour afterwards I went there again and took possession of a green dress—I did not take it, I received it from Madame Bouillion, and also a cloak and jacket, brown colour, maroon—I at once examined the pocket of the green dress, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is it—Mr. Massey, the Police Magistrate in Paris, bad it after me, and it was made up into a parcel, sealed up, and given to the Embassy—in the pocket of that green dress I found this porte<lb></lb>monnaie and a book, or <hi rend="italic">livret</hi>—the name of Margnerite Dixblanc is in the book—the porte-monnaie contained these eight English bank notes, I marked them—I at first thought they were all 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, but when we came before the Magistrate who had the matter in hand, there was one of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; however, I don't even know it now very well—I marked the notes and took them to Mr. Massey, the Instruction Magistrate—in the same porte<lb></lb>monnaie I found an English pawn ticket, here it is, attached to the bank notes, with my mark—I also found this ring in the porte-monnaie—upon this I took Madame Bouillion into custody—that was on the 12th, in the morning, the same day as Mr. Bouillion—he had been arrested an hour before her—it was on account of finding these things that I arrested Madame Bouillion an hour afterwards—when I took her she handed me this little box, containing 125 francs in English gold, three sovereigns, and four half-sovereigns.</p>

               <p>at that moment seized her by the throat, and held her very tight; that she cried out "Let me go" and she did so; that her mistress said "Now, you must leave my house at once;" to which the prisoner said "Very well, I will leave, provided you pay me what you owe me;" that Madame Riel replied "No, you shall remain your time, and leave afterwards, "saying "Where could you go to when you leave this house, you are going on the streets, like others;" and that the prisoner then replied "Perhaps you have walked the streets longer than I have," and high words again recommenced: it was to the same effect as before; that then the prisoner gave her a sudden, quick blow on the throat; that Madame Riel fell down on the ground from this, and that she looked at her and found she was dead; on seeing that she was dead she dragged her to a room adjoining; I think, from what she said, it was the coal-cellar, and then I don't know what happened, but she wanted to carry it up stairs; that she took a rope from the kitchen, which she placed round her waist, dragging her up to the staircase; that, having arrived there she could not get it up the stairs, because the body was doubling in two, and then she took off the cord from the waist and placed it round the neck, and that in this manner she pulled it up stairs, and put it into another room, which she shut—that was all that passed—she illustrated by my neck how she did it—she showed me to my own neck how she had given the blow—that was how she showed it, twice (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>) a blow twice—I then took her to the Prefecture—before arriving there I searched her, and took from her three French newspapers, and a French bank-note of 25 francs—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the newspapers, there are two <hi rend="italic">Petite Presse,</hi> and one <hi rend="italic">Petite Journal.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am Fellow of a College, and Physician to St. Georges' Hospital—I live at 12, Park Lane—on 8th April, about 8 a.m., I was called to No. 13, Park Lane—I did not know Madame Riel at all—when I got there, I went into the pantry and found her body on the floor; her face and knees were on the ground and her legs so turned up, that you saw the heels and soles of her boots; her hands were placed under her body, a rope was placed round her neck, the knot of it was under her left jaw—the rest of the rope was twisted twice round the knob of the door of an iron safe, and the remainder was thrown over the deceased's body—it was just strained from the door to the neck, but not tight, no force; not enough to have resisted any effort to disentangle it, besides which the free end of the rope was loose—the room was perfectly undisturbed; there was no carpet in it, and not the slightest appearance of a struggle, as far as I could see—I waited, leaving things exactly as I found them till Butcher arrived, after which the body was removed by him into the next room, a parlour that is there—I first examined the body before it was removed, and took the rope off—I made no detailed examination, but merely to look for marks of injury on the body—when it was moved into the parlour, I examined it again; no change whatever could have happened between the first examination and the second—I made a few notes, it is scarcely necessary to look at them—I found the dress open in front, it buttoned in front, but no buttons were torn off; I looked to see—I found a reddish brown mark nearly all round the throat, with a reddish brown depression where the knot had been under the left jaw—there was a bruise over the right eye, and an abrasion under each eye—the eyes and mouth were firmly closed; I tried them—the right-hand was firmly closed, and the nail of the ring finger, the third finger, was broken back; there was no ring on that finger—a slight scratch under the right knee was the only other injury I observed—the third finger nail being bent back resulted, I suppose, from some struggle which she had made—I did not draw any conclusion from that—the dress was not torn, only open</p>

               <p>in front—I saw no other signs of tearing—the pocket was examined in my presence, and nothing found in it—a little blood was coming from the mouth, very slight—the body was quite stiff and cold—it is very difficult to say how long a body has been dead, but there was nothing incompatible with the notion that she had been dead twenty hours—the safe was examined in my presence, and something was found in it, but no money—this exami<lb></lb>nation was on Monday, and I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Wednesday, and found a bruise on the left-cheek bone, which I had not observed on the Monday; I ought to say on the angle of the lower jaw on the left side—two front teeth of the upper jaw were rather loose—I also found some slight scratches on the nose, which I had not observed before, and in the neighbourhood of the mark of the cord there were some reddish scratches, which I had not observed—the mark on the lower jaw was higher than the place where the rope was on the Monday; the rope was below the jaw—the membranes of the brain were healthy, but gorged with blood—the brain was healthy, except that it was greatly congested—the lungs were gorged with blood, but perfectly healthy, except a little <hi rend="italic">empyema</hi> at the tips—that is a little rupture of the air cells, nearly everybody has it—the valves of the heart were perfect, and the structure of the heart was perfectly healthy, but it was nearly empty of blood because the blood was so unusually fluid that it ran out when the heart was removed from the body—the liver and kidneys were both gorged with blood, but healthy—the lungs, liver, and all the important parts of the body were gorged with blood—I naturally examined the throat and wind pipe, and found two fractures of the <hi rend="italic">hyoid</hi> bone, also a fracture of the <hi rend="italic">hyoid</hi> cartilage, and one of the <hi rend="italic">cracoid</hi> cartilage, just at the left of the medium line—I should also say that there was blood poured out under the mucous membrane of the right vocal cord—that is what we use in articulation—these different bones and cartilages which I have described, are parts of the structure of the throat through which the voice passes, and the blood—they showed that some very great violence must have been applied to the throat—it comes to this, that the architecture, the frame of the throat was broken; the fracture of the frame-work of the throat, and the blood which I saw gorging the different organs, made me consider that she had been killed either by strangulation or throttling, the effect of which would be to gorge all those organs—strangulation would cause that flow of blood to the internal organs—the destruction of the throat which I have described would be the result of throttling, and throttling would also produce the gorging of the various organs which I have described—the mark by the neck, and the injuries to the neck, might have been made during life or after death, but the blood poured out under the mucous membrane of the vocal chord, showed that some injury must have been done during life—it might not have been aggravated afterwards, it must have been before death—in the healthy patient, when strangulation takes place, it would so interfere with the system that congestion would ensue—I do not think congestion would increase after life had ceased—I think the pouring out of the blood under the vocal chord must have been done during life; I should think it was probably done by the violence which caused the breaking of the part—in my opinion a single blow on the jaw would not produce the injuries—it requires very great force and strength to produce the breaking of the frame<lb></lb>work of the neck which I saw—I have made experiments two or three times to see whether it could be done, and it requires very great force indeed—a</p>

               <p>rope might possibly have caused the two fractures of the <hi rend="italic">hyoid</hi> bone, but not the others, for the mark of the rope was above those injuries—there was only one mark; such a mark could be made by a rope after death, but this was so very regular that I should hardly think it could be made by a rope dragging a body—still there was only one mark—looking at all the circum<lb></lb>stances, my opinion is that she either died from being strangled or from being throttled; strangling with a rope or throttling with your hand—whether one or the other the gorging of the vessels would equally have taken place.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POWELL</hi>. It is consistent with my examination that the deceased might have been killed by grasping the throat, by throttling—cases have occurred where the throat has been grasped so suddenly and strongly that the windpipe was closed, and death followed almost imme<lb></lb>diately—I discovered on the Wednesday a fracture of the <hi rend="italic">hyoid</hi> bone, and an injury to the cartilage of the throat—the fracture of the bone was not caused by the rope after death—my opinion is that the injury to the car<lb></lb>tilage was caused during life, it might have been caused by a powerful grasp of the hand—I give it as my opinion that a blow could not have caused the injury to the cartilage—I have met with no case on record, and I think it would be an accident happening in prize fights, if possible, but it is matter of opinion—in the experiments I have made since I have fractured the bone—that was after the death of the subject—I succeeded in producing similar injuries to the cartilage, twelve or fourteen hours after death—I can give no opinion whether injuries to the bone and cartilage might be more easily produced during life than after death—I am not aware that injuries to the structure of the bone may be produced much more easily on the living than on the dead subject—I am aware that the German surgeons have experi<lb></lb>mented largely in that way, and Mr. Casper says that he has failed to break this thing—he was a very high authority—he is not living—his works are a very high authority—he says that he never could produce those injuries after death—it is very improbable that the injuries I discovered on this body might have been produced by a blow given under what for medical purposes might be called favourable circumstances—I have not made the experiment, and therefore I cannot say that it is impossible.</p>

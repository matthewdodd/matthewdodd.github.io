               <p>Q. On the 12th of August last, were you at home or not - No, I went out at five o'clock in the morning. I left my wife and two children in the house. My wife returned home first.</p>
               <p>MRS. WEST. Q. What time did you go out - A.On the 10th of August, I went out about ten o'clock. I locked the door, and took the key with me. I left nobody in the house. I fastened the window with a wooden-pin. I returned home about half after three in the afternoon, I found the window broken, and set wide open. It was a little sash that goes back, sliding in a groove.</p>
               <p>Q. In what respect was it broken - A. One of the panes were broken. I secured the window that morning with a wooden-pin.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the pin prevent the window from being opened - A. Yes, without the pane had been broken, and they had taken out the peg. The window was on the ground floor. The window was large enough to let a man get in.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into your house, did you miss any of your property - A.As soon as I got into the door, I found my house robbed, my property was gone, and my box standing open; that box was in my bed-room; there was no lock to the box; there was gone out of the box, two coats, a pair of breeches, a waistcoat, and a black pair of stockings; they were my husband's property. I saw all these things in the morning before I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them again - A. When they took the prisoner. I have got them here. I saw them on the Wednesday, after the 12th of August, at Isleworth, in

            . I buy and sell old clothes at Brentford. On Tuesday, the 12th of August, about the middle of the day, the prisoner brought me these clothes. He said his name was Davis, his brother was gone in the Militia, he said in the 6th division. His brother was a brick maker, and lived at Cooling. He had left him these clothes. He offered them for sale. I gave him 20 s. in silver for them.</p>

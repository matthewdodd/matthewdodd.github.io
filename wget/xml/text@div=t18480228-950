                  </hi> I am a widow. I was a casual pauper at Lamboth Workhouse—on 9th Feb. the deceased Jane Jackson, was assistant nurse of the probationary ward—a person named Clark and the prisoner came there that evening as casual; poor, and soon after two others, named Sutton and Buckley, came in—Buckley led the deceased into a water-closet, and while there I saw her through the doorway give her a bottle from her pocket, con<lb></lb>taining about half-a-quartern of gin—I do not know whether she drank it—the door was then closed—the deceased then came out of the water-closet. went to the side of the bed, and asked Clark and the prisoner to remove from it—Clark said she would have no words, but would go into the passage and eat her supper, which was a pice of dry bread—the prisoner still sat on the bed, and made no reply—the deceased said, "I never can get up to my bed for one or the other"—the prisoner said, "While there are favourites here, I shall come here too," and Clark said, "Good God! no one can speak here but you"—Buckley said, "It is quite enough for the nurse to speak"—Buckley got into bed, and made use of very base and coarse language to the prisoner, but she did not say anything till she repeated it several times—she</p>

               <p>called her a wh—, and was very aggravating—the prisoner then jumped up to strike her—the deceased was siting on the side of her bed, and in going to rise to save the blow, she caught it on the front of her head, at the top—she said, "Oh, my God, my head!" and place her hands to her head directly—she gradually got worse, and fainted, and was sick, and died a little after twelve—she never rallied, but kept complaining of her head—she ceased to speak not more than twenty minutes after receiving the blow—she was in good health before this.</p>

                  </hi> I am a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company. On 9th Feb., about ten o'clock, I was called to the deceased at Lambeth Workhouse—I found her perfectly insensible—she gradually got worse, and died—I afterwards made an examination—I discovered nothing externally, but on opening the membranes of the brain, I found a vast extravasation of blood on the left side of the brain, down the base of the brain—after clearing away the blood, I found a hard substance at the termination of the carotid artery—I cut it, and found it to be part of a <hi rend="italic">sac</hi>—I passed my finger into a larger opening, and found it to be a dilated artery or an <hi rend="italic">aneurism</hi>—I should think it had been of some standing—I attribute the death to the bursting of that <hi rend="italic">sac</hi>—any concussion might cause it to burst, or any sudden exertion or jumping forward—a blow such as has been described might produce it.</p>

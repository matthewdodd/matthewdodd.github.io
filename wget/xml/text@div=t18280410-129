I was appointed to watch them, and at a quarter-past two o'clock, on the 4th of April, I saw two men standing in the door-way of one of the houses - I was about thirty yards off - I went up to them; the other man went backwards through the house, and the prisoner came against me in the door-way, and tried to shove me backwards off the plank - his thumb was bleeding, and I saw the pipe close by him was cut near to the ceiling; I took hold of him, and said he was the King's prisoner, and I would take him to Mr. Nurse; he said if I did not let him go, he would split my head against the joists: I said I would not; I then asked where his partner went; he said he had no partner; I said "He is gone with the lead;" he said, "Well, come, and I will assist you to find him;" I went with him; he tried to shove me down two or three times - he then called the other man, who came back three or four yards, and made a signal, and the prisoner tried to shove me down again; I held him fast, and he kicked me violently; he gave me a very bad shin - he threw me down, but I still kept fast hold of him, and took him to the master's house; I knocked, and a person came; we secured him - I had seen the pipe all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100077"></xptr>right a quarter of an hour before; and the man who went off had a bundle of something under his arm - the watchhousekeeper took two knives from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the prisoner cut anything? A. No; I seized him, and he struggled; the prisoner did tell me he went into the house for a particular purpose.</p>

             sworn. I am in the employ of Mr. Smith; I only know that the prisoner was in the employ of Mr. Smith, he absconded and the coats were missing. On the 5th of September, between one and two o'clock, in St. John-street, opposite Charterhouse-lane, I saw the prisoner, I asked him what made him go away in the manner he did, I signified to him that I should take him in custody, he ran away, I dismounted my horse and gave it in charge to a man and ran after him, he ran into a little court where there was no throughfare, I took him and gave him to a constable.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Did you ever find these great coats again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Moore) Can you take upon you to value the great coats. - A. I can safely say the four great coats are worth ten guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear that the four great coats are worth more than forty shillings. - A. I can.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw this fight from beginning to end—I saw them struggling, and the prosecutor fell—it was a very weighty fall, it shook the place—I saw blood when he got up—I saw the prisoner all that time—the prosecutor was in his naked skin, and he ran and put his arms round my son-in-law, Connor—I was with the prisoner the whole time, and she had no chopper or weapon from first to last—she was alongside of me when the fight, at 11 o'clock, commenced; and if she had anything in her hand I must have seen it—she never left me, and I was the last one that went into the room—she never went into the house till she was pushed in—a little fellow came behind her and hit her with a shovel on the head.</p>

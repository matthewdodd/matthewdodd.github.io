               <p>Was you at Mr. M'Cartney's in the evening of the 7th of June last? - Yes, all day, except the morning, when I was carrying out bread. I was there when the mob came, which was at about a quarter after nine o'clock. I saw about fifteen come, some were armed, some not, some had pieces of iron crows, and some logs of wood in their hands. My master pacified them by giving them money and liquor, and they went away. My fellow-servant and I lay down; but we did not pull our clothes off, because I thought they would return again; they did come again in about ten minutes. I heard about half a dozen brick-bats thrown in; we got up directly, and went into the shop; about fifteen of the mob were there; and there were I suppose above thirty in the house.</p>
               <p>What time did they break in? - About half after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner? - Yes, very well, by serving the house he lodged at with bread. He was one who broke into the house.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing the mob did? - They asked for the books. Some of them said there were no goods in the house; they ran up stairs; I went after them; I followed one man up stairs, who was a brewer's servant. I saw him knock all the windows out and the frames, and throw the wainscoting out at the window; as he threw it out he cried out, take care below. After I saw that I came down and stood at the door; my fellow servant said to me, come here; I said what for He said the young man who lodged at Mrs. Mason's was pulling the wainscoting down; I then looked and saw the prisoner helping some of the mob to pull down the partition between the parlour and the shop, and they threw it out at the window, and it was set on fire by the rest of the mob at the door, and burnt.</p>

               <p>How long did the mob continue in the house? - I suppose an hour and a quarter.</p>
               <p>In what state did they leave the house? - The house was pulled all to pieces; the partition up stairs and below was pulled down and the window frames were beat out in the fore part or the house, but not in the back part of it; and some of the floor at the upper part of the house was taken out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was never in the house in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you saw the prisoner there? - Yes, I am sure; I know him well.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you saw him do these things you have described? - I am positive.</p>

               <p>Was you at your master's in the evening of the 7th of June last? - I was there from five in the evening during the whole night. There was a very great mob there. The first that I saw came about six in the evening.</p>
               <p>What number might they consist of? - An hundred I dare say. They came and said they were resolved to pull down my master's house; they did not do any thing at that time. They came again about six hours after, and threatened to pull down the house. My master and some others gave them a good deal of money, and they distributed a quart of brandy amongst them to quench the mob. They went away for about a quarter of an hour, and they then came back again; we thought there was to be no disturbance that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280137"></xptr> night; that was about a quarter after nine o'clock. We heard the mob at a distance huzzaing; we got up and went down stairs. One of them threw a brick-bat through the window, afterwards they rushed in.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one who rushed in? - I did not see him rush in; I was in the inside of the house when they broke in; I went up stairs with them and saw them begin breaking the windows; then I came down stairs and went out of the house for about a quarter of an hour. When I came in again, I saw them plundering and pulling down a wooden partition, which goes between the shop and a small parlour.</p>
               <p>In what condition was the house when the mob first came? - Most of the furniture had been removed.</p>
               <p>In what condition was the wainscoting and window frames? - All were whole then. The wainscoting and partitions were mostly pulled down by the mob, but they were not all pulled down. The floors were all whole except the two-pair-of-stairs floor, some of that was taken up.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you went up stairs that evening to bed was your fellow-servant with you? - My fellow-servant,

               <p>I have lived in this house a great many years.</p>
               <p>In what state was the house on the 7th of June last? - Being apprehensive from the continual threats of the mob, that my house must be pulled down that night, I had a number of the first people in the neighbourhood to assist me in order to entertain the mob, and by money and liquor to entice them to go away. I was backwards in my own yard when the mob first came; my friends advised me to keep backward and they would perhaps be able to persuade the mob to desist</p>
               <p>I was asking you in what state the house was when you left it? - I left it about twenty minutes after nine o'clock. The house was whole; I had got best part of my furniture away, but there was a great deal left.</p>
               <p>When did you return to your house? - About eleven o'clock that night, I believe; then all the front of the house and the shop windows were all beat to pieces, and the windows and frames were gone; the partition between the parlour and the shop was every bit carried away; the kitchen window was all broke but the frame was left; the fore door was a glass door, all the glass was broke to pieces; the shutter, which secured it before, was taken out; the skeleton of the door was left; the stair-case was all broke to pieces; the dining room up one pair of stairs was quite demolished; the wainscoting was all gone, and nothing but the bare walls all round; the frames and glass of the two windows in front were knocked out and the per between broken in such a manner that I was afraid the house would fall down; the stair-case, between the first and second pair of stairs, had all the railing taken down; about a third part of the flooring of the second floor was taken away; and the closets were all torn to pieces and thrown out; they took the furniture of the house to the corner of the street and there burned it; the neighbours persuaded them to carry it there, or they would in all probability have set fire to the whole street.</p>

               <p>Are you an house-keeper there? - We have a lease between two of us; I saw him again at about a quarter or half past ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him then? - In the back kitchen in the house where he lodges, sitting upon a settle in the corner.</p>
               <p>Was you in the house then? - I was; that is a publick house where I generally go and have a pint or two of beer in the evening; I went there, and smoaked a pipe before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>What time did you go there? - I went there about a quarter after eight; he was then standing at the door. I went into the house, and ordered the beer for my wife, to be sent to my own house; I went back after that, and drank a pint myself, and went for a pipe about ten o'clock, as I generally do.</p>
               <p>At what time did you go back? - At ten, or a quarter after; I saw him then in the back kitchen, sitting upon a settle.</p>
               <p>That is all you know of it? - I know no further; I have drank many a pint of beer with him, and always found him to be sober and solid.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What is the distance from the house where you saw the prisoner to the house which was pulled down? - It may be a quarter of a mile or rather better.</p>
               <p>You say it was on Wednesday? - I am not positive, but I think it was Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Do you know that it was the night on which Mr. M'Cartney's house was destroyed? - It was that very night I am sure, for I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280139"></xptr> heard it in a house I went into. The mob were either then about the house or had been</p>
               <p>Was it the first or the second time of your being in the house that you heard that? - It was the second time.</p>
               <p>Did you hear it upon your first coming in or afterwards? - I cannot say that.</p>

He always behaved with good nature and honestly and has been punctual to his payments; he always behaved good naturedly in the neighbourhood. I saw him come in to supper; I drawed him a pint of beer; I did not regard whether he was in or out till he came into the back place and sat down; he said he was afraid Mr. M'Cartney was in a bad way. I said, I hope he has got his effects off; I hope you have not been there? He said he looked in. I said, I hope you did not do any thing. He said no, he did not. I asked him what they were doing? He said they were talking about books. This young man (

               <p>To Stone. Do you know this witness? - No further than drinking with him on the Monday following. I never was in his company before.</p>
               <p>What conversation passed about the prisoner? - None at all that I know of; we were drinking our ale together; he sai d he hoped I would not hurt him; we were fetched from home by two men to the artillery ground. I said I could not help it. I must speak the truth, that was all that passed.</p>

               <p>What did he want with you? - He wanted me to speak in the prisoner's behalf, to favour him.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that you saw the prisoner at your master's, but that he was there more as a spectator than any thing else? - I will not be positive whether I might not say so; after we drank three or four pots of ale together, it might get into my head; but I do not think I did say such a word.</p>
               <p>How much did you drink? - Four pots of very strong ale; he kept me there five or six hours.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go away? - Because when one pot was out he said we will have another; I said I did not care.</p>
               <p>Who paid for it. Did you pay your share? - I did; but I had it returned back again by the landlady, Mrs. Mason.</p>

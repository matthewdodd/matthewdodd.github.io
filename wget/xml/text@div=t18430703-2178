                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in Sydney-place, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road. In consequence of some communication from Kate, on the 28th of June, I missed some cotton handkerchiefs from my door—I went with him into the Commercial-road, between nine and ten o'clock at night, and found the two prisoners there—I went up to them and put my hand under Davis's shawl, and under her arm she had three of the handkerchiefs I had lost—these are them—they had been pinned to a piece of carpet outside my door—Ryan had this other handkerchief on her neck, under her shawl—this is another of the handkerchiefs I missed that evening—they had all been pinned together—they begged hard to be forgiven—I said I should do nothing of the kind—Ryan endeavoured to throw this handkerchief away, and, in my catching it, Davis escaped—I gave an alarm, and she was stopped by Kate—they were both delivered to the constable—there was a new collar found on Davis, but it was not mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in North-street, Limehouse, and am errand-boy to Mr. Pound, whose shop is next door to the prosecutor's. On the 28th of June, about nine or half-past nine o'clock, I saw the two prisoners looking at the goods, outside the prosecutor's door—they appeared to be acquainted, and were talking together—I saw some handkerchiefs pinned to a piece of carpet—I saw Ryan unpin them, double them up, and walk away with them—she had a shawl on—she walked away with the handkerchiefs, and kept them in front of her—Davis was looking at a piece of net which hung close by the handkerchiefs, and in two or three minutes after Ryan walked off with the handkerchiefs Davis went away—I told the lad, outside, what I had seen—he went in and told Mr. Stevenson—I went with Mr. Stevenson to the Commer<lb></lb>cial-road, and saw the handkerchiefs found as he has described.</p>

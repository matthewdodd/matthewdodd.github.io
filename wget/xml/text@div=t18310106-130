On the 13th of December I had been out on business, and returned at six o'clock in the evening; I looked at my window, and it was as I had left it when I went out - I went in, took tea, and returned; I saw the window had been cut from the bottom, a piece taken out of the glass, and,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060067"></xptr>at least, eighty silk handkerchiefs were gone, which had been in a bundle in my window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You cannot tell exactly when these were safe? A. I saw them in the morning when they were put into the window, and they were safe at six o'clock when I returned, I believe - whether the whole of them were there, I do not know.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live with Mr. Maslin, in the Westminster-road. I have twenty silk handkerchiefs, pawned by the prisoner, on the 13th of December, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening - he came in a violent hurry, went into the box, produced nineteen handkerchiefs and his coat, and wanted 3l. - I could not lend it; he then pulled out a separate one, and I said,"With that, I can make it 3l." - he said," Very well," but wished to have a separate duplicate for that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you known him before? A. Yes; as pawning things for many years - I knew his name, but he had removed; he came the next morning, and redeemed the coat, by paying 15s. - he gave the address Agnes-place; we went there, but could not find him - I knew where his sister lived; I went there and they said it was No. 14, Agnes-place - I could not find him there; it was an uninhabited house - my employer has known his family fifteen or twenty years; I have been there seven or eight years, and known him by coming to the shop.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and found on him four duplicates, all for handkerchiefs, and I believe one is in the name of Davis.</p>
               <p>JOHN BENTLEY. These are part of my handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many are there which you swear to? A. Eight; I have seen some more in the possession of a pawnbroker - I believe they are all British; some of them have my private mark on them; here is one with it on.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a mark in use in the shops in London? A. Certainly it is, though not in common - this I can positively swear is my own mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you swear it was a common mark? A. I considered you alluded to the letter of the mark, but this I positively swear is my own mark.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had purchased twenty-nine of the handkerchiefs of a hawker at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, on the 13th of December, at the Equestrian coffee-house, near the Surrey theatre.</p>

            . I am a commission-agent and merchant. I was at Mr. Wardle's coffee-shop, next to the Surrey theatre, on the evening of Monday, the 13th of December - I saw the prisoner there; I have known him from a boy - in the course of the evening I saw a tall, stout man come in with a bundle of handkerchiefs for sale; he offered them to me, but I did not buy them - he then offered them to the prisoner; he then offered a price for the whole of them, and, I believe, purchased them - when they had agreed, they went out together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What coffee-house was this? A. It is called Johnson's, but a man named Wardle keeps it - the prisoner is a general dealer, and an accoutrement-maker, and latterly he has transacted business for himself; when I knew his working place it was in the Borough-road - I do not know whether he is a master or a journeyman; he has lived at No. 31, Bond-street, Borough-road, within twelve months - he has been a general dealer since I have known him; I cannot say whether I ever knew him to buy silk handkerchiefs before - the parcel was opened, but I cannot say whether these are any of the handkerchiefs.</p>

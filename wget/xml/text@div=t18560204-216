                  </hi>. I am a ship's joiner, and live at No. 5, St. John-street, West Ham. On Saturday, 12th Jan., about 7 o'clock in the evening, I was with two friends, at a public house, in Addle-hill, and saw the prisoner standing in front of the bar—she came in to sell some oranges, I bought some, and we went into the tap room—after some time she came in there, and wanted me to buy some more oranges, and I bought all she had, about two dozen or more—I afterwards came out into the passage, and had a dispute with the landlord—while I was talking to him, the prisoner came into the passage, put her hand into my left hand trowsers pocket, and took my purse, containing eight sovereigns, and which I had seen safe ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before—I caught hold of her hand before she took it out, and held it till I took her into the taproom; but she must have slipped the purse from one hand to the other—I did not see her do it—I told my friend, John Manning, to go for a policeman, but before he went I saw the prisoner drop the purse under the table from her lap, and three sovereigns came out of it—I picked one up, and Manning picked up the other two, and went for a policeman—my other friend was named Alfred—he left before this happened—while I was picking up the sovereigns the prisoner threw a glass at my head, and struck me with a pewter pot—a policeman came, and took her in charge—I had picked the purse up from under the table, it then contained five sovereigns, a policeman took it from me at the station—that was the first public house I had been to that day, and I had only had two or three glasses of ale.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You asked me to leave my basket behind the bar, and go with you, before the money was lost. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Nothing of the sort—I asked you to drink in front of the bar—I left my friend talking to you outside the bar—I never put my hand near you till I took your hand from my pocket—I bought the oranges to get rid of you, because I did not want your company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a joiner, of No. 4, Plaistow-grove East, West Ham—I was with Hosking in front of the bar, and asked the prisoner how she sold her oranges—Hosking went into the taproom, and I stopped there till I had drank my glass of ale—I did not ask the prisoner to follow me into the taproom with her oranges—words arose between Hosking and the landlord in the passage when I was at the bar—I went out to them—I passed between them, told them I would have no disturbance, and tried to put an end to it—the prisoner was in the passage, and Hosking cried out that he was robbed—he had hold of her hand, and dragged her into the taproom—I followed them, and one sat down on one side of the table, and the other on the other; the prisoner dropped a purse, and three sovereigns dropped from it—Hosking did not continue to hold her when they sat on each side of the table—I told him that the prisoner had dropped the money, he picked up one sovereign, and I picked up two—while he was doing so the prisoner threw a tumbler, which struck him on the head, then hit him on the head with 4 pint pot, and then threw it at him—she had no appearance of being in liquor—Hosking was not in liquor, I think he had had about two glasses of ale—he had come from Doctors' Commons.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 341). I was called to the public house, and the prisoner was given into my charge for robbing Hosking of his purse, and eight sovereigns—she said, "I have not got it"—she was sober—Hos<lb></lb>king</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went into the public house, the landlord knew me; these gentlemen forced me to drink with them; they forced me to have more, and I said that if I had anything more, I would have a glass of shrub; they gave me several glasses of shrub, and the last thing they gave me was something like ginger brandy; I said that I wanted to get home; the prosecutor asked me to go into the tap room with him, and said that he and his friend would buy the oranges between them; I said that it was too late, as I wanted to get home to my mother; I went into the tap room, and the prosecutor was challenging the landlord to fight; he pulled his purse out and dropped it on the ground; the landlord said, "Never mind, it will be found when they sweep up the place;" I went out, and he said that I had robbed him; he pulled me about in the tap room, and because I would not allow him to do it, I hit him with a glass, and a pint pot.</p>

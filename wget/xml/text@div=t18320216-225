            . I am a constable. I was with Fowler and the others; we got to Cook's house at near ten o'clock- Mr. Cook had been sent to Newgate that morning - I saw Tingey, Mrs. Cook, and several others playing at dominoes - Fowler and lugram went up stairs; I stood at the door, to prevent the prisoners leaving the room - I found a large clasp knife in Tingey's pocket: there had been a rope round the hamper, which was cut; I saw part of the cord, which was found near where the shoes were lost.</p>

            . I am a constable of Edmonton. On Wednesday evening Game informed me of his loss - I apprehended Walton on Sunday morning, about four o'clock, in bed, at his mother's, at Edmonton; I told him it was for stealing shoes from Game's cart - he denied the charge, and said it was the first he had heard of it: on the day after the robbery I went to Cook's house, to search for more property, and in the room where the shoes were found I found this paper laying by the side of the bed - it has been apparently burnt with a candle and dropped down.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Wednesday evening, the 25th of January, about half-past seven o'clock, Game's cart passed me in Claremont-street, in the upper part of Edmonton, about a quarter of a mile on this side the Angel, and about twenty minutes to eight Walton and Tingey passed me; they were going after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160083"></xptr>the cart, walking very fast in the same direction - I saw Walton again about ten minutes past nine o'clock, coming in the same direction as before; I did not see that he had any thing with him - he was against Mr. Brooks', going down the lane towards his own home; I saw Camp, and told him.</p>
               <p>Walton's Defence. I was not in the house that night.</p>
               <p>Tingey's Defence. I went to Cook's, but took nothing with me.</p>
               <p>Cook's Defence. When I go out on business I cannot say who goes into my place - there are no locks on any of the doors.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH FORSTER. There is no lock on the street door- I did not observe the bed-room doors.</p>

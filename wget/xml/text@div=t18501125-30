                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 68). On 5th Nov. I was at Lampton, in the parish of Heston—about ten minutes to eight o'clock I saw a fire towards Hounslow—I went, and found a rick burning in Mr. Doubleday's brickfield—just as I got there I met Mary Ann Bowles—I received information, and went with sergeant Scotney, about half-past ten at night, to Lampton, where the prisoners lived near each other—we took them to the brickfield, took their shoes with us, and made impressions by the side of some foot-marks there—they corresponded in size, nails, and tips—these are the shoes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the nails agreed in the difference between the rows—I did not count them—we compared a great many marks of two persons coming and two going away—we traced them right up to the hedge against which the rick was built—they came from the Lampton-road to the middle of the field, and then one went one way and one the other—there were marks from the road to the rick, and from the rick to the road again of two pairs of shoes—a bonfire was burning in that field when I got there; it was 150 yards or more from the straw rick—it did not make a great deal of light—it was made of wood and brushwood—there was no effigy or Guy Fawkes—there was a little wind, but not much—it blew from the rick to the bonfire, or partly so—a good many persons were round the bonfire when I got there, and a good many had got up to the rick, which was nearly all on fire, it was so dry—the side next to the bonfire was the least burnt.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother at Mr. Double<lb></lb>day's brickfield. I know the prisoners—on 5th Nov., about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw them together about 200 yards from the straw rick, going from Hounslow towards Lampton—that would take them towards the stack—I passed them on the road—I was going into Hounslow, which is about 240 yards further on—when I came back, I went into my master's gate, which is about fifty yards from the rick, and saw them again nearer to the stack going towards Hounslow—they were opposite my master's gate—I came out again in about three minutes, and</p>

               <p>saw them going towards Lampton, nearer to the rick than to my master's gate—there was no fire then—I first saw the fire about ten minutes after eight—I saw Purdy, and told him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far was the bonfire from the stack? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 253 yards I have heard—I had not been looking at the fire long before I saw the prisoners—the fire broke out before the prisoners came up to the rick—the first time I saw them was at the bonfire—I was in the lane—the bonfire was not alight then—it was known that there was to be a bonfire; my brothers and other children made it, and we thought of setting fire to it at eight o'clock—we had some lucifers at the end of the field where the bonfire was—I was not there when it was lighted—my brothers and sister wanted some lucifers, but mother would not let us have them—she had none—the fire was made of sticks and stinging-nettles—the boys did not carry about lighted sticks—I know the prisoners—they spoke to me—they used to work in the field—they only spoke to me the first time I saw them—they said, "Well, Mary, when are you going to set light to the bonfire?"—I said when my brothers came back I thought they would light it—they were at Hounslow with a Guy Fawkes—there were 6ome fireworks at the bonfire; the wind blew towards it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, T</hi> 18). I went to the fire with a lantern—I traced foot-marks from a gap in the hedge 140 yards from the rick, right up to it—in consequence of what Bowles said, I went to London's house, and found him in bed—I said I wanted him, on suspicion of setting fire to Mr. Doubleday's rick of straw—he said he knew nothing about it—I took his shoes, and compared them with the foot-marks—they agreed in I should say twenty instances.</p>

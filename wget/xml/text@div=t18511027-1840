On Monday, 13th Oct., I received a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note for wages—I changed the note, and bought a new pair of trowsers, a jacket, and waistcoat—I put the money into a tobacco-box in my trowsers pocket—I know the prisoner—I met with him, and we went to a public-house, and had some beer, which I paid for—I had some money besides the sovereigns which were in the box—I wanted to go to Egham, but the prisoner took hold of my arm, and took me to Staines—we went to a beer-house there, and had more beer—the prisoner paid for some, and I paid for the rest—I opened my tobacco-box, and took out one sovereign, which I changed with the landlord—the prisoner was then by—I then had three sovereigns left in the tobacco-box, they were wrapped in blue paper—I then went to sleep in the tap-room—the prisoner was there when I went to sleep—I was not sober nor drunk—just before I went to sleep I felt the prisoner put his hand into my pocket—I was not sound asleep, and I felt his hand in my pocket—when I awoke up my tobacco-box was gone—I slept at the house—the prisoner took me up to bed—I was rather drunk by that time—the prisoner would not sleep in the same room that I did—I saw him the next morning—I spoke to him about my money—he said he had not got it, and should not give it me—the young woman at the public-house gave me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. just as the prisoner was coming down-stairs—he did not see her.</p>

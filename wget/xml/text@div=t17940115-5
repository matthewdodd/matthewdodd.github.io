            Had he made any promise to him?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150012"></xptr> - No, none at all; immediately after I swore to my property, he made a consession, voluntary without any thing being said to him, to induce him to confess.</p>

               <p>Court to Anslett. What did he confess? - He confessed that he stood and watched, while James Westbrook and William Alexander went and took them. The next day Westbrook was taken up, and he was admitted as an evidence; he has been here to-day, and has gone back, and he will be here to-morrow by nine o'clock, if you will be so kind as to put the trial off till then.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to go back? - He could not find any body here, and so he went back.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen the geese? - I see them the day before, I see them locked up every night; the last thing I do, is to see that they are in the stable, and I lock them up; I am certain they were locked up that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any other account to the Jury of knowing your geese, than that of the size? - They are geese, a sort that I have bought for many years, I deal in them; and I know by the largeness of them, that they are my property. I have no other reason but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of the others? - When William Arslett bad confessed, and I had told him, that it was a great loss to me, he told me, there were four of them turned out somewhere; in about ten days afterwards, I found them within a mile from where he directed me. I was ten days looking after them, before I found them.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you find them from Sunbury? - About a mile, they were on the common.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed these geese on the 21st, what time of the day was it? - About six the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lets the geese out of this stable? - I went down in the morning to seed them, and when I went down, there were but two left out of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. What relation are you to the prisoner, John Arslett? - His father and my grandfather came of two women, but one father.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been no dispute between that family, and your family? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And the only way you have to know your property, is by their being large? - That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. No mark whatever? - I don't know that they ever had any mark; I buy them and seed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know your own geese from any other geese that might be passing? - I should know them.</p>

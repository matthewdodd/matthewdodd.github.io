                  </hi>. I am clerk to Robert Perrot Ward and another, trading under the firm of Ward and Clay, Tarnish and colour-makers, City-road—I know Bayliff—two or three days before 30th July he brought this card to me (<hi rend="italic">This was a business card of John Cocks, carpenter, plasterer, &amp;c. of</hi> 98, <hi rend="italic">London-wall, and on the back was written</hi>, "Please send by bearer samples of your palest oak and copal, about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.")—I assisted in getting up the samples, and gave them to him—we said nothing about charging then—I was asked at the Mansion House whether we charged for samples, and I said, "No"—young Mr. Ward was there at the time the prisoner came—he asked the prisoner if he was a painter at Mr. Cocks', and he said, "Yes"—on 30th July he come again, and brought this order (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "London-wall, July 30th, 1864. Messrs. Ward and Clay. Gentlemen, Please deliver five gallons pale oak varnish, and three gallons copal, as samples The bearer can bring the sample of the oak. Please not to send later than Monday morning. For Mr. Cocks, G. Dove.")—the prisoner took away the three gallons of copal, and signed this receipt (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi>—"July 30th, 1864. Received from Ward and Clay, I can and 3 gallons of fine copal varnish. For Mr. John Cocks, London-wall, George Lee.")—he signed that in my presence—we sent the other varnish to Mr. Cocks, and it was sent back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that the first time you had seen him, when he came with that card? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my knowledge it was—he was there some seven or ten minutes the first time—Mr. Ward, jun. has died since that time—he was not examined before the magistrate—he died last Sunday—our foreman was present when the prisoner came, but he did not see enough of him to recognise him—he is not here—it must have been between the hours of 10 and 2 that the prisoner came—it was not a par<lb></lb>ticularly busy time with us—the foreman was present on the second occasion that he came—I see fifteen or twenty people in our place perhaps during the day, some of them are strangers whom I have never seen before—the next time I saw the prisoner was at the Mansion House—the policeman came and told me a man was in custody, and I was wanted to see if I could recognise him—I believe he said he was in custody "on a varnish job"—I saw the prisoner in the cells—he was brought out with Crutchley—I did not say he was the man then—I knew Crutchley so well, and was so staggered at seeing him there, that I did not observe Bayliff then, but when I saw him in the dock at the Mansion House, I knew him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house-decorator, at 98, London-wall, and am the son of Mr. John Cocks—this is one of our business cards—I do not recognise the writing at the back as of any one in in our employ—it is per<lb></lb>fectly strange to me—we have no person in our employment named Dove—on 30th July, five gallons of varnish were brought to us from Ward and Clay—we knew nothing about it, and sent it back—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

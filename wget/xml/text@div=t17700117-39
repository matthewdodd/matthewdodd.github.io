It was a very clear moon-light night. I gave a halloo, and said, Who is there? Upon which I saw a tall man come out of the parlour window; and after him, a short man: I could distinguish all their dress. Then I went down stairs; I found a tinder-box and some matches, and a candle and half, which they in their confusion had left. There was a night-cart passed by; I desired the man to call the watch; as soon as the watch came, I described the men and their dress. The tall man had a blue surtout coat on, and was about six feet high, and had short hair, without a hat; and the other, a little, thick-set man, with a lightish coat, a red waistcoat, and a hat with a dragoon cock. He told me, he could not stay with me, but would send another, which he did. About four o'clock, that watchman came and told me, of such men being taken at an ale house in Goswell-street, and if I went to the watch-house, I might see them. I went to St. Luke's watch-house; there were the two prisoners, dressed as I had described. I knew them to be the men, as soon as I saw them. I charged the watchmen with them. They were searched, and a large knife was found on Broadhurst, and a broken one on Hart. In the morning about ten o'clock, I went with them to Justice Girdler's. I went to bed that night about half an hour after eleven o'clock; my shutters were fast then. I found the sash broke by forcing it up in the morning. I am positive the prisoners are the same men that I saw come out of my house, by all the circumstances that my eyes could see.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The man with the night-cart came to my box, and desired me to make haste to this gentleman's house: I went; the gentleman told me his house was broke open; I found the shutter hanging by one hinge. He desired I would go and get some watchmen to sit up in his house. I went, and sent him that belonged to that beat. Then I and another watchman went to his house, and asked if he could tell what sort of men they were. He described them as he has now. In going my rounds, I went in at the Wind-mill, in Goswell-street, for a penny-worth of purl; there I saw the two prisoners sitting. I left my brother watchman there, while I went to the watch-house for assistance. I brought three more watchmen, and we took and brought them to the watch-house. Broadhurst was ready to faint as we were carrying them along. When we had got them to the watch-house, I went and told the prosecutor. He came and saw them. There were several people in the watch-house. The constable gave the prisoners all the fair-play he could. The prosecutor pitched upon Broadhurst to be one; (he is the tall one) he said he could swear more clear to the short one, than the other. Then he pitched upon Hart, for the other. We found a large knife upon Broadhurst.</p>

            . I am the constable. We had got the two prisoners, and then sent for the prosecutor. He said, Had that tall man a hat on when he came to the watch-house? I said, Yes. He said he had a great deal of time to see the small man more than he had the other, as he took more time to get away. He could swear to Har, he said, more than to the other. I had told the prisoners, I would shew them all the fair-play I could. I let other people stand with them, that the prosecutor might pick them out; he pitched on both the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoners behave?</p>
               <p>Hunter. They behaved very quiet. Broadhurst cried very much. One of them told me, they lived at Low-laton, and had been walking all night; and after that, the other said, they had been at the Coach-and-horses, in Aldersgate-street, all night, and were turned out from there. (The tinder-box, flint, steel, and matches produced in court.)</p>

               <p>That evening I had been out into the country, and came back again about eight o'clock, into White-cross-street: it rained very hard. This other man (meaning Hart) had been drinking at a public-house where I had been; I over-took him; he said to me, where are you going? I said, Home. Said he, I believe you go my way, will you go in and have a pint of beer? We went into the Pyed-bull, in Gloucester-court, White-cross-street; we had, I believe, two or three pots of beer, and each of us half a sheep's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170038"></xptr> head. It rained prodigious hard. He said he lodged in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell-green; and I lodged in Mutton-lane. It was past eleven o'clock; we set out, and went into the Coach-and-horses, in Aldersgate-street, and staid there some time. Going for Swan-alley to go home, I said to a watchman, I should be obliged to him, to tell us of any body that was up. He said, go to the Wind-mill. We went there, and had a pot of half and half; I desired the watchman to comein and drink. I took off my hat, and hung it by the fire to dry. When the watchman came in, seeing me without a hat, he thought we were the thieves, by the description he had had. After that there came in more watchmen, and took us to the watch-house. I have been in the Train of Artillery, and have a shilling a day allowed me from the Board of Ordnance.</p>

I was locked out of my lodging in Aylesbury-street, at the Bell and Star. A Whitfieldite keeps it, and I was sure I could not get in; it rained so powerfully hard, that kept me longer than I chose; they generally lock up between eleven and twelve. I thought to get into a house to drink a pint of beer. I went to the Coach-and-Horses; there was a troublesome man there, whom they turned out; then we went to White-cross-street. We saw the watchman; he directed us to the Windmill in Goswell-street. This man hung his hat up by the fire; and they were talking about a house being broke; and they thought he was one, because he was without his hat, and they took us to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Powell. I am a watchman. We took the prisoners at the Windmill. They called at my stand in the morning between three and four o'clock, and asked where a house was open. I told them the Windmill. They said if I would come there I should drink with them. When I came there Broadhurst began talking about a watchman that belonged to us, that was tried last sessions. (See No. 18. in last Session Paper). I said there is a house broke to night. He said, Where? I told him. He said he knew it very well, he had been out all night, and had come by it about one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. I never said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Powell. He did say so. I sent them to the Coach-and-Horses, there they staid till almost four.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they both hats on when they went by your stand?</p>
               <p>Powell. I believe they had; they had been at the Coach-and-horses from one o'clock till almost four. After the other watchman described them, as he said the gentleman had to him, he desired me to go and take them up, and he would go and describe them to the gentleman, to see whether he knew them. I staid there till he came again with the constable and others, and we took them in charge. Broadhurst seemed ready to faint, and said he could hardly speak for himself. We staid he was only taken upon suspicion, and if he was innocent he would be cleared. When we came to the watch-house, one was put to one part, and the other to another; there were other people there. Mr. Hunter said he would give them all the liberty he could. When the gentleman came, he asked if the tall man had a hat on? We told him he had. He looked at the little one, and said, I am clearer to the little one than to the great one.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did it rain betwixt one and two when you was at the window?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, it was clear and no rain at all. It had rained between eleven and twelve, and when I came out at four it did not rain.</p>
               <p>Q. to Teesner. Did it rain at the time the night-cart came by?</p>
               <p>Teesner. No, it did not. It was some time cloudy, and some time very clear: it rained in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether it rained between the hour two and the time the men were taken?</p>
               <p>Teesner. I cannot tell whether it did or not.</p>
               <p>Powell. It was clear between one and two.</p>

On the fourth day, soon after the sale commenced, we missed two volumes out of three, of a book entitled the "Catholic." I spoke of it during the sale, and a bookseller standing by said, he had observed a person with two volumes in his hand. The prisoner had bought a lot a few minutes before, and paid one shilling and sixpence for it. The bookseller went out to look for the person of whom he spoke; but his search was fruitless. On the 2nd of December, the prisoner bought three lots, amounting to one pound fourteen shillings, and he paid four shillings deposit. When the sale of that day was concluded, I was going out, and was stopped by two booksellers, who were bringing the prisoner up to the sale room, on the first floor; they accused him of having taken a book, and put it into his pocket. I requested him to produce it; at first, he denied having taken it; but, at last, produced it, saying, he purchased it at the sale. I remarked that that could not be the case, as the book was the "Polite Philosopher," and had not been sold. He was then taken to Bow-street, and I gave him in charge of an officer, and requested he might be searched immediately; to this he made so violent a resistance, that it required four persons to do it. In the scuffle he put some duplicates into his mouth, which he chewed to pieces. They succeeded in taking seven from him, which contained twelve books, my property.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and was at the sale of Barrington's books. I saw the prisoner there on the 30th of November, with two volumes of the "Catholic," in his hand, which were subsequently missed. Seeing him in the shop on the 2nd of December, and knowing him, I watched him; I saw him take a book, which afterwards turned out to be the "Police Philosopher," from a shelf in the shop, and put it into his pocket; upon that I acquainted Mr. Saunders; and after denying his having the book, the prisoner gave it up. He was then taken to Bow-street, and searched; it required four or five to search him. He put a ticket in his mouth, which he chewed, and spit out, and rubbed it with his foot on the ground.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and produce six books, and four books; the six pledged for four shillings, on the 29th of November, by the prisoner; I am certain as to his person, for I have known him before. On the 1st of December, he pledged the other four, for two shillings and sixpence. I was about to say I thought he was mad at the time he pledged the books. He stated, he was going to start on Blackheath on the Sunday following, to walk a thousand miles in a week; he said, he had come from Rochester that morning in three hours. He also said, he had discovered what he called, a pinnacle process, which would turn fresh beer into sour, and sour into fresh. He pledged the books in his own name.</p>

            . I was apprentice to the bankrupt. Mr. Barrington, and by that means became acquainted with the books on the premises. I also assisted in making out the Catalogue for Mr. Saunders. I look at the books produced by the pawnbroker, and know them by my own marks to have been on the premises.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews, as counsel for the prisoner, called a great number of witnesses to establish the prisoner's insanity; and from their evidence, it appeared that the unfortunate man had on several occasions combined drugs together to make a panacea as he supposed for all diseases, and had taken them himself, and had most materially injured his constitution, by producing a discharge of bloody urine. He had also appeared to have conceived himself contractor for the illumination of Charlton House; he was engaged by Government to go from the Downs to Brest, and burn the French Fleet. That he could turn old boots and shoes into new, and various other extravagancies, which clearly proved that at times, he laboured under mental derangement.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, in summing up the evidence in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060026"></xptr>formed the Jury, that if they were convinced that the prisoner laboured under periodical fits of insanity, their attention would be turned to the question, whether at the time he committed the offence with which he was charged, he laboured under that degree of insanity, which would disenable him to distinguish right from wrong.</p>

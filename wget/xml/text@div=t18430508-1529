                  </hi>. I am the son of Richard Swinnerton, and live in Cumberland-row, Battle-bridge. These decanters belong to my father—I saw them in the possession of the prisoner—he went into Meek's house in Fifteen-foot-lane—I called the policeman—the prisoner ran out of the house, without the decanters—I afterwards went to Meeks' house, and there found the decanters—I then went to a house in Harrison-street, Gray's Inn-road—I found the prisoner, and gave him into custody—I knew him before.</p>

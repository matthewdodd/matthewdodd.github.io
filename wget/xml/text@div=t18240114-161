            , to take care of his property. There were three or four brass cannons in the store-room - I saw them safe on the 27th of January, last year, and missed them on the 9th or 10th of February. The key of the garden gate would unlock the store-room door, of which I had the key. Each cannon weighed about 100 lbs.</p>

I and Hughes went to the premises, about four o'clock one morning, about a year ago - Hughes had the key of the garden gate, which unlocked the store-room door, and we brought away six cannons; they laid at my house for a fortnight, under some rubbish; then I went to Pratt, the Paddington carrier. I wrapped the cannon in a sack, and went with him up to town. I had known Nash three years ago, and he had been at me to get this cannon; he said,

             told him there were cannons there, and if I would get them he would send a horse and cart down for them, and buy them of me; but the cart did not come, so I took one up to him - I had told him I had got them the next night, and he said he would come down next morning after them. He kept an iron shop at Paddington. Pratt stopped the cart at his door, by my order. I told Pratt that it was cast iron. I told Nash I had brought one of them up - he said he would weigh it, and I was to call in directly for the money. I went out, returned, and he said it came to 1 l. I should think it weighed above I cwt.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell this story to the Magistrate - A. About six weeks ago, when I was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You gave this account twelve months after it happened - A. Yes. I was taken up on suspicion of robberies which have been done about Edmonton.</p>
               <p>Q. You cleared that suspicion by confessing thirty-two robberies - A. No; I only did one robbery - that was this cannon. I told about more robberies that were committed by other people, who told me of them when I was drinking with them; I did not help them. The prisoner did not charge me with stealing a shovel from his door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many robberies did you tell the Magistrate you had heard of, was it twenty - A. I dare say it was pretty well twenty, if not more - they have been done at different times, within the last year. I live at Elstree.</p>

            . I am a carrier from Elstree. Eight or nine months ago, I was at my door - Lowe said he had a bit of old cast iron, and asked me to take it to town, as I was going there. I said I would. He lifted a sack into the cart; I helped him, and think it weighed I cwt. He followed, and stopped me at an old iron shop at Paddington, lifted it out, and carried it into the shop. I did not see who was inside the shop. I knew of no other name belonging to the shop but Mrs. Lloyd. I passed a fortnight after, and saw Nash's name up. Lowe and I had some refreshment at the Red Lion, public-house, which he paid for, and gave me sixpence. I heard of this robbery a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you the least idea of having taken a cannon - A. No. I have carried nothing else for him.</p>

I staid, and looked at them a little time, and then they handed it to

While it was in Watts's hands, I took hold of him, and asked him to give me my watch; he said, it was not mine; but his own. He then walked-off, and I called stop thief; then I attempted to run after him, and there were some people came behind me, and shoved me down; they shoved me off, and I lost sight of him. I went farther up the road, as far as Globe-lane, and there stopped. I saw the prisoner Watts coming back by himself; when I saw him, I sang out to the watchman, and got him taken up.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I live in Mile-end-road. On Sunday morning, the 9th of June, I got up between four and five o'clock; I went and threw my sash up, and threw the shutters back; I saw some persons on the same side of the way as my own house; there might be ten or a dozen men standing in the street; they had got the prosecutor between them, hustling him. I then saw John Watts come towards my house; he came from the others, and had a watch in his hand; that I saw; it was a silver watch; he had an apron before him, and seemed as if he was putting it into the apron; the other man, Edmonds, was with the others, endeavouring to keep the prosecutor back; he was on the outside of the party that was round the prosecutor; he was standing still, and looking towards Watts, said, push it, Jack. I am sure the prisoner Edmonds said so; I had a full opportunity of seeing him. I saw this out of my parlour window.</p>

               <p>Cross examined by MR. BARRY. All the parties were totaliy strangers to me. My husband was constable of the night; he asked me if I could describe the person who got the watch; and I said, I could. I know there are such things as rewards. I have heard of such a thing, but not from my husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Prince Regent, in Regent-street, Lambeth. The prisoner has been in my employ nearly nine years—he ought to be there to open my shop about seven o'clock in the morning—I generally come down about half-past seven—the prisoner had no business to serve—the servant maid has—I know this cann to be mine—it holds one gallon, and is what the prisoner generally carried out beer in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You are sure that is your cann? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have one more like it—you have been in the habit of carrying out this can for the last three years—I swear it is mine—I purchased it myself—I never found any beer left in the cann which you had not sold—sometimes you bring back a good drop, which I always allow you for—what you did not sell you accounted to me for, and I put it down in a book—you always paid me honourably for what you took out—I never allowed you to serve in the bar, except three months ago, when I had no servant—you then served sometimes, but I have had a servant ten weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">THOMAS SYMONS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) In consequence of information, about half-past one on the morning in question I was watching at my window, and saw the prisoner come down the street from towards the prosecutor's house, and about thirty yards from it, with a cann of beer—he was going into the yard leading to his own house, when I came and stopped him, and asked whether he had got any beer there—he said yes, he had some, which he was going to boil up with some broth or something—I said I must take him back to Mr. Wood—he said he hoped I should not do that; he did not want to go back—I said I must, and took him—after we came out of Mr. Wood's he threw down this bottle on the pavement and broke it, and said, "Here is a bottle</p>

               <p>of gin; you shan't have that"—I produce the pieces of the bottle—he afterwards said that every potman must do it to make a living, or else they could not live on their wages, because of the credit they had to give in carrying out the beer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service, and have charge of the bar in a morning till he comes down. On this morning I came down about half-past six, and let the prisoner in—I did not see any beer drawn after letting him in—I went away for about ten minutes—he had no business to take any beer except what I served him with.</p>

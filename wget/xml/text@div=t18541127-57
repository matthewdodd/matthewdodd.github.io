I have known the prisoner about five months; he was serang on board a ship that I worked for; I knew the captain—the prisoner spoke to me in English quite plain—he can under<lb></lb>stand English if he likes—on a Thursday, at the end of Oct., I met him in the street—I did not exactly know him—he came to me, and asked me how I did—I said, "Pretty well, thank you, how do you do?" he said, "I have been looking for you all day, give me a card where you live"—I did so, and he called on me—as I had got to washing, he went away and came in the evening—he asked me if I would be kind enough to let him lodge there—I said I did not keep lodgings—he said he had no where to go, and no money, and no victuals; and would I allow him to be there till to-morrow—I said, "If you wish me to do for you, I will do what I can"—I took him in, and gave him a supper—I gave him a newspaper, and lent him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my pocket; I made a bed for him in my front kitchen—I did not go to bed till my husband came home, at 12 o'clock—when I got up the next morning, the prisoner was gone—my husband got up, he went down before me, he looked for his jacket—I said I supposed it was hanging in the kitchen—he said, "No," he could not find it, nor his handkerchief—when I came down my gown was gone, two shawls, two shifts, belonging to my children, and two shirts—one of the shawls was my best shawl, that I gave 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—these are my articles—I had shut and locked the door at night—the lodger went put about 5 o'clock in the morning—I do not know whether the door</p>

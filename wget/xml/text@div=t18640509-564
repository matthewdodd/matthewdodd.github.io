I keep a coffee-stand in Blackman-street, Southwark—I have a residence in William-street, Newington-causeway—I left there at 12 on Monday night, 25th April—I left my family in bed—I pulled the door to; it closes with a spring lock—I was in the habit of doing that every night, at that time—I returned at half-past 4 on the morning of 26th—as I turned the corner of the street, which is about thirty yards from my door, I saw the prisoner standing with my door open, half way in and half way out—I went up to the door and asked him what he was doing—he rolled away shamming to be intoxicated, and made no reply—I then saw another man get out from my next door neighbour's—the prisoner then ran away; I ran after him nearly to London-bridge, but could get no tidings of him—I came back and went as far as the Rockingham Arms, when I saw him again—he ran away; I ran after him across the road, and gave him into the custody of a policeman—I am quite certain there was no key in my door, and am quite certain that I pulled it to, as I am in the habit of doing.</p>

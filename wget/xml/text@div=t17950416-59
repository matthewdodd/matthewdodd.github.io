               <p>I am a constable belonging to Bow-street; on Monday, the 16th of March, I went up to an old iron shop to get some screws for my own use, and the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose shop was it? - Mrs. Man's, at the top of York-street, Westminster. He asked the woman to buy some lead, he had sixty pounds to sell; he said he understood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160133"></xptr> by the husband, that he had spoke to before, that he would give but five farthings a pound for it. They said for that quantity it would not be worth while to give that for it. She said she would not buy it of him, but there was a person behind, pointing to me, that would buy it of him; I said if he would bring it to me I would take it; he said he would come with it about five o'clock in the evening. The same day, between five and six o'clock in the evening he came, he said, he believed it was cabbage; I asked him how he came by it? he said it was cabbage, that a man authorized him to carry it down there, and he would give him a shilling for carrying it, and he should have some more next week if I would buy it. After looking at it, I told him I did not think he came by it honestly, and that I was an officer of Bow-streets I took him there and kept the lead. After we went to the office, he told the magistrate that if I would go to Sloane-street with him, he would shew me the person who he had it of; and I asked him if it was not a man that his mistress put a good deal of confidence in? he said, yes, it was; but when he got near the house, he said I had it not of a man; it was a woman gave it me. He wanted to go into the public house, I would not let him go into the public house. He told me before that the person lived at a private house. I took him into custody, and took him that night to Tothilfields; and going down I learned that his wife lived with Mrs. Jackson, was her servant, and that it was from his wife he got the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say his wife was a servant to Mrs. Jackson? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. Has this man a wife in your service? - She was in my service at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not thieve it, a person gave it me.</p>
               <p>Warren. I can swear to this pipe, this went through a part of the wall, and the cask was cut away the other side.</p>
               <p>Perkins. I can swear to it by these two joints.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had it given me to sell. I have no witnesses at all.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. Did you know this servant had a husband? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long was she your servant? - Five months. I always thought her husband and she were parted.</p>
               <p>Court. What may be the value of this lead? - Twenty-eight pounds; about five shillings.</p>

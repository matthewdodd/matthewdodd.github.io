               <p>JOHN WARD. I am servant to Mr. Heath; I knew the prisoner and allowed him to sleep in the stable on the 8th of March; and on the 9th, I sent him to get some shears from Mr. Day - I gave him some money to pay for them; he brought me a message, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Day - when I returned he was gone and I missed the great coat off the bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the coat to pawn and gave me the ticket of another; he told me to get that, and to pawn this. Witness. There was a duplicate of another coat which he took away - upon my oath I did not give him the coat to pawn.</p>

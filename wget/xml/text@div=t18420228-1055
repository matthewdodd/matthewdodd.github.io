I live in Dove-row, Hackney—I was at a pub<lb></lb>lic-house near St. John's-street, early in the morning on the 22nd of February—the prisoner came up to me and took the watch out of my pocket—I immediately pursued him, and called out, "Stop thief"—he was taken by a policeman—this is my watch—I am positive he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defense.</hi> I was coming from the play; I heard three or four cry, "stop thief;" I ran, and the policeman asked me if I had robbed a man of a watch; I said, "What watch?" the gentleman tin came up, he asked if I took the watch from him, and he said he thought so; there was a young man passed that knew me, and he took him as well as me.</p>

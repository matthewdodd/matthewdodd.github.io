                  </hi>. I am a leather-seller at Little Newport-street, Leicester-square. The prisoner was my clerk for four years till Nov. 1848—I paid him wages—I then made a fresh arrangement, by his solicitation—he was to receive five percent. commission on moneys received—he named two of three of my customers that he was likely to do business with—he was to solicit orders, and on the regular pay-days to call to receive the cash or cheque, and pay it over to me—the commissions were to be paid any time he asked for them, not on the day on which he received the cash, no time was specified—he was certainly not to deduct his commission, the full cash was to be paid in—there was no alteration in that respect from his duty when he was clerk—when he was clerk he came to the desk and reported what he received, and paid in the money, which was entered by myself or my assistants—his salary was paid on Friday night—he accounted to me for the sums he received in gross; he made no deduction whatever—that was the system from 1848 down to the present time—since then I have paid him his commissions when he has applied for them—he has received about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than his commission—he has not accounted to me for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Messrs.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long did he serve you as clerk or servant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four years, ending in Nov. 1848—he was not in my employ in any capacity in Dec. 1848—he renewed his engagement at the time he left my service as clerk—that was at my instance—I told him I had no longer occasion for his service as clerk—I lost a brother in April, 1848—I made an arrangement with the prisoner to get in money due to my brother's estate—for that he was to be paid by commission—that arrangement was made afterwards, not at the time he took the commission on my account—it might be some weeks or months afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not in Jan. 1849 you made your new arrangement with him comprehending the getting in your brother's estate, as well as what he was to-do for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not say it was not—what he received were generally petty accounts—I should say what he received during the four years was not as much as 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—very likely it might have been half of that—it might be nearer to 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is rather a difficult question for me to answer—my books are here—before he left, he accounted entirely to my satisfaction—I am quite sure it was at his solicitation that he entered into the fresh engagement with me—there was no writing between us—I think there was no one present but ourselves—he left my employ as clerk in Nov. 1848, and entered on the new arrangement at the same time—I have in my hand a memorandum which I have made since I was before the Magistrate containing extracts from my books—I have never settled any commission with the prisoner—there has been no balance struck—he has never since January, 1849, asked me to settle his account—he has never asked me to go through the account—I have applied to him to do it—I swear that—I do not remember his asking me to go through the account, and my giving as a reason why I did not, that I was going abroad—that did not pass to my knowledge—I do not remember that he repeatedly applied to me to go through the account, and that I gave as a reason that I did not, that I was too much engaged, or was going abroad—I remember nothing of the kind—he presented an account in May, 1849—I did not go through it; I put it in my desk—since the time of the new arrangement, he has accounted to me for 227<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some shillings—he has not, to my knowledge, made application for many sums that were received by myself personally; for none—the arrange<lb></lb>ment comprehended several sums which I received, and not he—Austin's was one, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I requested him not to call on Austin's—there were two accounts which I separated from my brother's estate—he put down Austin's account in my presence, but immediately afterwards I requested that Austins' and Watkins' accounts should be separated from them—he made application to Austin, but if he made any subsequent ones, it was on his own will, and not at my request—I have received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills on Austin's account, and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Watkins—I did not apply to him to settle his account before I gave him into custody—I gave him into custody about the second week in May—it might be about the 14th or 16th—I went before Mr. Long, the Magistrate—he dismissed the charge, because he considered the man was not a clerk or servant—he did not go through all the circumstances—there were very few questions put—he did not go fully into the commission account to know how it stood as to the amounts—I went before him on the subject-matter of the accounts due to me, as distinguished from my brother's estate; but I told the</p>

               <p>Magistrate there were also accounts on my brother's estate—it was after that that he said he did not consider the prisoner as a clerk or servant—the prisoner brought an action against me three or four days after I had been before the Magistrate—I understood from an officer who called on me that a writ was issued, but I have not been served with it—I went before the Grand Jury about three weeks ago, and preferred these bills of indictment—there are no deposi<lb></lb>tions sent here—I went after the Magistrate dismissed the charge—my mode of paying the prisoner's commission was to give him money when he asked me—there is an arrear on that commission—that is a commission on 227<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. collected on my own account, separate from my brother's—I think he has received from me 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the money received of my brother's estate is 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the total amount I gave him to collect of my brother's was nearly 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that included Austins' and Watkins', which were afterwards withdrawn—the prisoner made out that account from my brother's books, which I gave him to make it out from—I know that he claims commission on the whole, but he is not entitled to it, because I struck out two accounts—I sent in a quarter's account to my customers in March—I have received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I beg to correct that; I have not received any of the accounts due in March, except 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. reported as cash from Mr. Williams on 11th May, whereas Mr. Williams had not paid the prisoner any account in May—I have received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the quarter's account I sent in March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you from time to time made the prisoner loans of money, for which you have taken his I O U? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took his I O U for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the only sum—I think that was immediately after he left—that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to him on commission—I have not made him loans besides that—I have not settled a commission account with him since Jan. 1849—I never could get an account from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In Nov., 1848, he ceased to be your clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was at the same time that I made a fresh engagement to employ him on commission; and it might be in Jan., to the best of my knowledge, that I employed him to collect the outstanding debts of my brother's estate—I was to give him two and a half per cent. on those—I told him that was all the estate could afford—there was only collecting there, and not soliciting orders—I think it was about Jan. that I gave him the books referring to my brother's estate—he produced to me a list of the debts due to my brother's estate taken from the books—that included the accounts of Austin and Watkins—when I saw them I desired him to exclude them—the debts he collected of my brother's estate were about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him no authority to collect Austin and Watkins'—the two and a half per cent. was not to be paid at any particular time; the same way as the other; it was to be on the amount collected—Austin's 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Watkins' 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. have been paid to me, not to him—if he were to charge the commission on Austin and Watkins, he would still be overpaid—it was about May, 1849, that I advanced the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of commission—he applied for it to my brother, in my absence—he is here—I have no regular account with respect to his commission—the items I have here are abstracted—I have since this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. made him other advances on account of his commission—nothing has been expressly said in reference to the first 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was taken as an item in the account of commission, but it is not in the ledger—I have made up this paper by taking the amount from the ledger of the accounts he has received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Some time ago you lent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on an "I O U?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes;—my brother took the "I O U"—that is a part of the money that I say has been overpaid in commission.</p>

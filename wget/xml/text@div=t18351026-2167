                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. James Mudford, a woollen-draper, in Kingsland-road. On the 8th of September the prisoner came to the shop in company with another man, and asked me for some straps for the bottoms of trowsers—I told tim I had got none—he asked me for some buttons—I showed him some, and served him with a dozen, which came to two-pence, and which he paid me for—his companion had his back to me, and, while I was serving the buttons, the companion took this cloth off the counter—they had both come in together—I had seen them toge<lb></lb>ther two minutes before—the other man did not ask for any thing—I had seen them pass the door together two minutes before, but only once—they came in together, as if in company—while the two-pence laid on the counter, the other man ran off with the cloth, and the prisoner ran with him, close at his heels—I gave an alarm—they were then running together—I followed them to the bottom of Edward-street, which is six or eight houses from our shop—they turned the corner together—when they passed the door together they passed slowly, and had to return to enter the shop—the cloth measured twelve yards, and is worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a yard—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in Charles-square, a fortnight after, and followed him into Wilson-street, and gave him in charge of the constable—he said I must be mis<lb></lb>taken.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner. <hi rend="italic">Tucker</hi> pointed him out—I accompanied him to his lodging—he told me it was his lodging—I found a pair of white trowsers there in the parlour, in a chest of drawers—there was a female lodger in the house, who he called his wife—the lodging was in York-place, Walbrook—I had heard the boy tell the Magistrate he had white trowsers on when he came into the shop—there were several old pairs of black trowsers, and two or three coats.</p>

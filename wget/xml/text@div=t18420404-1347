                  </hi>. I am street-keeper of High-street, Whitechapel. On the 18th of March I was on duty in Mr. Larking's neighbourhood; my attention was attracted by several of his men watching about the end of Irish-court, which leads to the back of his premises—I continued to watch for about half an hour—in the course of that time I saw Baker come to the end of the court and cross into the middle of High-street—he stopped for a carriage to pass, then came to the side where I stood, and stood in front of a tobacco shop—there was a strong gas light in the window of that shop, which is immediately opposite the entrance of the court—he showed him<lb></lb>self in front with his back to the light, and his face towards the court—I consider that was to show his person—he put his back against the window, which would enable a person in the court to see him—Boughton came out of the court in a second afterwards, carrying a butter-flat—I followed him into Petticoat-lane, which he went up, stopped him, and asked him what he had got there—he said he did not know what it was, a man had given it to him to carry to the Ship public-house, Artillery-lane, and was to give him a shilling; and as he was a poor man he was glad of the job—I had left Baker standing with his back to the light—I took Boughton into custody—I afterwards took him to Mr. Larking, the cheese-monger, in High-street, opened the flat, and it contained two hams, two Dutch cheeses, and a bladder of lard, which Mr. Larking claimed-Boughton gave the same account to Mr. Larking as to me—I found 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a silver watch on him—he had said he was a poor man, glad to get anything—I took Baker into custody in High-street, next morning, as he was coming to work—I told him I had orders from his master to take him</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my son as wholesale cheesemongers—the prisoner Baker was in my service as carman for three years—there is a way of getting from our premises behind, at the stables, and you can come out into Irish-court, but the court is no thoroughfare—there is nothing beyond our premises—the constable brought Boughton to me, with a flat containing some cheese and hams—the cheese was ours—I can identify it—it was part of a lot I had just had in—the things in the flat were worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Boughton had no business on our premises.</p>

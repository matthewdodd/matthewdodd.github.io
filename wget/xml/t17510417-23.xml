I ordered my servant to knock at the kitchen door, and tell the prisoner we wanted some plates out of the kitchen; she opened the door and we burst in; I took the man in bed and charged the constable with him. I asked the girl some questions. When I got them to the watch-house, she would not give me any account of the things. I took her to a little place backwards in the watchhouse, then she said if I would discharge the man she would tell me where the things were. I went back with her home, she took me backwards, and in the necessary house she had wrapp'd the things mentioned up in rags, and tuck'd them in a hole under the stairs, which go up over the necessary.</p>

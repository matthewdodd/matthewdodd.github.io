I lost a handkerchief on the 16th of March - the prisoner was employed by me, and had the washing of this handkerchief; we found it in her basket, in which she brought her provision - my wife asked her how she came to put it there - she said she did not know, but it was her first offence, and she hoped to be forgiven - I gave her in charge - we went to her lodging, and found another handkerchief there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your wife here? A. No, she was not bound over - we have between thirty and forty persons in our laundry; it is my wife's custom to search the people as they go out - I was present when the prisoner presented herself to be searched - I cannot say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050064"></xptr>whether my wife searched her person or her basket first - she presented her basket to be searched - I have since heard that she had a quarrel with some Irish women who had a spite against her. She had been in our employ eight or nine months, and we had a good opinion of her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the handkerchief was found, did she say any thing about any one having a quarrel with her? A. No; I am sure she said it was her first offence. My wife is in good health, but she is not here.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoner's basket was searched, and the handkerchief found; I heard her beg of Mr. Joyce to forgive her on account of her two children and her health.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your oath, have you not had a quarrel with her? A. No; none of my country women wished to hurt her - I have heard my master and mistress say they put more confidence in her than in any woman they had - I cannot tell whether my mistress searched her basket or her person first - I cannot say whether she searched her or not - she does rub her women down every night - I am not searched, because I live in the house - none of the women had any quarrel, but there was a little row with them a day or two before - I do not know what it was about.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took up the prisoner - she begged pardon, and went down on her knees - I took her to the watch-house - I saw the last witness and several other women there; I did not see the basket searched - the handkerchief was wet, just out of the tub.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I declare I had no knowledge of the handkerchief being in the basket - it must have been maliciously put there - I had bound the other round my hand one night as it was sore with washing - I intended to return it - the servant tied it on my hand.</p>

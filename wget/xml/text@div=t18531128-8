                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Whitechapel. I work for Mr. Singer, of Watling-street, a shirt maker—the prisoner worked there, on the premises—there were four other women there besides myself—we do not take any work home—last Saturday fortnight, when I was leaving work, there were three other women there—there were two shirts lying on the table; the prisoner took them up, put them into a handkerchief, and left the room with them—they were shirts which she was making, and were unfinished—I supposed that she took them home to finish them—it was not allowed to take shirts out of the house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). I went with Mr. Kohen to the prisoner's house, No. 4, Windsor-street, Somers Town, on Monday, 14th Nov.—I told Mr. Kohen to ask for another party, merely to see if the prisoner was there—he asked at the door for Miss Roberts—the prisoner</p>

               <p>did not answer the door; but she came out to where we were standing after we had left the door a short time, and said to Mr. Kohen, I hope there is nothing wrong with respect to Miss Roberts?"—Kohen said, No, there is nothing wrong respecting her—the prisoner said, You know I brought three shirts away to finish on Saturday night, which I intended to bring back this morning, but I could not get them done"—this was at 11 o'clock at night—Mr. Kohen said he was not aware of it till he was informed of it, and that she had no right to do so—she said that it was usual with most shirt makers—I said I was an officer, and had come with respect to the shirts; that it would be my duty to take her into custody; and asked her if she could produce them; she said, Yes," she could—I went, indoors with her, into her husband's shop, and she was allowed to go into the back room for the purpose of producing them—in about a quarter of an hour she came back, and said she could not let us have them to night, for two of them were with a friends of hers, Miss Randall—the husband produced this shirt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from a drawer in the inner room, and said, This is the only one I can find in the drawer;" but the prisoner was not present then—I showed that shirt to the last witness, and she identified it at the Mansion-house—Mr. Kohen examined it at that time, and said he did not know that there was anything missing till he was told of it—the prisoner gave me Miss Randall's address, but I could not find her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Singer, a shirtmaker, of 61, Watling-street. The prisoner was employed there at piece work, at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a shirt, which is what I always pay; it is the best price paid in the city—she was the overlooker of the girls; they did the rougher part, and it was her business to finish it—the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not for finishing only; she engaged hands under her to work—she did not give security for work done on the premises, but if she takes work away she must—she got security signed, and took, work out about three months ago; but we did not like to give her any more out, because she did not bring home a shirt in time once when I wanted it; and I told her I would not give her any more at home, but that she might do them on the premises—that was about a fortnight before I missed the three shirts—I still have the security; I have not realised it—I am in the habit of cutting out the shirts—I know these shirts, the three are worth 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I signed, as well as you and your husband—I did not take the work in before the women left at night, if I had nobody could have taken it; but I went up stairs every night and looked for the work, except on Saturday, when I am busy, till half past 11 o'clock, and cannot do so; and I go on Monday mornings instead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Last Friday and Saturday fortnight I was up at half past 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, on purpose to get the work done, and all I took for my week's work was 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it took three of us three days to make four shirts, as it was such very heavy work, there was a dozen button holes in each shirt; I had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with each shirt made in the room, but I paid 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week to each of the women; the reason I did not go to my work on the Monday morning is, that I had not a bit of shoe to my feet, and I had to walk from Somers' Town every morning.</p>

He is agent to Sydney Aquilla Butterworth, and Jabez Butterworth, of Manchester—on the 14th of Nov., at a quarter before two in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and another man, and the other man lifted this bale of cloth on the prisoner's back from the gate-way, leading to Mr. Dades' warehouse—I followed the prisoner to Watling-street, and took him with this bale on his back—he said a gentleman had asked him to carry it.</p>

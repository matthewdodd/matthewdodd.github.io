I am the wife of Thomas Stevens, of Princes-street, Whitechapel. Gibson lodged with me on 25th Sept.—Dickinson is an acquaintance of his—I have seen them together—a woman named Elmer lodged in my house—on that evening, about six o'clock, the two prisoners and Elmer left my house together—Gibson came home afterwards and said he was going over the water to take two bed-winches—I observed that they were all three together about twelve that night—I heard them bid one another good night—my house is about one mile from Stepney Church.</p>

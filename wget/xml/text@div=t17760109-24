The tallest man was some time before he disentangled himself from the other; when he got loose he ran away, he turned down Bloomsbury-court towards Holborn; the deceased got up and attempted to run after him, he ran about eight or ten yards and then sell, he got up a second time and ran about three or four yards, and fell again; by that time I had alarmed some of the neighbours, and

               <p>I heard a great alarm of murder on Sunday morning the 15th of October: I opened my window and saw two men scuffling together, but they were at such a distance that I could not distinguish one from the other; I thought they were drunken men, and was going to bed again, but I heard the deceased cry out murder; then I called for the watch, then the person that had murdered him ran away; the deceased got up and ran after him a little way and fell, he got up again and fell just opposite my window; and said</p>
               <p>"Oh dear! he has killed</p>
               <p>"me; I am a dead man, I am a dead man:" a gentleman called out of Mr. Blinkow's one-pair of stairs window to the watchman to stop the man, but he did not; the man went down Bloomsbury-court; he had no hat or wig on, and his head appeared to me very clean shaved.</p>

               <p>What distance were they from you when you first saw them? - I imagine about ten or fifteen yards.</p>

               <p>On Sunday morning the 15th of October I was awaked with the cry of watch; I got out of bed and threw up the sash, I sleep in a two-pair of stairs room: I saw the two men scuffling together near Mr. Pratt's stable door, I looked upon it to be a drunken sight, and paid no regard to it; in the scuffle they came nearer to my house, they fell in the middle of the kennel, the deceased fell undermost; the other then disengaged himself from him and ran away, leaving his hat and wig behind him: when I saw him running without his hat and wig, I imagined it was something serious, upon which I called to the watchman, who was coming along the side of Bloomsbury-market, to stop that man, he was then running away; the watchman attempted to cross the way to meet him, upon which he turned short and ran down Bloomsbury-court by my house; then I heard somebody ask the deceased what was the matter, he told them that a man had broke into the stable, that he attempted to secure him, and he believed he was a dead man.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How near was you to him? - My house is the corner of Bloomsbury-court: the deceased died about eight in the morning: I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090015"></xptr> first at his master's house, he was taken from thence to the hospital.</p>
               <p>What distance was you when you first saw them? - Mr. Pratt's stable is about fifty or sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Did, you see the hat and wig on when first you saw them? - I did not observe then, but I observed he had not a hat and wig on when he went away; when I saw them first it was but just break of day, and at that distance I could but just discern that they were two men, they in the scuffle came ten yards nearer me.</p>

               <p>How far was it from Mr. Pratt's stables when you saw them first? - Pretty night, as near as I can guess; they had another fall together, and were some time down; the murderer got loose from the man; when he got to the corner of Bloomsbury-court, he turned and looked after the deceased; the deceased had got up and fell down again; I called the watch, and a watchman, who was at the further end of the market, made the best of his way to the court; the watchman got to the end of the court just as the murderer did; the murderer set off down the court, and the watchman gave an alarm with his rattle; I saw nothing of him after he got into the court: I called to a young man that was assisting the deceased, to take up the man's hat and wig, which he had left at the corner of the street; in picking the hat and wig up, he found an instrument which we supposed the murder was committed with. The deceased was carried away on a shutter.</p>

               <p>I was alarmed a little before six o'clock by the cry of watch and murder; I then jumped out of bed, took my coat and ran to the place, where I saw the deceased lying on the ground; I went and asked him what was the matter with him; he made no answer for some minutes, but groaned; he said afterwards,</p>

               <p>On the Sunday morning, the 15th of October, I was waked by my wife (she had been at the window) she told me Mr. Pratt's coachman was murdered; I jumped out of bed and went to the window; I looked to my right-hand and saw the deceased leaning on Holland's breast; I turned my eye to my left-hand and saw Israel Dearing coming up the stable yard; I desired him to take up the two hats and the wig that lay on the ground, and bring them to my door.</p>
               <p>Where were they lying? - Against Mr. Pratt's coach-house, as near as I can recollect, one was the deceased's and the other belonged to the person that had murdered him; I examined them both very strictly: I dressed myself and came down immediately, and I went up to the deceased and unbuttoned his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was full of blood, there was likewise a great quantity of blood in his breeches; about three quarters of an inch above his left pap, there was a wound, out of which the blood gushed very much; I went immediately into Great Russel street for Mr. Younge the surgeon, I stayed there ten or eleven minutes till he came down; in the interim they had carried him on a shutter to his master's: Mr. Younge came with me to Mr. Pratt's, we found him on a shutter, he ordered him to be put in a chair, he examined the wound; I asked him if he thought it mortal, he shook<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090016"></xptr> his head, but at that time gave me no answer, but desired the deceased might have a little hartshorn and water given him; I thought he was a little refreshed, with that I asked him if he knew the person that had used him so; his answer was No, says I, where did you find him, In my master's stables: the watchman brought in this instrument (producing a small bayonet bent at the point, made to fix upon the end of a stick) I shewed it to the deceased, and asked him if that was the instrument with which he had been wounded, he said, Yes; it was bent by his fall upon it. Mr. Younge wrote an order for him to be admitted into St. Bartholomew's Hospital; he was carried a little way in a chair, but being weak through the effusion of blood, he fell and broke the glass; they were obliged to take him out of the chair and put him into a coach, in which they carried him to the hospital; I saw no more of him, but heard he died about eight o'clock that morning.</p>
               <p>Do you know who picked up the instrument? - A little boy, who took it up and gave it to the watchman; we don't know who the boy is, here is a person here that saw him pick it up.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. What condition was the instrument in when given to you? - The watchman had wiped it with his coat, but there was a little blood on the tip of it, I put my finger to it and found it blood.</p>
               <p>ISRAEL DEERING sworn.</p>
               <p>As I was going up Holborn, about ten minutes before six o'clock in the morning of the 15th of November, between Bloomsbury-court and Southampton-street, I heard the cry I thought of murder; I went up Southampton-street, and when I came to the corner of Silver-street, by the gateway, i saw a man runing and he fell, and as I came up the gateway a person at a window desired me to pick up a hat and wig, and the coachman's hat, which were lying on the ground; in about two or three minutes after that I saw a little boy pick up that weapon.</p>
               <p>How near to the place was it where the hat and wig were lying? - About five or six yards from the place where I took up the hat and wig; it was near Mr. Pratt's stable door; one of the watchmen took it of the boy: we took the deceased to Mr. Pratt's house, a surgeon came, he probed the wound; but hearing there was a weapon, he ordered it to be got before he could tell which way the wound went; in about ten minutes the weapon was brought, and he looked at it and returned it to somebody; I left my name and departed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you see the boy take up the weapon? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did he give it you? - He offered it me; I had the hats and wig, and my stick; I could not take it, and he gave it to a short man, a watchman, who shewed him the weapon close to his face; as he sat in the chair, he said, Hum, hum, we could not tell what he said.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Sutton: I heard a terrible noise, rather before six o'clock, as I lay in the coach-yard over the stable; I slipt my cloaths on and went down into the yard: Mr. Vincent said, Sutton, Mr. Pratt's coachman is murdered; I went up to him directly, and saw him lay on the slag stones, with his coat and waistcoat open, all of a gore of blood, it was running off the slag stones; I said do not let the poor fellow lie here, let us take him up and carry him to the house; we put him on a shutter, and took him to Mr. Pratt's, then I went into Holborn to seek a surgeon; I did not know where one lived; I returned and found Mr. Young there, he probed the wound, and put a bit of plaister on it; he was sat up in a chair, and was shewed the weapon, and asked if that was the thing that stabbed him; he faintly said, Yes; Mr. Younge wrote a letter to the hospital; he was put in a chair, he could not sit still, his agony was so great, reeling about he knocked his head through the glass; after he had broke the glass, he was put into a coach and taken to the hospital; I held a handkerchief all the while to his wound: just as the surgeon at the hospital was coming in at the door of the ward where the coachman was, he expired; I think he had been there about twenty minutes, it was just a quarter before eight as I came out of the door.</p>

               <p>You speak to the hat upon account of its being so coarse that a pawnbroker would not lend a shilling upon it? - Yes, there was that black piece round it at that time, but that white cord I cannot positively swear to.</p>
               <p>To DEERING. Did you pick up the two hats and the wig yourself? - I did.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the other hat? - I carried it to Mr. Pratt's house, and gave it to the servant.</p>
               <p>What do you know it by? - The bit of cord that was round it, and the coarseness of the hat and lining; the wig was in the hat.</p>
               <p>There was no particular mark upon the hat? - No, I told Mr. Pratt's servant to take particular care of it, and delivered it into his hands.</p>
               <p>To VINCENT. Was the hat in your hand? - Yes, the lining of the hat is tore inside, if it is the same.</p>

               <p>I am a barber: upon the fourth or fifth of October the prisoner brought me this wig to make an alteration in it, it was not then deep enough in his neck; I am certain this is the wig he brought to me; I did alter it, and here is the alteration in it now.</p>
               <p>Have you shaved the prisoner any time since the alteration of his wig? - Yes, in the course of the week following.</p>
               <p>Do you know what day of the week you shaved him? - I believe on Friday in the next week.</p>
               <p>Did you shave the hair all off? - No, I left some hair on each temple, and likewise a little in the neck.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Craven-street, Soho, or Hog-lane; it is called by both names.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - I do not know that I ever saw him before he brought the wig to alter.</p>
               <p>Then you have no acquaintance with him? - None at all.</p>
               <p>What time of day was it he brought it to you, the fourth or fifth of October? - In the afternoon of one of those days, by day light.</p>
               <p>Was it left with you? - It was made longer from the forehead to the neck.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner wear during that time? - His own hair, with curls.</p>
               <p>When was the wig fetched back again? - At six in the evening, and then I cut his hair off.</p>
               <p>That wig could not be wore with the hair? - With the hair which I left it might: he was very fearful of catching cold, he said, or he would have been shaved then; I did not shave it at first, but cut it off, as we generally do, when people are afraid of catching cold; I cut it pretty close.</p>
               <p>You never saw him afterwards? - I have met him several times, from the affair happening, before he was taken up, and have given him the time of the day, but he never made any answer to me.</p>
               <p>When was he taken up? - Last Wednesday was a week I believe; I did not hear any thing till Wednesday of it.</p>
               <p>Are you certain the prisoner is the man? - I am positive.</p>

               <p>I am a peruke-maker, and live in Newtoner's-street, Holborn: I know the wig to be the prisoner's, I am positive he wore it, I dressed it twice; I took notice, the first time I combed it for him, of a particular riband in the inside, I never saw such a particular thing in a wig before, which made me take the more notice of it; the prisoner took a lodging in the house I lived in, in Newtoner's-street, Holborn, No 8, for his mother and sister to live in; to the best of my remembrance it was the same day this murder happened, but I cannot positively swear to the same day or the Monday afterwards, that a note came to Mrs. Williams his mother; I saw the note, it was desiring her to send him a great coat, a pair of breeches, a hat and a silk handkerchief, which I imagine came from the prisoner: on the Monday or Tuesday night the prisoner came in with a bundle, but what it contained I cannot say.</p>

               <p>You dressed the wig twice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know what days? - No; the first time was about the 8th or 9th of October, I believe, but I cannot speak to a day; he kept rabbits there; he used to come at eight or nine o'clock in the morning, and was there generally most of the day.</p>
               <p>As to this note you know nothing of it? - No more than that such a note came.</p>

               <p>When was you taken ill? - I cannot tell the day of the month.</p>
               <p>When did you recover to be able to go about your business? - It may be about five weeks ago since I went to work again.</p>
               <p>A SURGEON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon belonging to St. Bartholomew's hospital: I examined the deceased Stubbins, he was dead before I saw him; there was a wound in his left breast, which passed between the third and fourth rib, and perforated the upper lobe of the left lungs, and likewise entered the cavity of the heart; there can be no doubt but what that wound was the cause of his death.</p>

               <p>I live in King-street, Drury-lane, and am a wool-comber: I have known the prisoner almost three months; he took a room of me for his mother and sister upon the 23d of October.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of him before that time? - No: my wife had promised him a room before; I never saw him before the 23d of October.</p>
               <p>How did he behave? - Very honest and civil; he came backward and forward twice a day to feed his rabbits.</p>
               <p>Had he a great quantity of rabbits? - Fourteen breeding does; he bred them and sold them.</p>

               <p>I did not come to appear for the prisoner, I only came out of curiosity: I am servant to lord Mansfield: I have known the prisoner eight years; he was second coachman to my lord eight years ago or better; I have not heard any thing to his prejudice; he quitted the service seven years ago, I believe.</p>
               <p>Have you known much of him since that time? - Very little; I met him the Saturday before he was taken up, and was asked one another how we did; nothing farther passed.</p>

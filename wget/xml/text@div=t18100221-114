On the 3rd of February, between ten and eleven at night, the prisoner came in our shop for a pound of bacon; it came to eleven pence; he laid down a dollar; I gave him four shillings and a penny; I took up the dollar and said I did not think it was a good one; I gave it to Mr. Davis, he gave it to the prisoner immediately, and said it was a bad one; the prisoner offered another, and while I was looking at the dollar he walked out of the shop; he had got the change and the bacon. I have the 2nd dollar to Mr. Davis; he ran after him. When the prisoner presented the second dollar he said he had taken two of his pay serjeant; he said they were both good ones, they had been weighed, and they both weighed the same weight; then the prisoner went away and my husband went after him with the dollar that I had given him; they returned in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, my husband with the prisoner.

I took him back to the shop, there was an officer waiting, and he wanted to strip; he shuffled his clothes; he said, they should search him; I said not; he should go to the watchhouse.

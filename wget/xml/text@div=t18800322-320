                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 240). On 17th February I was on duty in New Gravel Lane and saw the prosecutor standing against a post in a court called Boarded Entry—as I came through the court the prisoner walked after me—she said, "This is him"—the prosecutor could hear that—she struck him on the left side of his head, apparently with her hand; I did not see any weapon—he was standing with his back to her—the place was dark, I could not have seen a knife even if she had one in her hand—it was apparently shut—the blood rushed from him profusely directly she struck him—I only saw her strike him once—I told her I should take her into custody for assaulting him—she made no reply—I took her to the station—she there said, "I did it," and directly after she said, "I did not do it," all in one breath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were only four persons present on the spot, the prisoner, prosecutor, myself, and another woman, she was about seven yards off—I saw the whole of this quarrel—I did not see the prosecutor quarrelling with another woman—I was there at the commencement—the first thing I heard was the prisoner saying, "That is him," and she struck him—I afterwards saw that the prisoner's arm was out—I did not see how that was done—it was a cross wound, a bad wound; the doctor put some stitches in it at the station—I could not say whether it was done before or after her hand came against the prosecutor—I took her into custody at once, it could not have been done while I was taking her into custody; there were no people round—the prosecutor threw up his arms when he was stabbed, and in pulling the knife out it might have been done then—it must have been done by the same knife—I saw no stab—I found this knife, about three hours afterwards, lying in the place where I apprehended the prisoner; it was stained with blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at 53, New Gravel Lane, Shadwell at this time—I am potman at the Rose and Crown, High Street, Wapping—on the morning of February 17th I was coming out of a court called the Boarded Entry—I had just come out of my mother's house—I had got about 30 yards, and stood against a post at the top of the entry leading into New Gravel Lane—I received three wounds, one in the hole of the ear, one through the oar, and one behind the ear—I did not see anybody do it—I fell, and became insensible, and knew nothing till next morn<lb></lb>ing, when I found myself in the London Hospital, and I have been there ever since.</p>

There had been no quarrel between me and the prisoner in the course of the day, or shortly before, or with anybody belonging to me—the prisoner has often threatened me—we have had rows together, and she has come into my place interfering with my wife—my wife and I can always agree if she keeps away from us—she has often said she would do for me—the last time we had a quarrel may have been two or three months before February 17th—I can't say exactly to the time—my wife has at times taken my part—if I had seen the prisoner a quarter of an hour before I should have spoken to her—there was no reason whatever that night for her to do this.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at the London Hospital when the prosecutor was admitted there about two in the morning of February 17th—he was in a state of collapse—the bleeding had been stopped by a pad put on by the divisional surgeon—I removed the pad, and found three punctured wounds in the region of' the ear, one going through the cartilage of the ear inwards, the other through the cartilage downwards; the other penetrated straight down—they were in dangerous proximity to the external carotid artery—he was in danger for some time—I stitched up the wounds—this knife would inflict such wounds—two of them were about an inch deep, and one about half an inch—he does not seem to speak clearly since, and he has some slight affection of his right arm, which is getting much better—I don't say that is entirely owing to the stabbing—it might be due to the way in which he fell, or to some cerebral complication—I did not examine the prisoner.</p>

I had a knife in my hand. I was going to cut some bread—and-butter. I heard my sister scream. I ran out and said, 'You are at it again.' He struck me, and I struck him back. We struggled together, and I cut myself in the arm. I did not take the knife wilfully to stab him. I never threatened him in my life. He has told me repeatedly in the public that he was the father of my children, and caused great un<lb></lb>happiness between me and my husband. My principal interference with him was to take my sister's part."</p>

On Thursday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100047"></xptr> the twenty-first of March, a gentleman's servant came to me, to pay me two shillings for some cloaths I had scowered for him: he wanted change for a five and three pence; I gave it him. He had put the five and three pence down; I thought I had taken care of it. After I had given him the change, I asked him to go and drink with me: I was going out of the shop to give him some beer, but he was in a hurry, so I took him up stairs and gave him a dram; then he went away. I went to give my wife some money, and missed this five and three pence. I went, immediately, and asked the prisoner about the five and three pence; he said he saw the gentleman's servant put it down upon a board, and did not know what became of it. For further satisfaction, I went after the man that paid the five and three pence, and brought him back. He said, my man saw him put the five and three pence upon the board. The prisoner insisted that he knew nothing what was become of it; I insisted upon it that he should be searched; we sent for a constable; the prisoner pulled off all his cloaths but his stockings, we did not find the five and three pence. My wife asked if he had been searched; we gave her an account of it: she insisted upon his stockings being pulled off; in consequence of which, one stocking was pulled off: then the prisoner said, if the constable would go with him over the way, to a court he named, he would shew him where the five and three pence was; the constable and he went together, and came back soon after. The constable produced the five and three pence: then the prisoner owned he had taken the five and three pence. I said to him, How came you to do this? The prisoner said he believed the devil made him do it. I bid him go along out, and never come there any more: he complained he had no money; I gave him six-pence, and sent him about his business. In about an hour after, when I came in, I found the prisoner there abusing my wife, and saying they could do nothing with him for taking the five and three pence. Then I ordered the constable to take him in charge.</p>
               <p>The constable confirmed this evidence, and added, that, in the court, he pulled his stocking off, and took the five and three pence out of the foot of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of the five and three pence the servant put down upon the board; I found this five and three pence, as I was crossing the way, in the street. When my master said he would fetch the constable again, I said I would stay and see what the constable would do.</p>

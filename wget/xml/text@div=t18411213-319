                  </hi>. I am clerk to Doxat and Co., of Bishopsgate-street Without. In June last they were the holders of some Portuguese bonds—on the 28th of June I carried seventy-four bonds to the Portuguese agency office in Finsbury-place, of which the eight bonds now produced were part—they then bad the <hi rend="italic">coupon</hi>—sheets attached to them—<hi rend="italic">coupons are</hi> dividend warrants, on little bits of paper, attached to the bond, and when dividends become due, they are cut off—the express meaning of "<hi rend="italic">coupon</hi>," is "to cut off"—none were cut off these bonds, because no dividend had been paid on them—all the interest was due, and is so up to this time.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a wax-chandler in Piccadilly. I know a person named Campbell—these bonds were lodged with me by him at two separate dates, 29th of September and the 4th of October—four each time—I had lent Campbell some money, for which these bonds were deposited as security—on the 12th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, in consequence of seeing an advertisement in one of the daily papers, I went that same day to Campbell's place of business in the City—he was not at home—I then proceeded to the prisoner's office—(I had not known the prisoner before November)—I found Campbell there—after some time the</p>

               <p>prisoner came in—there was a newspaper there, and Campbell referred the prisoner to the newspaper, to an advertisement—I do not remember his exact words—he called his attention to the advertisement, and desired him to explain—the explanation, as I understood it, was that he had received them from his friends in Portugal, to be converted hen—(I do not recol<lb></lb>lect that he said any thing about the advertisement when his attention was directed to it—he read it)—I then pressed for the money, and some con<lb></lb>versation took place between Mr. Campbell and the prisoner, as to further security—I did not hear accurately the conversation that took place be<lb></lb>tween them—they proposed to pay me the money the next day—I said I had come to settle the business, and unless I had the money I would go to the Portuguese agency—they then spoke of bills and wine warrants—a locksmith was sent for to open the prisoner's desk—I ultimately got some wine warrants in place of the bonds—the wine warrants were sent to my house next morning—I kept the bonds—in consequence of seeing something next day in the newspaper, I sealed them up, and sent them to Mr. Har<lb></lb>ris's, my attorney—I afterwards saw them at the Manpion House—this advertisement is to the same purport as the one I saw—(<hi rend="italic">the advertisement setified that the lost bonds in question were null and void, and offered a re<lb></lb>ward of</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for their recovery</hi>.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear that any such proposal as you have stated ever came from the lips of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt of it—I can swear I have no doubt whatever of it—I wish to be exact—I have no doubt in my own mind the proposal came from both—I swear it to the best of my belief—I cannot speak more directly than that—the explanation I understood the prisoner to give was, that he had had these bonds from his friends in Portugal—I do not mean to swear that he stated so, because I understood what he said imperfectly, and the explanation was not very clear.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Secretary to the Portu<lb></lb>guese Financial Agency in England; their office is at Finsbury Chambers. The prisoner was in the employ of the agency in June and July last—he was assisting in sorting the bonds then out, and sent in to be cancelled and converted—these eight are bonds issued by the authority of our office, and which were brought in to be cancelled—I know the handwriting of all the official persons whose sgatures appear at the bottom—after the prisoner had sorted them, I made up a list of them, to see that they were accurate, and then missed eight 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bonds—I spoke to the prisoner many times about it, and he said he did not know any thing about them—I caused an ad<lb></lb>vertisement to be put in the papers about them—the prisoner had only to sort the bonds after they were cancelled—I do not know whether the per<lb></lb>son whose business it was to cancel them did so in the prisoner's presence—these bonds are not cancelled, at least, the part that is produced—if properly done there ought to be a line on this part—these are severed, but not cancelled.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Morley and Saunders. This paper which the bonds are on is manufactured by us—the value of it coming from us is about a penny per sheet, I mean the paper simply—I think the <hi rend="italic">coupons</hi>—were half the sheet—I should say the value of these eight pieces of paper as they are is a halfpenny, or perhaps three farthings, as waste paper.</p>

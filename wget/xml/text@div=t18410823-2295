                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Franks, the pri<lb></lb>soner was in his service. On Friday, the 6th of August, I gave him a parcel to take to the Irongate-wharf, and book it for Dublin—here is the book he took with him—I did not give him any money at the time I gave him the parcel—he afterwards produced this receipt to me—I told him it had been altered, that the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. appeared to be added—he said it was just as he received it, that they took it back again from him, and he did not know whether they had altered it then—I paid him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the sum men<lb></lb>tioned in the receipt—I afterwards made a communication to Mr. Franks—it was Mr. Franks's money I paid him.</p>

I saw her write on the note. She gave me the change, and I gave it to Jennings.

               <p>Q. On Saturday, the 15th, did either of them come - A. Yes, Griffiths came between eight and nine o'clock - he first came into the shop, Jennings was outside, about two yards from the door, while Griffiths was inside. Griffiths bought an aitch-bone of beef, he brought it to me to weigh - it came to 4 s. 1 1/2 d. he gave me a 1 l. Bank note, I told him it was a bad one, and that he knew it - he said nothing. I collared him immediately. The moment I collared him I saw Jennings run away from facing the shop, where he was standing in the road. I think he saw me collar Griffiths - he could see me. I called Adams in, and gave him the note. Jennings was brought back in about three minutes.</p>

               <p>"Tom, that is my woman," pointing to the woman who was with Jennings - he joined their company, and all three went away talking together. I had known Griffiths before for three years; his name was Brooker three years ago, when we lived opposite each other.</p>

My master was called in, and he ran away; I pursued him as hard as I could, and took him opposite a hair-dresser's shop kept by Murrell, in Titchfield-street. He fell down there.

            . I am a signing-clerk; two of the notes purport to bear my signature, but are not signed by me.</p>

               <p>GRIFFITHS'S Defence. On the 1st of January a woman came and asked me for drink; I said I had no money, and told her I lived in John-street, New-road - she said she was going that way; she fell in company with another man, and they went into Adams's; they told me to stop at the door - I spoke to Ollive. When they came out I said that was going to be my woman - they treated me with gin; I should know the man again - it was not Jennings. On the Friday fortnight following I sold my ass for 14 s. in Smithfield, and the man paid me the 1 l. note. Jennings was not in my company when I went to buy the meat.</p>
               <p>JENNINGS'S Defence. I was going to Poland-street, and accidentally looked at the shop. I thought it was late, began to run; I never saw Griffiths in my life, and never was in the shop.</p>

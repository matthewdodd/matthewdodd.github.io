                  </hi>. I am a musician, and reside at 6, Liverpool-terrace, Walworth. On the morning of 12th May, about a quarter to 4 o'clock, I was returning home down the Walworth-road, and when I came within about ten yards of Mr. Williams's shop, in York-place, I saw a party come out of the shop, with his feet foremost, from the bottom end of the shutters—as soon as he got on his feet, he started off running for about twenty yards—Immediately followed him, ran also, and kept him in sight, with the exception of turning the corners—he turned down East-lane—I did not lose sight of him half a second—I followed him into East-lane; he turned down a street, and I followed him till I saw a policeman, and told him—I do not know the name of the street where that was—he turned three corners before I saw the policeman—there were no persons about—the constable secured him, and we all went back to the shop—the shutter was down on the pave<lb></lb>ment—it was broad daylight—I swear the prisoner is the man who came from under the shutter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you aware the shutters of this shop have been blown down on a previous occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been told they have—after they had been put up on this occasion, I touched them with my stick with the least possible touch, and they tumbled down—after the shutters are removed there is an open front—when the shutters fell, they stood on the pavement, and rested against the window—I cannot say the exact situation of the shutter when the prisoner came from under it—a slim person like the prisoner might get under the shutter to the shopboard, but I could not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they require a blow before they came down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw the prisoner come out with his feet foremost; the shutters apparently came out with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the shutters close to the shop, like abutters in general are? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As butchers' shops usually are, with a bar outside—to the best of my knowledge, the shutter came out as the prisoner came out—when the shutter rested on the pavement, the bottom was about a yard and a half from the front of the shop—the window is not more than two yards deep.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 107). On 12th May, about 4 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Trafalgar-street, Walworth, and saw Mr. Revel, who called my attention to the prisoner—I took him into custody, and took him to Mr. Williams's shop—the shutters were then in their places—a piece of beef of 17 lbs. was shown me—I have known the prisoner by sight-two or three years ago he was then in the service of Mr. Head, a butcher, at Walworth—he denied having been at the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever heard anything against his character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I know that a great number of witnesses were here to give him a character, but are now gone—I saw the shutters tumble down when we went back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of a blow was requisite to knock them down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A pretty <hi rend="italic">stiff</hi> blow; they fell immediately—it seemed a particular way of striking them that made them fall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Williams, of 5, York-place, Walworth; it is his dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. Mary, Newing<lb></lb>ton. About 4 o'clock on the morning of 12th May I was called up, and found two of the shutters out of their places; one hung on the rail, and the other stood before the other shutters—they were put back in their places—I am in the habit of putting up the shutters—they were not, in my opinion, in such a position as to have been brought there by a tap from outside; they appeared as if some one had put their band at the bottom and pulled them out—I had fastened the shutters myself the night before—there was a piece of beef at the back of the shop when I went to bed, and in the morning that was lying on the block in front of the window—it had been removed about five yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you the last up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I cannot say who was—I left the shop about 10 o'clock—the shutters have been blown down twice—I was the last person who had anything to do with the beef—I fastened the shutters in the usual manner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nineteen years old. I was servant to Mrs. Metcalf at Newington. On Friday morning, the 30th of June, about twelve o'clock, I went out for some porter—my mistress and her sister were in the house at the time—as I went out, I saw the prisoner on the grass plot in front of the house, with some ornamental shavings for stoves, in a blue handkerchief—he was about two yards from the front parlour window—there was a beautiful time-piece on the mantel-piece there—I saw the prisoner again a day or two afterwards in custody, and am confident he is the man—I was taken up to be a witness myself—I dare say I was gone a quarter of an hour for the beer—the window was wide open when I went, and when I came back I saw my mistress reaching out of the window, to get the shavings which were on the ground, close under the window—they were in the same blue handkerchief I had seen the man with.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you go for the beer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the top of West-street, about a quarter of a mile from the house—there was a public-house nearer than that—I have lived with my mistress about six months—a gentleman comes twice a week to see my mistress—he does not always sleep there—he goes next morning about ten o'clock—I have come from prison now—I was sent there to give evidence—I was discharged from my situation, and I was sent to the poor-house first—I did not say any thing to the man when I saw him in the front garden, nor to my mistress—I have always said it was twelve o'clock that I went out—I am quite sure of that—I did not say it was eleven o'clock—what I said before the Magistrate was read over to me, and I made my mark to it.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated it was eleven o'clock when she went out for the beer, and that she left the window a little way open.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, having heard that read, was it not about eleven o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think it was—I am sure the window was wide open when I went my—I did not say before the Magistrate that it was a little way open—I think it was a little way open—I did not say any thing before the Magistrate about my mistress reaching out of the window when I came back—I had been in service twelve months before I lived with my mistress—she did not lose the time-piece before, while I was with her.</p>

                  </hi>. The last witness was my servant. I sent her for some beer about eleven o'clock in the morning of the 30th of June—she was away about a quarter of an hour—I went into the front parlour be fore she went for the beer, to see the time, and the time-piece was then on the mantel-piece—the window was a little way open then—I went into the parlour again just as she was coming back, and the window was wide open, and the time-piece gone—under the window, outside, I found a bundle of shavings in a blue handkerchief—I had no shavings in my par lour—there were the marks of a man's shoe under the window—my servant was very insolent after going to Union Hall—she would not do her</p>

               <p>work, and said if I discharged her I should have the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay, as I was bound over to appear, and that was the cause of her going away—she went to the poor-house at first—she was not charged with being concerned in this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time did you look at the clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eleven o'clock—I once before had the time-piece taken out of the window, but got it back again—the room had been swept, and the window was open—the man who took the clock the first time was caught by a person who took it from him, and he got off—there was only me and my sister in the house, besides my servant—no gentleman—I shall not answer any him pertinent questions.</p>

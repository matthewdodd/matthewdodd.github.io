                  </hi>. I am cellarman to Messrs. James Goding and Company. There are other partners, I believe—there is a cellar where a particular sort of ale is placed—it is my duty to lock and take charge of that cellar—I had suspicion that ale was taken out at different times, and watched—on Thursday evening, the 28th of May, about nine o'clock, an hour and a half after the premises were locked up, I went to the cellar, and, on opening the door, I heard a noise of somebody falling over a pail—it struck me that somebody was in the cellar—I left the door a little ajar, and heard somebody come to the top of the stairs, and make a peculiar noise of clucking, like a hen calling her chickens—on looking up I perceived a person on the watch, and, on looking down the cellar, I perceived somebody moving backwards and forwards, there being no light in the cellar but through an air-hole—he walked up to the door—I laid hold of him, and it was Douglas—he was a miller on the premises, and had no business in the cellar at that time of night, and could not have got in by any fair means—I said, " Douglas, I know you"—about a second afterwards Newberry came up, with a can containing ale—he came up to the top of the stairs—he ran round to make his escape—I said, "Newberry, I know you, that is sufficient"—he threw down the can, and ran away—there was about a gallon of ale in it—it was spilt—the can belonged to the men in the tun-room, to drink out of—I left the prisoners in the storehouse, and took the can to the watchman—next day I told the clerk, and they were taken into custody.</p>

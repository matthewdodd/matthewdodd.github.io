                  </hi>. I keep a public-house in Palace New-road, Lambeth. The prisoner was in my service about nine months—he was em<lb></lb>ployed to receive money on my account sometimes, from my regular cuto<lb></lb>mers—he usually paid me on a Saturday night, but there was no time in parti<lb></lb>cular—there was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from Mrs. Farrell—I directed the prisoner to recieve it on Saturday night, the 18th of Feb.—he did not return till the Tuesday night following—he was then intoxicated, and I said nothing to him that night—on Wednesday morning I asked if he had got any money for me he said no—there was then due to me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that week's account, exclusive of this 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was due from customers of his own—I allowed him a halfpenny a pot for selling it, but Mrs. Farrell's was a private account</p>

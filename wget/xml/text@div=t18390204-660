                  </hi>. I live in Chester-place, Bethnal-green. On Sunday evening, the 30th of December, about eight o'clock—I was sitting in my room and heard a whistle—I turned ray head and saw another boy hand my till to the prisoner at the door—I saw the prisoner's dress perfectly by the gas light, and I saw the prisoner again in about two minutes—I had had the till in my shop, and there was in it a half-crown, two shillings, one sixpence, fourteen penny-pieces, and thirty-eight half-pence—I had counted them not ten minutes before—the other boy ran away, and my son took the prisoner with the till under his arm—he said if I would let him go, he would go and get me the money back—a gentle<lb></lb>man gave me my till at the door—the half-pence were in it, but the silver was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's son. I was outside the house, and saw a lad get from the step of the door off his knees, and hand the prisoner the till—the prisoner was standing at the end of the shop-window—I thought he was cutting the glass, and I would give him a slap on the head—but when he received the till, I took him by the two shoulders, and the till fell from under his arm, and he fell on his two hands—it was my mother's till that fell from him.</p>

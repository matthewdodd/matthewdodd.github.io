                  </hi>. I live in Upper Smith-street, Northampton-square. I have known the prisoner nine or ten months—he was introduced as Cap<lb></lb>tain Frew—he stated he was in the 35th Madras Infantry—some time ago he asked me to lend him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on an £8 bill, for ten days—I consented to do so—he promised to pay it himself, if I would hold the bill till that time—I was to give Thomas Transfield, on account of that bill, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and give the captain the other 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Transfield introduced him to me as Captain Frew, and the captain promised to make me a present when the bill was paid—that bill was never paid—on the 6th of November he drew another bill—I produce that—it was drawn by the prisoner for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the former bill was cancelled—I advanced him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, besides the money for the first bill—this is for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated November 6th, signed "E. W. Frew"—he drew this bill in my presence—before it became due he brought this cheque—he then wished me to take my bill out, and give him the remainder—this is a cheque for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., signed by George Duncan, to Messrs. Coborn and Co., No. 4, Whitehall, dated from Liverpool, October 29th—I said I had not money enough in the house, and I would not do it till I had been to the bank—I went myself to the banker's with it, in the state in which it was—when I advanced the prisoner the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I did it under the impression that he was a Captain Frew, of the East India Company's service—I always thought he was nothing else—I advanced the money to him, believing the promissory note was good and genuine—I have never received a farthing of the money I lent him, neither the first nor second.</p>

               <p>introduced him to me there as Captain Frew—I never heard any other appellation at the tavern—I know that the captain lived at Windsor-ter<lb></lb>race, City-road, where the bill was made payable—I do not know whose house he lived at—I never inquired—I knew where he lived—all these representations occurred at the Eagle-tavern—I advanced my money con<lb></lb>siderably on the personal appearance and respectability of Captain Frew—I cannot tell the day that he first asked me for the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was about two months ago, or perhaps not so much—it was about three weeks before the 6th of November I advanced 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Transfield, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to him, by his order—I never had a written order to pay that 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had nothing but the bill—I did not tell Transfield that 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were deducted for the interest for the eight days—I told him I detained 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back for the captain—I did not keep 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back for interest—I paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the captain the day after I paid the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Transfield, at three o'clock—I do not keep any books, nor does my wife—my wife receives the rents I live on, if I am not in the way—I have four houses, two at Camberwell, and two at Clerkenwell—I was not to receive any weekly payment for this money—the £8 bill was at ten days' date—he burnt it himself in my presence, at the time he gave me the £21 bill—it had become due about a day or two before—he did not draw it at the time I advanced Transfield the money—I paid him the next 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 6th of November, about ten days after I paid him the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—only my wife and myself were present—I paid him the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the same place, and by myself—when he drew this bill he said, "I shall make you a handsome present"—he gave me the £21 bill—I do not know whether he meant to give me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or not—if he had paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should have returned him the change, but I should have taken the legal interest, and not more—that is not my usual way of doing business—I may charge more, but I considered the captain a safe man—I have never given any other money to persons in names that I knew were not theirs—I have never lent a gentleman money, and taken his account in a name that I knew was not his—I might not find it out.</p>

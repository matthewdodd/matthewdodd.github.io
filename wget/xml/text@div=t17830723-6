               <p>On Sunday June 29, about a quarter after eleven at night, I was robbed by one man, he accosted me in very illiberal terms, called me thief, and villain, and ruffian, he damned me a good deal, he carried me from the pavement under the rail, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230020"></xptr> took me by the collar; he said something when he first approached me, but I do not know what it was, to the best of my recollection it was come this way; he pulled my watch out of my sob, I gave him my purse out of my right-hand breeches pocket, and he searched my left-hand breeches pocket, and my two waistcoat pockets.</p>
               <p>What money had you in your purse? - Three guineas and some loose silver; I lost a gold watch, two red cornelian gold seals, one was a cypher, a gold watch-hook, a gold watch key and a metal seal, a sham cornelian, and a steel watch chain.</p>
               <p>How long did you keep under the rails? - Between two and three minutes.</p>
               <p>Was any body passing by at this time? - Not a soul.</p>
               <p>Did he produce any arms? - A pistol, I was walking from <placeName id="t17830723-6-crimeloc26">Great Russell-street</placeName>

               <p>Was you able to take notice enough of the person to know who he was? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know him now? - No.</p>
               <p>Has your property been found again? - Yes in part, the watchmaker has the watch, and one of the Justice's men has the purse.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether that is or is not your watch? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Court to Best. What do you know the watch by? - I know it to be my own watch and number, I had lent it to Mr. Luard about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>I went to search the prisoner's lodgings, No. 12, Castle-court, in the Strand, on Monday the 30th of June, when we first went in there was a lady in the apartments that seemed very busy about the feet of the bed, I desired her to walk into the dining room, and sent a person with her while we searched the bed-chamber; in searching a trunk we found this pistol, loaded with powder and ball; in searching further we found a coat with a key of the street door in the pocket, we then took the lady up to Bow-street, and returned a second time.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose coat that was? - It was in Mr. Atkins's lodgings, we came back and searched again and found nothing, the person that was with me went down to the necessary, to see if there was any thing there, I walked into the ground floor that belonged to the people of the house, and saw this box on the ground there; it then came fresh into my memory, that when I put the lady into the dining room, I had seen that box in that room; in that box we found these three purses.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear that that box was in the room when you first went into the house? - My Lord, I am confident that a box of that size and shape was in the room; I know nothing of the apprehending of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Best. Did you apprehend the prisoner? - He came to my house after Mr. Chadwicke, and I stopped him, to know how he came by it, he said, he had it of one Mr. Hett.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. He went to Mr. Chadwicke's house, before he came to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he came after Mr. Chadwicke, when he came to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He did not hesitate at all, he followed him to the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The purse deposed to by Mr. Luard.)</p>
               <p>I will swear to the purse; that was the purse I was robbed off.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230023"></xptr>Do you know where the prisoner was the night before? - He was at home at half after eleven, in his bed.</p>
               <p>What time did he get up the next morning? - I carried him a pint of ale and a pint of beer, and I asked her if I should put my chain up, that was on Sunday night; I have two keys of the door, one he had himself, and one I kept; the Justice's man has one key; the gentleman never asked me for the key, but I gave it to him one night in case he staid out.</p>
               <p>So he kept a key every night by your consent? - Yes, Sir, I offered it to him, he did not ask me for it.</p>

               <p>What time was he up next morning? - He got up between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Did he stay long in your house after he got up? - I know he breakfasted in the house, I dare say he went out by twelve, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You are sure, you say, that he was in bed by half after eleven at the furthest? - I am sure of that, for I carried her up a pint of porter, and she desired me to bring up a pint of ale, for says she, we shall mix it, says I, is Mr. Atkins come home, and she said, he was in bed; I did not see him, but I heard him cough in his bed, I never saw any thing of him, but like a gentleman, he kept regular hours.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Sunday evening before I was taken, I was walking in the Park, and another gentleman; and I was tapped on the shoulders by another gentleman, I turned about, and it was a Mr. Hett whom I immediately accosted, and asked him where he had been these seven years past, he said, he had been in Ireland, I asked him some questions about an affair that had happened before, and he gave me a decisive answer, he told me that he went off to Ireland, that he was ashamed not to have sent to me, said, he was ashamed to borrow money and not be able to pay it he said, he lodged at the Swan with two Necks; I asked him if he had settled with the people of the house, he said, he had; I said, I wish you would pay me now; he said, he would settle with me in the morning; I asked him to breakfast with me at eleven, I then parted and went home; next morning at eleven o'clock I expected him to breakfast, he did not come, I waited a very short time, and I was determined to go down to Lad-lane, to see where he was; when I went about two streets from my lodgings I met him, I asked him his reason for disappointing me, in not coming to breakfast, he said, his hair-dresser did not come to him in time; so we walked on discoursing about indifferent things, he pulled out his purse, said I, that is a pretty purse, where did you get it, and he said, a lady in Ireland knitted it for him, I looked at it, and produced mine, I offered to change it, says he, I will give it to your wife, if you will give it her; we walked on, says I, can you give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230024"></xptr> me any money, says he, I have a bill on a Lord in town, for 200 l. but he has put me off for a few days, and says he I have no other mode to give you some money than to dispose of my watch, I knew the debt was a bad one, and for my own sake I took the watch, which I certainly should not have done from any other gentleman; he told me he bought it of Mr. Best, in Cornhill, says I, if you will go there yourself he will give you a better price for it, says he, you will do it better, I shall be ashamed; I consented to do so, I went down as far as Cornhill, and just by Cornhill I went into a shop to enquire for Mr. Best, I told the gentleman my business; I shewed him the watch, he asked me what I wanted for it, I said, twenty-five guineas; he said, he would shew me the way down to Mr. Best's house; I went into a silver-smith's shop, and I asked this gentleman to buy the watch, Sir, says he, will you shew it me; I saw him go out, and I immediately supposed, in my mind, that he was gone to the maker, I went to Mr. Best's shop myself, Sir, says I, this gentleman has shewn you a watch, I told him, I had a commission from a gentleman to dispose of it, Sir, says he, a gentleman has been robbed of it last night, says I, the gentleman that gave it to me is now standing at the corner of the street, and I requested of him several times to let me go out, he would not, nor would he send anybody there; I sent a constable to Lad-lane to enquire for him, but there is no account of him, I am informed, he is gone Ireland.</p>

               <p>I live in Salisbury-street.</p>
               <p>Do you know all the connections of this young man? - Very well, very reputable connections and family in Ireland, they are all there and I am the only person in this country to whom he could apply; he is a very distant relation of mine, but so distant that I cannot trace it, nor my father.</p>
               <p>What general character has this young gentleman at the bar? - I never knew any wrong of him; he came last November with a letter from Ireland, and introduced himself to me by that means; he was in the horse in Ireland, in the blues, five or six years ago he sold out; he wished to go abroad.</p>
               <p>What is his general character? - I never knew any harm of him, he never visited me much, nor was I ever out of the house with him, all his connections are in Ireland, every one, he has a brother, very respectable uncles and the most reputable kind of relations.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You observe, that from the time the prisoner went out in the morning he never returned at all, then how could this purse be found locked up in the box; it is therefore impossible that he could receive the purse from Hett; that is a very strong and a very pointed contradiction; a robbery was committed late on Sunday night, and the property is found on the prisoner the next morning totally unaccounted for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, it was in the Park when I asked Mr. Hett for money that he gave me the purse, it was in the Park on the Sunday night, I made a mistake in that respect.</p>
               <p>Court. Then that is directly contrary to what you said before.</p>

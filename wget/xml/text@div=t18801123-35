                  </hi>. I am an advertising agent, and reside at South View, Hampton—on 24th July last I was on the river in a pair-oared outrigger, with my wife, Mr. and Mrs. Baliard, and two children of theirs, one about nine months old, and the other three years—I hare been more or less accustomed to the Thames ever since I was 10 years old—I am now 35—I have lived in my present house about six years—my wife is one of the most accomplished oarswomen on the Thames, and has had great experience—we have been up to Oxford a dozen times, and she has always steered when I was rowing; and she am row as well as I can—on the day in question we started from my own place at 2.45 for Staines—we proceeded on our journey there in a perfectly satisfactory manner—we expected to meet Mr. Ballard's father there, and as we did not meet him we had some tea at the Angel, and started for home at 8.45—the first lock we came to was at Penton Hook, which we passed at 9.15—we arrived at Cherteey about half an hour later; not quite so late as 9.45; I have not the time but at Staines Mr. Baliard looked at his watch to make the time correct by the church clock, and also the clock at the hotel—in Chertsey Lock we asked a launch to tow us up—on leaving Chertsey we kept down the middle of the stream, to get the benefit of it, and a little over to the jurrey shore, nearly mid-stream—my wife remarked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230058"></xptr>
               <p>that she saw a light, and said she had better steer into the Surrey shore—I turned round over my right shoulder and said, "Quite right," and she did so, slightly—I turned round and looked a few seconds afterwards, and the light was much closer to us—she still continued to steer to clear the light—at the time I first turned round, when she spoke to me, I judged the light to be about 200 yards off; I now think it was 100 yards—the second time I looked round it was much closer, about half the distance, perhaps 50 yards off, as I should estimate then—my wife was steering entirely herself—she still continued steering near the Surrey shore, when soon after something made me start up, and I saw the launch coming in to us at an angle of about 45—thinking it was a very small craft I got up with the intention of staving it off with my hands, but the launch immediately struck us on the port bow, and I was thrown violently into the water—my idea was that the launch striking like that chucked me out—in my opinion I was jerked out by the launch striking the boat—I appeared to be under the water some considerable time, as when I came to the top I could see nothing but the launch, as near at I could judge about 100 yards off, up the river, above me; of course I floated down—I called out to them, but got no answer—I then tried to swim back, but could not make any headway at all against the stream, and, feeling exhausted, I struck out for the Middlesex shore, where a policeman gave me a hand out—soon after Mr. Desvignes came back with the launch to where I was, perhaps in about five minutes, and my own boat floated down past me in the river, moderately close to the shore—when Mr. Desvignes came back he pressed me to go on to the boiler and warm myself, and after some persuasion I did so—soon after the lock-keeper from Shepperton came down—the launch remained stationary for a very considerable time—the lock-keeper said, "Ah, Mr. Desvignes, I told you what would happen"—I asked him for his explanation, but he said he was not in a position to give it me; he would not tell me—I am not sure whether that was in Mr. Desvignes's presence; I think not—I complained to Mr. Desvignes about the light being a very insignificant one, and quite unfitted for a boat of such dimensions—while he was warming us in the place he said, two or three times, "Don't make it too hot for me"—Mr. Ballard replied to him rather sharply, I don't recollect the words—after that he took us back in the launch to Shepperton Lock, and we were dressed by the look-keeper, and afterwards went home in a cab—the spot where I rose to the surface was about 200 yards from Docket's Point—I can't tell how long I was under water; it was about 100 yards from Docket's Point that the collision happened, and I was about 100 yards from Docket's Point when I came to the surface—the collision occurred at 9.57; I knew that from Mr. Ballard's watch, which stopped—I saw the watch—the launch was too far off for me to say whether she was in motion when I rose to the surface—I heard a whistle, perhaps two minutes before the collision—I heard no more; no whistle anywhere nearer within the time when we saw the light—I heard a whistle pre<lb></lb>viously—I don't know to whom it belonged; I could not tell whether it was from a launch going down stream or anything else—I only heard one whistle—I could not hear the engines of the launch; they are perfectly silent; they make about the same noise as a sewing-machine would—at the time of the collision she must have been going at least 12 miles an hour or more—nobody on board the launch took any notice of the boat</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230059"></xptr>
               <p>before the collision—I heard no shout; she did not alter her course at all; it was too rapid for that—I saw her three times altogether—from the way the boat struck, and from Mr. Desvignes's own eyidence, I imagine he turned her into us at the last second—I saw the light twice before she struck us—she was keeping on in the same line; we were trying to clear her—I did not see the launch till it was close on to us—I say she must have turned in just before striking us—I did not know that it was a steam-launch coming on to us till she was within a few feet of us—the second time I turned round I knew it was a steam-launch by the pace she had travelled; I knew it was not a barge, a sailing-boat, or a rowing<lb></lb>boat, it came too quickly—I was present at the inquest—it was an inquest on the deceased person—Mr. Desvignes made a statement there—he said that he himself was steering the launch and driving, but it required Dagwell, the stoker, to reverse the engines, Dagwell was attending to the stoke-hole and reversing the engines—I have since seen and examined the steam-launch—it is about 60 feet long, within two or three inches, steel-plated, about 18 inches out of the water, with only two large compartments to sit people down, but no accommodation whatever in the shape of awning or covering—there was a small stoke-hole, about three feet deep, a very short funnel, with a boiler-plate about five inches above the stem—I think she drew about 10 inches on one side and About 18 on the other—there was a place on the funnel where a light could have been hooked to; when I saw it afterwards it was on the boiler-plate—I can't tell whether it had been there before; it could be moved at pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We expected to meet Mr. Ballard'e father at Staines—he was not going to join us in the boat; we should most likely have come home by train, or by a dog-cart—it was at the option of the ladies whether they liked to go home by boat or not; we had not formed any opinion; it would have been a matter entirely for afterthought; they would probably have come home by the dog-cart—my wife was steering between Staines and Ghertsey—I can't say whether the children were asleep after we left Chertsey—one of them was not lying down in the bottom of the boat; one was in Mrs. Ballard's arms and the other between them, I believe, but I was rowing, and have not a very definite recollec<lb></lb>tion—when I was first examined before the Coroner I said that the launch was 300 yards off when I first saw it, but that was a <hi rend="italic">lapsus lingua</hi>, and I corrected it—I say the launch was going 12 miles an hour from the rapidity with which the light came on me—I could not have said before the Magistrate that one of my reasons for arriving at the rate of speed was that Mr. Desvignes was unable to save any one of those in the boat, because he saved Mr. Ballard—the two reasons I gave were the rapidity with which the launch came on us, and the distance she had gone when I came to the surface—the accident took place about 200 yards above Docket Point—when I came to the surface I was about 100 yards from the launch, as near as I could guess; I was then about 100 yards above Docket Point—the launch was not standing over the place where the accident happened; she must have gone beyond that, she had travelled 60 or 70 yards from, the point of the accident, I could not tell whether she was moving or not when I came to the surface, I saw her black hull, nothing else; I did not see her light—she was probably still pointing up stream, I don't know; I could see nothing but a black mass—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230060"></xptr>
               <p>I say I gathered the pace from the rapidity with which she came on us, I don't mean her speed at the actual moment of the accident, I mean her speed up to the time when I jumped up—she came too quickly for me to say whether she had slowed—I can't say whether she had stopped at all or not; I was barely on my feet before I was in the water—I can't say whether the stem of the launch struck us or not, but I should imagine not—I had a very severe injury to my throat and one of my knees, but I should not think the launch struck me, I think I must have come across something, I don't attribute it to the launch; it would have cut me in halves—I am a trifle short-sighted—when I first saw the light it was coming round the bend, I should think nearer the Middlesex shore—I saw it over my right shoulder when I turned round—I was not steering, I only glanced round and saw it, and we steered close to the Surrey shore—I had perfect confi<lb></lb>dence in the steering—I looked round again after two strokes, and still we had not cleared it—seeing the light across there we kept steering to get away from it—it appeared nearly in the same direction as it was at first, only much closer—I don't recollect noticing the other shore at all, it was all too sudden—I noticed our own shore, the Surrey shore, that we were on—I made no observation of the course which the light was travel<lb></lb>ling with relation to the shore of the river; we only wanted to get out of the way of it—I saw Burgoyne's launch at Ohertsey lock—I judged it to be his—I have often seen it on the river—we left Chertsey lock together, at the same time—I forget whether he got away first—we asked him to give us a tow; he said he was very late—I am perfectly certain that I only heard one whistle before the accident happened—no one in the boat called attention to the fact of a whistle having been sounded—I did not think about its being a steam launch whistle—we simply looked round again, and looked and steered to get out of the way of any light, which was the correct thing to do—when I saw it afterwards I supposed it to have been Burgoyne's whistle, but there was nothing at the time to mark it on my memory—I dare say we all heard it, but there was nothing to guard against—I did not know what the light was—I should always steer away from a light, because you cannot tell whether it is a steam launch or anything else—an inquest was held on three days, and Mr. Desvignes was examined, and gave his account of the transaction—Sir George Nares was there—I don't know who he represented—I heard the verdict of the Jury on the third day—I have never laid the matter before the Public Prosecutor—I took out a summons in this case, I suppose about the middle of October, I really forget; you must ask my solicitor—it is very likely that my solicitor has issued a writ against Mr. Des<lb></lb>vignes within the last fortnight—he would not act without my instructions—I have instructed him to do it, at his option.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I consulted Mr. Galmoye in this matter from the first time, at the inquest—I have left it entirely to his discretion—if Mr. Desvignes had offered me any expression of sympathy I should not have taken it—I heard the sound of a whistle long before anybody in the boat sighted the light—I think there was an interval of about two minutes between the whistle and the sight of the light; it might be a minute; as I have said, there was nothing to fix it—my suggestion is that when I rose to the surface I was 60 yards from the spot where the accident occurred—my recollection is not distinct—when I came to the surface I only saw the black hull of the launch—I wanted to save anybody's life,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230061"></xptr>
               <p>and when I found I could not do that I naturally looked after my own—it was about nine or ten seconds from the first sighting of the light and my standing to my feet—after saying before the Coroner that it was 300 yards off when the light was sighted I corrected myself directly—I spoke to Mr. Galmoye about it—I don't recollect whether the notes of my evidence were read to me before the Coroner, I was very ill at the time—I now desire to correct it to 100 yards, because I thought it was a launch light, the ordinary proper light, and of course that would look very diffe<lb></lb>rent to a light little bigger than a policeman's bull's-eye—it was a feebler light than the ordinary, which is quite a blaze of light—very possibly the position of the light had something to do with my inaccuracy of estimate, I can't say—it may have been shifted, or I may not have seen it—it may have been covered by the boiler part at the time—I formed the conclusion that it was a steam launch the second time X looked round, by the rapidity the light had travelled—at that time we were about one and a half or two boats' lengths from her.</p>

My boat is 25 feet long all but a few inches—I had double sculls—I was in the front of the boat, in the centre of the thwarts—I know the river well at that part—there is always a good stream there—I should think it was running about one and a half or two miles an hour—it would not be setting off on to, the Surrey side, the other way, towards the Middlesex shore—it was very slack that day, certainly not more than two miles an hour—I could feel from the pace our boat tra<lb></lb>velled—we went up almost as fast as we came back, so I put the very extreme on it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 24th July I went in a skiff up the river with my wife and two children, and Mr. and Mrs. Newcomb, starting from Hampton and going to Staines; Mrs. Newcomb steered; we started from Staines on the return journey about 8.45—I compared my watch with the church clock at Staines, you can see it from the bridge, and it coincided—I am a jeweller by business and understand watches—I can't say that I noticed the time in coming from Staines at either of the locks before the accident—I cannot tell what the time was at Penton Hook or Chertsey—Mrs. Newcomb steered the whole of the way; my wife was sitting on Mrs. Newcombe's left hand, one of the children was in my wife's arms, and the other was between them on the seat—I was pulling a pair of sculls, rowing stroke—after we left Chertsey we were nearer the Surrey than the Middlesex side—I noticed Mr. Burgoyne's launch in the last lock we passed through, and we asked them if they would tow us down—I have been in Manchester eight years, and consequently have not had much chance of being on the river, but I have been on it every summer I dare say—I cannot tell the exact point at which the accident happened—my attention was first attracted by a remark from the ladies that there was something coming—I think we both turned round and looked, and I think Mr. Newcomb remarked, "It's all right, but you had better keep a little nearer the Surrey side"—Mrs. New<lb></lb>comb acted upon that and turned the nose slightly towards the Surrey shore—I turned over my right shoulder and saw the light; we never heard anything—I don't think I saw the light again before the accident; I saw the launch, but I could not say that I saw the light—the next thing was a frightened remark from one of the Indies, "They are coming into us," or words to that effect, and in a very short space of time I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230062"></xptr>
               <p>in the water; I turned round and just had time to see that the launch was coming, and the next moment we were struck and I was in the water—I felt the keel of the launch; it seemed to draw me to it, as I suppose it naturally would, till it passed over me, and when I came to the surface I was some distance astern of the launch—I don't think I could swim a dozen yards; when I came to the surface I picked up an oar, and then a life-buoy and a rope were thrown to me from the launch, and L was taken on board—the launch then went to the Middlesex shore, I think, where Mr. Newcomb was with the horse-patrol—Mr. Desvignes was on the launch when I was picked up; he asked me how many there were in the boat, and I told him—I don't think much occurred before we got to the bank—I think the launch was backed into the Middlesex side, but I did not notice; we landed near a small farmhouse there, a few yards above it, I think it is called Docket's farm; somebody came out of the house to us—I got off the launch and then got on again—the lock-keeper had not come up at that time, he came up soon after—I don't re<lb></lb>member whether Mr. Desvignes went on to the bank before the lock-keeper came, or not; I fancy he was on board the launch when the lock-keeper came up—the launch was close to the bank then; the lock-keeper was standing on the tow-path, close to the launch; he said to Mr. Des<lb></lb>vignes, "I told you what would happen;" he was very excited—Mr. Desvignes could hear him; he did not make any answer that I am aware of—when I went on board the launch again Mr. Desvignes said to me, "Don't make it hard for me;" he said that several times to me per<lb></lb>sonally; at one time Mr. Newcomb was present—I said I thought it was very unmanly to make use of such an expression as that; he seemed to think only of himself—we wore taken back to Shepperton that night—the launch was coming quick when the accident occurred; as to giving the number of miles an hour, I don't think I could, because it would require some experience to judge of the speed—nothing was called out to us, or any alarm given from the launch; we never heard anything from the launch at all—I saw the position of the light after I was on board the launch; it was on the top, about three inches above the deck, above the edge of the boat, above the gunwale, in the centre, at the bottom of the funnel, in front of it, not on the bow; not fastened at all, but just simply placed there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a lantern placed directly in front of the funnel, about three inches above the stem of the boat—I think I have said that when I first saw the light it was about 80 or 100 yards off; it is very difficult to tell, but that was the distance I put it at—I would not like to swear that it may not have been 300 yards off, because it is always difficult to judge the distance, particularly on a dark night; I may have said before the Magistrate 100 to 150 yards—Mrs. Newcomb steered the whole way; when the remark was made that we were to go to the Surrey side she had the tiller ropes in her hands, because she steered the boat that way—I did not see anybody else take hold of the ropes—I did not see the body of Mrs. Ballard directly it was taken out of the water, I saw it a little time after, and the ropes were round both her arms, very far up, by the shoulders—these were separate ropes; they were wound round and round both her arms; you might almost imagine they had been put round; the top part of the rudder had come unshipped, and was attached to them—when I saw Mrs. Newcomb steering I cannot be quite certain whether she had the lines under her arms or over her shoulders.—my wife had been on the water before, but she had no practical know<lb></lb>ledge</p>

               <p>of working a boat—when Mr. Newcomb turned round and saw the light he said, "It's all right, but you had better keep a little nearer the Surrey side"—I understood by that that there was something coming, what we could not tell—we saw the light; I should take it that it was a light belonging to some vessel; that it was a moving light—I am not well acquainted with the river now, because I have been away from it for a good number of year—it was a moonlight night, only there were some clouds about occasionally, but there were times when we could see across the river; the moon was nearly full—I put it down that the light belonged to something, and that there was a possibility that it was coming our way; we were not sure, but for safety we steered for the Surrey side; I was not in charge of the boat; Mr. Newcomb knew the river, and I did not; I thought Mr. and Mrs. Newcomb were better judges than I—I did not stand up in the boat at the moment of the collision; Mr. New-comb stood up, that was all—the ladies had rugs wrapped round them, over their knees—I believe those rugs were afterwards picked up out of the water—there was a reticule in the boat; I know my wife had one—I believe there were loose cushions, which they were sitting on—there were no books loose; there was one in a drawer, I believe—I don't remember seeing the boat floating down the river after the accident; when I came to the surface I had been carried down stream some distance—I think I was about 30 yards from the launch when I came to the surface—I was asked at the inquest whether Mr. Desvignes did not do everything possible to save life, and I said, "Yes, he certainly threw me a life-buoy and a rope from the launch, and they did all in their power to save me"—I said that I personally had no charge whatever to make against Mr. Desvignes—I saw a steam-launch leaving Ohertsey Look; I knew afterwards that it was Mr. Burgoyne's; I was not aware of it at the time—I heard a whistle before the accident; I might have heard two—that was some little time before we saw the light for the first time, some considerable time, I think, before; it is rather difficult to fix a time; there was nothing to impress it on my memory—before we saw the light Mr. Burgoyne's boat had disappeared round Docket's Point; we lost sight of his launch very soon after leaving the lock—I did not look round when I heard the whistle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mrs. Ballard's body was recovered about 10 next morning; I drove over from Hampton; the body was being brought on shore after I had been there, I think it was actually recovered while I was there—I did not see it landed, not till it was put where the bodies were laid—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the top of the rudder with the lines that were found—I did not notice very particularly how the lines were round my wife's body; there are other people who have noticed it, they can give it you very much better. Mrs. Newcomb's body was recovered before my wife's—my watch stopped at 9.57.</p>

I am a pretty good sculler—I can scull a pair—Mr. Newcombe is a very good sculler, he is fully qualified in every respect—I should think we were going through the water five or fix miles an hour with the stream—she is not a heavy boat, it is just the sort of skiff you would take to go from Oxford—we remarked just previously how easily she was riding—we should go four miles an hour against the stream and I should think eight with the stream—I should judge that we were going</p>

               <p>about six miles an hour through the water—there was no wind to inter<lb></lb>fere with the steering; there was no labour, one arm worked as easy as the other—the fact of the boat riding easy proved that the steering was right—I seemed to be a long time under water—I was exhausted when I came up—I cannot swim, but with the help of an oar I picked up I managed to keep myself afloat till I had the life-buoy—I was perhaps under the water the best part of a minute—a very little time elapsed between my rising to the surface and getting the life-buoy—I was picked up within a minute and a half; they were some time getting me up the side, because I could not help myself—I did not notice whether the launch was still pointing head against stream or whether she had got across the river at all; but from the fact of our going back to Shepperton, and we did not turn round afterwards, I think it must have turned round; he could not have turned round in the time, before I was picked up—I think we went to the bank almost directly I was picked up; they said, "Who have you got there?" and they said "A man;" we went to the bank to see who was saved—I had no idea that my wife and children were lost—I saw the boat next morning at Shepperton, not at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lock-keeper at Molesey—on the evening of 24th July, I remember Mr. Desvignes's launch passing through the lock at 8. 40—it might have been a minute or two later, that was while he was in the lock—there was no light on the launch at that time—I com<lb></lb>pute the distance from Molesey to Sunbury Lock at three miles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lock-keeper at Sunbury—I remember on the 24th July last Mr. Desvignes's launch passing through my lock in the even<lb></lb>ing—it was 9 o'clock when he. arrived at the lock, and five minutes past nine when he left it—the launch had no light on it—I lent him one; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the launch was not detained any time before the gates were opened—I was waiting for him—I had two rowing boats going up, and seeing the launch I waited to receive it—it would take five minutes to get through—I believe it is rather over three miles from Molesey to my lock—I am positive that my watch was quite correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is a double wicked lamp which I lent him—it throws a light which you can see for quite two miles, in a clear reach—it is a deal better than many boats use on the river—it is better than many single lights—it was a suitable light for Mr. Desvignes to carry, or I would not have lent it to him—to the best of my belief it was placed on the port side of the funnel, on the top of the boiler case—I cannot say for certain whether the funnel is amidships; I think it is rather forward—the boiler case would be between the funnel and the stem—the lamp would throw a light straight over the stem of the boat, and on both sides, and better than when the light is carried so high, because</p>

               <p>in running between the bushes, if you get close on the land, the boat will obstruct the light; and that is how I am afraid a great many mis<lb></lb>takes are made with craft running alongside of the river with lights too high—I did not advise him where to place the light—I simply left it to his discretion—I think it was placed in the proper place—I should hate placed it there if I had been in the same position—I have seen the row<lb></lb>ing boat in question—I have been nearly 13 years the lock-keeper of Sunbury, previous to that time I was at sea—I should think from the condition of the boat after the accident, the launch must have been going at a very slow rate of speed indeed—if she had been going a very heavy rate of speed, the boat, being a small one, would have been completely smashed up—the amount of injury done to the boat indicates, to my mind, that the launch could not have been going at a very great pace—I do not think she would have cut through her, she was bound to have gone clean over her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That would of course depend upon the exact angle at which the blow was struck, and also whether the boat gave way on being struck—I have seen rowing boats row into one another, and I have seen considerably more damage done than this—I never lent my lamp to any<lb></lb>body before this, and never shall again—I hate no other lamp to lend—I have frequently seen Mr. Desvignes travelling at night before this—he has always carried his side lights previous to this—I mean red and green lights—the stoke-hole is behind the chimney—I cannot say where the steering wheel is—I am not quite sure whether it is before or abaft the funnel—I have not driven a steam launch by night in this part of the river—I have in the lower part, but not by Teddington Lock—I have no experience of that.</p>

Mr. Desvignes usually carried two lights when I have seen him late at night before; but it is so very seldom he is late at night—there are a good many steam launches upon the upper Thames—very frequently there are 25 or 26 through my look in one day—I think some of them carried a single light previous to the accident, and some of them none at all, but since the accident they are all getting the side lights—we now have a notice of the obedience or disobedience of the Conserv<lb></lb>ancy rules—the order came out in the forepart of the season, that if boats have no lights at all we have power to detain them—I should have detained Mr. Desvignes that night if he had not asked me for a light—he did ask me to let him have a light—it was a bright white light—so far he was complying with the rules—he told me that in starting away for the Kingston Regatta in the moraine they were rather late, and through the neglect of some of his men they omitted to put the lights on board, and at Molesey Lock the Maria Wood was coming down, and they were detained for 20 or 25 minutes—he gave me that as his reason for being without lights.</p>

I am lock-keeper in the service of the Thames Con<lb></lb>servancy at Shepperton Lock—that is 8 miles and 7 furlongs above Sunbury—Mr. Desvignes's launch entered my lock at about 10 minutes to 10 o'clock on this night—I can fill my lock in about two minutes and a half—on this night it took me about three minutes—we had to empty it to let a boat down, and Mr. Desvignes had to wait outside—I kept him waiting as far as I could judge about three minutes—that would be the ordinary time—I saw the police patrol pass on the towing path; I stood</p>

               <p>talking to him—I do not know how long he had passed by before Mr. Desvignes passed out of my lock—I remember saying to Mr. Desvignes "Be careful, sir, for I fear there is a plant on to-night"—I heard Mr. Burgoyne's launch whistle that night for the lock—I kept my eyes open for him—I saw him pass Docket's Point just about the spot where he would pass Mr. Desvignes—from the time of Mr. Desvignes's launch coming out the lock was not closed again until Mr. Burffoyne's launch came into it—Docket's Point is about half a mile from the lock—I passed Mr. Burgoyne's launch, the Formosa, through my lock before I heard of the accident—the next thing I saw was the police officer on horseback, he galloped past my place, and he gave me instructions to go up there, as a dreadful accident had occurred—I went to the spot as soon as I possibly could—he got there before me—I had to walk about half a mile before I got to the place—I found Mr. Desvignes's launch lying close to the bank—I did not see Mr. Desvignes for some time; I could not say exactly how long, it might have been two minutes after I reached the spot—Mr. Ballard and Mr. Newcomb were lying on what is said to be the casing of the boiler on board of the launch—the bow of the launch was then pointing down stream, I think—I can hardly be positive of that now—when I first saw Mr. Desvignes he appeared to me to be walking from the cottage to where the steam launch was lying—I said to him "Oh, Mr. Desvignes, how did this happen?"—I did not say "Ah, Mr. Desvignes, I told you this would happen"—I am quite sure of that; nor "I told you what would happen;" nothing of the kind—I remember using the expression that it was a singular thing that it was only this afternoon that I should have made a remark that we should soon have another Princess Alice disaster if steam launches would go on like that—I said that just as I was leaving the steam launch, to some gentleman on the bank—he was referring to some steam launch that came through the locks in the afternoon with a party of gentlemen on board, I was letting four boats out of my lock, and a steam launch was waiting, I saw them start full speed ahead to come in the look, and I held up both my hands and sang out at the top of my voice, with the aid of my assistant, "There are four boats coming out," they paid no attention, but rushed in the lock when the four boats were coming out—it was then I made the remark—I said to my assistant "If they go on like this we shall have a serious accident"—after this accident happened I was in the, kitchen, Mr. Ballard and Mr. Newcomb were there, in and out, and my wife also, as well as Mr. Desvignes and several young gentlemen who were camping outside—I heard Mr. Desvignes say "Speak the truth, or it will go hard for me"—he was addressing Mr. Newcomb—I could not say what observation of Mr. Newcomb's called for that expression, I was finding the clothes for them.</p>

               <p>them to the best of my ability, we cannot always do it—we know how long it will take to enter—Mr. Desvignes's launch came through before the Formosa—there was one boat coming out; that was why I had to detain Mr. Desvignes outside—I had not to fill the look again, the look was ready—when I let the boat out Mr. Desvigues came in—it would take about two minutes to fill the lock and get it away again—there was nothing else in after Mr. Desvignes's—from the Lock House I can see Docket's Point—the Formosa whistled before I could see her—she had not then turned Docket's Point—at that time Mr. Desvignes's launch had got out of my lock and was going up stream—the next thing I heard was a whistle to tell me that a steam launch was coming round Docket's Point, and then I saw it was the Formosa—the patrol left my lock house shortly before Mr. Desvignes's launch started—I was filling my lock, and had just shut the gate when the patrol spoke to me and went on—he was very little ahead of Mr. Desvignes's launch—I could not see the launch after it left my lock—the patrol was going on along the towing path.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was a cloudy moonlight night—it was a clear atmo<lb></lb>sphere, but there were dark clouds which obstructed the moon at times—the Formosa had her port and starboard lights, red and green, and a white masthead light.</p>

I did not look at my watch, but I have two things to go by in taking the time; when the Formosa was in the lock the look was being emptied, as three church clocks struck 10 o'clock, she stopped in the lode, and after it was emptied, for 10 minutes; then I looked at the time, and then I knew it must be just about 10 minutes to 10 o'clock when Mr. Desvignes was there—it is only a guess, I did not see the time—I saw some light—it really was not, in my humble judgment, sufficient, but there are plenty worse than that considerably—it ought to have been a little brighter, but you could see it at a long distance—I should think it would hardly be sufficient on a dark hazy night—on a dark hazy night like that I should think you could see it for about two miles—Docket's Point is half a mile from my look, and the accident was 200 yards farther than Docket's Point—I could not form any opinion as to the rate the stream was running, but on that particular day the water was lower than in any part of the summer, and that would have a ten<lb></lb>dency to reduce the stream—the look is constantly at work—when there is not much water in the river that does not make the stream go faster—I do not know at what rate the stream was running at the place where the accident happened—I do not think more than three miles an hour, it might be a little more or less—it might be going more than two—it is a question I can hardly speak distinctly upon—I should think it would be between two and three miles—I think that would be very reasonable.</p>

I am one of the mounted police—on the evening of 24th July I was on duty, doing my ordinary patrol beat on horse<lb></lb>back—I have been a patrol for some time; I have had the same horse for five years—I have timed the pace of my horse between stations when I have been going with despatches; the utmost he does he four miles an hour, that is walking; in fact, it is more than he is able to do—on this night I remember being at Shepperton Lock on my beat—after leaving there I rode up the towing-path on the Middlesex side—I saw Mr. Des<lb></lb>vignes's launch—it might be about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after leaving Shepperton Look, I could not say exactly; I had ridden</p>

               <p>about half a mile; I had got up to Docket's Point—the launch overtook me; I suppose it was going about 3 1/2 miles an hour—my horse was keeping pace with it for about 100 yards—I saw the Formosa before that 100 yards had been covered, they both rounded the point together; I heard a whistle—I saw them pass each other—Mr. Desvignes passed on the Middlesex side, and Mr. Burgoyne on the Surrey side—after my going the 100 yards side by side with Mr. Desvignes's launch she steamed away from me, wont faster—the next thing that attracted my attention was a crash and some screams; that might have been three minutes after the launch had steamed away, or not so much—I galloped up to the spot where the occurrence took place, still going up stream; I had to gallop about 200 yards—I dismounted and took off my clothes, and was in the act of jumping in when I heard the screams, I thought there was some<lb></lb>body in the water—I saw Mr. Newcomb in shore, and I helped to pull him out; he complained of his knees being hurt—I saw Mr. Desvignes's launch then about mid-stream, still, and I saw Mr. Desvignes working to and fro with his boat-hook—I asked him how many he had saved; he said one gentleman only; he said there were more people in the river—then I ran down some distance and got into a boat close to Docket's Point, and rowed about to see if I could find any bodies floating; I could find none—I don't remember seeing Mr. Newcomb's boat—I came ashore again, and galloped down to the lock-house—the launch had come to the bank before I left—I came back with several young gentlemen who were camping there—I got back before the lock-keeper; I think Mr. Newcombe and Mr. Ballard were then on the launch, and Mr. Des<lb></lb>vignes also—the lock-keeper afterwards came up, and several young gentlemen with him—I heard some conversation, but I was busy taking the particulars of the accident, getting the names and addresses of both parties—I took notes, and have them here; I did not take any notes of the conversation, only what I did myself; Mr. Desvignes said nothing to me—when the steam launch was going alongside of me I noticed the lamp, this is the lamp—the atmosphere was cloudy, the moon was clouded every five or ten minutes—I could see the lamp of the launch quite plain—when the Formosa whistled the other launch answered with his whistle when they passed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had ridden from the lock up stream, and then Mr. Desvignes's launch caught me up at Docket's Point—I had heard the Formosa's whistle just before; the vessels passed each other just as they were rounding the bend; each whistled just before rounding; the corner—I first heard the Formosa's whistle, and then Mr. Desvignes's—the light Mr. Desvignes's launch carried was a bright white light; it could be seen more than 400 yards in a straight line—I could see the rays from the lamp across the river, it was a good strong light, throwing it out on each side—I should say after she left the point she was going nearly double as fast as when she was by my side—I saw the rowboat afterwards at the lock, I don't remember seeing it floating down; when I did see it it still had in it the bag and the loose cushions; there was not much water in her—I saw Mrs. Ballard's body at the inquest; I did not see it found.</p>

               <p>the Formosa, coming down stream—I first saw Mr. Desvignes's lauuch just as we were rounding Docket's Point—I knew it was a steam launch because he whistled; I whistled, not in reply to him, but for the lock-keeper; he whistled first—after that I passed him; I saw his light before I passed him; it was a sufficient light, according to the laws of the Con<lb></lb>servancy above the look, but it was not a sufficient light—in a straight course I could see it for a mile, if there was nothing to interrupt the view—after the whistling we passed on—nothing attracted my attention—the atmosphere was cloudy; it was a full moon, but the clouds kept on passing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At the time Mr. Desvignes's launch passed us she was going about six miles an hour altogether through the air; the stream would be pretty nearly four miles an hour at that point, 3 1/2 or four—I have since seen the boat—looking at its condition, I should say it was struck more at right angles than anything else, between that and 45 degrees—if the launch had been going at considerable speed when it met the boat it must have produced more damage than it has done—if it kept at the speed that I saw it I think it would have cut it in halves, cut it right down—I have seen accidents with steamers and with rowing boots, and can form a judgment as to the sort of injury that would he done to a boat by a violent collision.</p>

I am a stoker in the employ of the defendant—on. the 24th July I was on board his launch with him—we were returning from Kingston—after we left Shepperton look we met another steam launch just below Docket's Point—she was 80 or 100 yards oil' when I first saw her—I blew the whistle, and then proceeded to Docket's Point, and I blew the whistle again on going round the Point—we always make it a rule to blow it on going round the Point—after we had rounded the Point about 100 yards, I saw a small row boat—it appeared to be about. 80 or 90 yards off, perhaps it might be more or it might be less, I can't say for certain—it was coming down on the Middlesex side—we kept him</p>

               <p>the middle of the river, the course we always take—I did not keep my eye on the row boat the whole of the time—when I saw it again it was about 30 yards off, or from that to 40—the launch was going then about 4 miles an hour perhaps, it might be 5, at the outside—'the rows boat kept coming down till she got within 10 or 15 yards of us, then she suddenly shot right across under our bows by some means—I had orders from Mr. Desvignes to reverse the engines—he was steering and driving also—I reversed the engines—Mr. Desvignes picked up the boat hook, and picked up a shawl—we came into collision with the boat, it might be a second or two after I was told to reverse the engines—I saw the defendant leave the wheel and take a boat hook, and he picked a rug out of the water—he never stirred from the place where he was—we came to a standstill immediately after the collision—I saw Mr. Ballard in the water—I threw life buoy to him, he took hold of it, and we brought him on to the launch—I did not see any one else in the water—after pulling Mr. Ballard out, we stopped there for some minutes, searching about at the scene of the accident—I saw the small boat almost immediately after the accident wing round on our starboard side, the Middlesex side—it floated down the stream—we then went in to shore—when it passed me the boat was up in its proper way, there was nothing the matter with it—we had not altered our course before the boat shot across us; we then turned towards the Surrey side—they were shooting across towards the Surrey tide—if the row-boat had not altered its course there would have been sufficient room for them to have passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been stoker for Mr. Desvignes about six years—the same steam launch was not used during that time; this one came into use in June this year—the steering wheel is behind the funnel and behind the stoke-hole—the person standing to steer is on a higher level than I am in stoking—Mr. Desvignes was standing higher than I was;. he was supposed to keep the look-out—the only light on board the launch that night was about 6 inches above the gunwale—the stoke-hole is between 3 and 4 feet below the gunwale; I could see the light from where I was, it would be on a level with my eye—I saw the row-boat at a distance of about 80 or 900 yards ahead, it may be more, it may be less—we were about in the middle of the stream, bearing towards the Surrey shore if anything—we whistled on passing the Formosa, before the acci<lb></lb>dent, and we whistled again between passing the Formosa and the acci<lb></lb>dent—the row-boat was more than 80 or 90 yards from us when we first whistled—we whistled round Docket's Point, I had not seen the row-boat then—we did not whistle when it was 80 or 90 yards off—I have said the speed of the launch at the time was not more than four miles an hour—the stream is very strong at that point, three or four miles an hour I should say—I had the control of the engines; I did not reverse them till I had orders from Mr. Desvignes—the row-boat was very close to us then; I should not say 20 yards, or anything like; I could not say how close within a yard or so, it would be impossible to say—I am not accustomed to row at all, I cannot scull—it is not the rule in going up against stream to avoid the current to go on whichever shore there is the least current, particularly round a point; we go the proper course for a steam lauuch—it was not unusually late for us to be out at night—Mr. Desvignes does not very often go out on the Thames so late; there are steamboats that go on much later; it was late for us—the launch is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230071"></xptr>
               <p>usually put up at Chertsey at night—we have been out a great deal later—sometimes we are earlier, sometimes later—we had not been delayed that night in our course up the river, only at Molesey look, we had to stop out there a little while, waiting for the lock, that was all—we did not carry three lights this night—red, green, and white; we have done so on other occasions—I think the current at this point is stronger on the Surrey side—the launch was turned a little towards the Surrey shore—I noticed that the Formosa had three lights; they were coming round the point as we were going up the reach—I did not see it just then at a greater distance than 100 yards, because they were coming round the point—it could be seen at a great deal farther distance off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The course we took is the best course for a steam launch—the water was not very low at this time, there was plenty of water there—we determine the course as it is the regular channel for steam-boats or barges, because there is more water in that course—the launch draws about 3 feet, or 3 feet 6 inches—she would draw about 2 feet 6 inches that night I should think, perhaps not quite to much—she draws more aft than forward—she drew about 2 feet 6 inches at the deepest that night, I should think.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I had nothing to do with the steering—if the row-boat had held its course the vessels would have passed safely, in my judgment—at the moment the boat was seen crossing our bows Mr. Desvignes did the best thing possible to prevent an accident—a charge was made against me before the Magistrate as well as against Mr. Desvignes, but the charge against me was dismissed.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 443). On Sunday, 25th July, I was at Shepperton, and found the body of Mrs. Ballard—I found the steering lines wound three times round the right arm, and twice round the left—I got the body out with the drags, with the assistance of some more men that were in the punt—it was about mid-stream between Shepperton lock and Docket's Point, below Docket's Point—the body was lying on the back, the yoke was hanging behind the body, and the lines were twisted above the elbows, something like that (<hi rend="italic">Describing the position on his own arms</hi>)—I did not notice whether the strings were equal in length between the arms and the yoke, or one longer than the other; the two knobs were hanging down from the arms—I believe these are the rudder lines I found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not sat down in the boat to see whether with the ropes round the arms the head of the rudder could possibly be on it.</p>

I have now made the observation—if she had the strings round her arms in the way I found them, the top of the rudder could have reached the rudder, because her clothes were thinner than my arm, which would make it longer—it would be just about the distance—if she had been steering with the strings round her sholders that would account exactly for all I found.</p>

Mrs. Ballard's was the only body I found—it was, I suppose, half a mile from Shepperton look—there is an island in the river there, and it was just at the far end of the island, from the lock—there was nothing in the hands; they were advanced and drawn up—I did not find her infant—I was present when Mrs. Newcomb's body was found, about 50 yards this side of Docket's Point, about 200 yards from where I found Mrs. Ballard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ferryman, and live at Shepperton—on Satur<lb></lb>day, 24th July, I heard from the patrol that an accident had occurred—I went to look for the boat; I saw it coming down the stream about 10 o'clock, almost immediately after the collision—I secured it and took it to shore—there were some things in it, a carpet, pads, cushion, coats, boat-hook, tow line, and mast—there was not 3 inches of water in her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cushions were not tied on, they were loose on the seat; no rugs, a small black bag on the floor, two little cloths, and some knives—the bag was underneath the seat—I am accustomed to this part of the Thames—I row occasionally—the stream at a point 200 yards above Docket's Point sets strong on the Middlesex shore coming round the point—from Chertsey lock all the way down to the point, it is Surrey shore stream, till you get down to Dunsey Dip—at this particular point it seta on the Middlesex side—the water runs very slow there, not above two miles an hour I should think.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—during the summer months I reside at Shepperton—my house is on the river bank below Docket's Point—I am on the river almost daily during the season, and have for many years been accustomed to the river—I did not hear of the accident till the next morning, Sunday—on the Saturday night I heard Mr. Desvignes whistle from his launch; I heard two whistles, first one and then the other, almost together—I had just come in with my own launch, and was fasten<lb></lb>ing her up—the first whistle was from the Formosa, and the second was Mr. Desvignes's, immediately after—I know his whistle, it has a very peculiar sound—I have seen the damaged boat—from its appearance I should think if the speed of the launch had been even six miles an hour it would have cut through her at that point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That would, of course, depend on the point of contact. <hi rend="italic">By the</hi>

If you observe the board at the point at which it was struck, you will see that it is cut at least au eighth of an inch at a direct right angle, as straight as anything can be, as if it was cut with a saw—there is no angle whatever on it, the gunwale of the boat shows it—it is directly at right angles; moreover, the bow of the steamer certainly never reached the other side of the boat—it struck at the end of the thwart, and the thwart pushed the other side out—that is at obvious as possible.</p>

I am the captain of the london Bowing Club—I have been on the river constantly for the last 20 years—I know this part of the river fairly well—I have seen the injured boat—in my judgment it is certainly not a safe boat to have ladies in on the river at night—I have examined the injury that was done to it—I should say it was struck at right angles; that is clear to me from the nature of the injury—to have done so slight damage the launch might have been going four knots an hour—she must have had very little headway; if she had been going at any considerable speed she must have smashed the boat to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That all depends upon whether she was struck at right angles—she did not capsize—I think the people tumbled out of her—I don't think they were thrown out—they must have stood up; I should say the men must, or one would be sufficient to throw all out, if he got on the side of the boat—I have had experience of steam launches—I</p>

               <p>steered one for a great many years at the Oxford and Cambridge practice—it depends upon where the channel whether steam launches keep the shore where there is less stream—there is plenty of room between Dosket's point and Chertsey Lock for a boat drawing two feet six to pass—the steam is on the Surrey side—all round the Send it would set on the Middlesex side, till you come to this point (<hi rend="italic">Reffering to the map</hi>)—there it would set towards the Surrey side—the strength of the stream would be just on the Surrey side of midstream—down to that point from Chertsey it would be slightly Middlesex—I have driven to launch at night—below "bridge, as a rule, we carry three lights—I have never driven a steam, launch over the part of the river the boat is buoyant enough for experienced people, if net steered by an inexperienced person—I assume that a woman steered—I don't know whether it was Mrs. ballard—I think very few ladies are capable of steering on the Thames—I object both to the boat and the inexperience of the person in the boat—I should think there was plenty of room on the stern seat for two ladies—I say the boat was not good enough even in the hands of experienced persons—below bridge the regulation of the Conservancy if to carry, three lights—coming down to reach above Docket's Point an oarsman would keep for two-thirds of the way on the Middlesex side, to get the advantage of the stream, and them cross over to get the stream round Docket's point on the Surrey side—at that time of year, there, would be sufficient water over any part of that portion of the river for such a steam launch as this—my answer applies to a state of things when the water is very low—In driving a steam launch you generally go along a regular course in order to get the best of the water—there is a recognised barge, track at certain points where there are shallows—a steam launch Would keep. that course? even if there was suffi<lb></lb>cient water at other parts of the river—this boat was not safe to take ladies and children in at night—I thought it would easily capsize.</p>

In July last I was living at Shepperton, and was stoker to Mr. Parsons—about 10 o'clock on Saturday, 24th July, I was fastening up Mr. Parsons's steam launch just opposite his house;I saw the defendant come along with his steam launch the wolverine—as near as I could judge he was going from three to four miles per hour—that was between Shepperton lock and docket's Point—I heard him whistle twice—I know his whistle well—I saw a light on board burning brightly.</p>

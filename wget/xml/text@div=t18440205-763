I saw the prisoner and another person in Compton-street, St. Paul's-place, I slington—there was another person about fifty yards from him—the prisoner had a bag—I asked what he had got in it—he said, "Fowls"—they had just taken them from the Cambridge wagon—I said he most go with me to the station—he said he would—he set the bag down, the other took it up and carried it some distance—they both followed me—they set them down, the third man came up, and he carried them a little way—they then put the bag down—the others ran away and left the prisoner—I took him—I found twelve dead fowls and two live ones in die bag—the dead ones were quite warm—the bag was covered with blood at the bottom—I found on the prisoner a knife, and a piece of rope and some feathers in his hat, and a handkerchief—he said he had been to see a shipmate, and in returning met these men who asked if he would earn 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they took him to the bottom of a lane and told him to wait there, and they brought these things to him to carry.</p>

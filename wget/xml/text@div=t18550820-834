                  </hi>. I am a coachmaker, in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, in business with my father and brother. In Dec., 1853, the prisoner came to our place, and hired a brougham, for about a month, at five guineas and a half—I had known very little of him before; I had heard of the name when he was a partner with a man named Little—we had bought a brougham of Little and Norris two or three years before, and I believe it was the same Norris; but I cannot be positive about that—he had the brougham away, and returned it on 30th Jan., that was five weeks and a half; he paid five guineas and a half—on 2nd Feb. he had it out again, according to a letter of his, to hire for a short time; this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe the prisoner came himself on 2nd Feb., I cannot say for certainty that I saw him—I received this letter on 30th Jan.—I know his handwriting—I have seen him write, and have got his writing to an agreement—I believe this letter to be his writing—this came on 30th Jan., and on 2nd Feb., I believe he came or sent, and fetched the brougham out—I have no recollection of seeing him in particular that day—I ordered it to go in consequence of that letter—we had no bargain for the hiring, more than this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>; "Dulwich, Jan. 30th, 1854. Gentlemen, I shall feel obliged if you can let me have the brougham again for a few days, as I have one in with a broken spring; the other I will see you about")—that refers to another brougham that he had out on Feb. 17th—we did not hear anything more about this brougham till some time at the latter end of the year, when we traced it as having been sent to the Pantechnicon—I think that was in Dec.—we found it had been at the Pantechnicon, but was sold to Mr. Allen, a coach maker, of Long Acre—we found it there, and sued him for it—on 17th Feb. the prisoner had another brougham on hire for twelve months, according to agreement—(<hi rend="italic">This memorandum of agree<lb></lb>ment was here read</hi>)—he was to have paid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he had the brougham away—he left a dogcart as security instead of paying the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 23rd Feb. he fetched the dogcart away, we sent to him to do so—he then paid the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was the only money we received from him—we heard about the second brougham first, somewhere about July—the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not in part pay<lb></lb>ment of the first brougham—we found it was sold to Mr. Hillyer, a stable</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Pantechnicon, in Belgrave<lb></lb>square. On 2nd Feb., 1854, the prisoner came there and brought a brougham with him; it was entered as to be sold for him, it was booked at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not take those directions from him immediately, they were entered in our books by the usual parties—I saw him on the day following—he had a receipt for it, a copy of the entry in our books—I did not mention the sum to him, it was on the receipt he had—on the following day I advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe I saw him then, I must have seen him; I have not any positive recollection of seeing him—he was there on that day and had the money—I have no doubt I saw him, because it was part of my business to attend to it—I know him perfectly well—I may say that I paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should write the cheque for him—I would not swear that I paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself, but it would not have been paid without my presence—I believe I paid it him, I have no moral doubt about it—he had had the receipt on the day previous—there was a bill at four months in the usual course—that was drawn for the amount that was advanced to him, and a memorandum also, which he signed at the time—that bill would be kept—I have not got it, it is over due, it may possibly be in the possession of the proprietor of the Pantechnicon—the brougham remained with us till March—the prisoner then removed it—I cannot say whether I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner—it left our premises, it was either taken away by himself, or removed by his order—in the common course of business it would not be removed except by himself, or by his order—I saw the prisoner on 21st April—I am referring to an extract from the books, that was made previous to going before the Police Court—I can remember, without this memorandum, that I saw the prisoner in April—he brought back the same carriage—he then entered it to be sold, as in the previous instance, but I believe the price was altered to 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on that occasion he mentioned the sum that it was to be sold for—he did not direct me to sell it for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he directed the party who has the entry to make—I cannot say that I heard him give the direc<lb></lb>tions—the person who received his instructions is not here—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner on that occasion—nothing passed about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by word of mouth—I saw the brougham, it was the same—he had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. again upon it, in the same way as before—the expenses had been paid when it was removed in March; when I said the bill would be over due I meant at the present time—it was paid, it might possibly be in his possession—if demanded, the bill is given up, but it is not always demanded, it is destroyed—it is a common bill of exchange, but not negotiated—it is always either given up or destroyed—the prisoner went away on that occasion, leaving the brougham—it remained till the latter end of the year, I think Nov., and was then sold to Mr. Allen, of Long Acre, for forty guineas—a few days after that I saw the prisoner, and accounted with him for the sale—I paid him the balance of 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, I think it was—that was after deducting the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—shortly after we had an application from Mr. Corbyn on the subject, and he was informed to whom it was sold.</p>

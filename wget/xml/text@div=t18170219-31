I had observed that she was large, and told her of it; she said it was her clothes. We slept in the garret. On Monday, the 20th of January, she went to bed about eleven o'clock. I had set up, with my fellow-servant, for my mistress till one o'clock. When I went to bed, the prisoner begged that I would be as quick as possible in getting into bed. About five o'clock, Roots called me, and begged I would come down stairs, as the cook was ill in the scullery. I did not dress myself, but came down directly, and went into the kitchen, and asked her what was the matter. I did not see her, she was in the scullery-it was quite dark. There is only a thin partition of boards between the kitchen and scullery, which do not go to the top. She said, she was very ill with a pain in her bowels. I struck a light. The scullery door, I believe, was shut. She still begged of me not to come in, as she was undressed. She had desired me not to come in when I first came down. My mistress rung the bell and I went to her. She desired me to leave the light in the kitchen - I did so. I returned in ten minutes. As I was coming down stairs, the prisoner called out to me not to come in. She met me at the kitchen door. She put her hand to my breast, pushed me back, and bolted the kitchen door. I waited there some time and begged of her to come up stairs, she told me to go and she would follow me. After waiting some time, I went up to bed. She came up about half-past six o'clock, with the light in her hand; the moment she came into the room she put the light out, and came to bed. I asked her why she went down, she said, she was dreadfully ill in her bowels, and went down for fear of disturbing her master. I offered to get up and get her any thing, she said, she had made a fire, and got some milk and water. She got up about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, and I got up at eight o'clock. I went into the scullery about ten o'clock in the morning, and observed some blood in the crevices of the stones and on the stones, there was some blood in a red pan, and some on a board on which she used to stand to wash the dishes; there were finger marks of blood on the scullery table, and on the posts which support the cistern. I also observed marks of blood on our bed-room floor and on the bed. If these marks of blood had been either in the bed-room or in the scullery the day before, I must have seen them. There was some blood on the night-gown in which she slept that night. On Wednesday, I asked her, what was the reason of the blood being in the scullery, she said, it must be from a calf's-heart which she had, had to dress. We had not had any thing of the kind in the house for three months before; upon that I told my mistress, and she went to Bow-street. On Thursday, Jefries came and searched the house, but found nothing; he searched again on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. The scullery is a flat smooth pavement; the marks on the cistern-posts were about a yard from the ground. The prisoner had the care of the provisions. I know all the meat that comes into the house.</p>

            . I am footman to Mr. King. I sleep even with the kitchen, and can hear any noise in the scullery. On the 20th of January I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock. At half past three in the morning I was awoke by the dog barking; he sleeps in my room. I did not hear any thing from that time till half past four o'clock; I then heard a pail rattling as if it was put down; at the same time I heard something of a voice like somebody in pain, but could not tell what it was. I got up and went into the kitchen; it was quite dark. I asked what noise it was; the prisoner answered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190016"></xptr>me from the scullery, saying, "For God's sake do not come here; I am not dressed." She said she had a pain in her bowels. I asked her what she came down into such a place as that for, and why she was in the dark? She said she was only come to get a little water to wash herself, and was going to bed directly. With that I was satisfied, and went to bed again. In about half an hour I heard a violent groaning. I could not tell whether it was a male or female voice. It was about half past five o'clock. I got up and went into the kitchen; it was quite dark. - The prisoner was in the scullery, making a groaning noise as if she was in pain; at the same time I distinctly heard the cries of a child coming from the scullery; I heard it for five minutes, at different times. She begged I would not come in or alarm the house, and said, if I would go to bed she should be very well in a minute. I asked her where her fellow-servant, Charlotte, was - She said she was up stairs, and begged of me not to call her. I went up and told her to come down; she did directly. I heard her ask the prisoner where she was, and what was the matter. She said she had been very ill with a pain in her bowels. Mrs. King rang the bell, and Charlotte struck a light and left it on the table, and went up stairs. She was gone about ten minutes, during which time I was in the passage between the kitchen and my bed-room. Charlotte came down, and the prisoner begged her not to come in. The prisoner came out of the scullery and met her at the kitchen door, and said you shall not come in here, pushed her back, and bolted the door. Charlotte staid at the door some time. I went to bed, and got up at eight o'clock. The prisoner was up before me. I went into the scullery about nine o'clock, and observed some blood in the crevices of the stones. They were wet as if they had been washed. There were finger-marks of blood on the cistern, on the scullery table, and on the scullery door. These marks were not there on the Monday, I am sure. There had not been a calf's heart dressed in the family for some time. I said nothing to the prisoner about it. Jefferies the officer came and took the prisoner away on Friday he came again and searched but found nothing. - He came again on Monday; I was with him, and searched the coal-cellar in the front area; the scullery is quite at the back of the house. He found a bundle in the coal-cellar, among the coals, near the door, the coals were over it. I saw the bundle opened; it contained a new-born female infant; the same child was afterwards examined by Mr. Leese. Jeffries took the child out of the bundle and put it in the pantry, exactly in the same condition as he found it; he locked the door and took the key. The Coroner and Mr. Leese saw it there afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner has been four years in the family. I understood her to be married. I had observed her to be in the family way. The prisoner knew that I slept down stairs. It was some time before I heard the child cry.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear that it was not the voice of a woman you heard - A. I will swear that it was a child. The blood-marks were not high.</p>
               <p>Court. - Q. When you saw the child was there any thing about its month - A. There was a coarse cloth put into its mouth when I first saw it, and I am sure that nobody touched the cloth before it was taken into the pantry.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I went to Mr. King's on Thursday, the 23d January. I went into the kitchen, and told the prisoner I had a warrant for her, and told her what it was for. She said it must be a mistake, and she went towards the table, where there was a large carving knife; I told her she must not leave me. She seemed very much agitated. I told her to put on her things and go with me; she said she would; I went with her to get them. She put her hand into her pocket; I asked what she had got there, she said she had nothing in it; she pulled out a small piece of rag (producing it); it was stained with blood; she said she had had a piece of meat in it. She asked me to give it to her, saying that it was of no use to me - I refused. I took her to the House of Correction. It was too late to search the house that night. I searched it the next morning, and found a great quantity of her clothes which were stained with blood. I did not search the coal-cellar, I searched it on the Monday morning; I found the bundle in the left hand corner of the coal-cellar, about two feet form the door and six inches under the coals. Nothing could be seen from the surface of the coals, and there was a large plank put over that part of them. I took it up exactly as I found it, and laid it in the pantry in the presence of Roots. I did not open it till I put it on the pantry table, and the first thing that I observed were the legs of a child. As I removed the clothes, I found the head part with a coarse cloth over the face and neck. I looked down sideways, and said"Why the mouth is full of coarse cloth!"-it was three inches within the mouth (Here the witness produced the cloth, which was quite hard, and formed the complete shape of the cavity of the mouth)-it was a female child. I left it in the pantry, and locked it up and kept the key. The next morning I went, with the Coroner, to Mr. Leese; I opened the door for them, and found the child exactly as I had left it. I removed the cloth out of its mouth by direction of the Coroner-it is now precisely in the same shape as it was when I took it out of the child's mouth-the child was wrapped up in a petticoat and other things-(I produce them).</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On Friday, the 28th January I attended the Coroner's Inquest. I went into the pantry and saw the child on the table. Roots and the officer were with me; the cloth was not in the child's mouth, it lay by its head. I examined the child's body could find no external marks of violence. I took the cloth and applied it to the child's mouth-it was compressed together in a hardened mass; the lump exactly fitted the internal part of the mouth, and resembled the cass of the mouth, as if it had been put in, and became hardened while in the mouth; there was a redness about its neck and head as if arising from strangulation-supposing the child to have been alive, it was quite sufficient to strangle it-it could not breathe. The child appeared to me to be perfect, and I have no doubt but that it was born alive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is difficult to tell whether a child is born alive or-not I will not swear it. It had come to maturity, apparently. I did not look for blows-if the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190017"></xptr>child had fallen on the stones at its birth, it would have caused its death.</p>
               <p>JEFFRIES.re-examined. Before Mr. Leese saw the child the Coroner, and Jury, had seen it. I removed the cloth then before Mr. Leese came.</p>

            , Esq. I am Coroner for the County of Middlesex. The Jury, Roots, and Jeffries, accompanied me-the child was lying on its back, with a coarse cloth, apparently a dish-cloth, pressed very tight into its mouth, as far as it possibly could-the whole cavity of the mouth appeared to be full-it was taken out in my presence; it came out like a bung. If the child had been alive, the cloth must have suffocated it.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner put in a written paper, as follows: "The prisoner never had a child before, and being inexperienced, thought she had two months of her time to go. Her reason for not making her situation known was, that she might remain in her place as long as she could."</p>

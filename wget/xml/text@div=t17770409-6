               <p>Did Mrs. Baker go into the room? - I cannot say whether I went farther than the door in my fright; I cannot tell but I might.</p>
               <p>Did you see the deceased? - Yes she was leaning against the servant; she was blood; she put up her hands and said, He has killed me.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing in his hand? - I cannot say that I did; he said something, but what I really cannot tell; I was frightened and ran away; I fetched a countryman of their acquaintance whose name is Lavendar; the prisoner went away, Lavendar went with me up stairs, and then he went and fetched a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation between the deceased and Lavender? - No; I went down stairs directly; I went afterwards to see the deceased in the hospital, and she said, Her husband had struck her with a poker.</p>

               <p>Do you remember how long it was after that that he was discharged out of custody? - I think he came out that very day or the next, and went back again.</p>
               <p>I believe he was out of custody a long time before she died? - About a week, I believe.</p>

               <p>Then he was in custody a good while after this time you speak of? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What depth? - About a quarter, or hardly so much.</p>
               <p>With what kind of an instrument did it appear to you to have been occasioned? - It might have been made by a blunt instrument with a coarse edge.</p>
               <p>Was the skull affected? - It was laid bare.</p>
               <p>Was it fractured? - There was no fracture upon examination.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you in what manner it happened? - No; she was rather stupid.</p>
               <p>Did that stupor appear to proceed from the effects of liquor or any concussion of the brain? - More from the effects of liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177704090008"></xptr>How long did she stay in the house? - Three weeks; she was going on very well at first for about a fortnight, then some bad symptoms came on; it was thought necessary she should be trapaned, and matter was found formed under the skull; she continued going on worse, and died about a week after.</p>
               <p>What do you apprehend to have been the occasion of her death? - The wound and the matter formed in consequence of it.</p>
               <p>In the course of your attendance, did you ever hear her express how she came by the wound? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was any declaration made from the hospital to the magistrate that she was out of danger? - No; there was an application, to know whether she was out of danger; I did not send word that she was out of danger, but that she was going on well.</p>
               <p>In consequence of that message I believe the prisoner was discharged out of custody? - I fancy he was.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Mrs. Pope owes me a grudge for demanding my wife's wearing apparel that she took out of the room at the time I was in custody; when I demanded my wife's wearing apparel, she swore she would take my life away if there was no other person in the world; there were four gowns and other things of my wife's got out of my room before I was let out upon bail from Tothillfields Bridewell; she got out of bed very much in liquor and came to the door and opened it; I was going to bed; I had been up all night; then turning about she gave a kind of slip, whether she slipped against the bedstead or whether against the sender, I know no more than the man in the moon; she cried out; I took her up in my arms and put her on the bed; I am as innocent as a child; we kept a public house 14 years; I never had an angry word with her all the days of my life.</p>
               <p>FOR THE PRISONER.</p>

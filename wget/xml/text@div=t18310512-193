            ; against the Statute, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>THREE OTHER COUNTS, varying the manner of stating the charge.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TUCKER. I am assistant-overseer of the poor of St. Giles in the Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury - they are united, for the purpose of maintaining the poor. I have a paper, which I got from Mr. Twilly, the governor of the workhouse; here is the signature of T. Tucker to it, but it is not my writing. nor written with my authority or knowledge; I am in the habit of giving written orders to paupers, to get clothing, daily and hourly, I may say- there is no other person named Tucker who gives such orders; the orders I give are on pieces of paper similar to this, and the wording of it is similar - they are as nearly alike as possible; I am not very particular in wording them - if it had been my signature Mr. Twilly would have been authorized to deliver the articles stated; he would have been bound to comply with it - it is the usual way in which we have been in the habit of giving articles to the out-door poor: Mr. Twilly has apparel by him to comply with such orders; it is entrusted to him by order of the directors of the poor, who are appointed by the joint vestry, under the local Act, which I now hold in my hand- there are twelve from each parish; the Act is the 11th of George the 4th.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. By what authority do you act? A. I am one of the assistant-overseers - I have my appointment with me; we act as overseer in every point of view, as regards the relief of the poor - I do not in general write "By order of T. Tucker;" I generally write, - Give such an article to such a person, T. Tucker.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is your election in vestry? A. Yes. I might have used the words "By order" in one of my papers, but not in general - I should consider that this means that T. Tucker wrote it.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL DRISCOLL. I am errand-boy to the master of <placeName id="t18310512-193-crimeloc1128">St. Giles' workhouse</placeName>

I saw the prisoner a day or two before Good-Friday - he came to me in the lodge, and gave me a paper, which I looked at, and put on the file; I did not mark it, but I can tell this paper by the name at the bottom - I took no copy of it.</p>

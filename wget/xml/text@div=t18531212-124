                  </hi>. I live at Long Sutton, in Lincolnshire. I am sexton there—I was present at the marriage of the prisoner with Sarah Emberson, at the church on the 31st Jan., 1831; she is now living, I saw her yesterday—I have not seen the prisoner for nineteen years or more—I produce a copy of the certificate of the marriage—I compared it with the book, it is quite correct (<hi rend="italic">this certificate being read, did not state the name of the parish or the church</hi>).</p>

               <p>this certificate was written by the curate—I examined it after he wrote it—I will swear it is a correct copy of what was in the book—there is no church mentioned in this certificate—I knew Mrs. Emberson before her marriage, and I knew the prisoner well; he was a bachelor, and she was a widow—it is nineteen or twenty years since I saw the prisoner, till I saw him at the police court—the prisoner and his wife lived together four or five years—I cannot tell exactly how long—the marriage took place in Jan., 1831—I do not know how long they lived together—I was not present at any proceedings at Long Sutton, with reference to their separation—I know there were proceedings—his wife had four or five children by her former husband—I knew her quite well, I saw her three or four times a week—I do not know how soon after her marriage with the prisoner she was confined—I cannot charge my memory with whether she had a child within two months after—one of her sons is here, he did not come up with me—we were before the Magistrate last Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Burton-crescent. I married the prisoner on 31st Jan., this year, at St. Pancras church—before we married he told me he had been married, but he did not say when—about two months after we were married, he said his wife was living, and I had no claim upon him.</p>

Q.</hi> Before the marriage the prisoner told you he had been married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he did not tell me his wife was alive—he did not say whether she was dead or alive, that I recollect—I was a dressmaker—we were not courting long, something like three months—I do not know that I made any observation when he said he had been married—I did not say, when he told me he had been married, "I don't care for that, I am willing to take the same chance as you if you marry me—when he told me he had been married, it was in general conversation—he made no secret of it—what induced him to say I had no claim upon him was a trifling misunderstanding—he went out to seek for work, and he came home and said he had met with an accident, and I thought he had been fighting—we had a few words—I did not send for the policeman till he left me, which was a fortnight afterwards—this misunderstanding took place on Monday—I lived with him till the Saturday week afterwards, and he left me; and on Sunday morning I gave him in charge—there was no dispute about furniture that I am aware of—it was his duty to pay the rent—I paid it when he gave me the money—he did not give me any money during the last fortnight, and my goods were seized—the prisoner did not tell me before our marriage what time had elapsed since he had seen his wife—he did not say he had not seen or heard from her for nineteen years—he did not mention any time that he had not seen her—he said he had left his wife nineteen years—he did not say he had not seen or heard from her for nineteen years—he said he had been living with a woman—I was three times before the Magistrate—he did not make a remark to this effect, that I was as bad as him for marrying a man who told me his wife was living.</p>

                  </hi>. I am of the firm of Brown and Krotouski, of London-wall; we are wholesale cap-manufacturers. These four caps, found at Baker's, in Bartlett's-buildings, and these twenty caps, found at Mr. Gil<lb></lb>more's, are my property—I sold them to Gerhard on the 19th of Nov.—I sold him caps to the amount of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I required a reference from him, and he referred me to Mr. Baker, No. 51, Herbert-street, New North-road—I sent a servant there—I afterwards got a guarantee—I have received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hat manufacturer, and live in Union-street, Borough. In Nov. last Gerhard called on me—he wanted some goods—he gave me a reference to Mr. Baker, No. 51, Herbert-street, New North-road—Gerhard told me he (Baker) was a retired laceman—I went to No. 51, Herbert-street—I was asked into the parlour, and after I had been there some time, the prisoner Baker came in—she asked what my business might be—I told her I came in reference to a person named Gerhard, who had called on me and wanted some goods—I should have said that in the first place I asked for Mr. Baker—she said Mr. Baker was out, but perhaps she might do as well—she said Gerhard was respectably connected, he was a very respectable young man, and what goods I let him have were quite as safe as if I kept them in my own possession—that his mother was a person of independent property, and he would come into possession of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. very shortly, and he did not wish to trouble his friends for anything for the purpose of opening this business—I heard something afterwards, and refused to supply my goods.</p>

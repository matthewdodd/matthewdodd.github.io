                  </hi>. I am a miner. On 29th July I came to London, at half-past 10 o'clock at night—I was in the street, coming from the King's<lb></lb>cross station—I did not know where I was—I met the two female prisoners, and one other woman who is not in custody—I asked the woman who is not here if she could show me a decent lodging—I walked with her from King's cross to Waterloo-road—I went into a public-house with her—when there, I saw Fitzgerald and Jones—I came out of the house with the other woman, and Fitzgerald and Jones followed me out—we were all four in the street—the first woman took hold of my coat and held me, and Jones took bold of me by the legs and threw me down—Jones pulled me down, and Fitzgerald tore my trowsers and my coat—the woman who is not in custody broke a little bag from a little tape on my neck—the bag had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—after she had broken the tape from my neck she ran away—Jones took 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. coppers, out of. my waistcoat pocket, at the same time that the other woman took the bag from my neck—they had seen money in my possession in the public-house—I took 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the bag to pay for the gin, and I put 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my waistcoat pocket, in the public-house—when Jones had</p>

About 1 o'clock in the morning of 30th July I saw the prosecutor with some women—I could not positively swear to the women—they were in an oyster shop—shortly afterwards I went to the station—I found the prosecutor there; I went with him to the Eques<lb></lb>trian public house—I went inside, leaving him outside—I did not see any woman, but as soon as I got in the prosecutor called out, "Here she goes!" I went out, and saw Jones running—he stopped her, and gave her into my custody—he said, "This is the girl that robbed me"—when at the station Jones said she had been in the shop and bad oysters with him, and she saw him have some money, but she knew nothing of the robbery.</p>

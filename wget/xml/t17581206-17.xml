It is Mr Scofield's watch; he was making me a new one, and this he lent me 'till that was ready. I believe I had had it 6 or 8 weeks.</p>

            . About half an hour after one o'clock that night, I was siting at the corner of Fountain-Court in the Strand; I heard this gentleman call stop thief; I call'd to the first watchman; and said, if you see a man come that way stop him. I saw a man coming in a white coat, and he ran up Marrigold-Court; I knew he could not go through, for the gate is shut on nights; there we found the prisoner standing close up in a corner. In bringing him away I had hold of his collar; I perceiv'd his hand behind my back; I look'd and saw the watch fly into the middle of the Strand; I said hold him, he has thrown the watch away; I went and pick'd it up while he held him, and brought him to the Watch-house.</p>

I had been in St James's market, and had drank part of 6 s. worth of punch, a friend ask'd me to go along with him to a club; he got me to Covent-Garden, I ask'd where he was going? he pull'd me along; at last, he went to the house. We were there two hours, and I got more in liquor. I had not been out of the house above five minutes, before they cry'd stop thief; I am a butcher, and was going to a brother butcher's house, to see if I could get a lodging.</p>

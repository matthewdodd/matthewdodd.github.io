                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 95). I was employed by Mr. Machin, of Bishopsgate-street, confectioner, to watch the prisoner Harrison—about Thursday, 13th June, soon after 1 o'clock, I saw him leave Mr. Machin's premises—I followed him down Union-street, as far as Shepherd-street, Tenter-ground, Spitalfields—that is where O'Holangin carries on business—it is a little general shop—he sells sweets, bundles of wood, grocery, and so on—Harrison went in there, and remained about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he had no bundle or parcel with him when he went</p>

               <p>in—I did not see what was done in the shop—next day, I watched him again—he left Mr. Machin's premises about the same time, and went in the same direction as before—when he got into Artillery-street, Whitney, the other officer, and I stopped him—we told him we were police-officers, and asked him if he had anything about him—he said, "No"—we took him into a passage to search him—Whitney found something on him, which I saw him produce at the station—I did not see where he found it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has been wrapped up in this piece of paper since—on the same day, we went to O'Holangin's, in Shepherd-street—I saw him, and asked him if his name was O'Holangin—he said, "Yes"—I told him we were officers, and that we had information that he had been buying some peel and jujubes of a person we had in custody—I did not mention the name—he said he had bought some, and he took me to a drawer, opened it, and showed me a quantity of citron, I think about 181bs.—I asked him if that was all he had bought, and he said it was—I asked him if he had not, purchased some jujubes—he said, no, that was all he had got—I saw some there in a basket, wrapped up in paper similar to this found on Harrison—Whitney took charge of that—I took O'Holaugin into custody, and left two officers to search his place.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 497). On 30th June, I watched the premises of Mr. Machin, with the last witness; and at 1 o'clock on that day, I followed Harrison to O'Holangin's shop, and again at a few minutes past 7 the same evening—he went into the shop each time, and was there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he had no bundle or parcel with him whatever—on the day we stopped him, we traced him in the same direction, and Gaylor and I stopped him in Artillery-street—he first said he had nothing on him—we took him into a passage in Bishopsgate-street, and he unbuttoned his coat, and gave me this 4 lbs. 15ozs. of peel—he had two waistcoats on, and the peel was between the two waistcoats—there were two pieces wrapped in a handkerchief in his pocket—when he unbuttoned his coat, it all fell out, except what was in his pocket—I then went with Gaylor to O'Holangin's shop, about half-past 2—we saw him there—Gaylor asked him if he had bought any peel—he said he had bought some, and showed us some in a drawer, and said that was all he had bought—after that, some more was discovered; some in the drawers behind the counter, some in the shop window, and some in a basket; 12 lbs. altogether—I heard Gaylor ask him if he had bought any jujubes—he said, "No"—I found some in sheets in a drawer behind the counter, and some in the window in glasses, cut up—I was left to search the premises—I searched the bedroom, and found 180 silk handkerchiefs in a box under the bed, some new and some second-hand; some with names on in full, others where the names had been picked out—I also found three quarters of a hundredweight, short of three pounds, of soap, which had all been scraped—Gaylor asked O'Holangin if he had any invoice—he said he had no invoices to any of the goods.</p>

               <p>as low as he could, and he did not get invoices—he kept what is commonly termed a chandler's shop—I asked him at the station whether Harrison was the man he bought the things of—he said, "I think that is the man"—I said, "You can make sure of it;" and almost immediately after, he said, "Yes, it is the man"—Harrison stated before the Magistrate, that in whatever way he got these goods, O'Holangin had no idea in what way he got them—he said that he took them in small quantities to him, and he said he was a maker of jujubes; that O'Holangin did not like the mucky appearance of some, and he said he would come and doctor it for him at any time—that was substantially his statement at the Police-court.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Frederick Machin, a confectioner, who trades under the name of Batcher and Co., 15 and 16, Bishopsgate—we have as many as five hundred hands at work, and the stock is very large; hundreds of tons of sweets—Harrison has been in our employment as porter about seven years—in consequence of information we received, Gaylor and Whitney were employed to watch, and on 1st July, I went to O'Holangin's premises with Gaylor, and saw him find a quantity of preserved peel and jujubes—these are the articles; they are Mr. Machin's property—I am quite sure of that—I know them from eight years' experience in the trade—we never sell jujube in this form—it is cut up by machinery into a diamond shape—this sheet of jujube has a muddy appearance—it undergoes another process to make it clear—this is in an unfinished state—any person who sold it would know that—the citron is finished—some of this jujube is cut up—I don't know how, but certainly not with our machine—it would be impossible to miss anything from our stock; we make between 200 and 300 tons in the course of the year—we take stock once a year—I don't know that O'Holangin has ever dealt with as—we do not wrap the citron up in paper at all; it is packed in cases—I should discharge any one if I saw them doing up peel like this.</p>

I went on board the schooner <hi rend="italic">Antioch</hi>, in consequence of information, on 22nd Nov.—it is lying at Irongate—I saw the prisoner—I went down the forecastle with him—I asked him what he had in his chest; he said, Clothes—he sat down on the chest—I asked him if that was his chest; he said, Yes—I opened it, and found under the clothes twenty-six cups, twenty-four saucers, one basin, two dish covers, and seven jugs; and on looking behind the chest, I saw a shirt—I asked him if it was his; he said, Yes; and in it I found twenty-six plates; and in a bag which he said was his I found two large dishes—I asked him how he came by the property; he said he took it off the deck of the vessel—the cargo was conveyed to the deck from the hold, and put on a cart, and he said he took these from the deck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sole agent in London for Anthony and Henry Scott—I received from the <hi rend="italic">Antioch</hi> schooner, a cargo of earthen ware—I received a notice that a quantity of goods was at the police station—I went there, and saw these articles—they belong to Anthony Scott and Co.—I do not know any other house that manufactures the same pattern—these cups are the first I ever saw of the pattern—there were nine dozen sent, and we are two or three dozen short—I have not the invoice here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

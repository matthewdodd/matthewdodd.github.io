               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q. How long had he been in your house? - A. He had been out about half-an-hour before that.</p>
               <p>Q.The things fell from him, you say? - A.He let them fall; whether by accident or not, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q.And yet you swear positively he endeavoured to break them? - A. I said, I believe it, and I do now; I have the marked tumbler here.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time you stopped, him, did he not tell you he was going to have then cut for a pattern? - A.No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The night on which this happened, Mr. Carter sent me to the warehouse to look out different patterns, and to take them to Harley-street; I did so; and before I had time to put down the different patterns, when I came in, he asked me for them, which I gave him, without any hestitation, not knowing he meant to charge me with felony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carter. The story, with regard to the patterns, is true; but, with regard to taking the tumblers, it was an hour after; I gave him no orders to take them whatever.</p>

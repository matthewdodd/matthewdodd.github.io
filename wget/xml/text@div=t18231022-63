            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Upper George-street, Bryanstone-square. On the 24th of September, Welch brought me four napkins and six towels to pawn, and in consequence of what she said, I went into the street to see who sent her with them, and found the prisoner, who said she did send Welch to pawn them; that they were her own property. She gave different accounts of where she lived - that she was married, and her husband was in the Guards. I gave her in charge, and before the Magistrate, she gave Mr. Briers' address.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Before my late mistress died - she said my present master and mistress were to pay my doctor's bill, as no nurse had been employed, and I had injured my health by attending to her. After her death, a renewal of my complaint increased the bill - it amounted to 3 l. 9 s., my present mistress said my wages should be stopped to finish payment of the bill - I objected to it, and they were going to part with me on the Saturday, as this occurred on Wednesday. I should have had 15 s. to take, deducting the doctor's bill. I was in great distress.</p>
               <p>MISS BRIERS. My mother is lately dead; she attended on her, but I had another woman. She might have said this in my absence. The prisoner was not paid extra for her labour. The things were locked up in a box; it was not broken open. All that was due to her was not paid; she had applied for it, but it was inconvenient - her health<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220028"></xptr>has been impaired, but I cannot say whether it was in consequence of attending my mother.</p>

            . I am a porter - I lodge at Mr. Smith's. On the night of the 3d of March I was in the parlour behind the shop; I saw the prisoner come in and inquire of Mrs. Smith whether they sold second-hand clothes - she said No - he said he meant clothes made of second cloth; she showed him some trousers which were gathered in front - he said he wanted some plain - she went to get them and he leaned on the counter: he said he did not like them - he then arose up and put his hand behind his coat, and went towards the door, walking backwards; he said he would call in a quarter of an hour if Mr. Smith would be in the way; Mr. Smith came home soon afterwards, and missed the trousers; there had been another person called (a respectable gentleman), who is a regular customer of Mr. Smith's - I was not in the shop myself.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. On the evening of the 3d of March he went out and left some mixed drab trousers on the counter - I saw the prisoner come in - he did not buy any thing, but went out with his hands behind him all the way backwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of work for a fortnight, and then I got a day or two's work, and went to buy a pair of trousers - I did not want to give more than 15s. or 16s., for them - she said she had none so low - I said I would call again.</p>

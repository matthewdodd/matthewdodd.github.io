                  </hi>. I am shopman to John Fox Kemp, a grocer, at Uxbridge. I did not know the prisoner till she came on the 31st of Jan., about one o'clock, and said she wanted 1/2lb. of black tea and 1/4lb. of green tea, 2lbs. of butter, 61bs. of sugar, half a bar of soap, and 1/2lb. of tobacco, for Mr. Stilwell—I asked if it was for Mr. Arthur Stilwell—the said it was for Mr. Arthur Stilwell, of Moorcroft-house—I knew him, and then asked if she had brought the book—she said she had not, but she requested a bill, which I made out—she took the goods, went away, and left the bill on the counter—after she was gone I had some suspicion—I sent Gutteridge after her.</p>

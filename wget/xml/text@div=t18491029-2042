                  </hi>. On Saturday, 20th Oct., I was at Wandsworth—I saw the prisoner there—I went with her and a young man to have something to drink, at the Rose and Crown—the prisoner took a black mantle from off my shoulders—she doubled her fist, and swore how she would use me if I came near her—I got a policeman, and went with him to a house in a court, and gave the prisoner in charge—the mantle has not been found.</p>

About one o'clock in the morning of Sunday, 21st Oct., I saw the prosecutrix, and she directed me to a court near the water side—I found the prisoner in bed in a room—she said, "She knew nothing about it"—I searched the house but found nothing—I had heard the prosecutrix cry "Police!" three times before I arrived—she had nothing on her shoulders, and it was a very damp night—she told me what had happened, and told me the prisoner's name—I found the prisoner in bed, half an hour afterwards—two prostitutes and a known thief live in the next house to where I found her.</p>

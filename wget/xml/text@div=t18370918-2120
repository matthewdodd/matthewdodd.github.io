                  </hi>. This is my brother's jacket—I never saw it in Chambers's possession—on the 14th of August, my sister came up stairs and took the jacket, and Chambers and her went into the public house and drank together—the jacket was pledged—I saw my sister go down the street with a bundle—I went up stairs, and missed my brother's jacket—Chambers and my sister were then together—I saw them together when I missed the jacket, in Neptune-street—I saw them together before she came for the jacket, in the square close by our house—I cannot say how soon after that my sister came in, as I had to go out, and when I came back I saw my sister and Chambers together—I suppose it was not five minutes—I did not see where the jacket was till I went up stairs into the room, and opened the drawers, and missed it—I saw it in my sister's possession in the house—Chambers was outside then—I ran after my sister, and saw Chambers outside the public-house—my sister came out of one door, and Chambers out of the other—I met Chambers on the Sunday morning, and he gave me these duplicates, among them was one for this jacket.</p>

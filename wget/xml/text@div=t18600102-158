                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Sir Samuel Morton Peto and others, at Prince Regent's wharf, West Ham—on 13th December we had a gas-pipe lying on that wharf which is in the occupation of the prosecutors—I saw the gas-pipe that morning about 10 o'clock—it was one entire pipe, about nine feet long—I missed it about half-past 4 o'clock—I saw the two prisoners that day about half-past 1 o'clock—they were coming in the direction from the Prince Regent wharf together—they each of them had a bag on his back—I followed them as far as the white gates—they went through a little distance to Eagle-street and put their bags down and rested—the bags were not so large as sacks—they appeared to have some<lb></lb>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001020062"></xptr>
               <p>heavy in them—after Jones set his bag down and rested he went away from the bag—he had seen me passing—when I saw he was gone I called the police—I gave Harris in charge, and a minute or two after I saw Jones coming back in that direction—on his coming back Heythom asked him if that bag belonged to him—he said it did, and on his saying that I gave him in charge likewise—Harris said, what did I know about the iron; that iron came off the marshes; that they bought it of two navvies.</p>

TINDAL ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When had you fceen that iron pipe there last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About lialf-past 10 o'clock—that was the only iron pipe that was lying there—I am the superinteudant of the worfi there—I can't say bow long the iron pipe had been there—I know it had been there for six months—it was lying on a plank stage where the crane is, where the men walk over when they are at work—there was no shed or roof over it—it was not an old piece of pipe, it was new pipe-there were five pipes left when the last were put down, and this was one of the five—we very frequently leave pipes exposed for six months—I know Messrs. Peto aud Co. have had that wharf in their occupation for seven years—I don't know that it ia their private property; it is in their occupation—when I first saw the prisoners they were about half a mile from the wharf, as near as I could guess—it was from a quarter to half-past 1 o'clock—our men come from their dinner and commence work at 1 o'clock we had but very few men at work at that time—some of them come that way to our place when we have them at work—the prisoners were coming in a direction from the wharf—I was at the entrance of the dock, and the place I saw them at was between the place where I stood and the wharf—they came towards me from the wharf in the public highway—I did not ask Harris whose bag it was—I did not hear him asked that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am storekeeper to Messrs Peto and Co. on their works—on that morning I had to go down to the saw mills near the Prince Regent wharf, in the occupation of Messrs Peto and Co.—I think they have used it for five years—as I was returning from there I saw the two prisoners with something on their backs; it looked like something very heavy in two bags—they were walking from the Princo Regent wharf—I and Lewis followed them, and overtook them just through the white gates in Eagle-street—they had just put the two bags down just at the entrance of Eagle-street—Harris way given in custody; Jones had left—I went through the street and met Jones who was coming back towards the bag—I took hold of him, and he walked back with me to the place where the bag was left—I said to him, "Is this bag your's?"—he said, "Yes"—he was given in custody—the pipe that was in both the bags was broken in pieces—I examined the pieces of pipe; they belonged to Sir Morton Peto and Company.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were they coming from the reed bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I first saw them, I think they were about 150 yards from it—they were near the Prince Regent's wharf—there are no men now employed near the reed bed—they are not making a Metropolitan sewer on that road—it is on the Barking-road, not near there.</p>

               <p>direction from Prince Regent wharf; they had two bags with them—I was afterwards called by Lewis—the prisoner Harris was there, and the two bags were lying on the ground near Harris—I asked him what he had got there, he said "Some pieces of iron—I asked where he got it; he said, "We bought it from two navvies who came over in a boat from the mud-ship—I took both the prisoners in custody—I assisted in putting the pieces of this iron together—there were 2121bs, in all—these are the two ends of it—I took the prisoner's boots off, and went to the wharf and compared the boots with marks I saw there—the number of nails in the boots exactly corresponded with the marks—I made a comparison with the foot marks coming from the wharf—my opinion is that those boots made the impressions in the ground—I have not the boots here; the prisoners have got them—I made the comparison of the length and the width, and the number of nails—there were some tops of nails worn off in Jones' boots—there were no toe pieces—the marks corresponded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you make the comparison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We could not make an impresion by the side, the ground was frozen; we put the boot over the foot-mark—I found foot-marks with nails by the side of the wharf—that is not the public road—I can't say if that is where the men walk—I don't know whether the men go to work in that direction; I have never seen them—there are not many houses—it is our duty to look after kitchens at night—I never had an opportunity of seeing whether the men go in that direction to their work in a morning—there were very few other foot-marka besides those I saw—I looked first to see where the foot mark was—I had both Jones' and Harris's shoes—I tried Harris's first; I put it by the side of the impression first, and then put it into it—the shoes were rights and tofta—I then took Jones's shoe to see if that corresponded, not with the same marks, I tried it with other footmarks—I compared them with twenty or thirty footmarks in a distance of between 100 and 200 yards from the wharf—as they came from the wharf, they had to go along the bank, and then they went on the pebbles, and we could not trace them there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I went with the policeman to compare the boots with the footmarks, as nearly as we could do it; and, in my opinion, the impressions in the ground were made by these boots—the iron pipe was whole when I saw it last on the wharf—there was no hammer found on the prisoners or near the spot, but in a place in the reed bed, there was a large granite stone, and it had some rust upon it, and some smaller stoues; and there was a hole in the ground where they had dipped the iron in with their hands so as to make it all over mud—the pipe was wet and muddy all over when I found it in the bags.</p>

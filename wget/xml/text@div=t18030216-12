I had left two little girls in the shop, one about seven, and the other eight years old; Mrs. Harrison was not at home. I said, I knew better than that; I took him by the cape of the coat, and led him to the shop door, and said, now shew me who you bought them of; he then said, he had picked them up in the street, and offered to run away; I secured him, and took the articles from him; I then told him, he must go with me to the watch-house; he went very quietly till we came near the watch-house, he then endeavoured to extricate himself from me by pushing me against the wall; he got from me, I cried stop thief, and a man stopped him, and brought him back; he was taken to the watch-house, and I delivered the things to the constable; I missed them as soon as I got to the shop door; they cost me eight or nine shillings.</p>

I have known the prisoner about three weeks - he lives in a court in Long-alley. I had some dealings with him, and told Alderson of it; on the 11th of March I and Alderson went to his house - he was not at home; I was directed to the Castle public-house, in Long-alley, where I found him - I told him I had come for a score of shillings, and asked Alderson if he would have a score - he said, "Yes - how much are they?" the prisoner said 6s.; Alderson said he would have a score - we came out of the public-house, and gave him the money; he said, "Put both monies together." I gave him two half-crowns and a shilling, and asked him where we should wait - he said,"Go to the public-house," meaning the Weavers' Arms, which I had gone to before; he went away - we waited at the public-house about twenty minutes - it was then church time, and we went out and stood at the corner of the court; he came to us, and said, "Did you not think me a long time?" I said No; he put both the scores into my hand; I put them into my pocket. Alderson asked him if he was not going to have any thing to drink - he said No; Alderson then said he was an officer, and took him; I then went away, and afterwards gave Alderson the two scores of shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Have you ever been in a Court of Justice? A. No - I never stood at any bar. I have been in this line about three weeks, but never passed any bad money; a young man introduced me to the prisoner. I never bought any money but these two scores for myself. I got some with the young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate ask you what had become of the other 8s.? A. Yes; I did not say I had passed them - I gave the two scores to Alderson about twenty-five minutes or half an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you ever deal in any counterfeit money till Alderson directed you so to do? A. No.</p>

            . I am Bow-street patrol, and live in Marshall-street, Golden-square. In consequence of information which I received from Stuart I directed him to go with a young man to buy coin - and on the 11th of March I went with him to the prisoner's house in Angel-court - he was not at home - we were directed to the Castle, where we found him; Stuart called him out, and said he wanted a score - he said, "Very well;" I saw Stuart give him two half-crowns and a shilling; he then asked if I would like a score - I asked how much they were - he said 6s. I put my hand into my pocket to give him 6s., and he said cheese it, which means not to give it to him at that moment; when he got by the archway I gave him two half-crowns and a shilling - he directed us to wait at the public-house, which we did, but at church time we were turned out, and stood at the corner of Angel-place, Skinner-street, Bishopsgate-street. The prisoner came and said, "Did not you think me long?" he gave Stuart two brown papers, containing two scores - I held out my hand for mine - he said, "They are both together;" I asked him to go and have some drink - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050052"></xptr>said No; I then said I was an officer, and took him into custody - he hallooed Murder! made great resistance, and called for a man named Steel: I put him into a coach, and took him to St. Martin's watch-house; I found Stuart at the gate - he gave me the parcel; I went with him to a public-house in Cranbourn-passage, and found twenty counterfeit shillings wrapped in each paper, with silver paper between them; I had disguised myself, so that I should not be known. I remember the Magistrate asking Stuart what had become of the other eight - that alluded to another score which was bought on a former occasion - Mace had that eight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to go as far as St. Martin's watch-house before you saw Stuart? A. I had appointed to meet him there. I had seen the prisoner give him the brown paper parcels.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Were Dodd and Mace near the spot? A. Yes; I asked the prisoner for a score - he said they were both together. I had marked my half-crown and shilling. Dodd afterwards showed me a half-crown, which was one I had marked.</p>

            . On the 11th of March I and Mace went to the public-house - we concealed ourselves; I did not see the prisoner till he was struggling in the crowd to get away - we put him into a coach, and took him to St. Martin's watch-house; I found this half-crown in his breeches pocket. Alderson produced two parcels, each containing a score of counterfeit shillings.</p>
               <p>D. G. ALDERSON. This is one of the half-crowns which I gave him; we took him to St. Martin's watch-house to prevent his being rescued.</p>

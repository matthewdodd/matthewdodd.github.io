               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes. On the 15th of December, she came in and asked for a lodging; I refused her three times, she told me she was a relation of Mr. Hanson's a publican that I knew; I took her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her the next morning. - A. Yes, she came down stairs about nine o'clock, she breakfasted in the bar with my family.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did your family consist of that she breakfasted with. - A. We breakfasted before she came down; there were the maid and two of the children in the bar when she came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they continue the whole time the prisoner was at breakfast. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she set after breakfast. - A. Till about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you between nine and eleven o'clock. - A. I was in the bar almost the whole of the time, except going into the tap room to take a pint or a pot of beer, and the children and the maid they were in and out of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when the prisoner left the house. - A. I was just gone into the tap room with a pint of beer; I did not stay there five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went from the bar into the tap room who did you leave in the bar. - A. I left the prisoner alone in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that had she been left alone to your knowledge. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your any money in this bar. - A. Yes, I fetched it down to pay the brewer; I expected the brewer in every minute; I brought down four score pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of it consist of gold. - A. I took out nineteen guineas in gold, for my distiller; sixty pounds I left in one bag, that was for the brewer.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you placed in the bar. - A. I had placed it in a cupboard in the bar; twenty pounds in one bag and sixty pounds in another; it was all in the cupboard at the time when I left the prisoner alone; the brewer had not called.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been in the tap room did you go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130008"></xptr>into the bar again. - A. Yes. I was not gone five minutes; when I returned she was gone. I found nobody there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she before signified her intention of going. - A. She said before, she wondered a gentleman had not called upon business, she was an independent gentlewoman at Richmond; she had not paid her reckoning, that made me distrust that she had taken my money. When I missed her I looked into my cupboard directly; I found twenty pounds was gone, and the bag with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not described the gold that was in the bag. - A. Twelve guineas in gold, and fourteen half guineas and one shilling; I am sure that was the contents of the bag. When I perceived this money was gone I was very much alarmed, I called my daughter down stairs; some people at the door heard me, they came in, and she was pursued; my maid and some of my neighbours went after her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go after her. - A. No, I did not; she was taken in less than an hour by Mr. Newman's servant; they took her to the magistrate, I saw her there. When I went into the room at the magistrate's I sat down, she came to me and went down upon her knees; she said, oh, my dear Mrs. Potter here is your money that I robbed you of, I ask forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to her before that. - A. I never spoke to her before that; she gave me the bag and the money; I took it out and told it, it was right, and the bag contained the twelve guineas; I cannot be positive as to say that there was the exact quantity of half guineas; I was flurried; they told it out, and they told me it was right.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bag that the money was in. - A. In their giving me the money I put it in my pocket, and I was going home; I dropped the bag, I did not think the bag was of any consequence as I had got the money. I begged forgiveness for her; Dr. Glasse would not let her go, he asked for the money; I gave it him. I should have taken care of the bag if I had known it had been of any consequence; but as she gave me the money I took no notice of the bag.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Newman, a butcher at Brentford. From information I went in pursuit of the prisoner; her person was described to me by Mrs. Potter. When I came up to the prisoner, I asked her whether she had slept at Brentford last night, she said no; I told her I thought she had, and she must be the person that robbed the widow woman at the public house, and she must go back with me; I took her back a little way to meet Mrs. Potter's servant maid, to know whether it was the right person or not; she said she was. I sent for the constable and took her to Dr. Glasse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took her to Dr. Glasse did you stay there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise of forgiveness if she would confess. - A. No, nor any body else that I heard, no more than Mrs. Potter wished Dr. Glasse to forgive her.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what passed. - A. Directly Mrs. Potter came into the room she was very ill, the prisoner immediately came to Mrs. Potter and downed upon her knees, and put the money into her hand in a bag, then the money was taken out of the bag; Mrs. Potter first told it; I believe she said it consisted of the same money that she had lost; the prisoner said nothing but begged for mercy of Mrs. Potter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say whose money it was when she put it into Mrs. Potter's hands. - A. He said it was Mrs. Potter's money.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Are you sure that the prisoner at the bar is the same person. - A. Yes.</p>

             BUTLEN. I produce the money; I saw it in the office in Marlborough-street, of which I am chief clerk; I received it in the presence of Dr. Glasse and Mr. Brodie; it was laid down on the table in a piece of paper; I was directed by Dr. Glasse to take it up and put it in the paper. I did and Dr. Glasse wrote his name upon it; I put this office seal upon it directly.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I was present when the money was delivered to Mr. Butler.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Butler open it and see what it consists of. A. Twelve guineas, fourteen half guineas and one shilling; there was one guinea which Mrs. Potter thought she could swear to particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Potter look at that money, do you know any particular piece of money among it. - A. Yes, I can swear to this guinea, only by the crook.</p>
               <p>Q. Another guinea might be the same. - A. Another might be the same.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Jury. Mrs. Potter when you received the money in the bag, did you know that bag to be yours. - A. Yes, it was the same bag; I should not have dropped the bag but I did not know any thing would occur further.</p>

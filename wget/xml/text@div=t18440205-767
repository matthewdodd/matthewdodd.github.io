                  </hi>. I am porter at the Eastern Counties Railway-station, at Shoreditch. There is a class of fares called "excess fares"—it was my duty to take them on the 28th of Dec.—on the arrival of the luggage train from Col<lb></lb>chester, I received for three persons and a child 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for excess fares—I paid it over to the prisoner immediately, and produced one of the party who had come up as acting-guard to the prisoner at the time—I received the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from that person—I told the prisoner the particulars of these receipts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the London-station of the Railway—the excess fares are created by persons not having taken tickets, or losing their tickets—it was the inspector's duty to pay these excess fares to me—the prisoner was an inspector—if a sum was paid to him on the 28th of Dec; it was his duty to pay it me by nine o'clock the next morning—he did not pay me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has not paid this since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you do not know whether he was on duty on the 28th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there are other inspectors besides him—they take turns—Pocock was there occasionally—the prisoner was busily engaged when he was there—it was the Christmas week—mistakes will occur in the hurry of business, which was about the same at that time as it is in the summer season—this is the book—here is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. put down as paid to me on the 29th of Dec—in most cases that would show that it was paid to the prisoner on the 28th, but it was not so in this case—here is the prisoner's memorandum to show it was not—he has inserted on the document 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 29th, and if this was for money received on the 28th, it ought to have been dated the 28th—I bave no document of money received on the 28th—this was paid on the 29th),</p>

On 10th September, at 3 a.m., while on duty on the towing path of the River Lea with Breed, I saw the two prisoners jump over a wall—I pursued them and arrested Evans, and Breed caught Shehan—we took them back to the rear of the tobacconist's shop, 775, Commercial Road, and took them to the station—Evans had a bundle of tobacco under his arm, and 24 meerschaum pipes in his pocket</p>

I was with Barrett and saw the I prisoners Getting over the wall—I pursued Shehan and caught him—while runing he dropped these four coats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "What have you I been doing?"—he called to the man in front, "Bill, don't see a mate taken, come and help me," and commenced to struggle violently, and I was obliged to strike him, as I was nearly going into the water—I took him along the towing-path—he was very violent—whilst going along he took three meer schaum pipes from his pocket and threw them down—I picked them up and got him to the station and searched him, and found four more pipes upon him. Cross-examined. I was about 20 or 30 yards from them when I saw them jump over the wall—the third man, who has not been caught, was running in front when Shehan dropped the coats—all the men ran in the same direction down the towing-path—they could not get out till they had run some distance to the bridge—the towing path is open to the public.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of January, a draft was presented me for payment at Mess.

When Dorr had mentioned that he found it, Rapley then walked about the office, and said, for Christ's sake! speak the truth? then they were both secured.</p>

               <p>When he came in after this, he said, I am much confused; and at that time, Rapley was walking about the office, as you call it? - He said, after he had said I received it from Mr. Manley, at the coffee-house; says he, gentlemen, you confuse me much, I have found it; on which, Rapley said, for God's sake! tell all you know about it?</p>
               <p>They were examined separately after this, and their stories perfectly agreed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said you knew it was not Mr. Joseph's writing, because it was signed Samuel contracted? - I am perfectly sure it is not his writing; I have paid many thousand pounds to his orders.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the partners of this house: on the 28th of January, the prisoner at the bar, Rapley, came into my inner room to me, between nine and ten in the morning: the first thing that passed on his entering the room was, Mr. Woodhouse asked him how he would receive the draft? he said, fifty pounds bank, and the rest money; and then he asked Rapley from whom he received the draft? he said, from a person at the door; I then desired him to go to the door, and bring in the person, which he did: Mr. Woodhouse went with him, and returned with Dorr; I then asked Dorr his name? he told me: I then asked him his business? he said a master carpenter; and that he worked in the Temple. I then asked him from whom he received the draft? he said from a gentleman in a coffee-house in the Temple; I then asked him if he knew him? he said, Yes; I then asked his name? he said, Manley; he then said, I am much frightened.</p>
               <p>Had Rapley interposed all this while? - He had not; he said he found it on Black-friars-bridge: they were then desired to walk into another office, and were secured.</p>
               <p>How long bath Mr. Joseph kept cash with you? - For seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to look at that paper, and see if any part of the hand-writing is according to Mr. Joseph's? - I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Have you the least doubt in your own mind, that it is a forgery? - I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>You do not know the state of his account at that time? - I do not.</p>
               <p>If he should chanced to have over drawn, should you have paid it? - I should.</p>
               <p>I observe the word Manley is written on the back of the note? - I understood it so, and as such wrote it down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Counsel. You wrote on the back of the draft yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All this transaction had taken up a small space of time? - Not a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>When Rapley came into the shop, what was the first thing said within your hearing? - Mr. Woodhouse asked him the first thing, how he would have the draft.</p>
               <p>You said, the only question you yourself asked of Rapley, was how he came by it? he immediately told you he had it from a man at the door. Did you go to see if there was such a person at the door? - The man was brought in.</p>
               <p>Then you repeated the question to him, but varied the term: you asked him of whom he received it; you did not ask him how he came by it? - I understood it the same.</p>
               <p>Your question was, of whom you received it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it was, he gave you the name of a person, and told you the profession he followed, was a carpenter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then nothing more passed between you and Rapley; and the man appeared much confused? - Yes: Dorr immediately on uttering the name of the person, appeared confused, and instantly said he had found it: and Rapley said, son Christ's sake! tell all you know about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have already told us that untill Dorr had mentioned the name of the person Manley, Rapley did not interpose? - Not one question.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time afterwards, hear from Rapley, whether he had previous to this, received any information how Dorr came by the note? - No, not till I came to Bow-street: then Rapley said that Dorr came to his house in the evening of the 27th, and told him he had found a draft.</p>
               <p>The question I would ask of you, was, whether Rapley interposed any observations<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240090"></xptr>Dorr said he had found it? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Rapley had no opportunity of hinting to you the falshood of Dorr's assertion, till he did? - No, none.</p>
               <p>You asked Rapley how he came by it; but when Dorr came in, you asked him how he received it, supposing he might have received it from some body? - Certainly; it seemed to me to be a proper question to ask, and as such I asked it.</p>


               <p>Mr. Fielding to Woodhouse. You was at the examination at Bow-street? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>I believe some circumstances you heard there; and after that, you examined into the truth of them, and found them true? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Does Mr. Joseph draw on Mess. Prescott, on checks? - Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of the prisoners at the bar? - No, I never saw them at my house, nor any where else, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Wolfe. What persons is Mr. Joseph's family composed of? - There are two brothers to Mr. Joseph.</p>
               <p>Of what ages? - They are grown up; one of them has a family.</p>
               <p>Is there any young man who has access to the place where his checks are kept? - He admits strangers never, and very seldom his brother.</p>
               <p>Where are the bankers checks kept; are they kept under lock and key? - To the best of my knowledge they are.</p>
               <p>Have you any real ground to doubt of the hand-writing of the word January? - No, none in the least; it is not like any one's about our house.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hollingsworth. Are the checks delivered in a book, or how are they delivered? - They are given in whole sheets mostly, but sometimes cut.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Joseph. Are they delivered to you in sheets, or some ready cut? - Some one way, and some another.</p>
               <p>Could you lose any of these checks without knowing it? - I suppose I might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Every other customer has the same checks, my lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Joseph. Do you know when you received the last checks, previous to the 28th of January? - At the beginning of January, after settling of the book: I took home a new book, and a parcel of checks.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether these checks are of the fresh supply, previous to the 28th of January? - All the checks I then received, were delivered to me this way. (Some produced.)</p>
               <p>Have you had occasion to have your checks altered? - No, not lately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Woodhouse. When your checks come home, they do not come home cut in this state in which they are now? - Some do; some do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the check is engraved over five or six times, or only once? - I believe only once.</p>
               <p>Court. It is obvious they make but one drawing of a sheet.</p>
               <p>Court to Hollingsworth. When was your name first introduced into the business? - About two years ago.</p>
               <p>How long has this firm been in use? - About a twelvemonth, to the present time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Rapley. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

            's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I cannot say any thing but what I said at Bow-street; and as to the rest, I leave it to your lordship and my counsel.</p>
               <p>PRISONER RAPLEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday evening, the 27th of January, Dorr came to my house about the hour of nine in the evening: after the usual ceremony of how do you do, he told me he had been lucky in finding a draft for a good deal of money; that he had been over Black-friars-bridge to fetch something, and that on his return, nearly facing the Albion Mills, he saw a paper lay, and picked it up, and looked at it as well as he could by the light of the moon; that he proceeded on his way home; and on this side of Black-friars-bridge, he stopped and looked at it by the light of a paper lanthorn; that he took it home, and thought upon consultation, he would call upon me, which he did, and asked me if I was going into the City the next day? I told him I was; and he said he would get me to get it cashed for him: I asked him again in particular, to tell me the manner of his finding it? and he described it exactly as before; I told him I would call on him in the morning, and hoped he had told me the true state of his coming by it; I called on him in the morning, and went with him; he said, if you will be so kind as to receive this for me, as I never was at a banker's, you will do me a great deal of service. The truth of this story of his coming to me, remains with my counsel; I believe they have sufficient witness of his being there; and also of his telling the story in the hearing of others. I observed the draft was dirty at the time he presented it to me; and I asked him whether the draft was off the pavement, or not? he said it was a little off, on the horse road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dorr. After I had left work, I went home and had a dish of tea; after that, I went over the water to redeem a cloak which was pledged; and not having money enough for that, I took a gown of my wife's, and pledged it for five shillings, at Parker's; the cloak was in for three shillings, and the interest was one shilling more; so the cloak was brought down, and I gave them the four shillings: as I was going home, before I came to Black-friars-bridge, just by the Albion Mills, I saw a piece of paper lay, which I stooped and picked up; and read it by the moonlight as well as I could; from that I went to the first light I saw: I stayed at an apple-stall, and read it; from this I went to my lodgings, and gave it to my wife, to look at it; I asked her if she thought it was proper for me to go to my brother in law's? she said, yes, by all means; so I called at Mr. Rapley's, who agreed to get the cash for me; and that is the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Rapley. After Dorr was gone, some gentlemen (acquaintances of mine) came to my house; I told to two of these gentlemen, separately, the circumstance of the draft being found, and by whom; and asked their opinion of the business; the gentlemen are attending to prove this; to prove my shewing it them, and asking them their opinion; their answer was, if I could place an implicit confidence in Dorr, and thought he came by it by no improper means, they could see no great harm there could be in tendering it for payment: and this each of them said.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am thirteen: I think that is the man (points to Dorr) that stopped at the paper lanthorn, I believe four weeks ago, yesterday.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening? - The watchman was coming half past eight.</p>
               <p>What did he do? - He held up a piece of paper, and looked at it.</p>
               <p>Who was keeping the stall at this time? - I and my sister.</p>
               <p>Which side of the way is the stall? - On the right-hand side, this side of the bridge, by Chatham-place; and that man came up, and held up a little bit of paper to the lamp; it was a paper about that size: I am sure that is the man that read the paper.</p>
               <p>Your sister was there at that time? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have told my friend it was four weeks ago, yesterday; do you reckon by the weeks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it this happened? - It was the middle of the week: the man took the note.</p>
               <p>Now this is Monday: if it was yesterday four weeks, it must have been on a Sunday? - It was not on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Now recollect yourself as well as you can, and tell me what day of the week it was? - I am sure it was in the middle of the week, because my sister was going to place the next day.</p>
               <p>She is older than you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you certain that the day the man came to the stall, was the day before your sister went to her place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon was it you was asked to remember this circumstance? - The next week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Who was it came to you? - It was a man; I should know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Was he a labouring man? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He said do not be frightened, I only want to speak a word with you.</p>
               <p>Where was this he came to you? - He came to my father's house: I live in Crown-court, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Then the first application they made to you, was at your father's house, Crown-court, Fleet-street: they did not come while you was at the stall? - I believe my sister told them at the stall: I, myself, saw them at the house first.</p>
               <p>Was there no one at the stall, but yourself and sister, when the man read the paper? - Yes, there was a gentleman buying some oranges.</p>
               <p>No woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you take any particular notice of the paper: do you think you would know it if you was to see it: do you know whether it was wrote upon or no? - There was some writing upon it.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you about it? - He said nothing to me about it</p>
               <p>Did he desire you to take notice? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the man before? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>How long did he stop? - He staid about three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>I wish you would recollect yourself, how many days it was after you saw the man at the stall, before you was asked any questions about it? - I believe it was the next week; I am not sure of it.</p>
               <p>How early in the week? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>In the beginning, or at the latter end? - In the beginning.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper, and see whether it was such a paper as that? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>And it appears to have as much writing on it, and as clean? - I did not take so much notice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. He did not desire you to look at it? - No: there was a man buying oranges at the same time.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of January, I was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240094"></xptr>other end of the town, and called upon Mr. Rapley; after I was there some time, he shewed me a draft, which he said an acquaintance of his had found that evening.</p>
               <p>Did you look at it? - I did; (looks at it) this is the draft, I made a remark of a blot on the ought at the time.</p>

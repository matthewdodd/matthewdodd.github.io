The house is let out in offices; I have two bedrooms, and occupy the front attic myself—the street door is open in the day—on 23rd Aug., about twelve o'clock in the day, I left my bedroom for two hours, and accidentally left the door unlocked; it opens on to the staircase—on my return I found the drawers open, and the room stripped—I missed two gowns, two petticoats, a cloak, a blanket, a satin visite, and other articles of mine, and a waistcoat which was left in my charge—this visite is mine, and this cap also, I made it myself; this petticoat I can speak positively to—I have not found more than half of what I lost.</p>

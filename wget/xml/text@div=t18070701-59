               <p>Q. Have you a barge of the name of Fly. - A. She is called by the name of Fly, but my bargeman has put the name of the Dart on it. On that day I had been to town; in the evening of the day before I saw seventy five quarters of malt on board of her.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information from Williams, did you go to the place where your vessel was moored. - A. I did not go on board the barge, I saw she was all of one side; they had taken the malt all out of one side of her. I took a boat, I went down the river till I came to a place called Rail's Head Ferry in Isleworth; there are two ferrys, this is the upper ferry, the nearest to Richmond; there I saw

               <p>Q. Did Rouse point out any thing to your attention. - A. He did, he shewed me the track of a cart; that had been there that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near the creek of the river. - A. There is a creek near where the cart had stood.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it that you saw the track of that cart from where your boat was. - A. About a mile. I discovered the cart by the track of this place where it stood; that it had been secreted in a field; there was the track of the horse's feet in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the Shoulder of Mutton field. - A. It is nearly opposite; it is on the right hand side going towards Twickenham, there is a field within twenty yards of this bridge; there I saw where the horse had stood, by the impressions of the horse's feet having stood a long time. I traced the horse and cart from that field to the bridge; on looking at the ground where the tail of the cart had been; I there discovered grains of malt scattered about the field; I will say there was forty grains of malt where the cart had been; I took some of that malt up, it had the flavour and appearance of my malt; I then looked to see which way the cart went from there, and as I imagined, I saw it went over from Isleworth to Brentford; but previous to that I observed where this horse had stood, that on the near foot before the horse had a shoe off; that I observed near where the cart was standing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there much trampling of the horse there. - A. There was, and that horse had scratched a good deal, as if he had gibbed, as if he did not go away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010050"></xptr> very kindly from the spot. I made enquires of the watchmen, I got some information; in consequence of that I went to the magistrate, he granted me a search warrant against Hearn and others. I searched Hearn's house and found nothing. We searched Cradle's, and their in a room on the ground floor I found fifteen sacks of malt, the quantity lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks had these sacks that you found. - A. They were marked W. Raymond on one side, and Richmond on the other, with red paint; our sacks are generally marked so. I can swear they are my sacks, and they contained malt.</p>
               <p>Q. As near as you can swear to grain of that description, can you say it is the same sort of malt as you lost. - A. As near as a person can swear to it, it is mine; I believe it is the malt that was taken from my vessel; I have some of them both here; I had a sample left in the boat, and I believe it to be the same upon comparison.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the sacks. - A. The sacks cost me three shillings a piece, I will put them at two shillings. The malt is worth seventy two shillings a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth twenty pounds. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to a man of the name of Ratcliffe. - A. I did; the horse was not at home, the horse had gone to the farrier's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Is any body interested in your business. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the cart stationed in the field, from where your barge was moored. - A. About a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that the only conveyance of your malt to this cart must be by boats. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much would be the value of a sack of malt, including the sack at two shillings. - A. The sack and the malt would be worth about thirty seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. A small boat would not carry many sack at one time. - A. The boat would carry fifteen sacks at one time, and rather more.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular in your malt from any other maltster's. - A. We colour your malt different from a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Other people may do it in the same way as you do. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. You have been asked whether a wherry would carry fifteen sacks - did you afterwards see Rouse's boat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that carry fifteen sacks. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to Hearn's house. - A. The next day; in the afternoon I went to Cradles, and there I found the fifteen sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a sample left. - A. Yes, one part comes from what was lost, and the other from the bulk (a sample of each shown to the jury).</p>
               <p>Jury. There is not the least doubt but they are of one sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp (to prosecutor). Had you sold any malt of that flavour. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you sold any to Hearne or Cradle. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did you sell the fifteen sacks out of that barge. - A. No, I do not recollect selling fifteen sacks to any individual. That is not the exact quantity.</p>

Yes, the horse had scratched a good deal, and had been very much loaded; it appeared as if he had struggled with the load; on the near foot before I observed the horse had no shoe on. I traced the cart over the bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the horse gib. - A. Yes, close to Ratcliff's house; first of all I heard a great noise, I looked and saw a horse and cart go backwards; I went to see and there was the three prisoners in the cart; I saw them going towards the Hounslow road.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards, before Hearn and Cradle were taken up, meet Hughes. - A. Yes, he asked me if I thought there would be any harm of it; now Mr Raymond had got his property. I met him in New Brentford, near the market place; that was the first he said to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been with the warrant before to Cradle's house. - A. Yes, I went with a search warrant, and took away the fifteen sacks of malt; they have been in my custody ever since.</p>

             and others, to a public house at Brentford. - A. I did, to the Plow, in Windmill-lane; I saw Hearn and Cradle there in the tap-room; when we went into the room, I said to them both, you are my prisoners; they asked me for what, I told them for Mr. Raymond's business, for the malt; they then made use of very abusive language, and said they would not be taken; they made towards the door, we persevered in keeping them from the door; the scuffle between us might last for a quarter of an hour, they were defending themselves against us; Cradle and I scuffled, he attempted to hit me, I guarded myself; I did not receive any blows. The greatest scuffle was between Hearn and Mr. Hughes; at last we secured them. We got to the door, and we kept the door shut; and somebody tapped at the door, which proved to be the party that went out with us; they went one way and we another; and there was a good deal of scuffling in the street.</p>

            . - Mr. Reynolds. We have heard that you accompanied the last witness to apprehend Cradle and Hearn. - A. I did. Cradle at first gave me a violent blow on my right eye, and set me reeling; and Hearn said, you b - r, give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you declared what you came for. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they make use of any other particular expression. - A. Hearn swore he would knock my fat guts out, and he began to kick my belly; I was knocked down three times by Cradle, and twice by Hearn; and I knocked them down as much. Cradle went to the fire place to get the poker; he said let me get my staff, and I knocked him down against the settle. They were very violent in the street, they kicked my shins, and bruised me all over, from my ancle to my knees; I have many black marks on my body; we were nearly an hour and a half getting them in the cage. Hearn sat himself down and said, do now what you please; I got hold of his heels, and gave him a complete somerset, and turned him over into the cage. I have now the marks of Hearn's teeth in my hand.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 29th of May, I apprehended the lad at Stoney Stratford, nine miles from Newcastle; I told him what I apprehended him for; he denied at first, I told him I was satisfied he knew Mr. Raymond, and he knew the malt, I dare say; he denied knowing any thing of it. I took him to a public house, I ordered him something to eat, and left him in the care of the constable of the town; after he had something to eat, he had a mug of ale, and half an hour after that he burst out crying; he said he was sent by Hearn and Cradle to get a cart, he went with the cart, he drove it into a field near Islworth; he waited there pretty near an hour and a half; Cradle and Hearn came up with some bags, filled with something, that he did not know; they put a quantity in the cart; as they were driving the horse out of the field, the horse gibbed, and would not carry the load; they took it back again to the boat, and ordered him to take the horse back again, which he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. It appeared to you from all this boy said, that this boy was employed as a servant, and under their controul. - A. I understood him so.</p>
               <p>Hearn's Defence. I am innocent of the robbery I am indicted for; I was not on the water all that night.</p>
               <p>Cradle's Defence. I was coming home from my work, I picked this boat up, she was adrift, and when I took her on shore she was sinking; I took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010052"></xptr> malt into my house, expecting somebody would own it, as the boat was sinking. I went to work about my business, as I heard nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Hughes's Defence. My father and I went to Kingston with the cart, and when we came back I put the horse into the stable and the cart into the yard; my father and I on Friday night went to Mr. Nott's at Kingston, on business,.</p>
               <p>Hughes called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hearn and Cradle called no witnesses to character.</p>

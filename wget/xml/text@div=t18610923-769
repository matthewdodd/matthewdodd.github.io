               <p>o'clock, I met the deceased and his wife in Shoreditch, coming towards the Eastern Counties Railway; the deceased had evidently been drinking very freely, and he and his wife were quarrelling—I persuaded him to get home—he asked her to come with him—she was frightened of his striking her, and said she should go to his cousin's and sleep, and not go home—she went across on to the other side of the way—I was speaking to her at the corner of Church-street, begging her to go in, when the prisoner came up and interfered, and asked if anybody had been hitting her—she said, "No"—I told him to go on about his business and not to interfere, it was a man and his wife having a few words—he refused to go on and kept making some remarks—Mr. Riley came up—the deceased came across with a knife in his hand—Riley said to me, "He has got a knife"—I turned round and took it out of his hand, shut it up, and put it in my pocket—with that his wife ran across the road to where some policemen were standing—the deceased followed her, I followed him, and the prisoner also followed—I said to him, "Why don't you go about your business?—he said, "I have a right to be here as well as anybody else"—I said, "You see the man is tipsy, why interfere?"—with that the deceased said, "What do you want to interfere with my wife for?" and he struck the prisoner—the moment he did that they began to spar—they fought for some four, five, or six minutes—the policemen then parted them—Riley then told the prisoner to shake hands, and go on about his business—they shook hands together, and I them laid hold of the deceased to take him home; we went one way and the prisoner another—about eight or ten minutes afterwards, as I was getting the deceased home, the prisoner came up again, tapped the deceased on the shoulder, and as he turned round he said, "You have struck me in the eye"—I told him again to go on about his business and not to interfere—the deceased smiled and said, "Well, I don't know that I struck you at all," and with that the prisoner up with his fist and struck him under the ear, and the man fell at my feet—he had not made any attempt to strike the prisoner; his hand was down.</p>

I was in company with Philo and his wife, and Free<lb></lb>man on the night in question—I saw nothing of the prisoner until Philo had left me, and was walking across the road after his wife—he had a knife in his hand—I spoke to Freeman; the prisoner came up and said some<lb></lb>thing to the woman—I did not hear what passed between them—she ran across the road, and the prisoner went over also to where there were some policeman standing—Philo walked across after the prisoner and said, "What have you had to do with my wife?"—the prisoner said, "I have a right to be here as well as anybody else"—Philo up with his fist and hit the prisoner in the eye or some part of his face—I said to the prisoner, "This young fellow is very drunk and has had a quarrel with his wife, go away; don't interfere any more; shake hands and make it up"—I put their hands together, and as I understood they were to have no more of it—we went</p>

               <p>one way and he another—as we were standing at the corner of New-inn-yard, Shoreditch, when the prisoner came back, some seven or eight minutes afterwards, I turned round and said, "What is the use of your coming here to have any more quarrel?"—he touched the deceased and said, "You struck me first"—Philo was standing with his head down, and he said half laughing, "I don't know as I did"—the prisoner immediately stepped back, up with his right hand and hit him in the jaw or some part of the face, and he fell at my feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London hospital—the deceased was brought there on Friday morning, 30th August, between 2 and 3; he was quite insensible, bleeding from the ear and exhibiting a great deal of restlessness and struggling—he died on the following Monday morning—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found that the cause of death was a laceration of the brain and a fracture at the base of skull—they were such injuries as are generally caused by a fall or blow, or any violence to the head—I do not know of a case in which a blow has directly caused it—a blow and a fall together would account fur the death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to one of the learned Judges. On the 10th of January, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I was returning home from Westminster-bridge, I had been with some friends, and had taken a good deal of wine—I believe I was in Lee-street on my way home, and went into Hadlow-street—one street leads into another—I fell into company with Frances Farr, and went with her to No. 34, Hadlow-street, into the front parlour—I there found the prisoner Davis, and the witness Milton, whom Farr represented as her brandy—they partook of it—I did not drink any of it—after being there two or three hours the room door opened, and Elizabeth Stan<lb></lb>nard and another woman presented themselves at the door—prior to that, however, Davis had left the room for some time, and had re<lb></lb>turned to the room again—when Mrs. Stannard and the other woman came in, they began complaining of our keeping them up so long, as they had work to do in the morning, and in a very uncivil kind of way—I immediately turned round to Farr, and asked whether that woman was her landlady—she said no, she was a servant, and that the other woman was her landlady—the other woman was very mild in her manner—the female prisoner was very violent, and I became indignant—I thought I was insulted, as well as every one in the room—I turned round to Farr, and said, "Do you allow yourself and us to be insulted in that way by that broad-faced Scotch woman?" (I cannot say I really was convinced of her being Scotch, but that was my idea,) she immediately flew at me like a tigress, siezed the frill of my shirt, tore my shirt right through my body, and beat me about in a most unmerciful manner—(<hi rend="italic">producing a shirt</hi>) here is the blood on it which came from me—whether Davis participated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300066"></xptr>
               <p>in the beating it is impossible to say—I was dreadfully mutilated, and was bleeding at the nose—a knock came at the door, and the man Stannard presented himself—I immediately took my hat up. and made a rush, I was fortunate enough to pass in time; I caught hold of the street-door lock, and was about to push it back, when Davis rushed at me, caught hold of my watch, and forced it away from my fob; and at the same instant a silver guard which was round my neck, attached to a silver watch which I had in my waistcoat-pocket, was taken away—the watch was held by a silk guard under my waistcoat—that guard was broken, and I have part of it here—I did not lose the other watch—I had a Bristol diamond-pin in my shirt, which I lost—Stannard came to the door before I lost my watch, but after I lost my pin—I cannot say that he did any thing to me—I did not observe it—I rushed out of the house and called the police—one came at first, and then two others—they knocked at the door, and asked to be admitted—they were kept a long time without being admitted (on my rushing out of the house I had heard the door bolted) at last the police were admitted, and I went with one of them into the front<lb></lb>parlour—that was the room I had been in—we then went into the back-parlour, and then into the yard—the policemen heard something, and im<lb></lb>mediately scaled the wall—of course I know nothing more, except that my property was afterwards produced—when I went to the house I was under the influence of wine, but after the beating I got sober, and I was quite collected—I had been in the house two hours and a half, or three hours—I drank nothing in the house—the policeman had the opportunity of seeing the state I was in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you drink in this house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was not in any other house but Nicholls' hotel, at the foot of Westminster-bridge—I had walked from there, and went into this house—they asked me to have a share of the drink, but I declined it—Farr asked me—we were not on the sofa together—she was on one chair and I on another, and the two young men were on chairs—there was a sofa in the room—I believe they all drank but me—Farr and I were friendly while I was there—they behaved remarkably kind to me—the two young men, and Miss Farr did—I thought it a very pleasant evening at the time—they fetched some water up to put into the brandy, as I refused to allow Miss Farr to drink it in the neat state—I said, "This is my brandy at all events; you shall not drink it without water"—to the best of my recollection, it was Davis went down for the water—he behaved re<lb></lb>markably well—he said he had been to St. Sebastian, and was going back—I recommended him not to go back—Milton said he was a tailor, and he showed me some patterns, and asked me for an order—we were all very comfortable—I took Davis for a young gentleman—if it had not been for the woman Standard, I believe it would all have gone on well—I have no reason to believe otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had it not been for the unfortunate observation you made abort her having a broad Scotch face, do not you think nothing would have hap<lb></lb>pened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Indeed, I will not swear that in the affirmative, for Davis went out of the room and returned just before them, and I was surrounded by the two men and that woman; she laying on with tremendous blows—Farr was not one of the women surrounding me—she behaved very well to me, and tried to protect me—I thought she turned very pale—I am not certain of receiving any blows from any body but the Scotch woman; and they were tremendous blows—she is a very powerful woman—I would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300067"></xptr>
               <p>not contend against a woman of that sort—I would not strike a woman—I would not condescend—I had my knuckles wounded in defending myself I am decidedly no match for her—I was defending myself from the ssault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not during this affray in a dreadful state of agitation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; I was as collected as I am now, except the little excite<lb></lb>ment remaining from the wine—I believe the combat made me more sensible from the loss of blood—I was astonished at such conduct—I had a very good opportunity of observing what was done, except when being actually beaten, but I could see her thumping my head almost to atoms—it wss almost like a jelly—I wonder I am alive to tell the story—it was all done instantaneously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> While you and Miss Farr were in agreeable conversation together before this happened, might your hand have gone as far as hers shoulder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly—it was round her neck; and I kissed her too—I will not disguise any thing—you shall have every thing you want—the truth, and nothing but the truth—I took her hand—I did not rest it on my lap—I am quite satisfied I did not—I should not be to ungentlemanly—I know your allusion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you go to the house for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is another thing—very likely for the same purpose as all foolish young men go for—I certainly can not recollect all that took place in the room, but I was never alone with Farr—I was introduced by her to the young men as her brothers—they re<lb></lb>mained chatting with me a great time, and then Davis went out—I had sobered down almost to my collected ideas before the women came into the room—they offered me drink, and I refused it, I knew I had enough—when Mrs. Stannard first came into the room, she addressed herself to Farr—she did not speak to me before I spoke to her—I did not call her a broad face Scotch b——I will swear that positively—for. I do not believe a baser term can be applied to a woman, and I am sure my gentlemanly feelings would not allow it—I had been two hours and a half or three hours in the house, and I was sobered down—I distinctly said, "broad-faced Scotch woman," and not the other term which I won't dirty my lips with—it was after that that she attacked me—I had the pin in my shirt—m taking hold of my shirt the pin would come out first, and here is the hole where it came out—I have certainly said I did not see her hands on the pin, but there is the hole in the frill as if it was torn out—she flew at me like a tigress at once, speak<lb></lb>tog to me and tearing at me—it was instantaneously done—she said some<lb></lb>thing, but what it was I cannot say—directly the words were out of my mouth, she flew at me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. On the 10th of January, I met Mr. Raynolds about twelve o'clock or a little after, and we went together to the ground floor of No. 34, Hadlow-street—Davis and Milton were in the room and Mrs. Morgan, the landlady's daughter—we had some brandy and water to drink—about two hours or two hours and half after we had been in the room, Mrs. Stannard came in—Milton and Davis were both in the room during that time—I was not left alone with Mr. Raynolds at all—Mrs. Stannard entered the room with Mrs. Morgan, and said, "We are working people, now are you not going to bed?"—I said, "Mrs. Stannard, I am quite ready to go to bed, but there are people in the house who are going out; you are not my landlady, I wish my landlady to speak, if there is any thing the matter"—and said it was a liberty she had taken in insulting me in my own place—the gentleman then arose, and said, "Farr, do you allow yourself to be insulted by a broad-faced Scotchwoman like that?"—I am tare he said "Scotch woman"—Mrs. Stannard then collared him, and beat him between the two doors up to the parlour window, and ill treated him very much—I went to take his part, so far as to lay hold of her arm, and begged her to be quiet and not kick up a disturbance, as nothing of the kind had occurred where I had lived before—she turned her hand, and said to me "D—your eyes if you do not stand off I will murder you"—and of course I was afraid of my own life—Mrs. Stannard and Davis took the prosecutor up into the corner of the room, beat him very much, and ill-treated him—the moment Mr. Stannard entered the room, Mrs. Stannard released the gentleman, who took his hat and rushed out of the parlour as fast as he could into the passage—I did not go into the passage—the candle was put out by Mrs. Stannard—the door was open, there was a great scuffle in the passage with Mr. and Mrs. Stannard and Davis—I did not see what took place in the passage—Davis and the other two prisoners were there at the time, but nobody else that I know of, the door was fastened—it was not open, that I know of—after the scuffle, Mrs. Stannard turned out of the passage blew out the light in my room, and after that the three prisoners got over the back wall, which I dare say is about four feet high—Mr. Stannard did not come into the room till after Mr. Raynolds had been ill-treated I saw a breast-pin in Mr. Raynold's shirt—I remember Davis leaving the room and coming back, about half an hour before Mrs. Stannard came in.</p>

JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear what Mr. Raynolds said to Mrs. Stannard when she came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When she came in, she said she would not have that disturbance in her house—Miss Farr rose and said she did not see why Mrs. Stannard should come, and insult them in the manner she had done—Mr. Raynolds then rose and said, he did not see that a broad-faced Scotch woman should insult them in the manner she had done—he did not call her any thing else, in my hearing—I lodge at No. 15, Lancaster-street—I do not know how long I have known Farr—I have been in the neighbourhood about three years—I have known her about twelve months, perhaps—I have seen her at different times—she knew where I lived—she never called on me—she knew the number of my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to the house in con<lb></lb>sequence of an alarm—my attention was directed to a back wall in the yard—in consequence of something I heard, I followed to the back yard of No. 37 in the same street—I there found the three prisoners—they were trying to make their escape through the back door into No. 37—I sprang my rattle, inspector Campbell came to my assistance, and they were taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. I heard a rattle spring—I went to No. 37, Hadlow-street, and there found the three prisoners in the yard, and the daughter of one of them—I took them to No. 34, where Mr. Raynolds was—he said, in their presence, that they had robbed him—he spoke rather doubtingly about the man Stannard, and I let him go—when the prosecutor saw Davis and Mrs. Stannard he said they had robbed him and ill-treated him, and stolen from him a watch and silver guard—they neither of them made any reply—as we were going to the station-house Mrs. Stannard said, they could not hurt her, they could not prove she had stolen the watch; and Davis said he had nothing at all to do with it—I think he said, nothing to do with the robbery—next day I took Stannard again—he told me he was not present, and he had nothing to do with it—I also took Farr—she was released and made a wit<lb></lb>ness—before I took Mrs. Stannard and Davis to the station, I went into the front parlour of the house and found Shields there—he showed me a silver watch-guard, and a watch and seals attached to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was posted at the door of No. 34 by my sergeant—I am not positive who opened the door to me—I went into the front parlour, and under the cushion of the sofa there, found a silver watch and seals—on further search I found a silver guard-chain broken, on the floor under the sofa—I searched for another part of a guard<lb></lb>chain, but could not succeed in finding it—I did not find any pin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist, and live in Chad's-row, Gray's-inn-road. On the 10th of January, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was in Hadlow-street, and saw the prosecutor pushed out of a house—it appeared to me to be the male prisoner Stannard who pushed him out—the passage at that time was full of persons—Stannard did not come out of the house—it appeared a violent push—the prosecutor would hare fallen, had I not put out my arms and caught him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The passage appeared to be crowded, so that whether the pushing was in consequence of any body poshing behind Stannard, you could not tell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It could not be to, for Stannard stood with the door in one hand, and with the other hand appear<lb></lb>ing to push him forwards—there was a light in the passage—I could not see what it was from, but it was sufficient for me to see what was going on; but as I was in a side direction, I could not see far up the passage—I was in my way home from a friend's house, No. 45, Hadlow-street, and it was ray nearest way home—I cannot call to mind at this moment whether I had dined there, but evidently I took tea there—I recollect that I did, but I do not know whether I dined there—I cannot say what time I got there—I took tea about six o'clock—I am in the habit of being there many times in a day, and cannot call to mind what time I went—I sat there drinking brandy and water, and then I had about one glass of wine I believe—I am positive that is all the wine I had—it was port—I took that about nine o'clock, and then sat down to supper—we supped about eleven o'clock—I cannot recollect what we were doing between nine and eleven o'clock—a song or two was sung, I believe—there was myself, a lady I am paying my addresses to, her sister, and her mother, who was occasionally in the room—I will swear there was not more than two others, and I rather think they were both females.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to be a witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By passing along, I stopped on the other side of the way—a person was at the door, speaking to a policeman, and he wished me to go into the house, as a person, a friend of his, as he called him, was in the house, likely to be robbed and murdered—he said, "This appears to me a drunken <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, if I was to interfere with every <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the street I should have enough to do"—there are a great many <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> in that street—I was not before the Magistrate—I left my address at the station-house at the time they went down—I said to the Inspector, "I am a man in business, and if you can do without my evidence before the Magistrate, I shall be glad"—he said if he wanted me, he would come for me—I did not appear at either of the examinations, not king sent for—Campbell gave me notice to be here, and one of the policemen brought me a subpoena last Saturday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you doing at this house where you were paying your addresses to one of the inmates, from nine till between three and four o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After supper I fell asleep, and they did not wake me till they were going to bed—they said it was time I was gone home—I am very often in the habit of staying there as late as that—my friends occupy the whole of the house—it is let out in lodgings—it is not let out in separate lodgings at all—there is nobody in the house, to my knowledge, who has a separate apartment—it is a house where boarders and lodgers are kept—two ladies lodge there besides the one I am paying my addresses to, and her sister—they are single, as far as I can judge—they have no.</p>

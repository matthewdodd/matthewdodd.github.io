            . I am the wife of William Bowie. On Friday the 29th of September we removed from Burr-street to Crombie-row, Mile-end Old-town; I had a trunk containing the articles stated in the indictment; I saw it put into the van a little before seven o'clock at night - here is a table-cloth and towel, which I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any mark upon them? A. My husband is a table-linen manufacturer - it is our own manufacture, and was the only one that was in the trunk of this pattern; I washed it the day before I put it into the trunk - it was marked E. B., but the the mark is picked out; I have sold a great many of that pattern; I know the napkin by the loop - that is not a general thing; I have seen some so, but few people take the trouble of doing it - here is a hole in one corner, by which I know it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I assisted in removing the goods - Morris had asked me if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260105"></xptr>wanted a van; I said, No, I had engaged one; I went again to get it, and when I came back, Morris was there; I had not hired him - we told them to put the trunks first into the van, but this trunk was left to the last - Morris then wanted to put it at the back on the top, but we moved a heavy basket of crockery, and put it under it - they were then in a hurry to get loaded, and I said, I would give them a pot of beer - we passed by a public-house opposite the London-docks - I gave Morris 1s. to get a pot of beer there; I saw several people come out of that house, and pass on - the van then went on to Crombie's-row, which may be a mile or a mile and a half; I took a basket, containing some glasses and light things, and went into the house; I had told Morris not to take anything out till I had seen it was all clear - when I went in, this trunk was in the van, and not a rope was touched, but I cannot say whether the rope was attached to the trunk or not - when I came out, I could not see the trunk - the basket was on the ground - Morris was about the place; I jumped on the van, and, when I had been up about a second, a man said that a man had gone down a turning on the other side of the way with a trunk of ours; I called to some one to run after him - Morris heard me, but he stopped about two minutes, pulling off his jacket; he then ran a little way, but returned in about a minute, and said, "Where is the man that said the trunk was gone?" there was an alarm, and a number of people round the van, so that I was afraid to go away myself; this is the trunk which I missed; I found it the next day at Mr. Dunbar's, a broker; I had observed it on the van, when I left it to go into the house; I know that my father had this pattern of tablecloths about fourteen years ago, and they were sold to Lady Cooke, of Norfolk, and a table-cloth of this pattern has been in use in our family ever since.</p>

            . I am a carman. I went to Burr-street to remove some goods, as I was going by the toll-gate near the London-docks; I saw Morris talking to the toll-man - he asked if I was going to Burr-street to load some furniture; I said, Yes - he asked if they would want any body to help - I said, I did not know; he said he had nothing to do, and had a great mind to go and see if he could get a job; he went in the van, and assisted to load the goods - this trunk came out last, and I was surprised at it, because I had given orders for the trunks to be placed in the bottom of the van - when we went to Crombie's-row Morris went with us, and he took this trunk out, and placed it on the ground; I asked him why he did not take it into the house; he said, the house was not ready; he then moved it to the side of the cart next the road; I asked him what he wanted with it; he said, To stand on it to reach a rope;" there was a rope that he might have wanted it for; and in a minute or two it was gone.</p>

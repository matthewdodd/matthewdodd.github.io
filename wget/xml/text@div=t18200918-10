            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner at Messrs. Childs'; he said he was sent by Mr. Dudfield, who kept the Antigallican, in Shire-lane; that a gentleman who came in there sent him to change it. I went to the Antigallican with him, they said a gentleman and a lady had been there, and given the waiter the cheque, and said they would return in half an hour. I called several times, but never found the gentleman.</p>

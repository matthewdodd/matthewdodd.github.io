I came down stairs directly; I asked King who it was he had delivered corn to; he in confusion and hesitation answered Joe, he said he had delivered him a bushel of oats for Moore, I then asked him how he could do it without acquainting me of it. I immediately went after Joe, and when I came up to Black Horse yard; I met Joe coming out with two nose bags full of corn; I asked Joe if he had any corn at my house that morning; he said, no; I told him I understood he had some for Moore that morning; he said it could not be him, for he had but just come down from his lodging, and was assisting the man to get his horses out with the coach. I then came back to my man, I was determined to bring them together; I said, are you sure it was Joe that had this corn; he said, yes; I had seen my man deliver it to Joe; I told Joe so. I asked my man if he was sure Joe had it for Moore; he said he supposed so, but Joe had not said; I then went to Joe again and I brought them together, and my man asked him if he had not some corn that morning; Joe then asked my pardon, said he thought I meant yesterday morning, I know I had some corn this morning. On the eve of the day I had my man taken up; I said, John, I am determined to know the truth; I know this is not the first time you have robbed me.</p>

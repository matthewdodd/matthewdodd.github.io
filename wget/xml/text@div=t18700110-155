                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at 4, Brill Row, Somers Town—on Saturday afternoon, 27th November, about 5.30 or 5.45, I was in Mid<lb></lb>dlesex Street, Somers Town, coming home from my work—I had received my wages—I had changed a sovereign, and had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my right hand trowsers pocket—when I came to a court I was knocked down by a man, with a blow on the chest, and sent on my back—I fell with my head on the pavement—directly I was down, there was one man on my feet, another on my arms, and a third ransacking my pockets—for a second or two I could not call for assistance—directly I could breathe, I called out "Police!"—there was nobody near—it was a very wet day—I did not see the faces of the men that held my feet and arms, but I saw the face of the man who stole the 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my pocket, distinctly—he was not half a minute taking it—the men ran away down the court—I went direct to the police-station and gave information—on 8th December, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was called to the station, where I saw five persons—the policeman asked me if there was ere a one there that committed the robbery, and I pointed direct to the prisoner—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man.</p>

I went to 17, Wellesley Street, Somers Town, on 8th December, about 1.30 in the morning—I saw the prisoner there with five or six others—I told him he answered the description of a man who was wanted for being concerned with two others not in custody for robbing a man about a fortnight ago in Middlesex Street, Somers Town, and I should take him into custody—he said, "I know nothing about it; someone has been getting this up for me this time"—I took him to the station. and placed him among five or six others, and the prosecutor immediately identified him as one of the three men, without any hesitation—the others were policemen in plain clothes.</p>

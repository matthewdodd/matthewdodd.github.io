I am a brick-maker, at Leyton—on 3rd February, I was passing the Britannia—I saw the two prisoners outside, having a bother with Mr. Leheup, who was accusing Lee of tendering him a bad shilling—Lee said "If we have tendered you a bad shilling we have paid in good money for the beer"—they said they had not drunk the beer, and they would go inside again—Freeman was outside the door with a dog—I told Mr. Leheup to get a policeman, and I would follow them—I followed them till Mr. Leheup and the constable Snow came up—he took Lee in charge, and he asked me to take Brinkley—Brinkley began kicking me, and tried to get away, and Freeman tried to rescue him—I got him into the tap-room of the Thatched House, and I assisted the constable afterwards to take Brinkley to the station—at the station I saw him try to pass a shilling to Freeman, but it fell on the floor, and Snow picked it up.</p>

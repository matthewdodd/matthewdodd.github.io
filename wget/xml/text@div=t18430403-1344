                  </hi>. I live in Cross-street, Huntingdon-street, Hoxton. On the 4th of April I left my boots safe—the next morning I found ray breeches, trowsers, waistcoat, and boots behind the door on the bannister—my father sleeps with me—the money stated was in my pockets—some one had come into my room and taken these things—the prisoner did live in the house for some time—there is a man in the house who plays instruments—he is out late, so we leave the street-door unfastened, and on that night I had forgotten to bolt the roomdoor—I had seen the prisoner at six and half-past ten o'clock, before I lost the property, and saw him in the Hackney-road the next morn<lb></lb>ing—I told a policeman—he took him, and found eight shillings and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, and one shilling I could swear to—this is it—he had told me on the Saturday that the worst had come to the worst, as he had gone to the relieving officer—he pulled out a paper to go and break the stones.</p>

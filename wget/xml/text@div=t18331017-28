               <p>JAMES HOLLAND. I am a cheesemonger, and live at No. 107, Drury-lane; on the 10th of September, the prisoner came to my shop and brought a large bundle of paper, which he offered for sale - it was tied up in a green baize; I asked where he got it, he said it was given him by a person in Chancery-lane, but I do not remember the name he mentioned - I examined it and found it was lawyer's papers, and the address on part of them was Sutcliffe and Birch, which was not the name he mentioned, I told him I did not think it was right, and I would send a person with him, - he began to murmur about that and said he would take it somewhere else; I then called in the policeman - this is part of the paper; he bought about 60lbs in all, worth about ten-shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of Westminster-hospital. Hannah Edwards was admitted there as an in-patient on Monday, the 30th of Sept.—she had a wound on the back part of her head, on the left side—the face and scalp were affected with erysipelas—she died on the following Satur<lb></lb>day, at five o'clock, of the erysipelas—I think the erysipelas was caused by the wound in the scalp—that is a usual consequence of such a wound—I believe she was an out-patient of the hospital before the 30th.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew Hannah Edwards, who is now dead. She was servant to the prisoner at a house of ill fame which he kept, at No. 17, New-way, Westminster—it is a common brothel—I live at No. 20—the pri<lb></lb>soner lives at another house of his in the Almonry, in Westminster—all the houses in New-way are bad houses—I was at the door of the prisoner's house, No. 17, a month ago last Monday four weeks, between ten and eleven o'clock at night—the deceased had been drinking a little I acknowledge—she was a little tipsy—the prisoner and her had a few words, and he accused her of robbing him of a pair of sheets—she had the care of No. 17, and acted as mistress—she said she had not stolen them, but somebody, who occasionally came to sleep there, had taken them, but she would replace them as soon as she could—it caused several words—he said she should not be there—she said, "I have nowhere to go to"—she went towards the door—he pushed her, and she had a dreadful fall—(she had been living there from before last Christmas)—her right foot was on the step of the door, and the left on the curb—he pushed her from the door, which was open—she fell into the road, and was senseless—I picked her up—he did not strike her—it was a violent push with his open hand—the stones in the road are very uneven—they are round pebbles, and most of them flints—she was quite senseless when I picked her up—she could not speak for several moments, and was all in a gore of blood—I got a person to take her to the hospital—I was too much alarmed to, take her myself—they brought her back again, and put her to bed in the</p>

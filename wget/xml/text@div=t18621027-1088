                  </hi>. I live at 37, Roupell-street, Blackfriars'-road—on 24th October, about 9 o'clock at night, I was walking in Dowgate-hill, and the prisoner met me full-butt—she asked me to treat her—after a short conversation she ran away, and I ran after her, having first missed my witch, which had been in my waistcoat pocket—while running after her I was attempted to be stopped by a man, and I knocked him over, in Thames-street; then another man came up and attacked me, and I pushed him aside—when I came up to the prisoner, I said, "You have stolen my watch"—she gave me the watch, and said, "You let me go"—I said, "No, I will not"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch—after she gave it me, she hit me in the face, and knocked my hat off, and while I was stopping to pick it up she got away—she never got out of my sight—she was stopped by a gentle<lb></lb>man, at a silversmith's, in Cheapside—the value of my watch is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—when she returned it, the ring of it was gone altogether—I have got the guard—I am positive the prisoner is the woman.</p>

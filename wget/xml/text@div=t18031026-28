               <p> - SLADE sworn. - I am a constable; I searched the prisoner's lodgings, I think, on the 22d of September, in consequence of information that I received; I went up stairs, and found this gown in an unlocked cupboard, about two yards from the prisoner's room, there was nothing else in the cupboard; there was another lodger in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Harwood). How long was it between the time of her sitting against the chair and your charging the constable with her? - A.Not a quarter of an hour.</p>

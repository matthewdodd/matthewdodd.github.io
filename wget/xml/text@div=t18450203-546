                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at Greenwich. On Mon<lb></lb>day evening, the 13th of Jan., I was near Blackheath-terrace, on the high-road, walking on the footpath, from Shooter's-hill to Greenwich, on the right hand side of the road—I was in the direct road that leads across the heath to the Green Man—I saw a wagon with three horses going in the same direction as myself, at a regular pace, walking—I saw the deceased standing on the left hand shaft—I could not see that he had any reins<lb></lb>there was a glimmering moonlight—the wagon was about the centre of the road, which is sufficiently wide for three carriages to go along easily—I observed the leading horses bearing to the right hand or off side of the road—at that time I saw a fly coming along, and it took the near side of the wagon—I was about five yards off the fly, abreast of the off hind wheel of the wagon—there was sufficient room for the fly to have passed on the off side of the wagon—the fly was going at a gentle trot, at the pace I have generally observed a fly go—I did not hear the driver call out before he went on the near side of the wagon—I was near enough to hear, and if he had called out very loud I must have heard him—the wagon continued going on—I heard the carman call out, and saw the horses turn towards the near side—at that time the wagon was between me and the fly, and I did not see what occurred—the wagon still went on—I lost sight of the fly—I could not tell whether the wagon went at the same pace as before, or whether the horses walked or went on faster—it was a covered wagon, which would hide the fly from me—I continued on my road, the wagon and fly being both ahead of me—when I got about sixty yards further I per<lb></lb>ceived something lying on the near side of the road—I went across, and found the deceased lying, with his face buried in the loose gravel stones—he had his carman's whip in his right hand—I stood by his side for a quarter of an hour—I could not get him to speak—at the end of that time I said, "Do you think you can rise if I assist you?"—he said, "Yes"—at the time I found him lying there I had lost sight of the wagon and fly—I asked him if he had been knocked down—he said, "Yes"—I said, "By a fly?"—he said, "Yes; where are my horses?"—I said, "It is Pearce's wagon, is it not?"—he said, "No; Davis's;" and that was the last word</p>

               <p>he said—he said nothing about the wagon doing anything to him—I found his hat about a yard before him—I went across the road for a surgeon, but he was not at home—I returned, and continued with the man till he was put into a fly—I was not with him when he died.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 219.) On the night of 13th of Jan. I was on Blackheath-terrace, and met the wagon at the further end of Blackheath-terrace, on the Sbooter's-hill end—the driver was then walking on the near side of his horses, about the middle of them, and the wagon was on the near side of the road—I met a fly about 300 yards from the wagon, coining towards Greenwich at a common trot—I went to the end of my beat, and came back in about half an hour—Kingman called to me—I saw the deceased by the road-side, and assisted in lifting him on the path—shortly after, he said he had been knocked off the shaft by a fly passing on the near side of his wagon—he said he was riding on the shaft, and without reins—I asked him to show me where he was hurt—he said he was not hurt at all—I asked him if the wheels went over him—he said his wagon wheels went over him—I stopped a fly, put him in, and got in wilh him—in coming along, between Blackheath church and the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, he pitched forward into my arms, and I believe at that mo<lb></lb>ment died—I took him to the station-house, and then to his own home—he lived in New-street, New-town, Deptford—I returned to the spot, and found some blood on the road, and marks of what appeared a fly-wheel on the footpath for about fifteen yards—it is 165 yards from the last gas<lb></lb>lamp by Blackheath-terrace to where I found the deceased—I mea<lb></lb>sured it.</p>

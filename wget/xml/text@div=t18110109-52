               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners at the bar - A. I never saw them before they were charged on the 4th of December, about twenty minutes past three, I was in the bakehouse at work.</p>
               <p>Q. They were charged with stealing two watches, and two gold seals, what part of the house were they in - A. They hung over the chimney piece of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the seals that were at the watches both gold - A. Yes. I heard an alarm by my wife, crying out,</p>
               <p>"Clay, the watches, the watches!" I ran to her immediately and pursued, but did not find neither of the prisoners, but on returning back I met a neighbour, he told me he saw two boys running, and we might see those two boys in the dock opening. This was the 4th that the watches were stolen, on the 7th me and my wife went to the dock opening, they were gambling among the Portuguese, me and my wife saw the prisoner Lewis there, I went for an officer; before I got back from fetching the officer it got dark, they all left the dock opening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watches - A. I saw one of the watches, but none of the seals; I knew it to be one of the watches that I lost on this day.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clay. Q. Were you at home on the 4th - A. Yes, I was in the kitchen, adjoining the parlour, on the same floor, about a quarter past three; I saw both the watches safe in the parlour, they were hanging up at the chimney-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it that you heard any thing that induced you to believe they were gone - A. About twenty minutes after I was in the kitchen, I saw the prisoner Lewis making way over the counter to make away with the property. I am certain he was the lad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see whether he had any thing in his possession - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the other prisoner - A. I did not. I thought he was about taking a quartern loaf, I went directly into the shop, I did not miss any thing from the shop; I came into the parlour and looked round me, and missed the two watches immediately; one of the watches had two seals. I went out every day to the dock opening to look for them, I did not see either of them until the Friday, I pointed out the boy Lewis to my husband. I had seen him often as a customer in the shop, he had come for three weeks and purchased small bread.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not apprehended on the Friday - A. No. Q. Was any thing found upon him when he was taken in custody - A. No. The watch was found afterwards at the cooks-shop, that is one of the watches that was taken from my parlour.</p>

            Yes, I know the them both. On the 4th of December the two prisoners and another person came to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the 4th - A. It was on a Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the 7th of December - A. They had something to eat, and after they ate it they came to pay for it; one of them offered me a bad shilling; the boy that is in court offered me a bad shilling, he was with them; I told them I could not take it, then they said I must trust them; I said I could not, they must leave something; they offered me a watch, I am not certain whether it was this boy or Lewis; they were both standing at the counter, they all three had something to eat, and were in company together; they offered the watch, and left it as security, and they would call and pay the reckoning. I delivered the watch to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18110109-52-person588">Gray</persName>
             the constable; Mr. Clay saw it and paid me the shilling that was left on it. They told me first they had got the boy, and then afterwards they said if the boy came to stop him. The same night Lewis came and said he wanted the watch; I told 
               <persName id="t18110109-52-person589">Lewis</persName>
             I had not got the watch. I said you are a pretty fellow, you have stolen the watch; he said it was no such thing. Directly Mr. Clay came in and and asked me if that was the boy, I said yes, and secured him. I am sure he was one of the party that left the watch and came for it.</p>

            Being about the London docks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in his company on the evening of the 4th of December - A. I was in his company at the Hampshire Hog, Lewis joined my company there, the boy was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the other boy - A. Much about the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then - A. Lewis told me that he had a watch; I asked him where he got it from; he said he stole it from a watch-maker, I asked him whereabouts; he did not give me a correct account so I left him for that night. I did not see him again till the 7th of December, then I went with him to the cooks-shop to have my dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the cooks-shop, you had no money to pay for your dinner - A. I took the bad shilling of the cook-shop man, he would not take it, he said he would trust me. Lewis took the watch out of his pocket and said, what will you give me for this; the cook-shop man said a pound: Lewis said he would not take it, it was worth three or four; he told him to take care of it for him until he should call for it at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he keep it for the reckoning - A. No. The two lads paid for what they had, except myself, he left the watch with Wicks to take care for him. I went along with Lewis to the London docks, I was standing there a good while, and about dusk Gray came and took me by the collar and said, I had stolen two watches; he took me to the watchhouse, from that they took me to Lambeth-street office, there I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090046"></xptr>them all I knew.</p>

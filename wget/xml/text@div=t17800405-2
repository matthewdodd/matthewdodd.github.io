It struck me that they intended to rob it; they saw me stop, upon which they crossed over the way and sat down upon a bench at a publick-house. I then went on a little way. I looked back and saw them both get up and go to the cart, and I saw the prisoner take the basket out of the cart. I went up to him; he had the basket upon his back; I said I am afraid this does not belong to you; he said it was his. He immediately let it down, and I took hold of it. The prisoner then put his hand in his pocket; I was apprehensive he was feeling for some instrument to do mischief. I struck him over the head with a stick I had in my hand; he did not fall, but ran away along King-street; just as he got into Gerard-street, I secured him. I found afterwards that the carrier was this

I just stopped to to leave some butter at one Mr. Sadgrave's, in Princes-street. When I came back to my cart there were some people about it who said it had been robbed. My basket was brought back to me; but who the person was that brought it I do not know.</p>

               <p>Are you sure that the basket, which was brought back, was the same that was missing from your cart? - Yes, it was; I knew it both by the basket and the direction which was upon it; it was directed to Mr. Mitchell, in Brick-lane. The prisoner and the basket were taken before the magistrate, there the basket was opened, and it contained the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

He said I had stolen the basket; I said I had not, for a person had given it to me to carry to Drury-lane.</p>

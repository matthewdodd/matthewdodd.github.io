When the lodger got up in the morning, about five, he alarmed us directly; when I came down, he had taken up a candle from the ground in the passage, and there were two candles upon the dresser; I saw the grease of the candles on the floor, and I saw two on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there over night?</p>
               <p>Spratley. No; one of them had scorched the dresser cloth almost through; the next thing when I went into the parlour, through a long passage, I saw the bureau drawers in the parlour pulled all about.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the drawers fastened?</p>
               <p>Spratley. No, I believe not. The next thing I saw was the sash of the parlour window shoved up, and the shutter pulled close to, not fastened. They drank a bottle of wine that was standing on the cupboard in the parlour, half a bottle of brandy and a little rum; they opened a jar of pickles, to see what was in it I suppose; they took out a black waistcoat and a pair of breeches out of the drawers the bottom of the bureau. There were taken out of the kitchen, a pair of silver spoons, the table spoons, a silver pepper box, two damask linen tablecloths, and a great many things, the linen apron and black gown; there was a pair of shoe buckles, they were not mine, in a bureau, and some checked cloth, enough I believe for three shirts, and a great coat. Here is a piece of the bottom of the window, that the shutter comes to, to keep the bolt that they wrenched out; (producing it) there was another bolt about the middle of the shutter upon one side, that they shoved back with some instrument; I am certain it was fast over night.</p>

             and I got these buckles out of Spratley's house; I cannot rightly tell the day of the month; it was on a Sunday night; we went out with an intention to break open some house.</p>
               <p>Q. What age are you?</p>
               <p>Evans. Seventeen the first of June last. The house was in White-horse-street; the watchman was going past one o'clock;

             had a chissel in his pocket, a long chissel, a rusly one; he bid me look out that no-body came by; I stood within a yard or two of him; he put his shoulder to the bolt, and pulled very hard, and broke it open; after we had broke it open, the watchman came by to call the hour, past one; we put the shutters to and went a little further down a turning, till he went to his box again. When the watchman went to his box we got in;

             struck a light; we both went in, and shoved the window up;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090023"></xptr> we pulled the window shutter to again, and he had a key that he pulled out of his pocket, or was in the bureau; he pulled the door open; he had a candle in his pocket, wrapped up in a bit of paper, and a tinder box and matches, and pulled the drawers open, one at a time, and took out what was in them; there was a blackish gown, and some cotton to make shirts of, some striped cotton, and a great large table cloth flowered; there were a great many more things I cannot justly mention.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the bureau?</p>
               <p>Evans. Standing on the left hand side when we went in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. to Spratley. Is that right?</p>
               <p>Spratley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Evans. Then we went on three or four steps the same side of the room, where there was a good deal of china; we saw the pepper castor with some pepper in it, and a silver spoon; one spoon bigger than a tea spoon; there were two bottles with liquor, one wine I believe; Chapman drank, and then said to me drink; I did; we laid the things upon the ground. I went backwards and searched where the coppers were, there I found half a dozen of tea spoons, in a cupboard where was victuals; the handles of the spoons did not turn up, they went downwards.</p>
               <p>Spratley. They were so, they were in such a cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read and write?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes. We looked down upon the ground, there was a great deal of copper saucepans and some shoes; I took some of the buckles of; I took one buckle out there in a place on the right hand side in the cellar; I saw some e shoes, and took another buckle out of an other shoe; the buckles have a stamp in the side much like silver, I thought they were her.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Evans. I am not very much acquainted with it; he tells me he is a sea-faring man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any thing else?</p>
               <p>Evans. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How many candles did you take there?</p>
               <p>Evans. We had but a little piece in our ket; John Chapman took a bunch of candles a little place in a cupboard, and lighted</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was two pound in such a</p>
               <p>Evans. We tied them up in bundles, and brought them over the fields; he carried me down Old Gravel-lane, to (I believe the place is) Broad-street where Mrs. Nimmy lives; he carried them up stairs, and I lay with him all night. Chapman lodged in her house then.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she live with her husband?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Evans. A watchman I believe; he watches in the night, and works in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him there next day?</p>
               <p>Evans. No. Chapman carried the things away in the morning; I got the cotton to make some shirts of; I brought it to Mrs. Nimmy; I knew her very well; she asked me whose they were; I said my brother bought them for me; I said I was going apprentice, and my mother would pay her, when they were made; I cannot tell where any of the other things were carried; Chapman gave me 12 s. for my share; he sold the things.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom?</p>
               <p>Evans. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see any of these goods at Mrs. Nimmy's?</p>
               <p>Evans. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you carried the shirts, were none of the goods there then?</p>
               <p>Evans. No, I did not see any; the gown was the same colour and same sort as this. I kept the buckles I believe a week; I came down with a pair of buckles on my finger; I said I bought them for silver, and they were not; I changed with her; these are the buckles that were taken out of the house.</p>

I lodged at Mr. Spratley's; I bought the buckles at Bath, and the tongues which were first broke in them; I broke one, and had another put in; it is rougher, not so highly finished as the other; ( looks at the buckles) I am sure these are my buckles. If this coat is mine, there is a small piece of cloth in the cape cut oval fashion, which I sewed on myself. (The jury inspect it) This coat is my property.</p>

On the 23d of July, I and Wright took Evans and another lad; we brought him to Justice Sherwood's; he was sworn in as an evidence; he said the old woman bought the things; a little woman there told Wright and I where she was; we went and took her; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090024"></xptr> said he had left a bundle that had this check in it.</p>

Powell's property, and were kept In a portfolio in the gallery, accessible to everybody when the warehouse was open—we have found them nearly all—I know the prisoner, from his applying for work a little more than a year ago—I saw him there once—I knew Mr. Oliphant—I believe he was a respectable man—he never worked at White<lb></lb>friars—he was an artist, and we have bought drawings of him—I believe he is dead.</p>

               <p>Court Road—about 10th December the prisoner came at five o'clock in the evening and asked if I would buy some drawings—I declined, but he pressed me so that I bought two for, I think, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., out of three which he brought—they were drawn in sepia, not coloured—he called again a few days after<lb></lb>wards, and brought three more, which I bought—he afterwards brought five—I offered him half a crown for the five, and he took it—they were put in the window, and the police came and told me they were stolen—some time afterwards the prisoner came again, and I communicated with the police—the prisoner said that they were his own designs, and that he had already been paid for them, and had had two guinens for one of them—I had no idea of their value, for as drawings they are not good, they are simply designs—I gave them to the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 442). On 8th February I took the prisoner from the station to Guildhall Police-court—he said, "I knew the cartoons were stolen. I have seen the bill of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them. I know they were no good to anybody but those in the trade. They were all stopped in the trade. I wanted Mr. Oliphant to get some respectable person to take them back to Messrs. Powell's, but since his death I should be glad to get rid of them for what I could get." I afterwards, on the same day, went with the prisoner to a coffee-shop in Old Street, by his desire, where he asked for a parcel he left the night before, and the landlady brought this roll of cartoons and gave him, saying that there would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for his bed—I took the cartoons—there is an adhesive label on each with Messrs. Powell's name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When all the witnesses were examined at the police-court, except Miss Stacey, how was it you never alluded to this conversation: you were both asked if you had any more evidence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was under<lb></lb>stood that you were going to take me to where the other cartoons were, and the evidence on both would do at the same time—you were remanded till the 20th—nothing was said about it then, because there was a person who was going to prefer a charge of robbery against you, and the Magistrate said he would remand you and hear the rest next week—I was only examined once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Five witnesses have been called, and none of them proves that I received the drawings knowing them to be stolen. They were left in my keeping by Mr. Oliphant. I told the officer where I got them, but I did not know the number of the house. When I heard that they wore Mr. Powell's I said I would give them all up. They are of very little value now, as they have been used, and new cartoons are always made for a fresh order. I called at Mr. Oliphant's before his death, but, as the servant opened the door, Miss Stanley did not see me. I have been frequently in the house; his study was on tho right-hand side. I had no occasion to call except to know whether, during his illness, he had left any notice what I was to do with the drawings, which are so similar to his own style that I would defy anybody to tell which was which, and I fancied that they were his. He had twice asked me to sell tho drawings which were sold to Watts; that was about December 10th, and he died on 17th January. His death was sudden, and, as he owed me money, which I lent him when he was not fully employed, I sold the, smaller ones. I believe mental excitement from fear of discovery was the cause of his death. We had known each other from youth, and he left them with me for fear of his effects being kept back for his rent. I heard the Clerk of the Court tell the solicitor on the third occasion that the evidence was insufficient, upon</p>

               <p>which the policeman requested to be sworn, and he was delivered of this conversation. The reward runs in their heads, but to get it there must be a conviction, which they would not get without inventing that conversation. When I went to Messrs. Powell's, in answer to the advertisement, I gave my name and address. I am well known as an artist throughout the trade.</p>

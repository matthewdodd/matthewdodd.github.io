                  </hi>. I am unmarried, and reside with my mother, Fulle<lb></lb>retta Hunton, a widow, on Stamford Hill. These silver articles are her's—they were safe about 11 o'clock on Thursday night, 14th May—I went to bed at half past 11 o'clock, and went round, and saw the house safely fastened up—in the morning, when I came down, the dining room window at the back had been thrown up, and the inside shutter forced open; that would enable a person to get in—the sideboard and cheffonier closet drawers were wide open, and the contents were in different parts of the room—the plate drawer was taken out, and placed on the floor, and the spoons all gone—two table covers had been taken, one out of the sideboard drawer, and one from the breakfast room, and were rolled up in another cloth from the breakfast room—two work boxes and a desk had been taken from the breakfast room, and opened in the drawing room, and the contents scattered about the floor—this little silver box of coins had been taken from one of them, and a vinai<lb></lb>grette from another—two coats which hung in the hall had the pockets turned inside out, and the papers were on the floor—the store room had been opened, and this bugle ornament taken from it—a drawer and box in the store room had been broken open and ransacked—this little leather bag was safe in the plate drawer the night before—the plate drawer was not locked, but was fastened with a screw inside the cupboard door, which was unlocked—I am not sure that we always lock it—an old pair of shoes were left in the hall, and we missed a pair which had been there—a pane of glass had been cut near the window fastening, so as to allow a person to put their fingers in; the sash was thrown up—I noticed a man, between 6 and 7 o'clock on the evening before, walking past the gate, but he was on the regular footpath—I believe the prisoner to be the man—he was alone.</p>

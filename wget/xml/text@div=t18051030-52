               <p>Q. What did you find there? - A. We found some lace in a dark closet; I was obliged to get a light; it was about ten or eleven o'clock in the day; I found two bags; I asked whose they were; Mrs. Taylor said they were her property; the little woman was in bed,

             was sitting in the room; she said afterwards they were perquisites to Bunting, and that she received them as such; and Bunting brought them there.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you ask any-questions of Bunting? - A. I went immediately to the bed, and asked her to get up, and let me see her finger; I thought she worked in the upholstery way, and by the appearance of her finger I was confirmed in my opinion; I enquired who she worked for and she said, the prosecutor and several other persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she came by the things? - A. She said they were perquisites; I saw Mrs. Taylor working at soldier's jackets, and the pockets that she was working appeared to be like this brown Holland; I produce the property.</p>

             sworn. - I am in the feather and mattrass way, and bedding line; I live at No. 19, Newton-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these things? - A. There are many of the articles I can speak to and identify; Mary Bunting worked for me about three years; we never allowed any perquisites; this bed-lace I bought for a furniture a little while ago; there is but little of it now; it was in a desk in the shop, to be used in case it was asked for; and this was given out in pillow-cases to her; now they are cut in shape of pockets; and this piece of brown Holland I know perfectly well; it came from a house in Bond-street; it is worth only a trifle, I cannot say how much, I do not know the weight of it; the other things I cannot identify.</p>
               <p>Bunting's defence. I am innocent of the crime as you are; I have worked at other places; my master would give me home a whole bed-tick at a time, and that is what has been left.</p>
               <p>Taylor's defence. I never received any thing as stolen things in my life; they were never brought to me as stolen things; they were left from her work; she has gone out to her work, and she has not stopped to take them back; and if they were wanted she said she would come and fetch them by and by; they were pieces that were left from her work, and they have been accumulating for three years.</p>
               <p>Bunting called two witnesses, and Taylor one, who gave them a good character.</p>

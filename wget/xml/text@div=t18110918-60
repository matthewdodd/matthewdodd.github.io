            . I live with Mrs. Record. On the 2nd of August, I was at breakfast in the kitchen; my mistress said she heard some one in the parlour; I went up the kitchen stairs, the prisoner was coming from the parlour; he offered me a letter, and asked me if there was such a person lodging there; I said I thought he had been in the parlour, he said no; I went into the parlour, and missed two salt-spoons. I told him I was sure he had been in and taken the two salt-spoons; he said he had not. I held fast of his coat, and told him if he would give me the spoons I would let him go; my mistress came up stairs; she made a great screaming. He gave her the spoons; he said he did not know how he came by them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sack and bag maker, in Old Change. The prisoner Keith was in my employ—on the 1st of December she had no authority to send out sacks for me to be sewn—she was employed to do that herself in the warehouse—she was to take care that nothing went out.</p>

You were not at home that night—Edward told me to take them home, and sew them on one side, in particular way; and in the morning, for fear of getting into difficulty, I got this woman to come, and I gave them to her—I have often taken them home to sew, and brought them in the morning. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She sometimes took them home, but I always had them entered in her book, and in mine also—I was not at home that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. On the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 1st of December, a little before nine o'clock, I was in the count<lb></lb>ing-house, and saw Newman come to the threshold of the door, and take something away with her—Keith was standing at the door—she took the sacks, and went away—I followed Newman, and passed her in the street—she had something in her apron, and in St. Paul's Church-yard I asked her what she had got there—she said she did not know—but afterwards said Keith gave them to her to take home to unsew and re<lb></lb>sew again—I examined them—they wanted nothing at all done to them—they were not sewn wrong—she could not have taken them without Keith knowing it, because she was standing at the door when she took the sacks, and must have seen her—they were worth 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when Newman was brought back, she said to Keith, "You gave them to me"—I called my father down then, and she said, "If I must tell you the truth, that woman gave them to me"—Keith said, "Hold your tongue."</p>

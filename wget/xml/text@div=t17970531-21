               <p>Q. Did he give you that note in payment for the shirts and stockings? - A. Yes; I told him I had not change to give him; he told me he was a captain of a ship, that his name was Hawse; he wrote it down, he said he lived at No. 25, Burr-street, Wapping, and desired me to send the change of the note in an hour's time, and if I did not, he would come for it, he never came for it; I gave it to the maid first to get change for it, she did not get it changed, and at eight o'clock in the evening, Mrs. Wetherall came home, and I presented her the note and the address that he gave me and she went there.</p>

             told me she had sold some shirts, and gave me a note wrapped in a paper, I gave it to Mr. Goddard to present for payment, I never had it in my possession; Mr. Goddard was to carry it to Messrs. Pybus's to get it changed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at any time afterwards? - A. Yes, the next day; I was sent for to Mr. Luck's, the watch-maker, I went with the servant who took the note, I asked him how he came to obtain goods from my servant upon a false note; he said, madam, if you do not like the note, give it me, and I will pay you for your shirts; I told him, I had not the note, that it was at Mr. Pybus's; there was an officer sent for, and he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he got the note? - A. I do not recollect whether he did or not, to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310025"></xptr>best of my recollection he said he had taken it at Portsmouth; he called himself captain Wilson, I think.</p>

               <p>Q. You took no more notice of this, than you would of any other note? - A. It was with me so long that I knew it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to undertake to swear merely from the circumstance of these indorsements, and the note being greasy, that this is the note you received of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, be so good as point out where the grease is? - A. I do not see it now, it has been in several hands, it may have got out, I know it from the number and the name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear upon your oath, that if any body had come to you, you could have told what the number was? - A. I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you got the number of it off by heart then, when you received it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You put it in your pocket, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean positively to swear that you can recollect the number? - A. No; it is the note, No. 398.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not put it down in any book? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has it been out of your possession? - A. From the next day after I took it.</p>

             lived there, at least of respectability enough to draw a note of that description, neither did I recollect the name of Edward Wilkinson, to whom the note was payable in that neighbourhood; I was much afraid Mrs. Weatherall was swindled, I made use of that expression, that I thought the note was a bad one; I then offered to accompany her to Burr-street, where captain Hawse said he lodged; I went with her, and enquired of the lady of the house, she said, they had no lodgers of any description, and she did not know any such person; we came back again to Mrs. Weatherall's house, and I told her I was going to the west end of the town the next morning, and if she chose, I would present it for payment; I took the note with me, and presented it at Mr. Pybus's house, about half past nine o'clock; the clerk I gave it to, looked at it a little while, and said it was a bad one.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it or not paid? - A. It was not; payment was refused; I left the note with Mr. Brookes, one of Pybus's clerks, who is in Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe, all you have been saying about supposing it was a bad note, was in the absence of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been at Manchester? - A A year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live in the town of Manchester, or do you reside in the country part? - A. I live about five miles out of Manchester, but I was backwards and forwards every day.</p>
               <p>Q. You suppose it requires a vast degree of respectability to draw a note of 10l.? - A. Yes, on demand.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear, that man's life being at stake, that there is no such person living at Manchester? - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the Manchesters was it that you lived at? - A. Manchester, in Lancashire.</p>
               <p>Q. There is another in Warwickshire, is not there? - A. I cannot say; there is a place called Godmanchester.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know whether, when a note is drawn at Godmanchester, it is called Godmanchester, or Manchester? - A. I never saw a note from there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you carried on business in Manchester lately? - A. No.</p>

Yes; there were some spots of grease upon it, but I do not see them now so plain; the grease was a deal plainer when I had it; I believe it is the same note, to the best of my knowledge; I did not take notice of the name, nor any thing, only of the grease.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to swear to that note at all? - A. If the grease had been plainer, I should have been more certain.</p>

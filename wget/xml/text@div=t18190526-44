            , who lives in Goswell-street - I live at Edmonton for the benefit of my health, and keep a jeweller's shop there, on my husband's account - I serve in the shop by myself. On Saturday, the 3d of April, the prisoner came in with a girl about fourteen years of age - they asked to see some rings, marked 4 s. 6 d.; I showed her a tray with five in it. She chose one, and asked to see more. I showed her another tray with sixteen rings in it. She turned round to the girl and said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got the pound note?" The girl said,</p>
               <p>"No, the young woman has got it outside - they both went out; the prisoner said she would be in again in a few minutes. I counted the rings, and missed one, went out, and saw the two and another female with them - the stranger left them, and went up a lane; they had been about two minutes together, and could have passed any thing from one to the other. I went to them, and said I had lost a ring; the prisoner said she had not got it; they offered to go to be searched. I said,</p>
               <p>"That is of no use, you have delivered it to the other woman." They insisted on going back. The girl began to strip; I said it is no of use, and threatened to send for a constable; the prisoner fell on her knees and begged for mercy - she said she had two babes at home, and if I would go with her she would pay me for the ring, rather than have a piece of work - she said it was about a quarter of an hour's walk. I set out with them, and went about four miles, to this side of Kingsland turnpike - A dray was coming along. The drayman said,</p>
               <p>"Are you going to town?" the prisoner said Yes, jumped upon the dray, whispered to the man, and he rode off with her - the girl ran away. I got on a coach that was passing, and overtook them; she got off the dray and ran away; I followed, and overtook her; she said she would pay for it, and took me to a house where she endeavoured to borrow the money; the woman said she had got none. She went out of another door of the house, and went away. I saw her again about six weeks after, and am sure she is the woman. I have never got the ring.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday, the 18th of April, I apprehended the prisoner on another charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went in to buy a ring, found I had not got the money, and went out to the woman to get it - she was gone. I saw three women standing, and asked them if they had seen her? the lady came, and I returned with her; I was frightened, and said I would pay for it. I was afraid to tell her that I lived in town, thinking she would put me in prison. I know nothing of the ring.</p>

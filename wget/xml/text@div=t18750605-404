               <p>&amp; Co., 3, Grafton Street, Tottenham Court Road. To Messrs. Blanchard, Merchants, Paris. London, 28th February, 1873. Gentlemen,—Please to send us by post the prices of your movements, striking movements, and also without striking movements; and the difference which may be between dials of such a character with glass, first and second quality, and to tell us if your prices suit us, if you are able to deliver our orders in the space of a fortnight. Hoping to receive your answer, accept our sincere salutations, Blumberg &amp; Co."—on that letter I first sent the prices, and some days after I sent some samples—on the 3rd March I received another letter con<lb></lb>taining an order, in consequence of which I executed the order, and for<lb></lb>warded it to the address given, which was the same as the last letter—on the 2nd April I received another letter containing sixty-five items of different measurements, and signed "N. Blumberg &amp; Co."—I executed it—I also received other letters dated respectively, 16th April, 29th April, 7th May—our custom was to pay once in three months—I also received letters dated 9th May, 30th May, 9th June, 17th June, about a dozen items containing about eighty movements, which I sent; 20th June, fifty-six movements which I sent; 24th June, two movements of different dimensions which I sent; 30th June, fifteen rims of movements of different sizes which I sent; 8th July, 21st July, 23rd July, 12th August, and 16th August, in which the prisoner said "Whatever is ready of our order, send it off," which I did—I sent him an abstract of invoice—on each occasion I sent an invoice—this is a bit of the invoice, March 19th—it goes down to July, but it is not finished—I value the goods that I sent at about 16,645 francs—the heading on the letter induced me to send the goods, having had transactions with a house of that name in Paris—I thought I was receiving these orders from their London house—not hearing from them I came to London—I never received any money, and I went to 3, Grafton Street—I did not see the defendant there, and there was no name up—it was a decent private house—it showed no business, but I think there was adressmaker there.</p>

Blumberg &amp; Co."—a quantity of goods came there in large cases by railway vans, sometimes everyday and sometimes not a thing—the prisoner said his name was Blumberg, and the cases were addressed to "Blumberg &amp; Co.,"—they would take them in themselves if at home—if not I took them in or somebody else, and delivered to them—sometimes the cases were too large or to heavy to come in, and they unpacked them outside—when I was near I could see the contents,</p>

                  </hi>. I have for more than twenty years made the study of handwriting an object, and am frequently called to give evidence in matters of comparison of handwriting—I have seen the letters in Court signed "Blumberg &amp; Co." and the receipts produced—it is my belief that the signatures to the letters without procuration, "M. Blumberg &amp; Co." are in the same writing as the two receipts signed "Roberts"—I have seen the book produced—it does not assist me at all—I have only seen the signatures this morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. C. MATHEWS</hi>. I have said before that the signa<lb></lb>tures to the letters appeared to be in an Englishman's writing, and also the receipts—if you look at these "R's" they are <hi rend="italic">more</hi> like an Englishman's than a Frenchman's—the "R" in "received" is just like an Englishman's writing—the "e" in Blumberg &amp; Co. very much resemble the English character—the "1" is like the French—if you look at the "I" in "<hi rend="italic">shillings</hi>" you see there is no upstroke—it is almost like a capital—it is formed in one—you find some "I 's' in Blumberg sometimes like one and sometimes another—I think from the "I" in "Blumberg &amp; Co." the writing is an Englishman's in imitation of a Frenchman's, and' so I should say of the receipts.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I took the prisoner into custody on the 15th of April this year outside Maryborough Street Police Court—I told him I was a police officer and had a warrant for his appre<lb></lb>hension for defrauding Mr. Blanchard—he said "I was not aware that a warrant could be executed after six months, and I have been in communi<lb></lb>cation with Blanchard with a view to his withdrawing from the prosecution"—I spoke in French.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Thomas Sproston, at the Rising Sun public-house, Prince's-road, Lambeth—he keeps the house—the prisoner was in his service about eighteen months—he lived in the house some part of the time, but latterly he lodged at No. 29, Caroline-street, in the neighbourhood. On Friday night, the 15th of Dec, I closed the house, and saw it all perfectly safe, at twelve o'clock—I was the last person up, and the first up in the morning—I came down a little after seven o'clock, and found the shutters and window up, of the parlour at the back of the house—the window looked into the back yard—there was a bureau, two tables, and some drawers in the room—on the previous day there was in the bureau a gold watch, two silver watches, above 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in silver, one guinea in gold, and one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, which was all gone in the morning—I missed property to the amount of about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I went with a policeman to the prisoner's house on the Tuesday, but found nothing then—I went again the same afternoon, and was in the house when two bottles of port wine were found, and some duplicates, but I did not see them found—I did not miss any bottles of wine—it is impossible to miss any—I was present with two policemen, when the marks on the bureau were examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed driver of hackney carriages, and live in Cardigan-street, Kensington; I know the prisoner. About six weeks before the robbery I saw Simmons at the Anchor and Hope, Kensington—he called me out, and introduced me to the prisoner—he said, in the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence, "Will you go with Orrow and see the back part of. Mr. Sproston's house; Orrow will secrete you there until the house is closed, and then he will come to you, and show you where the property is, and assist you to take it"—I said I would have nothing to do with it—Orrow said, "Do, I will assist you"—I said, "No, I will not"—I then went away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever been anything besides a cab-man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been in gentlemen's service previous to that—I have been a cab-driver above ten years—I was once in gaol on suspicion of burglary—I have been in gaol for fines from common informers; three times altogether; twice for fines, and once on suspicion of burglary—the bill was ignored—that was last October—I did not threaten to knock Simmons down when he proposed this to me, nor did I go directly and tell Mr. Sproston—about six weeks elapsed before I mentioned it—I know Mr. Sproston's house by going into the tap-room the same as another customer—I do not often go—I do not frequent the house—I was there on the Monday before the robbery—the prisoner and Simmons were there—Simmons wanted me to wait to see Orrow—we did not drink together—we did not sit side by side—he spoke to me outside—we did not go out together—when I went away be followed me—I was told at a barber's shop that I was suspected of this robbery—I then went and told Brooks what had been stated by the prisoner and Simmons.</p>

On Monday, the 18th of Dec, I was at the Rising Sun, about three o'clock in the day, and saw Orrow there—he said, "If you see Tom Spivey this evening, tell him to be on his guard for me, and <hi rend="italic">Kiddy</hi> (meaning Simmons) and Tom Spivey expect to be taken to<lb></lb>night or to-morrow morning, for Mr. Sproston has had <hi rend="italic">Kiddy</hi> in the parlour about it"—I had heard of the robbery on the Saturday morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 34). In consequence of a communi<lb></lb>cation made to me on 17th Sept, I went to 127, Leadenhall-street, where the prosecutor carries on business—I afterwards went to No. 115, in the same street, where the prisoner resided—I there found these two dusters, these two cambric handkerchiefs, five silk handkerchiefs, two pieces of cloth, a cake of soap, and a purse—I then went back to Mr. Boreman's—I found the prisoner there, and showed him the things I had found—I showed him these two dusters first, and asked how he came in possession of them—he said, "I don't know"—I had previously told him I was an officer—he knew I had been to his place—he had given me permission to search his place—I had seen him before I went there, and had a little conversation with him—he was living in a house of Mr. Boreman's partner—I then asked him if they were his own—he said, "They are mine"—I then showed him this blue silk handkerchief, and asked how he became possessed of that—he said, "That I bought of a man in the street"—I asked what his name was—he said, "I don't know"—I asked when it was—he said, "I don't know"—I asked what street it was in—he said, "I can't tell"—I then showed him the other three silk handkerchiefs—he said be bought them of the same man, at the same time, and also the cambric handkerchiefs—I showed him the two pieces of cloth—he said his wife had bought one; at least a woman of the name of Taylor had brought or bought one of them, and the other he knew nothing of—I did not ask him about the purse—I told him his master charged him with stealing the whole of these goods—he did not make any answer—I afterwards returned to No. 115, and then found the cake of soap—I had previously seen it in the box, but did not then take it away—I did not show him that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship-broker, carrying on business at 127, Leadenhall-street; I formerly occupied premises at No. 3 in the same street, and carried on business as an outfitter there. The prisoner was in my employment as porter, at No. 127—he assisted in removing the goods I bad at No. 3 to 127—they were packed in boxes, tied round with rope, and some of them were locked; they were put in the counting-house at No. 127—I did not live at the counting-house; I lived at Southampton—the pri<lb></lb>soner had the keys of the counting-house after the clerks had left; he had them during the night—Mr. Hickey, my partner, has a house at 115, Leaden-hall-street; the prisoner was allowed to live there—on 17th Sept., I missed some of the articles—I had missed some about a month before—the goods were removed from the one house to the other; last May, I think—the first I missed was in Aug.—the amount I missed on 17th Sept. was about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., perhaps more—the box from which they were taken appeared to be exactly in the same state, corded and locked—I gave information to Russell—these handkerchiefs are like many that I had in stock, both as regards the quality, the hemming, and the fold—this is one that was found in his room, and this is one that I had remaining in the box, which is precisely the same in quality and hemming—this (<hi rend="italic">produced by the officer</hi>) is the one from the stock; they correspond in texture and fold, and in the borders—I have some dusters in stock the same as these; I have missed two of them, and only two—there were two dozen packed away in this box, tied up in dozens with pink tape—one of the dozens had been unfastened, and two dusters have been taken away from them, and these correspond precisely with those remaining in hemming and border, they are rather peculiar—these silk handkerchiefs have been washed—I could not exactly swear to them; they are precisely like those I had in the box—the cambric handkerchiefs have been washed; they were kept in stock washed, and ready for use—they are just as they were taken from the stock; they are folded precisely the same; it is an unusual way of folding them—this blue silk handkerchief is worth 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I missed dozens of handkerchiefs like that—this piece of soap matches precisely with some I have in stock—it is marine soap, a peculiar description, made for washing in salt water, which outfitters usually keep, and is made by a person in the Strand—I produce some, which is precisely the same—they are done up in bundles of three—this bundle has two left in it—this other piece, was, no doubt, taken from it—I only miss one cake of soap—this piece of cloth I have no doubt was taken from that box—I had a dozen pieces there; they are all gone, with the exception of one or two—they are cuttings of cloth which we use in the outfitting—they were rolled up in a bundle in the box—I had numbers of purses among my goods, of this and other sorts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>not at that time—he ceased to be my partner last Dec., three or four months before the removal of these goods—about two or three weeks before the loss I had packed these goods into the large box in Leadenhall-street—I first missed a few goods, but could not lay the charge on the prisoner, or any one else; and I put the remainder of the stock into this large chest, about three weeks before I discovered the loss—they were removed in May, in a number of small boxes—I did not take stock of them, or enter them in any book—it is a matter of memory with me, and certainty as well—I did not take the goods out of the small boxes; I put the boxes all into the large chest, and roped it; and when I opened the large box, I discovered them packed pre<lb></lb>cisely as I had left them, but nearly all empty—there might be seven or eight small boxes there; I cannot say exactly how many; but I know they were all empty, or very nearly so—I should think there were about half a dozen, there might have been seven—they were full when I put them into the large box—I put them in myself—I could not tell what quantities were in each box; there were two or three, or three or four dozens—they were kept in the counting-house—there are two clerks—there is no housekeeper there—a Mr. Davis lives in the upper part of the house—he is a pickle merchant—he has one servant—he has the first-floor, over the shop—there is a shop below, but it has no intercourse with the house at all—Messrs. Maynard and Harris keep the shop—this is the cambric handkerchief that was taken from my stock; I took it out myself—it was either this or the other that I first spoke to as coming from my stock—this is the one I got from the policeman—I did not before I got that show one to the Jury as taken from my stock—there is no private mark on the handkerchiefs—I bought them of a wholesale house in the City—I may have had them in my possession for a twelvemonth—I have not sold a large quantity of these—I have not sold any of these; they were in dozens—I have sold handkerchiefs corresponding, but not corresponding with the border—it is a particular border, a wide border—I will not swear I have not sold any—it is a very particular border; it was not made for me specially—I go by the folds, the quality, and the way it is put up altogether—I do not say it is a very par<lb></lb>ticular fold, it is the way we have kept them all—that is the way I used to keep them—I had two dozen dusters—I have one dozen and ten of them; they have been washed and hemmed, and they have a particular border, and a wide hem—I got them from a wholesale house—I dare say they sell to other houses—I dare say other wholesale houses keep and sell them—I never sold dusters of this kind but once; it is a thing I very seldom sell; I had an order for them, and sold them all to one party, and these were two dozen left on the piece.</p>

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you these dusters hemmed in your establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not buy them hemmed—the two dusters produced from the prisoner's house have been washed, that has caused them to shrink a trifle—with that difference they exactly correspond with the bulk; they are rather paler in colour from the washing—two are missing out of the two dozen—I am certain these articles were safe in the small boxes when I put them into the large one—I should say that all the things that have been produced to-day were then safe—I had no catalogue of the things—at the time we disposed of the business—they were packed up and put away, while I was residing at Southampton, till I had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of shipping them—my present partner has not been an outfitter—the persons in the shop had no access to my premises—my premises were always locked up at night—there was then no communication from either up-stair or down-stairs.</p>

On the 23d of September, about one o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and purchased some calico of my shopman, which came to 4 1/2 d. She then looked at some lace, which was shewn to her from the window, and asked the young man if he could not shew her some out of a box? he got the box up so to do. I then attempted to serve her myself, and shewed her a number of pieces; when we came to the one in question she took it out of the box herself, folded it in its present form, and laid it on the counter by the side of the box; then took another piece out, asked the price, and how much it measured; she said it was too much for her, and she would decline taking any, and said if I would put the calico in paper, she would pay for it. I stooped to get a piece of paper from under the counter, and then rose and missed the lace. I made no observation about it then, but endeavoured to persuade her to buy a piece of lace - she declined it, as she thought she could purchase some cheaper, which would suit her purpose. I suffered her to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270067"></xptr>go near the shop door, and then said to her,</p>
               <p>"I will thank you to let me look in your hand, I think you have something which does not belong to you." She opened her hand, and the lace now produced was in it. I talked to her for sometime on the nature of her offence, and gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before - A. She was in my shop the evening previous.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. She had a bundle in her hand - A. She had. She could not have took the lace up with the bundle. There were a number of loose pieces on the counter, she must have reached over to get this, her parcel did not lay near it. I found she had a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not want 40 l. to make it up - A. No, 40,000 l. should never move me from a principal of justice.</p>

            . The prosecutor called on me on Wednesday week, told me he had been to Hick's Hall, and he believed the bill would be found against Mrs. Scott. I told him I was very sorry for it, and asked him what I was to do? He told me, as we did not wish our friends to know it -</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a relation of her's - A. Yes. He said the best way we could do, would be to acquaint three or four of our friends, and by that means raise 40 l. to prevent it; and then he should not be obliged to appear against her.</p>
               <p>Q. That was for his recognizance - A. I suppose so. He said Mr. Scott had better call on him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are her sister - A. Yes, she is a perfectly honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This 40 l. he wanted after he had been before the Grand Jury - A. He had expressed a wish to have it before.</p>

             re-examined. The prisoner's husband and sister have been repeatedly to me, to know what I could do in it. I said the law was not in my hands, I would recommend her to mercy, and all they could do was to pay me 40 l. for not appearing against her, as I must forfeit that. I undervalued the lace, not to make it capital.</p>

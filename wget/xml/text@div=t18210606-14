             - the prisoner left that moning without my knowledge. While I was sitting in my room, writing, a gentleman and lady came; the prisoner told me they were up stairs, I went up to them, and left the key in the cupboard. I was not up stairs five minutes, before a knock came at the door three or four times, and on enquiry, it was found the prisoner was gone - he was taken in about three weeks. When the coachman brought the notes, he gave them to the prisoner instead of giving them to me. The prisoner conducted himself with great propriety during the two months he was in my service.</p>

I have no entry of 3449, and cannot speak to the note found on the prisoner; I may have made a mistake in the entry, as it was a busy time.</p>

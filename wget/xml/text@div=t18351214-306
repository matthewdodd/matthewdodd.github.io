                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police-constable R</hi> 99) On Monday last, I made a communication to the prosecutor—I was in the street, about forty yards off, on the look out—I observed Norman leave the house—I crossed—he had not got far before he met Eyers—he turned back, and they were in conversation,—Eyers then went to the warehouse and pushed the door open—he went in, and in a few minutes came out with a truss of hay on his back—he walked towards me, and Norman got before him, I then crossed over—I took hold of him, and before I had turned him round, Mr. Runch<lb></lb>man came up—we returned back and opened Mr. Runchman's warehouse, he there threw the hay down, and said, "Do not, Mr. Runchman, I am going to pay you for it"—he said to me, "Do not collar me," I let go of him, and he made his escape—Norman was taken afterwards—Eyers said to Norman, "Did not you give your master the money?" "No," said he, "I gave him no money"—when I went up to Norman, I said, "I want you"—he said, "What for?"—his master said, "I have preferred a charge against you at the station-house"—he said, "I know nothing about the hay"—the hay had not been mentioned to him.</p>

               <p>for it myself—I have done nearly the same thing before, but there was the money—as I was going along I met Norman—I said, "I want a truss of hay"—He said, "Come on"—he opened the door, and I took one—he said, "Make haste"—I said, "I want change for half-a-sovereign"—he knows that I like to go to pick out a truss myself—I have even sold a truss in the shop.</p>

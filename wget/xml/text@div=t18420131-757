                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Kelly's house that night and go to a public-house—she had some beer and gin—she put down on the counter 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took it, and found it all marked but one halfpenny—I went back to Mr. Kelly's and stated I had found some marked money—the prisoner was called up, and these gentle<lb></lb>men were called, who stated that the halfpence had been in their coat pockets in the hall—the prisoner said she had not been in the hall, that all the money she had was in her pocket—she took out some more half<lb></lb>pence and pence—I found some more of it marked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you quite certain that the halfpence she laid down were not out of your sight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she had been in the public-house once before that day—she went in just at the door and came out—she had not time to bring any coppers from the house—she did not stop a minute—my letter is A No. 29, but I am specially employed at the Post-office, and the prisoner's master is an inspector of letters—I was off duty that night.</p>

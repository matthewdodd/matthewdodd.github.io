I sent him on the day stated in the indictment to Globe-yard, Thames-street, to get some greaves and some meal; I went to the warehouse soon after him, and saw the greaves delivered to him: they were in cakes, and some small pieces to make up the weight. I was at home at Edmonton when he came home that evening, between eight and nine o'clock - I desired him to shoot the meal into a bin, and to draw the cart, leaving the greaves in it, into the shed; the next morning I went round my premises, and saw the ten cakes of greaves and the small pieces in the cart; I ordered him to put them on the top of the granary when he had done attending the cows. I then left for London - I returned in the evening, and on going round the following morning I found there were only eight cakes in the place where I had desired them to be put; there were two cakes missing - I asked him about it - he said he did not know how many cakes he had received; he had had 5 cwt. but did not notice the number. I then made some inquiries to ascertain how they had been got away from my premises, which are enclosed with a fence and moat - there is only one bridge over which any thing could pass, and as my wife had been in town she could not have given any one leave to have taken any thing off. I heard that my cart had been lent to a Mr. Waldron, and I asked the prisoner how he dared to lend it to him without my orders; he said he thought it very hard he could not lend it to him. I then went to a Magistrate, and got a warrant to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270019"></xptr>search Mr. Waldron's premises - I took the constable first to my house, to ascertain whether I was correct. We weighed the greaves, and found about 1 cwt. deficient; I then asked the prisoner about it, who said he knew nothing about it. We then went down to the water side, and met Waldron; I said, "You borrowed my cart yesterday" - "Yes," said he. I then said, "There are some greaves missing, and I shall search all the neighbourhood, and begin with your premises;" he made some objection, and we all went on together. I said to the prisoner "How many cakes did you give Waldron?" he said one; we went on, and under a hay-stack we found a cake and part of one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that when you asked how many cakes he had given away he said one? A. I believe I did, but I will not swear it. I answered all the questions he proposed to me. The prisoner said he did not know what number of cakes there were; he had put them away as I directed, and thought they were all right - he was not an in-door servant; he slept there that night by my desire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I keep the Golden Anchor public house, at East Greenwich. On Saturday, 24th Nov., the prisoner came between 11 and 12 o'clock in the forenoon—I knew him—he asked for a pint of rum—he brought the bottle with him—I served him, and he paid me for it with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said to him "Is this yours?"—he said, "I come for change for a person that I work for, Mr. Oliver, an oilman, in Trafalgar-road"—I wrote that on the note, this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—"Oliver, oilman"—this is my writing—I gave the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and the pint of rum—he took the change and the rum away—on 12th Dec. I paid the note to Mr. Wade, the distiller, and I received it back on the 17th—I saw the prisoner once after that, at my house, on 5th Jan.—the note had then been returned to me—I did not say anything to the prisoner about it—I left it till I saw my distiller—on the Wednesday following I gave it to the policeman.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, 16th Jan., at the Duke of Wellington public house, in Woolwich-road—I did not show him the note then—Mr. Stevens, the landlord of the Duke of Wellington, stood behind the bar, and asked him to give an account of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note he had passed to Mrs. French a few weeks since—he said he got it from Mr. Oliver, an oilman, living in Greenwich-road—he said he had sold him ten gallons of ketchup, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gallon, and he took the change home, and gave it to the man who was waiting at his house—I said, "I must take you to the station, and I will make inquiries"—I took him to the station—he was kept there two hours, and I went to the road to make inquiries—I have known Greenwich-road about twenty<lb></lb>four years—I made inquiries for Mr. Oliver—there is no oilman of that name, or any person of that name—I searched the prisoner's house, No. 5, Jane's-row, Miles-street, Trafalgar-road—the prisoner gave me that address—he did not say what rent he paid—I found the house in a very desolate condition, and very little furniture.</p>

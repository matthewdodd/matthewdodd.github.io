                  </hi>. I am clerk of the checks in the London Dock. I was at the Dock on 4th March—I know the prisoner—I saw him come out of the tobacco-warehouse that day about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve o'clock with Clarke—I followed, and saw the prisoner go into Inch's house—I went into the house shortly after, and saw him in Shain's custody—at the station I saw 6lbs. or 7lbs. of leaf tobacco taken from him—I had seen him in the tobacco-warehouse two or three times that morning—I saw him leave, looking bulky—he was an extra-weigher in the service of the Crown.</p>

On 4th March I was at Inch's house—the prisoner came there—Bridges was there—he asked the prisoner what he had got about him—he said, tobacco that he had got from the sailors—he was given into my custody—he said, "I am an old officer like yourself; just turn your head away while I get rid of the tobacco"—I said I could do nothing of the kind.</p>

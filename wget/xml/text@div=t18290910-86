             - our shop is in Oxford-street. On the 12th of August we missed a flute from the glass-case in our shop - I had seen it three or four days before.</p>

            . I received information, and on the 18th of August I apprehended the prisoner going into No. 177, Tottenham-court-road; I called him, and asked if he had pawned a flute at Mr. Duprees - he said he had; I asked him what he had done with the duplicate; he put his hand into his pocket, and said, "I can't think what I have done with it, I have lost it;" he told me at the office that he had it of a man named Ferguson, that Country Joe engaged him to go and pawn it, and that all he got above 25s. he might keep - he said he pawned it for 30s., gave Country Joe the 25s., and kept 5s. himself - he did not say where he had received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he had seen the young man a night or two before at a music party? A. He said he had seen him once or twice before when he was at the office; he did point out a person who he said had employed him - that person is not here, he is committed on another charge; the prisoner gave his correct address at the pawnbroker's - he was going into his own house when I took him.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Dupree, a pawnbroker. On the 10th of August the prisoner pawned this flute with me; I knew him as a customer - I do not know his family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you aware that Mr. Dupree is acquainted with his mother? A. I do not know; he asked 2l. for the flute, I lent him 30s. - I heard him point out a person at the office who gave it him.</p>

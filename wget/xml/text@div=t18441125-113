                  </hi>. I am in partnership with William Bardon—we carry on business in Hatton-garden as linendrapers—the prisoner was in our service—on the 7th of Nov. I found a pocket-book of his on my desk, containing duplicates of articles of my property—I have ex<lb></lb>amined the property at the pawnbroker's where it had been pawned—the prisoner was in the shop when I found the pocket-book, but he did not see me take it—amongst the duplicates I took from it was one for Orleans cloth, one for a silk handkerchief, and others relating to Mr. Bardon's pro<lb></lb>perty—I gave the prisoner into custody, and gave the duplicates to the officer—on the next day I charged the prisoner with it, in the evening—the policeman was there—I charged the prisoner with robbing me, and he confessed to it, and said it was through poverty that he had done it—a pair of boots and a pair of stockings were found at his lodgings—I saw them at the station, and knew them to be ours—I believe this cloth to be ours—I had such, and particularly this green piece—I cannot swear to them—I know these boots by the mark on them—I can swear to them—I cannot say when they were safe in our shop—we have a great many.</p>

I saw the pocket-book on the counter, and I put it into my pocket—I did not tell the prisoner I had got part of his property in my pocket—I examined the book in my par<lb></lb>lour about half-an-hour after I had taken it—I found in it memorandums relating to my own business—I am not aware that I found in it any not re<lb></lb>lating to my own business, but I cannot swear that—the officer has the pocket-book—it was in the same condition that it is now when I first got it, as far as I am aware, but it has not been in my possession—I told the prisoner on the 8th that I 'ad his pocket-book, and he said he had done it—my partner went with the officer to the prisoner's lodging—my part<lb></lb>ner is not here—I know no more about these stockings than that the prisoner says they are my property—he said so to my partner before the officer.</p>

I have known the prisoner about eight years—on Sun<lb></lb>day, the 21st of July, she came to my place to remain there that night—she went to bed with me—I awoke at twenty minutes to three o'clock, and she was gone—all the doors were open, and I missed these articles, which were safe in the room when I went to bed—on the 25th of July I met her in Seven Dials, with one of my gowns on—I asked her for the ticket of my things, and she was giving them up to me when the policeman came up, and I gave her in charge.</p>

On (the 28th of last October) the Day before my Lord Mayor's-Day, I agreed to go out a Fishing with the Prisoner, and I was to have a Groat in the Shilling of what we made of the large Fish, and half the small Fish, as is usual. We went from Hammersmith to Fulham, and there he left me 3 Days, while he went to his Wife to get some Money of her, and then he came to me, and we went to Sheerness ; but getting no Fish there, we went to Feversham, and from thence to Woolstaple-Bay, where having caught some Fish, we return'd to Feversham to sell them. We set the Boy on Shore with the Fish, and then put off again; but the Shore being very slippery the Boy let the Fish fall, upon which the Prisoner desir'd me to put too again; he went to the Boy, and beat him with a Rope, and return'd to the Boat, when presently the Boy fell down again; the Prisoner again went a-shore and beat him, and so return'd a second time-to the Boat; the Boy happen'd to fall a third time, upon which the Prisoner went a-shore once more, and he and the Boy went away together. The Boy came on Board again at Night, but the Prisoner did not come till next Morning, and threaten'd to beat the Boy for asking some Body at Feversham for a bit of Bread. Says the Boy, I hope there was no harm in asking for a little Bread when I was very hungry ? Well, says the Prisoner, I won't beat you now, but I'll give it you by and by when we come into Queenborough-Grounds. So we row'd through Queenborough-Grounds by Milton-Creek's Mouth towards Sheerness ; then the Prisoner took a 2 Inch Rope, and splitting it into 7 Strands, he ty'd 3 Knees in each Strand, and stripping the Boy stark naked (except only his Shoes and Stockings) he whipt him with this Cat of nine Tails, for I believe, full three Quarters of an Hour by the Clock, and then 2 Fishermen came up, and said, Why don't you kill the Boy out-right? You had better hurl him over-board at once, and put him out of his Misery. Upon that the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120003"></xptr> left off beating the Boy, and made him put his Cloaths on again.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe any Marks on the Boy's Back?</p>
               <p>Sugg. Yes, it was all black and blue, and wheal'd, and his Eye was cut some how in whipping; and when the Prisoner saw that, he threw the Cat-o'-nine-Tails over-board, and said, I am sorry I have beat you so much, but I'll never beat you any more. Then we went to Sheerness, where we staid 2 Days. The Prisoner and I drank together, and he and the Boy were good Friends. But going out to work next Morning he beat the Boy again, because the Boy had eat more Victuals than he intended to let him. Sirrah! says he, if you offer to eat a bit of Bread without asking my leave, I'll strip your Skin over your Shoulders. Two Days after this, when we were at work, he beat the Boy with a Helm-stick (the Titler, that we steer the Boat with) because he had eat some Victuals without asking leave. And when he had done beating him, he stript him to see if he was black and blue, and I saw the Blood was ready to start out of his Skin. Then we return'd to Sheerness, and were all good Friends again; but after this he beat the Boy again, because he was lousy, and he took some of the Lice, and thrust them into the Boy's Mouth, and swore, damn his Soul he'd make him eat them. The Boy told me, that he could not keep himself clean, for he had been 3 Months with his Master, and had had but 1 Shirt to his Back in all that time. After this the Prisoner and I quarrel'd and fought together.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you quarrel about?</p>
               <p>Sugg. I told him I would not work any more with him if he abused the Boy so.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you no other Motive?</p>
               <p>Sugg. Yes; he did not do by me as he should do about the Fish, for he went to Billingsgate and sold seven hundred, which I was to have had my share of, but he spent all the Money except Six-pence, and so we parted. But before this parting, I had taken up a Fisherman's Lave-Net, and put it into the Prisoner's Boat; and three Days after parting I met the owner of the Lave-Net, and told him of it, so we went together on board the Prisoner's Boat to fetch it; we asked the Boy where it was, and he said he knew nothing of it (for the Prisoner being there, I suppose the Boy was afraid to say it was there, without leave ) but the prisoner bid him see for it, and then he went and fetch'd it. I believe his Master had just been beating him afresh, for he was in a sad condition; his right Eye was cut down half an inch (it was his left Eye that was cut before) and his Cheek was cut a matter of two Inches down; the Blood was running fresh from those Wounds, and it run from his Head like a Spout.</p>
               <p>Court. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Sugg. I forget the Day of the Month, but it was on a Tuesday, about six Weeks or two Months ago. And four-Days after this, the Prisoner brought the News to Billingsgate, that his Boy was dead. He said that he fell from the Mast-Head, and killed himself; but that was impossible, for his Mast is so low, that a Man may stand upon his Boat's Head and reach the top of it.</p>
               <p>Will. Finch. I saw the Prisoner beat the Boy barbarously with a Tiller, at Sheerness Dock;

             (the last Witness) was then in the same Boat; I ridicu'd the Prisoner for so doing; You Villain! You Rascal you! says I, your Master never served you so! About a Week or a Fortnight after (I am not certain to the time, but it was upon a Friday-night) the Prisoner brought the Boy dead in his Boat to Hammersmith, and there he run her a-ground, and left the Boy in her all Night.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see that?</p>
               <p>Finch. No; but the Boat was found there next Morning, and the Prisoner was gone to Billingsgate.</p>
               <p>Court. But how do you know that the Prisoner brought the Boat in over Night?</p>
               <p>Finch. Next Morning his Father came to my House crying; I asked him what was the Matter? He said Matter enough, his Son had brought his Boy home dead. I said it was no more than I expected.</p>
               <p>Court. What his Father told you is no Evidence.</p>
               <p>Finch. But I met the Prisoner himself not long after, and he said, What Cheer Finch? Pretty Cheer indeed, says I, you have made a fine piece of Work of it! your Boy is dead it seems, but it's what I expected. Why, says he, I own I have beat the Boy, but that was not the Cause of his Death.</p>

               <p>Finch. I have no Judgment in such Cases.</p>
               <p>Court. The last Witness swore that the Prisoner sold some Fish, and then spent all the Money but Six-pence. Had you any concern in that Fish? Finch. No.</p>

            . About two Weeks before the Boy's Death, I was at Sheerness, and having some Fish to sell, I borrowed a Basket of the Boy (in the Prisoner's Absence) and in about half an Hour the Boy came to me crying, and said, Give me the Basket, my Master is going away. I asked him why he cry'd? He said his Master had knocked him down backwards two or three times with his Fist for lending me the Basket. I saw the Boy when the Coroner sat, his Body was blackish, and had several Wounds.</p>

            . I am a Waterman at Hammersmith. On the 2d of December between One and Two in the Morning, the Prisoner's Father called and said, he had got a job for me that Tide; so I went down to the Water-side, and there I found the Prisoner putting the Fish out of his Boat into mine. He said he wanted me to carry that Fish to Billingsgate. Says I, How came you to bring this Fish by Billingsgate last Night, and now want me to carry it back thither? Why, says he, something has happened. So he laid down in the Boat sleep, and ordered me to land him at Card Alley (by the Old Swan.) When we came there, he fetch'd a Basket and sorted the Fish, and bade me go to Billingsgate and sell them. I asked who was his Market-Man, and he said, Blackbourn. The Prisoner went Home to Hammersmith that Night on foot, and I believe got there before me.</p>

            . The Prisoner's Wife and Sister came to me, and said, Can you make a Coffin? Yes, says I, have you brought the Measure? No, says his Sister, but if it is as high as my Shoulder it will do; and it must be done by six at Night. Before I had carried the Coffin Home, the Prisoner came and desired me to lend him a Hand to bring the Body from the Boat. I asked him if he had a Justice's Warrant for moving the Body; and he said, Yes. So he took a Lanthorn (for it was between 8 and 9 at Night) and I and another went with him to the Blue Anchor at the Water-side; when we came we found the Boat lay off from the Shore; so we took another Boat, and

So I put my Hand under the Head of the Boat, and felt the naked Body; it was crouded up so close there, that I thought it impossible to thrust a dead Body into so little room; and therefore it was my Opinion, that the Boy had crept in there for fear of being beat, and so had died in the Place. I was above an Hour in getting the Body out; but at last, I got it thro' a Hole 14 Inches square; it had no Clothes on, only it was wrapp'd up in a Red-rug. So says I to the Prisoner, Where's the Boy's Clothes? Why, says he, the Clothes are all bloody, for he fell from the Mast and kill'd himself. Then we went a-shore, and I put the Body a-thurt [athwart] the young Man's Shoulders, the Prisoner went before with the Lanthorn, I staid a little to launch the Boat off, and then follow'd. When the Prisoner came to the Lane's end, he was taken from us by the Constable. I help'd the young Man to carry the Body to the Prisoner's house, and there I laid it a-thurt a Bed, and then the Prisoner's Wife desir'd me to fetch the Coffin.

            . On Thursday (the Day before the Boy died) I went unto Sheerness, and there I saw the Prisoner and his Boy; it was then a very hard Frost. The Boy had nothing on but a Serge Waistcoat and Breeches, and he said he had been at Work all Night and all Day in the Cold, and had had no Victuals. He was wet to the Skin, and I seeing a dry Jacket in the Boat, said to him, Sirrah, why don't you put on that Jacket? I did put it on, says the Boy; but my Master made me pull it off again, and beat me, and broke my Head here about my Temples. Says I to the Prisoner, How can you use the poor Boy so, he is ready to perish with Wet and Cold, he'll never live to see London again? Then the Prisoner went a shore for a Pint of Gin (whether he intended any of it for the Boy or not I cannot tell) but when he was gone the Boy shew'd me his Head. There was a Wound in the Temples, and the Flesh was bruised and black all about it; and I afterwards understood that the Boy did not live above 5 Hours after.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think those Wounds were the Cause of his Death?</p>
               <p>Dafforn. I believe those Wounds and want of looking after, and Hunger and Cold together, were the Cause of his Death, and especially Hunger and Cold; for we must all dye if we have nothing to eat or keep us warm.</p>

            , Surgeon. Pursuant to the Coroner's Orders, on the 5th of December, I examined the Boy's Head, and found 3 contus'd Wounds, 2 of them were very considerable: I made a cross Incision, and raised the temporal Part, and found a large Quantity of coagulated Blood in the Interstices of the Fibres of the Muscles. I saw'd the Skull round in the ordinary way, but found no Contusion or Fracture in the Skull.</p>
               <p>Court. Could that extravasated Blood be the Cause of his Death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Duddle. The Dura Mater was found, but the

             much inflamed, and the Vessels much extended; the Vessels of the Brain were very turgid; the whole Substance of the Brain was much swell'd. Now the violent Concussion proceeding from the Blow, might so disturb and affect the Brain, as to occasion these Appearances, and so be the Cause of his Death.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you known any Instances of a Person's Death being caused by such an external Violence when there was no Fracture in the Skull?</p>
               <p>Mr. Duddle. Yes, there was one Biggs, who was killed at Kensington Gravel-Pis, on the 23d of May was a twelve Month, by being pushed against a Cart-wheel. There was only a single Wound, no Contusion or Fracture, and yet between the

             and Dura Mater we found five Ounces of extravasated Blood. And in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, there is another Instance of a Criminal, who was to have been broke upon the Wheel, but (his Hands being chained behind him) he run his Head against a Wall, and died immediately: The Surgeon who opened his Head found no Contusion. I examined the Body of the deceased, I found nothing in the Thorax or Abdomen that could occasion his Death; I observed a Contusion in his Arm, upon which I raised the Skin, and found the Muscles discoloured, but nothing that could cause his Death, he had no other Wound but that in his Head.</p>

            , Surgeon. I examined the Body with Mr. Duddle, and am of the same Opinion with him. There were 3 Contusions between the temporal and coronal Satur. We opened the Head and found an Inflammation of both the upper and lower Brain, though I can't tell if the Brain was swell'd so much as to be the Cause of his Death.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe any Marks on his Back?</p>
               <p>Delauny. I look'd on his Back, but saw no Marks, it was all clean and plain.</p>

On Friday the 2d of December, about 10 or 11 in the Morning, I met the Prisoner in his Boat by Greenwich, and says I, John, where's your Boy? why, says he, I am come to a sad Misfortune, I sent him up the Mast at Old-Haven in Essex, and he fell off and killed himself, and I carried him a-shore to get a Bed, but the People would not let me have one to put him in. The Prisoner was going up to London, and I was going outwards, and so we past and said no more: He was a civil Neighbour. The Jury found him <rs id="t17330112-3-verdict15" type="verdictDescription">

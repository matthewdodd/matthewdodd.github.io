He went to the window and put his hand out. I said "Does it rain?" he made no answer, and I went to sleep again; it was moonlight, and I saw his features plainly; in the morning I heard of the money being lost, and saw it found in the prisoner's purse; I had two half-crowns and some shillings of my own; I think 11 s. 6 d. in all; I had received it for wages the night before.</p>

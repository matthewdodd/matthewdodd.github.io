                  </hi>. I live at 57, Murray-street, New North-road, and am a cabinet maker—I missed four silver pepper tops on Wednesday-night, 17th July—I had seen them safe the night before—I went to bed at 11 o'clock—I left my house all safe when I went to bed—I saw the window of the back kitchen shut at that time—it was not fastened—it is a sash window—I came down at 7 o'clock in the morning, and found the window open, and the place all in confusion, and missed these four pepper castor tops—the policeman showed them to me on the Friday at Guildhall.</p>

I produce four pepper castor tops—I got them from Mrs. Storey, a marine store dealer in Golden-lane on the morning of the 18th, about 10 o'clock—the prisoner was in the shop at the time—Mrs. Storey was filing the castor tops to ascertain the metal—when I went in she put them into her pocket—I said, "Give me them pepper castors you have got"—she said, "What, I don't know what you mean"—I said, "Them that you have just put in your pocket"—she then pulled them out, and I said, "Where did you get them from?"—she then pointed to the</p>

On Monday the 12th of April I went out about half past eleven, (about two I came home again); when I went out I left the key in the door. I came back and went out again, and returned again. The prisoner came up stairs to me, and said, John, you have plenty of work. I said, yes; he stopped about ten minutes. I went out with him. I locked my door, and went after him; I was going to treat him. I went with him to the public-house door. I said, we will go in here. He said, go in; I want to speak to a person in the street. I stopped about six or seven minutes; I did not go in. I went to him. He said, Day, go in and call for a pint of beer; I will come and pay for it. I went in then, and called for the beer. He never came near me at all. I stopped there an hour, and then went home. When I went home I found the door fast and the window fast. I did not perceive the house broken at all. I went up stairs, and missed two pair of boots.</p>
               <p>MR. BLAND. I am one of the marshalmen. I was informed of the robbery on the 13th, and I heard the prisoner was expected that evening at the Warwick Arms, Warwick-lane. I went there, and slept there all night, expecting his coming there the next morning. On the next morning, the 14th, he made his appearance; I took him in custody, and found one pair of boots on his legs. These are the boots. I questioned him respecting the boots; he gave me three accounts: first, that he had them some years; secondly, that he had them some months; and lastly, that he had them a day or two. I shewed them to the prosecutor; he claimed them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the boots; and when I came home my house was as I left it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the boots in Hounds-ditch; the man is not here.</p>

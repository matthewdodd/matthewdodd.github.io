                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Brompton, and am a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. On 16th Aug., I was summoned to the house in Hill-street—I immediately went to the room where the body of the deceased was lying on the bed—it was cold and stiff—there was a large pool of blood on the left side of the body, extending from the seat of the wound to the hips—the body was horizontal—I conclude that the blood must have flowed at a time when the body wan semi-upright, before it was in the position in which I found it—it would not have flowed in that way after it was in that position—there was not blood on the floor, as there would have been if she was sitting quite upright—there was no blood in that part of the bed where her head would have been lying if she was asleep; it must have been done after the head was removed from the pillow—I examined her arms—the right wristband of her dress was marked with Wood, and a little above it on the inside—there were some detached marks of blood on the outside of the arm, by the elbow, and very little marking of blood at any other part of that right sleeve—the left arm was lying extended by the side of the body in the pool of blood—I carefully examined the wound—it was about four inches in extent, extending from a point level with the ear on the left side, two inches behind, passing downward and forward towards the windpipe, dividing vital parts in its way—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220032"></xptr>
               <p>was a slight turning out of the wound towards the windpipe, which would lead me to infer that it had commenced behind—the right side of the neck was not touched, nor any other part of the neck—death would follow very rapidly from such a wound in an old person.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your brother surgeon, I think, said that none of the arteries were divided? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The internal jugular vein was divided quite through; the carotid artery and other important parts had escaped—it was not such a very severe injury as I have seen—the artery often escapes, it lies deep there—it was very remarkable that it should have escaped, because it lay about as deep as the vein, and the vein is a larger vessel and more distended, and therefore would arrive at a higher level—there is no pre<lb></lb>dicating what amount of muscular power even an old person would hare under certain stimulants—there was no mark of struggling or violence about the body, or on the fingers, or hands, and no bruises—I examined carefully—I examined the right hand side of the body, there were mere stains of blood there—the edge of the pillow that was lying by the side of the deceased was dipped into the blood, and a clean towel had been placed over it as if to cover the blood—the anterior part of the wound turned a little upwards, which is against the notion of its having been done by herself, and so is the fact of the wound having been done in a semi-erect posture; because that would not be a position that a person would take to commit an act of that kind, they would be sitting forward—if it was done sitting up, the blood would have been on the floor—I had not attended the deceased before—I ascertained that she was ruptured—that has very little effect upon a person when of long duration—I have not known it affect the spirits in any remarkable degree.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cutler, and live at No. 5, Brompton-road, Knightsbridge. On 31st July, the prisoner came to my shop with this razor that has been produced—she said she wanted it ground for a gentleman who was out of town, and who was coming to town that day—I said, I would get it done and send it home—I forgot it—she came again two days afterwards and said, "I have called for that razor that you pro<lb></lb>mised to send home"—I said, "I had quite forgotten who it belonged to—she said, "It is of no consequence; the gentleman has not come to town, but 1 expect him in town to-day"—I sent it back about two days after<lb></lb>wards, by my young man—on the Thursday morning on which the death occurred, the prisoner came to me three times—I did not see her the first time, which was about a quarter to 8 o'clock—she came again about half past 8 o'clock, I was not in then—she came the third time about a quarter past 9 o'clock, I then saw her—she brought this same razor again to reset</p>

               <p>—it was smeared, as if a gentleman had been sharing—she said the gentle<lb></lb>man was quite angry about the razor, for it would not share, it shaved him very well at first, and he was waiting to shave with it again—she asked me what was the reason of the edge going off so quickly—I said that some gentlemen were very careless with razors to what others were, that he might hare wiped the edge off with a towel or pushed it against the shaving mug—it was sharp enough even then to shave anybody, it was not so sharp as when I sent it home—whilst I was talking to her, Mrs. Johnson came up to the door, and wanted the prisoner to come away without the razor—the prisoner said no she could not, the gentleman was waiting for it, she must take it with her—Mrs. Johnson made some signs to me not to let her have the razor, and I said to her, "You had better leave me this razor for a few hours or a day or two, and I shall be able to put a better edge upon it"—she said, "No, I cannot, I must take it with me"—I then sharpened it a little, and gave it to her—I saw her talking with Mrs. Johnson, when she left my shop.</p>

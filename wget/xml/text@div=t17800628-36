I received a blow on my arm, upon which I got out backwards over the pales into a neighbour's house. I went to seek after my wife; I saw Stafford bring a bed out upon her back; she carried it and put it in the fire; she returned back and staid about two or three minutes in the house, she then came out with another bed on her back and put it on the fire. I did not see her afterwards; she continued in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hall? - Yes; I saw her come out a little after with a bed, afterwards she passed me with a lap full of something, I cannot say what, but I saw her come out of the house with it. I stood very close.</p>
               <p>You lost some china out of your house? - Yes, and other things.</p>

               <p>Do you remember, the night Connor's house was destroyed, seeing the prisoners take any thing out of the house? - I saw Mrs. Stafford come out with a bed on her back, she carried it and put it on the fire; she then stood by the fire and huzza'd with the rest of the mob. The next morning I went up into Stafford's apartment, she was lying on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280098"></xptr> the bed; I found there this bolster, pillow, and blanket, and these yellow harrateen hangings (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Were those your master's property? - - Yes; we were ironing on the blanket the day before. I saw Hall in my master's house several times; I saw her come out with something in her apron, I could not see what it was; she went through the crowd with it. I saw her in the parlour afterwards, I asked her if she was not ashamed to see my master's things destroyed so? She made answer She had as much business there as any other.</p>

               <p>The night your husband's house was attacked did you see Hall there? - Yes, I saw her go into the house several different times; the first time she came out at all was before the things were all destroyed; she came out with an apron full of china, I saw that they were china bowls; she returned several times; then she brought a bed out and carried it towards the fire; I did not follow her to the fire because of the mob, I was afraid they would put me in; when the things were put on the fire she huzza'd and seemed pleased.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the bowls? - Half a guinea at the least.</p>

               <p>I sent for my witnesses they have been attending four days, I do not know whether they are here. I was putting my children to bed when I heard of the fire. I was never out of my own door; it is a false thing they have sworn against me; I never saw the fire nor never was at it.</p>
               <p>STAFFORD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never was near the place, I had been a hay making; when I came home I went and had a drop of beer; there was such a to do in the yard I was frightened; when I went home I was locked out of my lodging. Connor has a spite against me I do not know for what; being locked out I went to Hall's room where the things were found; I know nothing of it.</p>

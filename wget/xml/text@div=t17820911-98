               <p>Sitting in the compting house I heard a jarring of warehouse doors which made me look round, and I saw the prisoner carrying away a box which had been in the warehouse a few minutes before, and some yards within the door; I rose from my seat and asked him what box that was, he made no reply, but walked off quickly; he walked to the gateway and I followed, stop my friend; he made no reply but began to run, I likewise ran, and finding himself close pursued, he threw the box within the gateway, I picked up the box and cried out stop thief, I pursued him till he was taken, he turned round the corner and I lost sight of him for a moment only; I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the warehouse door open or shut ? - I cannot say. (The box produced.) The box was not out of my custody till given to the constable; the box lay within five yards of the door; the warehouse and buildings are under-one roof; there are lodging rooms over the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Are there any doors to go up stairs from the warehouse? - There is not.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of August about eleven o'clock I was standing at my door, and I saw the prisoner come out from Messrs. Mott and Harris's gateway with that box under his arm and throw it down; I observed Mr. Anderside cry stop thief: I am certain the prisoner is the man that threw the box down, he bid every body defiance, and waived a stick about.</p>
               <p>Court to Harris. Is there any communication between the warehouse and the rooms over the same ? - None from the warehouse, but from the house.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do they pay for the house and warehouse together or separate? - A tenant owns the rooms over the warehouse, I pay the rent and taxes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this a correct account of the situation,</p>
               <p>"a warehouse over which there are lodging rooms, with which there is no communication but by the warehouse"? - Yes, but the whole adjoins to the house where Mr. Mott lives.</p>

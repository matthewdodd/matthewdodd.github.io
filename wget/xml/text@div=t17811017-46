             sworn.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - I shall be fourteen next Christmas-day.</p>
               <p>Do you know the nature of an oath? - Yes: if I take a false oath, I shall go to hell. To take a true oath is what ought to be.</p>
               <p>What happened in your father's house on the 4th of September? - About eight or ten minutes before four o'clock in the morning, on the second day of Bartholomew-fair -</p>
               <p>How do you recollect the time? - I heard St. Andrew's clock strike four just after. A dog, that lay under the bed in my room, barked, and waked me. I looked about, and saw a man sitting on the sill of the window, with his feet on the top of a chair. It was a lightish night, but not very light.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to discern what this man was about? - Yes: he came from the dining-room window, and walked round the room where I lay.</p>
               <p>Were your curtains drawn? - No: I had no curtains. We have a Beauset in the corner of the room. I heard the man go to it, and rattle something like china. Then he went round one side of the room, and went to a slab between the two dining-room windows.</p>
               <p>Could you see him all the time? - Yes; I kept looking on him while I could see him.</p>
               <p>Did he look at you? - Not at that time. He took something from the slab, and gave it out at the window; what it was, I cannot say: it was not light enough for me to see, as his back was towards me. He came round the dining-room again, and he came to my bed, and stood up and looked into the bed.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity at that time to look at his face? - Yes, all the time. I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of his face? - I took as much notice of him as I could. He went from my bed out into the passage, and shut the door; and I heard him go into the kitchen, that is opposite the dining-room. He came into the dining-room again. He walked round it. He went out then, and shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>He said nothing to you? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>What became of the dog; did he continue to bark? - No; he never barked after the man was in the house. What became of him, I do not know. In the morning he was below stairs. Then the man went down stairs, and I heard him unlock the shop-doors. The iron bar, that goes across, fell down. After that, I heard him lifting up the shew glass. We had two on the counter. In lifting up the shew-glass, the flap fell down, and made a great noise. After that, I heard the found of the plate on the counter. I got out of bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170044"></xptr>Did you dress yourself? - No; I did not. As I was getting out, I heard the found of the man coming up again; upon which I went into bed; and the man came into the dining-room, and went round the room again.</p>
               <p>Did you cover yourself with the clothes? - They were not over my face; but they were so high, nobody could see me.</p>
               <p>Did you see him, when he came into the room again, so as to know whether it was the same man or any other? - I did: it was the same man. He went out again, and shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>You thought he did not see you? - I thought he did not and could not see me.</p>
               <p>How do you account for it, that your face not being covered, you could see him, but not he you? - Because I lay in the dark, and the light was fronting me: there are two folding-doors.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay in the room? - Not long: he only walked round the room, and went out, and shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>I suppose you did not stir in bed? - Not an inch: I lay as still as I could. After I heard he was down stairs again, I attempted to get up; but I heard him come up a gain. I went into bed, and covered the clothes over me. He came into the dining-room, and walked round it a third time, and then went out and left the door open.</p>
               <p>Did he come to the bed again? - No; he only looked, as he walked round, to see, I suppose, if I lay still: upon which, after I thought he was down stairs, I got up, and ran up stairs, as the door was open, and alarmed my sister and the servant-maid. As I was going up stairs, I heard the street-door shut. I thought, then, they were gone out of the house. I alarmed the maid and my sister, and told them, There were thieves in the house, and I thought the shop was stripped, and desired they would get up. We opened the garret-window, to give the alarm out of doors. We looked out, but there was no person going by at the time.</p>
               <p>Who opened the garret-window? - I will not be positive; I think it was me. They dressed themselves; and we came down. I thought, as my papa was out, I had better go to the beadle, and get him to go with me to my father, at Islington. I did so. The shew-glasses were open, and all the plate was taken out.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this window was fastened over-night? - I believe it was; because, if it had been open, I should have heard the carriages and the people very plainly in the street.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the magistrate, and give a description of this man? - Yes; I told them it was a tallish man, in a brown great-coat. They asked me if I thought I should know him: I said I should.</p>
               <p>Can you say, from what happened that night, that you could point out that man again? - Yes (looks at Todd); that is the man that entered the window, and sat on the sill of the window. I went to a house along with Jellous, and some of Sir

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Had you been fast asleep when you first heard this man? - I had: I was waked by the dog.</p>
               <p>Can you tell how long you had been asleep? - I cannot: I went to bed, I believe, about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>You went with the justice's men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many? - I believe five.</p>
               <p>You knew them? - Not all: I know Jellous, Clark, and that other man (pointing to Prothero.)</p>
               <p>Who was in the front-room when you went in? - Only the master of the house and this man.</p>
               <p>Did you know upon what you were going to that house? - Yes; they said, Perhaps I should see the man. I knew him directly, as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>You was waked, by the barking of a dog, out of a sound sleep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning? - Eight or ten minutes before four o'clock.</p>
               <p>How came you so certain to the time? - Because I afterwards heard St. Andrew's clock strike.</p>
               <p>You said it was lightish, and not dark? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170045"></xptr>What is your idea of lightish? - It was so light that I could see.</p>
               <p>Court. There was, then, a moon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any light burning in your room? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner any lanthorn, or light? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>I take for granted you was under some terror of mind? - I was.</p>
               <p>Were you greatly frightened? - I was, when I saw the man.</p>
               <p>Did not that fear take off your observation? - It did not.</p>
               <p>You was in perfect recollection? - I was; because I thought I should come to see the man again.</p>
               <p>How came you not to get up, when you heard the noise? - Because there are generally noises in the street. He was sitting upon the fill of the window, with his feet in the chair.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation as to the person of this man, before you saw him? - No.</p>
               <p>Because I understand the description you gave of the man was, he was a tallish man, dressed in a brown coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that all you was to know the man by? - No.</p>
               <p>What is there particular about that man, that you should know him again? - Is it not likely, if I saw a man five or six times, that I should know him again! I took observation of him on purpose, because I thought what it would come to.</p>
               <p>Did not you hide yourself under the bedclothes? - I pulled the clothes up so that it was impossible the man should see me, though I saw him. I kept my eyes fixed upon him all the time.</p>
               <p>And you now positively and roundly take upon you to swear that is the man? - I can, and do.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did your father go out of the house that evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time? - I believe, past nine; for I went to bed directly as he went out. I believe I was undressing me while he was in the room, and he went out directly. I believe I might be in bed before the door was shut.</p>

               <p>Did you leave your things in the house? - Yes; they were all safe when I left them.</p>
               <p>What quantity of plate might you lose? - I suppose somewhere about 200 l.; but I can't speak positively; I do not know my own loss.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever been able to recover any of it? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Did you go with the officers and your son to the house? - No, not where he was taken. On Tuesday morning, the 4th of September, I had a message brought me, to Islington, that my house was broke open, and the greatest part of my property taken out. When I came home to my house, at Holborn-bridge, I looked round; it was a dismal aspect to behold, indeed! I endeavoured to recollect, as well as I could, some of the principal things I had lost. I put them down upon paper. I thought it was expedient to go directly to Bow-street. I took my son, and the beadle of the parish, with me, and laid an information there of what I had lost, as near as I could then recollect. My son described the person to the officers, at Bow-street. They seemed to have some kind of an idea of the persons; I don't know how they gathered it; but they said, if I would come again about eleven o'clock the same morning, they would endeavour to get me all the intelligence they could as to my property and the persons.</p>

               <p>How did your son describe the man, at Bow-street? - To be rather tallish, in a dark brown coat. I was there in the morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I believe, at Bow-street. At eleven o'clock I went back again. They said they had heard nothing about the property, and gave me no encouragement. The affair happened on Tuesday, the 4th of September. On Saturday, some of the officers of Bow-street called at my house, and begged of me to let my son go along with them. They said they were going in quest of the persons that had robbed me, and they would take him to some of the public-houses where they suspected some of them were. I consented to his going.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170046"></xptr>Had your son said any thing to them, that he should know the man again? - At the office he had before said he should be certain to the man whenever he saw him, or to that purpose. I consented to his going with the officers. They had him out for some time. I learnt, when he returned, that, after going to some public-houses, they had carried him to that where they had lit of Todd, at the house of one Claxton, in Old-street.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was one of the persons who apprehended Todd. I was at the office when Mr. Sharpe came to give information of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Was the child with him? - I can't say. We called upon Mr. Sharpe, desiring the son might go with us; for we understood by the father that he could give information of the person. The first house Clark, I, and Prothero, went to, was in Golden-lane. The son stood outside, while we went in. We came out there, and went to a house in Old-street. The little boy was then left outside the door. We went in, and sat down there. Mr. Clark desired the son might be beckoned in. It might be at that time two o'clock or after. He came in. Mr. Clark desired him to look round, and see if there was any body there he knew. He said, There was; and that the man he knew was reading the newspaper; which was the prisoner Todd. I searched him immediately, but found nothing of Mr. Sharpe's upon him. The son went home to his father, and then came to the office after us.</p>
               <p>How many of you were there? - Four of us, the prisoner at the bar, and another. The man of the house was there; he went backwards and forwards; but I believe at that time he sat down; and I think, before the prisoner went away, two more came in.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You four officers all went together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the landlord sitting at the bar? - I think not; sometimes he went backwards, and sometimes forwards.</p>
               <p>He had the appearance of being landlord? - I think he had his cap on.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know both the prisoners. On the 7th of September, I was in company with Underwood, at the Angel, Mr. Fitzpatrick's, at Hoxton, between nine and ten o'clock. I took up the news-paper, to read it: I saw an account of the robbery at Mr. Sharpe's house: I told him it was a great robbery. He said, Yes, it was. I was amazed, I said, who could do it. After some conversation we had, he said he was one concerned in the robbery of Mr. Sharpe. I asked him how it was done. He said it was done upon the jump, in the one pair of stairs window. I asked him how many were with him. He said, Only one more besides himself; which I suspected to be one Brockley, who was then in company with him; and Brockley having plenty of money, made me suspect it was he that was concerned with him. I asked how much it might fetch. He said, about 78 l.</p>
               <p>What did you do in consequence of this? - Some time after that, I spoke to Justice Blackborow about the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170047"></xptr>Did you go to Mr. Blackborow yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you there? - I was a prisoner there; and after I was cleared from that charge, then I told this to Mr. Blackborow, and he took my information down.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A smith.</p>
               <p>You have not followed that business all your life? - Yes, ever since fourteen years of age.</p>
               <p>Where have you spent the last two or three years? - In London.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts? - Where I live now, the greatest part of my life.</p>
               <p>Where before that? - In London mostly.</p>
               <p>Where the other part? - Some time out of town.</p>
               <p>Where? - In Hertfordshire, part of it.</p>
               <p>You have been here before, I believe? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>In that place, I believe? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>You have been capitally convicted? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>TODD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>What is alledged against me is false. I had not had this coat ten minutes, when they took me: I had lent it a man for three weeks. They said I had a brown coat on, at the office. When the little boy was asked, he fell a crying, and said, To the best of his knowledge I was the man. The justice said I must go back till Saturday; that a gentleman was coming out of the country; and with the boy's evidence I must be committed till October sessions next. When I came up the Saturday following, there was no gentleman there, only the boy, the same as before. When they came to swear the boy, he fell a-crying, and said, To the best of his knowledge I was the man.</p>

            . How was that? - No such thing. I was crying. I did not say, To the best of my knowledge he was the man; I said, the moment I saw him, he was the man. I knew him immediately: I said positively he was the man.</p>
               <p>UNDERWOOD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing about what has been said. I am innocent of every thing that has been said about me. There is nobody in the world knows any thing of me but that I work honestly for my bread.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharpe. The window was fastened over-night; for they had broke the glass, in order to enable them to put their hands through, to throw up the springs of the sash.</p>

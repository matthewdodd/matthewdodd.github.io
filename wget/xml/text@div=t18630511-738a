                  </hi>. I reside at Weston-street, Stratford, and am a signal-man on the Great Eastern Railway—I was present at part of the fight between Rivett and Howlett some time after 7—I do not know how long they had been fighting—I saw ail four of the prisoners there—Lewis had got a sponge or rag washing Howlett's face when I saw him—William Hammond had a watch in his hand, and was calling "time" while the fight was proceeding—when they had fallen he called "time" for them to come up again—he had two. men as seconds—I do not know who they were—they bathed his head a great deal with cold water out of a basin; I do not know by whom—I did not remain to the end—I was there some time; then I went away for a few minutes, and went back again—while I was to and fro they fought about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I should think—I was there before the last round began—when his seconds set him up he was first let go, and knocked down again directly—he made no defence with his hands the last round—he did not seem capable of anything—I saw him fall—he lay there about five or six minutes; I cannot tell exactly—there was a loud talking and noise—I did not hear anything said in particular—if I am to speak the truth, I should say it was not a fair fight in the last round, because the man could not stand up to fight.</p>

               <p>As soon as they got him up, they were just going to let go, and he was hit again—he was hardly let go when he was hit—he was hardly standing—I believe he would have dropped if he had not been knocked down—the de<lb></lb>ceased seemed to be the best man all through the early part of the fight—Howlett was a good deal punished—he hit the deceased in the neck, I believe, the last time—he did not hit him very hard, not so hard as the last round before.</p>

               <p>ceased was brought in on the morning of 6th April, a few minutes before 10—I examined his body—he was dead when I saw him—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found marks of contusions over the head, face, chest, shoulders, and hands; the scalp was extravasated with blood—on removing the skull-cap, I found a large <hi rend="italic">coagulum</hi> of congested blood on both hemi<lb></lb>spheres of the brain, which was congested—the lungs and air passages were congested also—all the other organs were perfectly healthy—I attribute death to the effusion of blood on the brain, which could be caused by a blow at a prize fight—hearing what happened before, I do not entertain any doubt that effusion had been caused by the violence that had been inflicted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May effusion of blood on the brain be caused by other means than violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; from disease, of from a sudden rupture of one of the vessels in the brain—a rupture of one of the vessels in the brain sometimes takes place without there having been exter<lb></lb>nal violence, as in the case of apoplexy—excitement brought on, whether from physical or mental causes, will result in apoplexy or the rupture of the vessels of the brain; it depends upon the age in a great measure—it is very extraordinary to see it under a certain age—in my own experience, I have not found it any so young.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am asking you, as a gentleman of science and reading on this matter, no age is exempt from it under certain circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot fully answer that question; not from disease; from injury—I never heard of it occurring in anyone so young—mental excitement might produce a rupture of a blood vessel in the brain at any age—when there is a rupture quite in<lb></lb>dependent of any blow or any fall, there is generally ossification of the tissues—I cannot say that the excitement of fighting a person who has undergone training would produce a rupture by the sudden change from severity of living to the excitement of fighting, without violence—I could not say, unless the tissues of the blood vessels had been diseased—it might, but I cannot say—I have never known a case occur except in cases where the tissues of the vessels have been diseased by bony deposits—from my examination I observed general extravasation over the two hemispheres of the brain—I should not expect to find extravasation only at the particular spot where a person has received injury from a blow or a kick—it depends upon where the blow was struck—if he received a blow over the temple, and the skull was fractured, and an artery ruptured, I should expect to find extravasation from the concussion to the head throughout—if there was a large blood vessel ruptured, it would flow all over the interior surface; it would depend also upon what position the body laid in; the blood would gravitate—I could not swear what particular vessel in the brain was ruptured—some might be produced by the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> in the act of getting off the skull-cap—the longitudinal <hi rend="italic">sinus</hi> was ruptured in two places—I could not say whether that was produced before death or after—great force is required in removing the skull-cap—this clot could not have been caused by the removal of the skull-cap—no doubt, when the skull-cap is torn off, it must rupture some of the vessels—you are obliged to take the <hi rend="italic">calvarium</hi> off with great force—the rupture of a blood vessel would be doubtful, but I have no doubt about the clot—it was not a clot in one single place, but over both hemispheres.</p>

Next morning I met a woman who asked me if I had got my money: I did not know the woman; she took me to the same house where I had been, and shewed me the prisoner at the bar, and said she saw him cut my pocket. I then went out and got a constable, who took him to the round-house; and on searching the prisoner found ten shillings in silver in his pocket: the constable then took him to justice Welsh, who sent for the woman, but she could not be found; the man of the public house said he would be answerable for her appearance.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of October I went into the Nag's Head, in Dean-street, for a pint of beer, and this man (meaning the prosecutor) was asleep on the top of the tables: the prisoner sat down by him, and I saw him cut his pocket; as soon as he had done it he went out.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you before he cut his pocket? - No; I was only in for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room besides? - A whole room full of people.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the company what was done? - Yes, and some of them ran out, but could not catch him.</p>
               <p>You did not awake the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No, never in my life. I was taken up on suspicion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060087"></xptr> for the same affair, and carried before the justice, who admitted me as evidence against the prisoner.</p>

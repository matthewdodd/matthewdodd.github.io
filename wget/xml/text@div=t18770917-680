               <p>no answer, but on looking round I saw it lying under the stairs—I went and picked it up and I found a new coat inside the old one—they both had tickets on—I asked him where he got them from—he made me no answer at the time, but I took him towards the police office, which was closed, and he told me he had them given him—I told him he would have to explain to me who they were given to him by, or he would have to explain to somebody else—he offered no explanation, and I gave him in custody.</p>

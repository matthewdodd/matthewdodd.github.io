               <p>What time? - Eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was you by yourself? - No: I had three children with me, two boys and a girl; one was about five years old, the other four, the other two.</p>
               <p>Was the girl two years old? - No; the girl was between three and four.</p>
               <p>Do you live near Stepney Church-yard? - In White-Horse-street. This man came up to me, and asked me the way to White-Horse-street; I said I was going that way, and would show him; but thinking he would walk faster than me, I showed him a cart, and said that was going there.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Going of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Past fourteen? - Yes; he told me he did not want to know the way to White-Horse-street, and asked me to go of an errand for him, and said he would give me a guinea; I said I would not go for two guineas; I told him I could not leave the children in the Church-yard; he said then he would give me three guineas if I would leave them in the Church-yard; I said I would not, they did not know the way home. He then desired me to take the children home and come again; I said I would; but I did not intend to come again. As I was going home from the Church-yard, I met my brother and sister.</p>
               <p>Were those children you were with your brothers and sisters? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many did you meet? - Only two; they stayed by the way, I went home with the youngest.</p>
               <p>What did you do when you had taken the youngest home? - I saw the other little girl at the door going of an errand; she said she was going to call a washerwoman for her aunt, and asked me to go with her; I said I would go, and went with her.</p>
               <p>What girl is that? - Her name is

            , her father is a breeches-maker.</p>
               <p>What age is she? - Going of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner at this time? - We did not see him; when we came into the Church-yard, I saw him standing at a burying, with his hat off; I said to the other girl this man will follow us, let us go home. We went as far as Stepney alms-houses, and this man followed us.</p>
               <p>That is in the way home? - Yes; only we stopped to talk to two little girls as we were going home, and this man came up to us.</p>
               <p>How came you to stop, when you expected he would follow you? - I did not expect he would follow us then, I thought he would if we went through the Church-yard; he came up, and asked us if we would go of an errand for him; he said he had some smuggled goods he had left with a boy of thirteen years of age at Rhodes' Well, and he was afraid of the custom-house officers, and would be obliged to us if we would go and fetch them for him.</p>
               <p>What, did he say he would give you then?</p>
               <p>He said three guineas, a piece of muslin, and a yard of lace a-piece.</p>
               <p>This was to each of you? - Yes, a bit of muslin to make a gown a-piece. I told him I was not willing to go; he asked me what I was afraid of; I said I was afraid he did not mean any good; he put his hand to his heart, and said He wished God Almighty might strike him dead that precious minute if he wished us any harm; he said it would be better for us if we would go. The other girl said, let us go a little way. We ran a little before him, through a field to Rhodes' Well. I then said to the other girl, let us go home; the other girl said, let us stop and hear what he says; by that time he had got up to us, and asked us what we were afraid of, because we seemed to be afraid and timorous.</p>
               <p>What was you afraid of? - We thought within ourselves that he meant some harm; but he spoke so fair that we did not think he could do us any harm; we told him we thought he did not mean any good; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070061"></xptr> again, Here is my hand from my heart, and said, he wished God might strike him dead if he meant any ill; that he had children of his own as big as we were, and he would scorn to hurt us. There were two gates; he bid us get over one in the beginning of the road, the other in the middle; they go into the fields to Rhodes' Well; he says to one of us, you get over one gate, you over the other. I said, no, we would get over together; he said, the custom-house officers would take notice of two; we both got over into the field together; we seemed afraid; he said, what are you afraid of and pulled out a great parchment, and said this parchment is 1000 l. property, you need not be afraid; so we went across two fields. I said to the other girl we shall not know our road home again; he said, yes, you shall, for I will put you safe into the road again, as soon as I have got the bundles. We came up to a five-bar-gate; he wanted us to creep through; I said I would not go through that field for ever so much. A man came by on horseback; he said, look, here is a custom-house officer; I said if there was a devil-officer, I would not go into that field; he said, then he should loose his bundles; I said I did not care, I would not go into that field for all the bundles in England. Then he says, if you won't go I will get some body else that will; then we went to go home. I said to the other girl I was afraid we were not going the way home; he said, yes, we were. He then took us down to the side of a hedge, and then he said, If you do not submit to what I like, I will cut your throats; and he fumbled about in his pocket for his knife, and took hold of our throats, and throwed us down, and said, God d - n you, and bugger your eyes, if you do not submit to what I like I will cut your throats directly! then I screamed again.</p>
               <p>Did you scream before? - Yes, when he threw us down we both screamed, and he put his hand before our mouths.</p>


               <p>One on each mouth? - Yes; we were both down on the ground; he put his hand on both our mouths, and there we lay a little while; and then he said he would lie with the eldest first. He asked which was the eldest; I said, for God's sake, have mercy on us, I said I would submit to any thing if he would not touch the other girl, because she was so young.</p>
               <p>So you owned you was the eldest? - Yes, I told him I was the eldest.</p>
               <p>How old was the other girl? - I thought she was younger than I; but when I came to hear her age, I found we were of the same age; I thought I was turned of fifteen. When I came to ask my father, I found I was only turned of fourteen. Then he threw me down on the ground, and swore if I offered to stir he would cut my throat directly; and he took hold of the other girl by the clothes, and held her down while he was indecent with me.</p>
               <p>Remember you told us you was down before - We were down once; we got up again, and he knocked us down again.</p>
               <p>You said at first you screamed again the second time? - We screamed twice the last time; he put his hands on our mouths, and said, if we screamed again he would c ut our throats directly.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, was you down twice or three times? - Only twice; it was the second time he put his hand upon my mouth.</p>
               <p>You said just now, that after he put his hand upon your mouth you got up, and then he knocked you down again? - I said, after he knocked us down the second time we screamed, and he put his hand upon our mouths.</p>
               <p>Then he did not put his hand upon your mouth the first time? - No.</p>
               <p>Then he lay with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And held the other girl down at the same time? - Yes, with his elbow; she untied her apron, and thought she might get away from him and call help.</p>
               <p>How came you to observe what she was doing while he was lying with you? - I kicked and tumbled about; I heard every word she said, because she was close to me.</p>
               <p>I should think you was so frightened you would not have observed what was done to her; did you observe what he said and did while he was lying with you? - See, I did not, but I heard; I was afraid he would do her some mischief or another.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070062"></xptr>How long was this about? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>He was not half an hour in lying with you? - Yes, he was as near as we could guess; we were frightened, and thought five minutes was a great while.</p>
               <p>What became of the other girl? - He held her down. When he had done with me, I got up directly; as we were going home I downed on my knees, and said, pray don't touch her; he said he would not; but as we walked along the field, he said the other would tell of me if he did not serve her the same; and I told him (not as I thought to keep it in from my father and mother) I told him she would not, because we had lived together so many years; he bid me not to tell any body; I said I would not (because I was in danger of my life, not that I intended to keep it in); the other girl was walking along. In the mean time he said, whenever I come down White-Horse-street, if I don't serve her the same you will take me up and put me into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>How near was you to the road? - A field off; there was not a person in the road to call to. Then he throwed the other on the grass; I said, for God's sake! don't touch her; he said he would, by God he would; says he, I know she will tell; she will hit it in your teeth whenever you quarrel. I said we never quarrelled; he said, we could not live without quarrelling. He took her by the shoulder, and throwed her down; instead of holding me, he let me go; I ran a little way off from him. As soon as he saw me got away from him, he fetched me back, by holding my shoulder, and struck me on my breast, so that it was black for several days. After he knocked me down, I thought I should not have risen any more; I had not power to speak for two or three minutes after.</p>
               <p>Did the other girl see all this? - She got up and attempted to run away.</p>
               <p>Then you walked away at the time he had got the other girl down? - I ran towards the road.</p>
               <p>Did he get up from the other girl and follow you? - She got up; she had not power to move for fright; she thought I was run away from her. I thought if I could get to the road I could call some body to my assistance. He ran very fast; he seemed rather to fly than run; he said, what, are you going to call some body to your assistance; what do you think of it; why, I could have run five miles off with this poor girl.</p>
               <p>Did the other girl get up while he was running after you? - Yes, she did; he took me back to her again; she offered to run away; he called out, and said, if you don't stop it shall be worse for you; there was no place for her to run away; he snatched her, and threw her down again; he held me by the clothes, and swore, I will serve you the same as I have done before, and I will beat you like a sack of wheat:</p>
               <p>Did he hold you down while he held her down? - Yes, he held me down as he did the other whilst he was with me, with his elbow.</p>
               <p>What happened then? - The other said what do you think will become of you, you will surely be hanged as you are born; he said he did not care; I said here is somebody in the field; I said there was a press-gang or one thing or another, in order to set him to run; he said he did not care if the devil was in the field, he would have his will. I did not hear any body, I only told him so, to try if I could make him run away; by that time the other got up.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing to do with the other at that time? - He was with her then when I told him there was some body in the field.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing to do with that girl? - Yes, all the while he was with her; I think I may say pretty near three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>This was all in the same field? - It was.</p>
               <p>Was there any path there? - No path at all.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the gate? - A good distance; we went through one field, then the other; we went over a bank to it; I really don't know, for I did not mind.</p>
               <p>Did you go over a bank into this field where this happened? - Yes, a pretty high one; but it was trod down, there was no path at all in it; there was a cow and a calf in the field.</p>
               <p>You went out of another field into that? - Out of the first field into that; the field that we were to go through to go home.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070063"></xptr>One field you said you would not go into? - That was the other field that we said we would not go into it; we did not go into that field at all; but we went into two fields; he wanted us to go into three fields; it was a great high wheat field; the wheat was fit to cut that he wanted us to go into. When we refused to go into that, he took us as if we were going home; we had been across two fields.</p>
               <p>Did he make you to get over the bank? - Yes, he said, come over this bank, and it will not be ten minutes walk there.</p>
               <p>How long after he had thrown you down was it before he threw the other down? -</p>
               <p>Not five minutes. I forgot to tell one thing; when he got to the field where the wheat was, he beckoned his boy, and said, Jack, come here; he said Jack could not hear him; I said I would not go through that field, for I mistrusted some ill then.</p>
               <p>You say it was not five minutes after he lay with you before he lay with the other; are you sure of that? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Did you lie very still, or struggle with him? - We both struggled a great deal with him; but it was all to no signification; he swore at us so that we downed on our knees six or seven times, and begged he would not kill us; he swore at us so that we were quite frightened at him; he was above our strength a great deal. We did not know our way home; I said to the other, I am sure we do not know our way home; I said to him, what do you think our fathers and mothers will say when we get home; he said he did not care. We asked him if he was not ashamed of himself; he said no, that he had served younger than us so. As he walked along with us, he said we should go home and we were very thankful he spared our lives; we were going home; he took us over into the last field which is next the road; then he said to the other -</p>
               <p>Did he give you any thing? - No, nothing in the world.</p>
               <p>How long did he walk with you? - About ten minutes; then he took hold of the other, and said he had not done with her; I downed upon my knees, and said, for God's sake, don't hurt her any more, you cannot ruin me more than you have done, kill me, or any thing, but don't touch the other girl; he said he had not done with her.</p>
               <p>What happened then? - He throwed her down again, and swore by God, if we made any resistance, or tried to run away from him, it should be worse for us. He made me sit down again, whilst he was concerned with her, and he held me the same again. There was a cart went by, we were pretty near the road, and there was nothing but two boys in it; he held our heads both down against the grass. If they had been two men instead of boys, we should have called to them if we had been killed; but the boys would have been nothing in his hands.</p>
               <p>So you did not call out because they were not men? - Yes; when he had done with the other he got up again.</p>
               <p>Did he lay with the other then? - Yes, he lay with her twice.</p>
               <p>He did not meddle with you then? - No, he never touched me any more; he said he did not like me; but when we were together he offered me a guinea; I said I did not want either him or his guinea, and he never spoke to me afterwards while we were in the field.</p>
               <p>Did he meddle with the other girl any more? - He did, twice; he said he would give us a guinea; I said I either wanted him nor his guinea; he said he did not like me, the other was the best natured girl, because I was so timorous to go with him, the other seemed to have a better heart than I had; and she said she did not think there was that in him, he spoke so fair that he knew so many folks in our street that I knew, that I thought he would not have that behaviour.</p>
               <p>Did he give the other girl a guinea? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he offer it to her? - He said he would give it us between us.</p>
               <p>Did he leave you then? - We went over the bank into the road, and we walked on first, and he returned to a bit of water; said he, I must wash my shirt or else I shall be blowed.</p>
               <p>Did you see him wash his shirt? - I cannot say I saw him, because I walked on; we tried to get up to Sunderland's.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Did you go home directly? - He said he would go to Sunderland's to get something to drink; instead of that he ran away; I never saw any more of him; we went home by ourselves, and my father and mother and people were coming to seek for us; we met them; because we never were girls that went out with fellows, or were out late at night; we told them immediately what had befallen us.</p>

               <p>But you could see whether there was a path in it or not? - There was no path in it I know.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there a gravel-pit in the field? - The field is begun to be cut as if it was to be ploughed; there was no gravel-pit in it.</p>
               <p>How far was it off the road? - There was a field and then a road, and then two fields more. It was on the left-hand side of the way as we went down the road leading to Limehouse church.</p>
               <p>You are you say turned of fourteen years of age? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to be persuaded, who knew the way home so well as you did, by a man that that was the nearest way, when the Gentlemen of the Jury know, and every body must, that it was the farthest way you could go? - It was not me that asked the way to White Horse-street; I said the man asked the way to White Horse-street.</p>
               <p>I do not understand that the man laid hold of you to pull you over, how came you to go over that bank? - He asked me the way to White Horse-street, I did not ask him; I said I was going there, if he would follow me I would shew him; I said there was a cart going if he went by that cart it would take him directly to White Horse-street.</p>
               <p>What size girl is the other girl you speak of, is she as lusty as you are? - No, she is quite thin.</p>
               <p>I understand you that you swear that he laid with you half an hour together?</p>
               <p>Court. That he was half an hour about it, and held the other girl down with his elbow.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath did not you consent rather than the other girl should be abused? - I did not, I only said so.</p>
               <p>Did you struggle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which elbow did he use to hold the girl down? - The left elbow.</p>
               <p>How came you to find out the man? - Dr. Hatton's maid told my father that she had been assaulted by such a man, and he offered her three guineas, three yards of lace, and something else if she would go and get a bundle, the same as he did us; she said she would not; he said if she did not like the things he would give her five guineas to go; she said she had been of an errand, had over stayed her time and could not stay to go; he said he was a captain of a ship, that he was going away the next morning, and that his name was Williams; he told me so, and that he lived in Tooley-street; I asked him two or three things because I thought we should find him out.</p>

               <p>You did not call out to the people in the road or the field? - There was nobody but the two boys.</p>
               <p>Was it the Limehouse road that you saw the boys in the cart in? - I do not know, it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>You used another expression, that after he had taken the liberties with the other girl he said he did not like you? - He said he did not like me because I was ill-tempered; that was in the field.</p>
               <p>But the other girl was very willing? - Not to do what he did; she was willing to go into the field, because she thought him a good sort of man.</p>
               <p>She was willing to go out of the way with the man as well as you; I understand you she was more willing than you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So she was willing to go out of her way? - We were not both together when this man met us.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath was the guinea offered to you after he said he did not like you? - When he was with her he said he did not like me; it was afterwards the guinea was offered, when he was great with her the second time.</p>
               <p>What did he offer you the guinea for? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>I should have thought it was for you to hold your tongue? - I would not have held my tongue.</p>
               <p>When the girl was held down by his left elbow did that girl struggle at all to get from him? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did he offer you the three guineas? - In Stepney Church-yard.</p>
               <p>He did not give it you? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say for deceiving you, for not giving you the three guineas he promised you? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did he make no excuse? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did not he do it? - I do not know. I did not go for the money; he said it would be a friendly action if we would go for him; he seemed so much in trouble to us; I did not go for the money but it was a friendly action.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him so? - He said it would be a friendly action, and would be better for us if we would go: he said that before we went.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Do you know one Drinkwater? - There was a man that they took up named Broadwater.</p>
               <p>Did you take him up upon a charge of this sort? - I did not, but the folks that were with me did.</p>
               <p>What did you say when the man was brought? - I said he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Who was the person that took him up? - The other little girl's father and somebody else.</p>
               <p>Did the girl in your hearing describe this Broadwater; was he carried before the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you there then? - I was.</p>
               <p>What did the girl say about him? - She said it was not him, and so did I, both of us.</p>
               <p>Court. Which side did the girl lie of while the man was lying with you? - On my right-hand side as I lay down.</p>
               <p>You have a mother? - Yes, but she has got a great family of children and could not come.</p>
               <p>Could she get nobody to take care of the children while she came out, upon so important a business as this? - She lives in White Horse-street; but my father is without side the door.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070066"></xptr>Which did you see and tell it first to, your father or your mother? - Neither of them; I told it to a neighbour.</p>
               <p>When did you discover this? - As soon as we went home.</p>
               <p>Who did you discover it to? - A neighbour.</p>
               <p>What is her name? - Mrs. Monk.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - No. She was the first I ever told it to.</p>
               <p>Who is Mrs. Monk? - A neighbour that lives by.</p>
               <p>But she might have come? - She can say no more to it than I have.</p>
               <p>How many days after was it that you took him up? - This was on the Wednesday, we took him up on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>You told Mrs. Monk first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell your father and mother? - I do not know; I believe she told them. I told my mother myself the next day when we were together by ourselves.</p>
               <p>You never told your father of it? - No, for he was in a great deal of trouble.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether you told the story to the father and mother of Stone, and the neighbours that met you? - It was the father and mother, Mrs. Wilson, and two or three more met us together.</p>
               <p>Did you tell your story to them? - We did not tell them then directly, because we were in the street; we only told them how we had been used, but did not tell them the whole truth of it because we were in the street.</p>
               <p>What did you tell them? - We said a man had behaved very indecent to us and that was the reason they took the other gentleman up; that was all we said till we got home, and then we told them; the little girl and I.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the whole story to Stone and his wife? - I did not to Stone and his wife, but his daughter did; I went home directly.</p>
               <p>Did Stone's daughter tell them what happened to you as well as to her? - Yes, she did as soon as she came home.</p>
               <p>How do you account for that, you said a man behaved indecently to you and therefore that was the occasion of the other man's being taken up? - Because they thought that had been the man that had served us so, and for that reason they fell upon him directly.</p>
               <p>Did you describe the man? - We were confused and frightened, we had not power to speak to them, we only said that was not the man; they said we only said so; they took hold of the man because we were confused and did not know the man, and because this man came out of Sunderland's, and they thought he had been the man and had changed his clothes, and therefore they took him up, for they said we might be deceived.</p>
               <p>Had that man when he was taken up the same sort of clothes on as the prisoner? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Upon your oath did not Stone's daughter describe a man? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>And you was by at the time? - I was at home; I went to bed directly as soon as ever I went home; I was not by but I described him the same she did, as they said.</p>
               <p>When did you tell Mrs. Monk? - My father bid her take me and ask me questions as soon as ever I went home.</p>
               <p>So you went to Mrs. Monk's to tell her by your father's directions? - I did.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Your father was angry with you for staying so late? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. And what did you say to your father that your father should bid you go to Mrs. Monk? - I did not say any thing to him, he saw how we had been used, and bid her ask me a few questions.</p>
               <p>What had your father seen that induced him to send you to Mrs. Monk? - I do not know any more than they asked me whether the man had served us so and so; I told them yes; that was the same night, and so I suppose it came to my father's ears.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not your mother at home at that time? - Yes; but she was like to be in sits, and for that reason they sent her to another house.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the father of the girl. I was eating my supper between ten and eleven at night, and word was brought me that the children had been decayed out, that a man had ill-used them, and that he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Do you remember who told you so, was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070067"></xptr> it any of Stone's people? - None. A person came running in, who it was I do not recollect from the confusion I was in; upon that I went immediately and I found two men had a man by the collar; a peace officer went along with me; they said what is the matter here, is this the man who has used your child ill? The peace officer said who gives charge; Stone said I do. There were several women buffetting the man about. I said to the women stand off good women, if the man has done any thing he is amenable to the law, and let the law take its course, but he shall not be hurt. They led him on; I followed; they took him to the watch-house. The children had declared that he was not the man; but the neighbours thought it might be from the confusion the children were in; some of the people even said they were drunk. They were drunk with terror and with the fright. That child had been beat about the mouth; her mouth was swelled, and she had been very severely beat.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any blow in any other part besides the mouth? - It was not fit for me to examine, some other neighbours said she had had a blow upon her stomach. The man was taken to the watch-house. I had heard that the children had said before that was not the man; but however I went in. As the man was going by, my child said O father, they have got the wrong man; I said I do not know. I persuaded them to let the children go down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>(The girl falls into a strong fit.)</p>
               <p>Is she subject to fits? - I never saw her in one till since this affair; she has had one before. She is a strong hale child. She said that was not the man; I let the children both be taken to the watch-house; and said do not keep the man if it is not the man. Every body was of opinion that in the state the children were in then, that it might have been as much against the man as for him, for in their terrour and fright they might as well have said it was as not. I did insist upon it the man should not be let go till the matter had been before a magistrate and investigated, for which I have a paper in my pocket to be brought to Westminster for insisting upon that. When I went home a neighbour, one Mrs. Monk, came in and said, take her and examine her and see whether she has been injured; they very foolishly and inadvertently only examined her by asking her a few questions, when they ought I think to have proceeded to a much stricter examination; they came and told me she had been injured.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not say what they said? - When she came home I said go to bed and compose yourself. That was all that I said to her.</p>
               <p>What questions did you put to the child? Not one. I could not suppose the girl would have courage to reveal such a thing to me.</p>
               <p>This woman should be here. - It was told me before the magistrate that there was no occasion, as she had not made the examination that I expected she would have made; she only verbally examined her; I meant a different examination. She was carried the next day before Mr. Sherwood, and this Mr. Broadwater was there; he separated the girls, put one in his parlour, and the other to the bar; as soon as the children saw him; they severally declared he was not the man. Mr. Sherwood asked if they thought they should know the man; they told him they could pick him out from a thousand, they should know him to the latest day of their lives. Upon a description that I learned from these children, and a corroborating testimony of the cook maid belonging to Dr. Hatton, the minister of Stepney, though Dr. Hatton smothered the evidence, for he would not suffer the servant to go before Mr. Sherwood till he knew who was to pay her. Dr. Hatton's servant gave me a description of that man.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - No, she would not come. Before the justice she gave me a description of this man; her description of the man's person so corresponded with the children's that by means of that I found him out. When I found him he answered to the description. I did not send for my own child, for particular reasons, lest they should say I tutored<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070068"></xptr> her; I sent for Stone and his daughter, and bid Stone go with another person to a publick-house the corner of King James's Stairs, where the man was. When they came there Stone went in; I took the child over with me, and said be cool and deliberate, a man's life, at least his character, is at stake; if you fix such a thing upon him it is one of the worst crimes you can be guilty of in the sight of God and man; now look steadily into the house when you go in and point me the man out. There were between twenty and thirty people in the house. I said to the father, Mr. Stone, how do you, will you drink. Just as I said these words the child catched me by the arm and said, that is the man, the man that did it; he said did what? she said that injured me in Stepney-fields. I collared him directly.</p>
               <p>Was you by when your own child saw him at any time? - I was following the man, and the rest came up into Shadwell-market, just as they turned the corner of Griffin-street my daughter, who was thirty yards from him, said that is the man! that is the man!</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before yourself? - Never, to my knowledge, in the whole course of my life.</p>
               <p>Was you with your child before the justice? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did she fix on him then? - She did identify him directly.</p>
               <p>And you had heard a description from her, and the description she gave before corresponded with the person of the prisoner? - It did; but though the prisoner has not got the same clothes on now, I could pick him out from ten thousand people.</p>

               <p>Had you any constable with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he go voluntarily with you? - He did not; he would not have gone at all if some of Mr. Sherwood's people had not come in; I told him if he was an honest man; he would not be afraid to go to Justice Sherwood. When I laid hold of him I told him I would not quit my hold if I lost my life. I wanted no warrant, for I think when the man was pointed out, any man had a right to seise him.</p>

I asked her to go with me; when we were about half over the church-yard, she turned and said that is the man that asked me to go for some smuggled goods for him. He was standing at a burying. She said she would go back, for he would follow us, and we turned back again and stood a little farther by the yard, and he followed us; says he, well, have you a mind to go; Nancy said no, I do not like to go; I said do go a little way with him, and so we went.</p>

We had got to a lane, and were turning down to go homeward; he called to us and asked us what we were afraid of. He was a good way behind us. Then he called us for to stop, and asked us what we were afraid of. Nancy said, I am afraid that you are about no good; he said here is my hand to my heart, I wish God may strike me down dead this minute if I mean any harm; says he I have got children of my own bigger than either of you, I would scorn to hurt you, or to use you ill; said I, well then we will go with the gentleman; says he, I wish one of my daughters was here now, I would not give you the trouble to go; he said it is not far now, I will shew you the place, and he pointed between two trees; there, he said, is my boy waiting with the bundle for you to fetch it; we went with him over two fields; we came to a great high gate, where there was a field full of corn, so he wanted us to get over there; she said she should not go. There came a man by on horseback; he said here is a custom-house officer, I am sure it is; get through this gate, the holes between the gate are wide enough to creep through, creep through, says he, if you will not creep through get over; she said she would neither creep through nor get over for 1000 l.</p>

               <p>How did you get into that field? - Over a gate.</p>

               <p>You got up again? - This was before we got into the field. He got over the gate first, and pulled it out and said, my dear, this is worth a thousand pound property.</p>
               <p>Who did he say that to? - He shewed it to us both; so then he took us to the lower part of the field and knocked us both down.</p>

               <p>I took this shirt (producing it) off the prisoner's back last Saturday; he was asked how long he had worn it; he said from the Sunday before the Wednesday on which the fact was committed.</p>
               <p>To Taft. Is that the same shirt you saw? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Fletcher. That is the same shirt you showed the woman? - Yes; it appears to have been washed. I have this to observe further, that on the Saturday evening, before we took him to gaol, he behaved very bad; he layed down on the floor, unbuttoned his breeches, and showed his private parts to several women present, and said, You bitches, is not this enough for you?</p>

               <p>I am as innocent as the child unborn. I was at home at my own house at half past nine o'clock at night the night it was done. As to my shirt, my wife was brought and examined to prove that she was so and so at the time; she was examined by women who are here, Mrs. Charleton, Mrs. Penwick, and several examined her at the same time.</p>
               <p>To Fletcher. Was this man kept in custody till his wife was sent for? - He was.</p>
               <p>The wife was sent for? - She was, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was she examined by the women? -</p>
               <p>I heard she was examined; I do not know of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was she examined by the order of the justice? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When was it she was examined; was it while he was before the justice? - She was examined on Saturday, I believe it was done without the knowledge of the magistrate. I heard nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Was it while he was before the magistrate? - No, while he was at the publick-house, after he came from the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did he make it his defence that his wife was out of order? - He did say so; he was very loth to let me look at his shirt; when he found I would, he showed it me.</p>
               <p>Was that mentioned before the magistrate? - On Monday it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, and live at Laurel Cottage, Whit<lb></lb>ton Road, Twickenham—on 30th December, about 4.45 in the afternoon, I was in Thames Street, at the east corner of Pudding Lane—the prisoner was in front of me—I touched him on the shoulder and requested him to move and allow me to cross—at that time a porter came up with a waggon of Christmas trees—the prisoner stood between a house and a corner post—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001100015"></xptr>
               <p>I tried to pass him—he turned round, and I felt my watch chain drop—I had a pencil in my hand—the prisoner was pressing against me, and the porter was about a yard from me—I walked after the prisoner, up Pudding Lane about 30 ft., arrested him, and accused him of stealing my watch—he said, "How could I steal your watch with my gloves on?"—he had brown cotton gloves on, and just as I touched him on the shoulder a young man with a white jacket crossed from me in rear of the prisoner—he crossed between the horses' heads and the tailboard of another waggon—I called the police, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

On 20th December, I heard a cry of "Police!" and the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my custody—the prisoner said, "How could I take your watch, you see I have got my gloves on; what a wicked man you are"—he said, "I am sure you are the man, there was no one else near me"—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave an address, 8, George Street, Horseferry Road—I went there, but nobody knew him there—there is no George Street in Horseferry Road.</p>

I am errand boy to Mr. Meredith—on 20th December, I was standing at the corner of Pudding Lane, and saw Mr. Kiddle crossing the road opposite Pudding Lane, going up Fish Street Hill way—I saw the prisoner cross the road before that, and saw him touch another person as he came across—they knocked up against each other, and one went towards Billingsgate and the prisoner came up Pudding Lane, and Mr. Kiddle came up and caught him—they touched their arms and wrists—the other man was not the prosecutor—I then heard the prisoner charged.</p>

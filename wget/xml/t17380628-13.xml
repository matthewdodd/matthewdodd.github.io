I took her up, but she is bail'd out by Harris the Officer, in Rose-Mary-Lane, a Thief Catcher, I think they say he is. The Girl stole it to be sure, for I lost this Gown, and six more; she own'd she stole this, and I found it upon

            . I have nothing to say against the Prisoner; the Gown was found upon Irish Peg. When the Girl was before the Justice, she own'd that Peg gave her 6 s. and 6 d. for it, and told her, that she would buy of her whatever she should get. This Accessary is out upon Bail; for Mr. Warrener, (Justice Farmer's Clerk) said, the Thief-takers would never let him alone till she was bail'd. I believe the Child is an honest Child, only she was drawn in by this Jade.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Dean. I never saw the Girl in my Life, till she was before the Justice; but the People that were about her, said she was an honest sober Girl. Irish Peg told us, she gave the Girl 6 s. 6 d. for it; - I would give a Guinea for it, to make my Money of it again.</p>

On Wednesday afternoon, the 29th of November, at two o'clock, I was in the shop; Wright and Harris knocked at the door - I did not know them before; they came in and asked to look at a second-hand silver watch; Wright said he had just come from sea, had 6l. in his pocket, and he wanted to buy one - I said I did not sell silver watches, and had none to suit him; he asked to see a metal one - I said I thought I had none that would suit him; he desired me very much to show him a watch - I showed him an old metal one in a tortoise-shell case - Wilkinson and Clark were standing at the window all this time, and appeared in conversation with each other - Wilkinson came in, and stood behind the other two; I asked what he wanted; he said, after some hesitation, that he wanted to buy a ring: I said I had none for sale, and desired him to go about his business - he went out, and stood at the window again, with Clark - while Wright was looking at the watch, Harris took an old silver watch off the case, and covered it with his hands; but I discovered it, and took it from him; I desired him not to touch any thing, unless I gave it into his hand; I took it from him, and hung it up - Harris then passed behind Wright, and got behind me, by the window - I turned round to speak to him, and at that instant Wright snatched up a watch and ran off; it was a French repeater, in a silver case, and a very large antique watch. I immediately rose a cry of Stop thief! my neighbours ran out and pursued Wright; Mr. Slark caught him in my sight; I called my wife down-stairs, but Harris slipped out behind me, and ran off with the other two prisoners who were at the window: I pursued them; they all run one way - I saw Slark take the watch from Wright; he gave it to me(Joseph Dossett here produced the watch); this is it; it has been in my possession ever since 1810, and is worth more than 40s.; he took it off a hook in the window.</p>

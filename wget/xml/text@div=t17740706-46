            . My name was Bellis, but I am now mar ried; Biskett told me of the hat and cloak being in pawn, but that she had nothing of her's to pawn to get them out, and I might get them out if I could; upon which I fetched my mother's buckles; she pawned them for four shilling and sixpence and got the hat and cloak out of pawn; when I saw them I was much concerned, for I found they were not worth near the money; all I could do therefore was to get as much as I could upon the cloak; I got Biskett to pawn it again, and she brought me half a crown.</p>
               <p>Stevenson's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am quite innocent of the charge; I know nothing in the world about it.</p>
               <p>Salmon's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Stevenson and Salmon did not call any witnesses; and there being no evidence to affect Carr and Cook, they were not put upon their defence.</p>

            . I am a labouring man. I had seen the prisoner twice on the day before this robbery. I saw him again that day, near Mr. Mynas's door, with a few matches - I went into a field after some cows, and upon coming back up a lane. I again met him with the shirts under his arm - I asked him where he was going? he said to Whitechapel. I said there was no road that way, but that if he would come back, I would direct him - he agreed; and I asked him what he had got - he said two or three shirts which were given him. I asked him if he would sell some of them - he said he did not care. I looked at them and found they were boys' shirts - he said you shall have them all for 8 s. I said, I'll take you and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270069"></xptr>all, for they are wet - as we were going along he said, "This will hang me, I have been transported before."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had had them in my possession half an hour. I said, I am going to London; and he said that was no thoroughfare - he asked what I had got there - I said some shirts, and if they were mine, I should sell them for 8 s., but they were not mine - when we got to the house, three women were washing, and one of them came out and said," this man was here half an hour before, if he took these he might have taken fifty more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not say that a man had given them to me?</p>
               <p>A. No, you did not.</p>

I met a man who said, "Is not your name Graham - did not you belong to the Mary Jane" - I said Yes; he said, "Hold this bundle which has got a few shirts in it, and when I come back I will give you an old shirt, I am sorry you have not got one." I said "Never mind, I shall soon go to the parish."</p>

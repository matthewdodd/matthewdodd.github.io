                  </hi>. I am a coach trimmer, of No. 1, Cottage Place, York Street, Lambeth. On Saturday evening, 19th Dec., about 6 o'clock, I was at the top of Strutton Ground; I was quite sober—I went into a public house, and had half a quartern of gin and some hot water—I paid for it, and got some change, but I cannot say how much—a sixpence dropped, and the prisoner assisted me to look for it, but we were not able to find it—he said that he was out of work, and with a good deal of persuasion I stood a pint of beer for him, and then got away as well as I could, but he kept pushing against me, and saying, "Stop a little bit, master"—I had drank about half a glass of stout with him before I gave him the pint of beer—I drunk some of the pint—after I got out I walked from one end of Strutton Ground to the other; I then heard a voice behind me, saying, "I say," or something like that—I turned round, and saw the prisoner; his hand was in my pocket in a moment, where I had got a pocket book containing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a tobacco box—there were two half sovereigns, and the rest in silver, I cannot say of what kind—I missed my pocket book in a moment—he then said, "All right," and shoved me down—I tried to <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> him, but could not—I got up directly, and went up Pear Street; I did not lose sight of him till he got to the top of the street—I spoke to a policeman, and went to the station house; a policeman went with me to the Corner Pin public house, Strutton Ground, and saw the barman—the prisoner was in front of the bar; I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Bricklayers' Arms, Strutton Ground, which is sometimes called the Corner Pin; it is kept by Mr. Knight. On this Saturday night the prisoner came in first—when I had served them I went in to tea—they were not together, but after I came out they were drink<lb></lb>ing together—I took for what Booth had, half a quartern of gin, and he gave me two penny pieces—there was no change—I do not know whether he paid for some beer afterwards; I was gone in to tea, and did not pay any further attention to them—I do not know who went out first, but Barry came back about half an hour after—the prosecutor had not been to me in the mean time—Isaw him come in without the prisoner in about a quarter of an hour—he did not speak to me, but to one of the barmen.</p>

On Saturday night, Dec. 19, about half past 6 o'clock, Booth came to the station, and from what he said I went with him to the Corner Pin, and saw the prisoner there with a glass of brandy and water in front of him, and a cigar in his mouth—Booth said, "That is the man who robbed me"—I told the prisoner I wanted him, for robbing Booth of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "It is a pretty job this is"—he came out very quietly indeed as far as the Grey Coat Hospital, when he became very violent—acrowd came round, and he passed something to his brother, who came up—itwas like paper screwed up small—he then said, "I am not going without I have a b—<hi rend="italic">scrap</hi> for it," and took hold of my staff, and tried to wrench it from me—he kicked me violently on my legs and thighs, and also my brother constable—it took five or six of us to take him to the station—he was there searched, and half a crown, a two shilling piece, and two sixpences (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) were found on him—his brother ran away at the Grey Coat Hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there a great many constables there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Idid not tell them to apprehend the brother, though I saw something pass to him—the prisoner had been drinking—there were about twenty persons at the Corner Pin—it is a very troublesome neighbourhood—Strutton Ground is a kind of market on Saturday nights, and there is a great crowd there—it is a very low neighbourhood—he was searched at the station.</p>

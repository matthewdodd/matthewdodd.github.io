               <p>Q. On the 15th of December, in the last year, did either of the prisoners come to your house - A. Yes, Mr. Vaughan, in company with Barrett; as near as I can recollect, it was about twenty minutes before five; it was darkish. I had left my work of cutting out, as I could not see to cut out, and I was drinking my tea, when they came in.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had you ceased to cut out, because it was not light enough - A. About ten minutes. Vaughan spoke to me before the other man, and said my name is Vaughan, and I am a Bow-street officer; and he gave me his card. He said, I know that your house is marked up to be robbed, and I am come to warn you, and if you will let me, we will take the men; this is Barrett my brother officer. Now they are very bad characters, and noted house-breakers, and if you do not let us take them, they will no doubt come when you are in bed and asleep, and most likely you or some of your family will get murdered. By these persuasions, I consented to Vaughan to protect my place, and then they both spoke to me. I consented to do as they should advise me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they then give you any advice - A. Yes, they told me to mark my cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner - A. The cloth in the long rolls, is all marked in a regular system, with a shop mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Vaughan propose any additional marks - A. Yes, he told me to mark some pieces that were on the counter and told me to lay them on the counter. I asked him how I should mark that which I was to lay on the counter, it being short cuts or lengths, and not marked as usual; they were cuts that lay about for present use. He took up my shears, and cut some bits of calico, little bits off; and then he nicked them, and they were pinned to the bits of cloth that lay on the counter; I don't know whether he pinned them, or shewed me how he pinned them on, but they were pinned on. There were cards on the regular rolls on the shelves; they did not want marking. I should think this was twenty-five minutes or half an hour before the thieves came. It was hardly a quarter of an hour before I went out with them. Just before we came away, the buy brought up a light and lit the lamp, and Vaughan ordered it to be put out, I can't say he gave any reason for desiring it to be put out. I don't know whether Vaughan or I put it out. He desired me to faston the door, not to lock it, but to latch it, but to be very particular about it, to take particular care that the latch caught, and was fastened, He, Barrett, and I quitted the shop together. Vaughan shewed, me how to fasten the latch, and said, now you do so; and be sure it is on the latch. Then we quitted the shop, and went over the way to Mr. Anderson's shop in front of mine, for the purpose of catching the thieves coming to plant them there. Vaughan asked me to get him into some neighbours house to watch. We went over to Mr. Andersons, and his eldest son gave leave for them to be there; that was Mr. Robert Embledon Anderson.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had stationed them there what did you do with yourself - A. Will you allow me to tell you, that young Anderson knew Vaughan, and he said, ah Vaughan, how are you. He more readily consented as he knew Vaughan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Vaughan and Barrett, what you had to do - A. Yes, I told them I had to go out and wait upon a gentleman, precisely at five o'clock. Before I left them, Vaughan and Barrett both spoke to me, telling me to mark any of the large rolls of cloth, beside what they had marked, and put them in the way. They told me I should loose nothing. I went across home, and told my wife I was satisfied that it was Vaughan the officer. I then took my candle and looked all round the shelves in my shop, and missed nothing. The lamps were not lighted, and I took the candle back into the parlour, leaving no light in the shop. I then told my wife to sit near the light if she thought proper. I then placed a boy on the stairs facing the passage door, I placed him to sit on the stairs; it was dark there, and if any thieves were to enter they could not see him there. They could well see my wife through the window, because my parlour has folding doors. Having made this preparation, I quitted the house to go to my customer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you quitted the house, how did you manage about the door - A. I latched it inside white I was inside, and went out by another door round by the passage. I ascertained that I had latched it, and that it was fast; I ascertained it both inside and out. I pursued Vaughan's directions and made every thing secure.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Vaughan had quitted your house, was it before you quitted your house finally - A. About ten minutes or hardly so much; I know I was some few minutes beyond my time with the gentleman I was to have been with at five; he was Mr.

            , No. 8, Mecklenburgh Square. I think I might be about ten minutes running there, and back. It was about six or seven minutes after the time of my appointment that I set out to go. I had been detained about this business, and was gone I thought ten minutes; I don't think I could be more. This was the shortest day, and when I was setting out it was rather dark; the lamps were lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see the face of a man - A. I have been reminded by Vaughan, that it must be the light of the oil shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't tell me of any light that you had from oil shops; from the light of Heaven, independent of of any artificial light, could you distinguish the features of a mans countenance - A. Yes, there was when I left my shop. I went to Mecklenburgh Square and was gone about ten minutes, As I was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180017"></xptr>out of my shop, I met two men between me and the railings; they afterwards turned out to be Batts and Rawley, and were afterwards convicted here; they were about thirty yards from my shop; the street is but short.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as you were returning, did you see any one - A. Yes, I saw Rawley with a roll of cloth under his arm, and another person; it was superfine broad cloth; I let him pass me about ten or fifteen yards, and saw no one coming. Then I turned round to go after him; I did not cry stop thief for some time. He threw the cloth down under my feet; it stopped me, and I jumped over it, and followed him, and cried stop thief. I still pursued him; I caught him nearly opposite the Foundling Hospital, in Great Guildford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lost sight of him - A. No. After I seized him, the officers came up immediately; I don't know where they came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take the other person - A. They did; it turned out to be Farthing afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Farthing and Rawley taken to the watchhouse - A. I left them in custody, and returned home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got home, how much of your property did you find missing - A.Three pieces of superfine broad cloth. Vaughan told me he picked up the piece that Rawley threw down. Vaughan and Barrett came to my house again that night at eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you - A.Vaughan was telling us a great deal about different robberies. I told him I had lost three rolls of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of these - A. I believe I lost about thirty yards, worth about twenty-five shillings a yard. I told him I had lost three pieces, and he said he knew where to find them, and he knew where to find the other thieves; but I had, spiked the job by calling out stop thief; for he knew where to have gone and caught them together dividing the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get the other pieces again - A. I never did. Vaughan afterwards returned to me the piece he picked up; but not as it was before; it wanted about two yards and a quarter; the length of the piece had been seven yards and a quarter, and when he returned it to me it was about five yards. I appeared the next day at Bow-street against Rawley, and Farthing; and Batts had been taken then. Vaughan made application to me about the conducting the procecution. He asked me if I would employ a Counsel, and I told him I did not want to go to any expence, what I knew of myself was plain facts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Vaughan and you give evidence against Rawley, Batts, and Farthing on their trial here - A. Yes; but I did not swear to one because I did not know him; they were convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. After that verdict was found did Vaughan make any observation to you about your evidence - A. He did when we went out of the Court; he said I had leaned two much to the prisoners, by saying it was so light, he said by which you have deprived me of the three forty pounds, which you would have had part of for taking the one man.</p>

             ANDERSON. I live at No. 3, Everett-street; that is almost opposite Mr. Poole's house. On the 15th of December, in the last year, Mr. Poole came to my house, accompained at the time by Vaughan and Barrett; at the time they first came over it might be a quarter after four o'clock in the afternoon; as near as I can recollect at the present moment.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they state for what purpose they came - A. Mr. Poole in the first instance stated for what they had come and I immediately recognized Vaughan as a police officer; I had seen him at the police office, and in other places. Vaughan then stated that Mr. Poole's house was that evening to be robbed by certain individuals, and requested that I would allow him to place himself in our house to watch the depredators; which I consented to; it was mentioned that there were to be four robbers; Vaughan mentioned that. The candles were not then lighted; but our lad was bringing them up stairs, when Vaughan requested that they might not be taken into the front shop; the reason he ascribed was that the robbers might not seen him, and his co-adjutor; that was Barrett. Barrett and he were in the private passage of the house. This application was made by Vaughan in Burretts hearing. I contiuned in the front shop from curiosity. I saw two three or four men; I can't say the number. I saw two individuals go into the shop of Mr. Poole; they went in at the front door; that was open; they went in at the passage door; in that passage there is a door that goes into the shop. I saw them go into the shop. One individual was a tall thin man, leaning over the rails as if in the act of watching any person who might come from the parlour into the shop. That man had on a dark brown great coat; he had on a pair of high shoes, what are generally termed high-low-shoes, which came up to his ancle; they were such as are laced up a short way in front.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the men come out of the shop-Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them any thing - A. Yes, one of them who was dressed like a sailor had a bundle of cloth under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them after that - A. The alarm was given, and the officers left the passage of the house, and as they left the street door open, I followed round to shut it after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what became of the tall man who was looking over the railings - A. He went down the street the same way as the officers went, and at the crossing of the street the tall man ran immediatelybetwen the two officers, or nearly; he had crossed over to my side of the way, and in crossing to the other side he got between the two officers; there is a blank side of a house and a garden wall at the end of the street where they might have certainly taken him into custody; they were near enough to converse together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them converse together - A. I saw them stop a few seconds. Barrett then went one way and 
               <persName id="t18160918-6-person138">Vaughan</persName>
             another; and a hackney coach coming through the street, I lost sight of them, and saw no more of them for a considerable length of time; I lost sight of the two officers; but I saw the tall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180018"></xptr>man; he took across from Everett-street towards Brunswick-square; I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come up with him - A.Yes, at the corner of a street paratlel with Everett-street; that was the corner of Barrard-street and Willnot-street; Everett-street is the street that is parallel. Then he stopped for a moment to pull up his stocking.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time an opportunity of observing him - A. During that time, I just walked round him, and as Vaughan had stated to me that he knew where to find the men; I did not stop him. I should be both to swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Donnelly again, did his figure and gait correspond with the figure and gait of the man you had so seen - A. At the time the individual had a long dark brown grent coat. When I next saw Donnelly, his dress was different entirely, except that he had high shoes on similar to those the person were.</p>
               <p>Q.Am I right in understanding you that his figure and gait corresponded with those of the man whom you saw looking over the rails in Everett-street - A. Yes; but there are many circumstances that I would not speak so positively; because the hat he then wore was much shabbier and slouched, wore over his face and ears.</p>

             was at the Falcon public-house; that is in Portpool-lane, nearly opposite the place where I lived; he was in company with Batts, Rawley, and Farthing; I can't say whether they were drinking together; it was between three and five; I did not see them after five I am pretty sure; they left the house altogether. About nine o'clock the same evening, Donnelly came to the window of the same house; I went out to the door immediately; he had not made any signal. He asked me if Tuniker was there; Vaughan was Tuniker as I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever heard him called so among them - A. Yes, always almost; very seldom any thing else. I told him no. I asked him to come into the house, he said, he could not, for he was concerned in a robbery with Farthing and Rawley, and he mentioned that Farthing and Rawley were in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen Donnelly and Vaughan in company together - A. Yes, at the Falson drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a house that Donnelly used - A. Not often; I have not seen him often there.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARRETT. I was a constable in December last. I have been acquainted with the prisoner 
               <persName id="t18160918-6-person141">Vaughan</persName>
             I suppose these three years; he was a patrole belonging to Bow street; I am also acquainted with the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did you know him by - A. Donnelly alias Jack-a-dandy. I know a house occupied by a person named Poole perfectly well. About the latter end of November last, I saw Donnelly in Holborn, in company with two other thieves; I only knew Donnelly before. Knowing him I watched them, they committed an offence there, and were apprehended, but no prosecutor appearing they were discharged. That adventure led to an intercourse between Donnelly, Vaughan, and me; I saw Vaughan, and he and I had some conversation concerning Donnelly giving information; he said he should I not wonder but what Jack would come it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the meaning of that - A. Giving information. It was agreed to ask him when we saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him - A. In the course of a day or two afterwards; I was in company with Vaughan, and saw him in Gray's-inn-lane; we invited him to Mr. Perth's public-house in Holborn, fronting the end of Gray's-inn-lane. We asked him if he could give us any information; he said if he did, the thieves would kill him or murder him, or something to that effect; Vaughan replied, he would make that all right. He left us after having had some porter; we might have been together then about half or quarter of an hour. Being told that that would be made all right, he agreed to give information, We saw him again in a day or two afterwards. Vaughan told me that he had met Jack, and had made an appointment with him to meet him at the same place at two o'clock; that was the house in Holborn. We went, and met him. Donnelly stated that he was going out that night; that was in December; it might be ten days or a fortnight before the 15th. He told us he was going out that night with Batts and Rawley; they were going upon the sneak.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that, among thieves - A. It means going into a house slyly; and that is distingnished from breaking forcibly. If any thing was done, he expected to share part of the reward; that was so agreed on. I was to go along with Vaughan to assist in taking them into custody; and if that was accomplished, he was to have his share of the reward. This agreement being made, we seperated; and we were to meet in the evening part, early, between four and five. The party that were going upon the sneak were to go between four and five from the Falcon in Portpool-lane; that is in the neighbourhood of Gray's-inn-lane; and we were to go and watch them out. We went to a public-house fronting the Falcon that same evening, between four and five. This was not the transaction of the 15th.</p>
               <p>Q. Now then come to the 15th - A. On the 15th we met at Perth's, Donnelly, Vaughan, and I; it was in the forenoon. Donnelly, said d-n me! how did you lose us last night? Vaughan replied, we lost you in a minute; which way did you go? Donnelly, described the way, and Vaughan knew it better than I did. They were alluding to a transaction<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180019"></xptr>the night of the 14th. Donnelly said, they went to the Draper's and went in on the screw and sneaker out a piece of broady.</p>
               <p>Q.What does the scraw mean - A.Turning round the latch of a door; broady, means broad cloth. I asked Donnelly what had become of it, and he stated that Long Tom's wife had pledged it. I asked him where, and whether he could get the duplicate; Vaughan was present all this time. Donnelly said he could not, nor did he know where it was pawned. Long Tom was a man who was convicted here, named Batts. I know a woman named Embling perfectly well; she lived with

            . I asked Donnelly where the cloth was, and told him that if that cloth could be procured, and the prosecutor could swear to it, that would be sufficient in convict them; if he could get either the duplicate or the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the mentioned as being concerned in that - A. Robert Rawley and

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and Vanghan, in point of fact, watched them, and lost them - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. How near had you seen them to Mr. Poole's house - A. About half a mile from it. I then saw Batts, Rawley, and Donnelly together, and missed them suddenly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now go on with the conversation you were relating - A. He said he could not get the duplicate, but they were going again to the same house that night, and they were to start from the same public-house about the same time; and he proposed that I and Vanghan should watch them from the house. Vaughan objected to that, he did not like following them from the house, and said that he would go to the prosecutor, and give him information of his house being about to be robbed. Vanghan stated that two heads were better than one, and he would have his own way in planning it; I had also suggested a doubt of the propriety of following them from the house. We then left the public-house in Holborn, and I think it was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. Donnelly said, mind and be there in time; mind how you act so as you don't throw any suspicion on me; because if you do, they will chiv me; that means stabbing him; putting a knife into him. Vanghan said; no, no, we will take care and make all that right. Soon after we seperated, and went to the Falcon, in Portpool-lane, and had some beef-steaks in the parlour. At the Falcon I saw, Donnelly, Rawley, Batts, and several other thieves; I think I saw Farthing, but I won't be certain as they were not in the room we had the steaks in. They were in the tap-room, and we were in the parlour. At the time that Vanghan and I were eating the steakes, Donnelly came into the parlour, and said mind be in time, don't be too late; we said we will take care and be in time. After we had eaten the steakes it got near the time, and Vanghan and I went to Vanghan's mother-in-law, and there we got two aprons, they were to be put on to disguise us. That was that we night pass for tradesman. Then we proceeded to Mr. Poole's house, and I saw Mr. Poole, Mrs. Poole, and a boy servant. There Vanghan related the circumstances to Mr. Poole of a plan laid to rob his house; he told Mr. Poole that his house was to be robbed and he was to mark some cloths Poole and Vanghan marked them; Mr. Poole seemed rather frightened. Vaughan marked one or two; I think two; I observed they were marked by pieces of calico pinned to them, and they were placed on the counter. Vaughan then told him to put his lamps out which was lit, to the best of my recollection that was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason - A. Yes. That the thieves should not see any person who was in the house. Then Vaughan asked Mr. Poole if he could go over the way; that we might conceal ourselves there; Vaughan shewed him how to fasten the door so as to be sure it was latched. Then we went over to Mr. Andersons, and he gave us leave to be there. After having been there some time, about five or ten minutes; Mr. Anderson gave us leave to go into his passage. We had been in his passage about a quarter of an hour when Mr. Anderson brought a chair, and Vaughan sat down; we had the passage door open, and presently we saw Batts, Rawley, and Donnelly pass Poole's door once or twice. Then there was a man looking over the rails; I don't believe it was any of the three that I have named, but I am not certain. Donnelly then passed again; then he stopped at the window. The first time of passing, a man at present unknown, was looking over the rails; whoever it was the first time, I am not enabled positively to say, but the second time, I saw him distinctly look over the rails into Mr. Poole's shop. Batts then went into the passage of Mr. Poole's house, and came out again. I believe he went in again. Then Rawley went in, and when he came out, he had a piece of cloth with him under his arm. I told Vaughan they had got it and said come along; Vaughan said they had not; I said they had, and said let us come along; I ran out. When I got to the end of the street, I saw Rawley give the cloth to Batts. I ran after them; they had got some distance. Vanghan objected to my going When I got to the bottom end of the street, Rawley gave the cloth to Batts. He went towards Bruntwick-square with it. Rawley and Donnelly returned to go to Poole's house again. Vaughan then came up to me, and they passed me on the way. I had left Vaughan in the passage, and in the moment that Rawley and Donnelly turned to come back, Vaughan came up to me; he came on the other side of the way. Whilst we had been watching them from the passage, Mr. Poole was obliged to leave his house, and when Rawley was running away, he was met by Mr. Poole, who was coming back. Then I and Vaughan joined each other and followed them. Rawley had gone into Mr. Poole's shop a second time, and whilst he went in Donnelly crossed over toward Andersons. Rawley brought out a piece of cloth again; Rawley made off with the second piece of cloth, and it was then that Mr. Poole met him. Vaughan and I pursued after him, and as we were crossing after the prisoner Rawley, Donnelly also crossed, and ran nearly against us, and said George, Bob is gone that way, and Tom is gone that way. Then Donnelly made off, I did not see any more of him. We precerded after Rawley, and when we were following Rawley, we heard a cry of stop thief. We then hastened our pace, and ran after Rawley as hard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180020"></xptr>as we could, and when he had crossed the road, we saw him stop by a gentleman; but we did not know who it was until we got up, and found it was Mr. Poole, Farthing ran across the road, as if he was coming to Rawley, and was stopt. Vaughan picked up the cloth that was thrown away; that was the second piece. We took Farthing and Rawley into custody and took them to St. Giles's watchhouse. Then Vaughan and I took the cloth to his house. We then went to Batts's house, but seeing no light we came away. Vaughan and I met very early the next morning, and went to Batts's house, as early as four o'clock, and apprehended him. Donnelly was not taken, he was to escape. If it had not been settled, there was no difficulty in taking him. These persons were tired here, and capitally convicted.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you see any of the prisoners again - A. In a day or two after, the commitment I saw Donnelly. In a day or two after, I don't know where, but I think in Cloth Fair, I and Vaughan were together, Donnelly said, you have get Jack, meaning Farthing. Farthing had at that time been committed for trial. Donnelly said that Jack was not there just at that time, meaning at Mr. Pooles. He went out with them, Donnelly said to go, but he stopped somewhere on the road, close by Mr. Pooles, but he was not there, at the time the robbery was committed. Vaughan said he had sworn to Farthing, and he was an old thief, and went out for the purpose of committing the robbery, and it could not be helped, and he should let it remain where it was. We agreed to meet at the Cloth Fair public-house, and we did according to the appointment. The chief of the conversation was about the three persons then in custody. I asked Donnelly what had become of the first piece of cloth that was taken on the 15th, that I had seen Rawley,give to Batts. He said, that when Rawley and Farthing were taken, Long Tom, meaning

            , threw the cloth over Brunswick-square, ran back into Holborn to the watering house there, and fetched a rattler, meaning a hackney coach, whipped back to Brunswick-square, took the piece of cloth, and fenced it at old mother Jenning's, in Redlion Market. Before we left the Gost in Cloth Fair, Donnelly said he should go and live over the water, until it was all settled; for he was suspected of giving information against the persons, and he had heard it from several he knew. Before he left the house, he asked Vaughan for some money. Vaughan gave him ten shillings, and we then agreed to meet again in the course of a week which we did, according to appointment at the same place. This was not the only money that passed, Vaughan gave him shillings, or something on former occasions, at Perth's in Holborn, before the robbery was committed. Before we separated at the Goat, an appointment was made for us to meet again; that was for him to give Vaughan and me fresh information. We did meet again, and we used frequently to see Donnelly, but I don't remember anything that passed upon the particular occasions. I believe Vaughan altogether let him have between fifty and sixty shillings, and he had eight shillings of me.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you remember any occasion in which Vaughan and Donnelly had any conversation in Portpool-lane - A. Yes, that was after I had apprehended Donnelly for stealing the gloves, and after he was discharged. After that I saw them again in company conversing together in the lane, and I could hear Donnelly mention his brother's name whom Vaughan had in custody for picking pockets. We frequently met afterwards. I heard that the officers were after me, and I suriendered myself to Mr. Harmer, and told him all I knew upon this subject, and another I was concerned in.</p>
               <p>Q. We have found that these persons were not convicted of the burglary, but merely of thes tealing. Had you any conversation with either of the prisoners on the aubject of that verdict - A. On the day, or the day after the coviction, I saw Donnelly in Cloth Fair, and he said that the persons were convicted, but nothing allowed. That Vaughan had spoiled it, and he would be damned if he would give any more information. After the conviction some time, I had some conversation with Vaughan, and he several times asked me over the water, and at last I did go, and we went to where Donnelly lodged. I knew the woman that kept the house, and Vaughan staid along with Donnelly and his woman. I stepped down below with the woman of the house. After tea we came out of the house all three together. They two came down from above, and joined me. I had told Vaughan of the expression that Donnelly had made use of to me, saying that Vaughan had spoiled it, and he would be damed if he would give any more information. Vaughan asked Donnelly if he would give any more information, he promised he would, but he never did.</p>

I knew where he used to reside, it was in Gray's-inn-lane; I found him at his aunt's; I told him I wanted him, and that I had a warrant against him; he asked me to let him look at it, and I shewed it him. Read came in, and we searched him; we took this pistol from him, and some papers, He declared himself innocent I apprehended Donnelly on the 29th of July, in Beech-street, Barbican; he had on a kind of short coat, as he has now, and shoes up to the ancle, laced in front.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any conversation with him at the time you apprehended him-A. Coming along in the coach, he made use of an expression, d-n his eyes, he never knew a bigger rogue in his life than Vaughan was; he did not say any thing about himself.</p>

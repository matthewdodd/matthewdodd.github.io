I was in the shop on the 11th of April, I was busy at the time, it was between seven and eight in the evening; I was alarmed by the witness that is here, he called out, take your things in, that are at the door; the door-way is very wide, we put boxes out there to lay goods on; it is under the roof, inside of the shop, near the door. Barrett called out, take in your goods at the door, and at the same time he brought the prisoner at the bar into the shop, and likewise a piece of goods, saying, he had stolen it from the door; that piece of goods belonged to me, it was a piece of gingham, six quarters wide, it is worth forty shillings. I looked, and missed a piece of gingham from the door; I had seen that piece of gingham a quarter of an hour before it was taken away.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 11th of April, about seven in the evening, I was at St. Giles's church; I perceived the prisoner in company with four others; in consequence of suspicion, I watched them, and followed them into the Strand. When the prisoner came to the prosecutor's house, they all walked to and fro a number of times; I was on the opposite side of the road, watching them. Two of them went up to the prosecutor's door, and the other three to the window; the one with the prisoner, who made his escape, he was a great deal younger than the prisoner; he accompanied the prisoner to the door, and took off the gingham, and the prisoner received it in his apron: the other then ran off; and the prisoner when he had delivered it into his apron; he made off also; I followed him; I crossed the street instantly, and caught hold of the prisoner's collar; he threw down the piece of gingham into the street, out of his apron; I secured him; I had a good deal of trouble before I secured him. I left the prisoner in the custody of a gentleman at a stocking shop, and went, and picked up the piece of gingham out of the street, where the prisoner threw it down. I took the prisoner and the goods to Mr. Todd, he said, it was his.</p>

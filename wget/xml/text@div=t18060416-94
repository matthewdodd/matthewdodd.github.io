Three pound in notes and fifteen shillings in silver, there was a dollar among the silver, I put them in a red Morocco purse, I went to the King of Prussia to drink along with a friend in Wych-street; we parted at the door; when we come out I looked over my shoulder, and I observed the prisoner behind us; when I returned to go home the prisoner tapped me on the shoulder, she said, John, I have not seen you for some time.</p>

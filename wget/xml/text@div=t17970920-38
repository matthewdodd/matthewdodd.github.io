               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her to induce her to tell you she had taken them? - A. No; she said she had taken them out of the room for distress, and I should have them the next day if I would wait till then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No; it was entirely a voluntary confession; the constable found some duplicates upon her which produced the sheets and the flat iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her? - A. No; I was very busy and could not go till after she had come in, and then I thought I would make trial of her; for they seldom send where they get a bad character.</p>

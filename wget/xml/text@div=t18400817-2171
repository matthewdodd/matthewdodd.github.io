                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Woodley, he resides at Wal<lb></lb>thamstow. The prisoner came into my service in July as housemaid, and in a fortnight I gave her a fortnight's notice to quit—she then remained one week more—on the 3rd of August I missed a pair of mittens from my drawing-room—I spoke to her about them—she said she had not seen them—I found fault with her on account of the linen being left out at a late hour—she said she would leave immediately, and get away from such an old <hi rend="italic">devil</hi> as I was—I wished her not to leave till her master came home, but she wished to go, and I consented—she then said, "Here are my keys, if you like to look into my box"—I went up stairs—she then seated herself on her box, and said I should not open it—I saw her open it—she raised some things on the top, and took some articles out, but I could not see what—some she put into her bosom, some into her sleeve, and some into her pocket—Mr. Woodley afterwards came home, and the police<lb></lb>man was sent for—he and another servant searched her—I saw my mittens in her hand, and my pillow-case I took partly from under her dress, as it was dropping down—this cambric handkerchief was in her pocket, which had fallen off, and this purse—I think my mittens were in her sleeve first, hot I saw them in her hand.</p>

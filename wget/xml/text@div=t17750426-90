I put the draughts in the drawer, he went out soon after, the same day he sent a letter by the penny-post, which in a manner acknowledges the fact, it acknowledges having done something wrong and promises to repay the money with interest, it appears to be put in by the post mark at about twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>I received this in the afternoon, the 16th of March, 1775, and finding that it was put in the post, in Leaden-hall Street, we enquired about the inns where the letter was put in, whether any such man had set out for the sea-coast, and found he had gone the Essex road, from the Bull in White-chapel.

            . I keep the Sacacen's Head at Dunmowe. On the 16th of March; the prisoner came to my house in a chaise and four, and wanted to change horses and chaise, he said, he was going to Holland in search of a sister that had been lost. His behaviour was such, as gave me a suspicion he had robbed somebody. I did not care to stop him rashly upon my own suspicion, but let him have four horses, and consulted with somebody; they agreed it was proper he should be stopped. I went afterwards and stopped him at an Inn at in Braintree, in the road to Harwich. When we took him, after some discourse, he confessed what he had done, and gave up to me, for the use of his master, three hundred gunieas, and then thirty-four more: soon after this, Sir

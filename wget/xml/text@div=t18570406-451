                  </hi>. I live at Voluntary Place, Wanstead. I was on Ludgate Hill on Monday afternoon, 16th March, with two friends, looking in at a shop window—one of my friends said something, and I missed my purse; I saw the prisoner standing by my side, with my purse in his hand—I took hold of him, and asked him to give up my purse—he said he had not got it—I said, "If you have not got it, you have thrown it away—I told my friend to call a policeman, and the prisoner was taken into custody—the prisoner said he had not got it in his hand or in his pocket—he spoke English—there was in my purse a half sovereign, a florin, nine shillings, two sixpences, two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and one 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I saw it again at the police station; a policeman showed it to me—I had had it safe about a quarter of an hour before.</p>

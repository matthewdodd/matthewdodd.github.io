                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. John Hunt who keeps a shop in Bishopsgate-street—on 2d April, the prisoner and a younger woman came to the shop—they went into the show-room during my absence down stairs—I went into the show-room and they appeared very much confused, and the prisoner was stooping down as if she was putting something under her dress—she asked to look at some cheap frocks—I asked what kind, and</p>

               <p>they could not tell me what they wanted—I saw a white cloak under the prisoner's shawl—I could just see the white lining—I made no observation—she then told me she wanted to pay some money off a dress that she had had laid by on the previous Friday—there had been a dress kept for them—they had been there on the Thursday or Friday—it is a usual thing to pay money on things that are kept, but not with us—I went to a little glass case and the prisoner dropped the cloak and trod on it—I picked it up and looked her in the face, and said, "What is this?" she said, "I must have dragged it off the chair;" but there were not any cloaks on the chair—after they were gone I missed two cloaks—I went down with the prisoner and the other, and she gave me half-a-crown to take 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more off what was left—when the prisoner came down she was holding her clothes up close to her, as if she was holding something—on the following Monday I missed two other cloaks—these cloaks are my master's property.</p>

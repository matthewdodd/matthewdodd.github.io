               <p>This man came in for a pint of ale; he offered bad money; I told him I could not take it of him; he went away without paying for it; and I went after him, and in a little time he dropped the curtain rod from under his coat; we could find nothing on him, but that he had no curtains about him, nothing but the rod; there was a woman with him, she conveyed away the curtains first, and he stayed behind; the woman and he came into the public house together; and I served them; they stayed in about an hour; the woman went first about five minutes before the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You found these rods on the man; did you ever find any thing on the woman? - No, she went away, we never saw the curtains any more, they were hung up at the water closet; the rod was fixed at one end, and screwed at the other end.</p>

            When had you last seen the curtain safe? - I had seen it just before the man and woman came in, and all right, and as soon as the man had left it, when he went away, it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that water closet from the room where these people were? - It is in the same room, it is a water closet made in one corner for gentlemen to go to; they were sitting in the room the whole time; it is a parlour for gentlemen to go in.</p>
               <p>Q. But there is some separation between this parlour and the water closet? - No, only the parting of the rod and curtains to keep the place from people seeing of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Ask if he did not see the woman take the curtain and give me the rod? - I did not; I found the rod on him; he dropped it, and ran away; I took him and held him till I sent for a constable.</p>

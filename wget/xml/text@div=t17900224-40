               <p>I had the care of eighty-seven sheep from Paddington to Smithfield-market: in St. Giles's there was two hackney coachmen coming along; and I saw the prisoner as they stopped, lay hold of the sheep, and pull the sheep out of the drove, on the 25th of January, Monday morning about two o'clock: I did not know the person of the prisoner before this time; he was on the same side as I was, standing up to let the coach go by; he pulled the sheep out of the road, and pulled it up the street; I followed him up the street some distance; I crossed the way before him, and met him, and asked him where he was going to drive that sheep.</p>
               <p>Were there any other people about? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he not observe you this time? - He might; he told me he was going to take it home; I asked him to let it go, and he would not; he would insist on taking it away home: I called the watch for some time, and none came; the watch at last came from the end of Monmouth-street; I gave charge of the prisoner, and they took him to the watch-house; he had then the sheep in his hand: I never saw the man before as I know of: it was a ewe sheep; the value of it is seven or eight and thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Had he parted with the sheep when the watchman came? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he go quietly with him? - Yes.</p>

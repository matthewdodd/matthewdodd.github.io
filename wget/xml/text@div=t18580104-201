                  </hi>. I live at No. 90, Fetter Lane, and am commission agent for Mr. William Simpson, of Birmingham. From a communication I received on 26th or 27th Sept., I called at Union Wharf, Limehouse, and saw a clerk who is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, from whom, on a second visit, I received this letter—I went again, five or six days afterwards, and saw the clerk again—(I was the person who spoke to Devoll before the policeman did; that was in Albany Street, Regent's Park, about four weeks ago—I said, "I believe your name is Devoll".—he said, "No; I am a stranger from the country, my name is Jones"—after I had given him in charge at Poplar Station, I said to him on the road to Harbour Square, "The clerk you had at the wharf was a very sharp fellow"—he said, "He was; it was no use engaging a fool"—I said, "He did very well the business that you engaged him to do"—he said, "He did, and I paid him very well for it; and all that he did, he did by my direction"—on 27th Sept. I called at the wharf, pre<lb></lb>sented my card to the clerk, and informed him that I was led to believe that Mr. Devoll wished to order some fenders, and I had called to submit my prices and patterns to him—he said that Mr. Devoll was not there, but expressed his own willingness to look over them; he did so, and said he approved of them, and that other parties had submitted their patterns to Mr. Devoll—one or two fenders were lying there, which he pointed to—we are fender manufacturers—he said that as far as he was concerned he preferred mine, and should use his influence to induce Mr. Devoll to take mine—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185801040048"></xptr>
               <p>said that they were for shipping, and that if I would call the next day but one, the 30th, I should see Mr. Devoll at 12 o'clock—when I called on the 30th, at a few minutes before twelve o'clock, he said that Mr. Devoll had important business at Sudbury, which rendered it necessary for him to leave by train, but had instructed him to give me this order—(<hi rend="italic">This was for twelve dozen bronze and black fenders; six dozen ditto spear foots; six dozen ditto bright round ends; and three dozen ditto 4ft. to 4ft. 6in.; signed, Henry Devoll</hi>)—he said that we must send him up the goods in a fortnight's time—Iobjected, that being such a short period, but he said that they were to be shipped for the Australian market in a vessel of Mr. Devoll's, one which was then loading, and would be ready to sail a few days after that period, and we must execute the order in that time, or he would give it to some one else—I under<lb></lb>took to do so—there were eighteen or twenty tons of iron rails lying there—hepointed to them, and said that they were a lot which Mr. Devoll had bought; that he had sold them, and should supply their place as soon as they were removed—he mentioned that we must give him six month's credit with the fenders, to which I objected, and told him our terms were nett at a month—he said that six months' credit was usual in the iron trade—I said that it was not common—he said that he bought the iron which I then saw at six months' credit, and should supply its place on the same terms—I asked for one or two days longer to supply the goods, and stated that they should be there precisely on the day he mentioned—I went again, scarcely a week after, and saw the same person—I called to know whether the goods were to be packed in tin, or whether we should send them up in crates, as we usually do—he said we were to send them up in crates, as they had a packer themselves—I asked him how it would remunerate them to pay the freight on fenders to Sydney, they being bulky articles—he said that they had cases made expressly, which had three partitions, holding wire at one end, screws, or similar goods, at the other, and fenders and soft goods, such as hosiery, which would pack with the fenders, in the middle—on the receipt of this letter, dated 23d Oct., I went to the wharf and saw the clerk, and also a lad—I inquired whether the fenders had arrived—he said that nineteen crates had arrived, but five were deficient, and requested me to see after them, as the vessel would sail imme<lb></lb>diately, and it would be very inconvenient if the vessel sailed—en the morn<lb></lb>ing of 24th Oct., I received this letter, dated the 23d—I have seen the clerk write, and believe it to be his.</p>

               <p>He desired me to say you could draw on him, provided you can allow three per cent. off. Yours respectfully, <hi rend="italic">p.p.</hi> H. Devoll.")—I was not introduced to Bristow as one of the firm—I mentioned to him that I had called, not hearing from him as to the settlement, as he had promised to write to me—hesaid that he had written that letter, and was going to post it for me, and that if I called a little later in the day, I should find him there—this con<lb></lb>versation took place on the step of the door in the public house—I asked the clerk if he would take a glass of ale; he said, "Yes," and we went in, and ordered a glass of ale each, and inside stood Mr. Bristow, but I was not introduced to him, or told who he was—he spoke to the clerk, saying he would call again on Friday—the clerk said, "No, make it Saturday;" Bristow replied that Friday would suit him better, as he wanted the money: the clerk said, "Still make it Saturday;" upon which Bristow left, and the clerk and I left almost immediately, I saying that I would proceed to Poplar, and call at the wharf on my return—I did so, but did not find Devoll—some days afterwards I was going down to the wharf with Mr. Taylor, and at the bridge across the road at Stepney Station, in sight of the wharf, I met the clerk, Mr. Bristow, and another person, who I believe to be Devoll—they dispersed as quickly as they could on seeing Taylor and me—we were on our way to the wharf to take the prisoners into custody, in consequence of information which we had received—the clerk endeavoured to get into a urinal, but I waited for him, and then he said that he had to go up by the railway, and darted from me—I had not asked for a reference, but one wag tendered to me, Charles McKinnell and Co., No. 9, Great St. Helen's—there were two offices there in the name of Charles McKinnell and Co., late Alfred Gibson and Co,—Iwas satisfied with the reference I got there, hearing a good account of them, and the goods were sent—they said that they had had several transac<lb></lb>tions which had always been settled satisfactorily, and inquired if the amount was large—I said about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they said that we were perfectly safe in doing that—I went to Albany Street on 16th Dec., with the policeman Sheridan.</p>

                  </hi>. I have an office in Laurence Pountney Hill, and am agent to Paul Moore, a wire drawer of Birmingham—on 14th or 15th Sept. I received a letter at my office, in consequence of which I went on 15th Sept. to Union Wharf, Narrow Street, Limehouse; I saw a person who represented himself as Mr. Devoll's managing clerk, and who went by the name of <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>—Ishowed him this letter, and he said, "We sent you this"—(<hi rend="italic">This was a request to be informed of the price of brass and copper wire, and the discount for prompt payment, signed, Henry Devoll</hi>)—I gave him a printed list of brass and copper wire, which he said he would show Mr. Devoll, who was out—hesaid that Mr. Devoll was a merchant, that he came there of a morning and saw his letters, and arranged his business, was out all day in the city, and came back again and wrote his letters—I said that I should very much like to see him, and if he would write to me I would keep any appointment he chose to make, either at his office or mine; and that I could recommend a certain quality of wire, which I pointed out, very highly; I showed him patterns of it, and left—a day or two after I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and I wrote saying that I would call on Friday, the 18th—when I went, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> acknowledged having written the letter, and said he was very sorry that Mr. Devoll had been obliged to go out, but that he had left me an order for seventeen bundles of iron wire if they could be delivered on Saturday, as they formed part of an order which they had to send to Canterbury that day, by barge—I said that it was a very short time, but I would write down specially about it, and it ought to be there on Monday at the latest—I then took the order, and left—I said that I hoped we should do business together, and repeated my desire to see Mr. Devoll; he said that he was very sorry he was out, but no doubt he would write to me and make an appointment—on 24th Sept. I received another letter acknowledging the receipt, and about 14th or 15th Oct. I received another letter in reply—I called again on 30th Oct. to get the money for the seventeen bundles; I saw <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> again, and he told me that Mr. Devoll was on his eastern and north-eastern journey, and he was very sorry he had not got money enough in the petty cash or else he would pay me—on Thursday, 5th Nov., I called again for the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said that Mr. Devoll had stopped at Sudbury on his way back, that he had written to him there, and that he would certainly be in town on Monday—I had not on 24th Oct. received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but I had received information from Paul Moore, &amp; Co. of it, and it was afterwards forwarded to me—I never received my money.</p>

Bird and Co.—it was some time in Aug. last—he said that he wanted it for hay, straw, and corn for sale, as he thought it would be very useful for that purpose—I reported what he said to my employers, who sent me again to him, and he said that he would give 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the wharf—Bristow then came to our office—I saw him there, but did not see him go before Mr. Bird or Mr. Bevan—I never saw Bristow after the wharf was let to him—I took this agreement from Bird and Co. to Ellison and Son, Fenchurch Street, and then to the Crown coffee house, and gave it to Bristow's son, at the place where I had seen Bristow—I never saw it after that till now—I saw it signed, there were two signatures—I cannot say whether Bristow's signature was upon it at the time I took it to the Crown coffee house—there was some iron on the wharf belonging to Messrs. Bird and Co., value about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was taken away last Saturday, when I was there—I never had any conversa<lb></lb>tion with Bristow about the rails.</p>

Bird and Co., in the state it is now, except these pencil marks—it was signed, but I do not know anything about the signature—I saw Bristow in White Cross Street Prison, on 20th Nov., and asked him to pay the rest of the premises—hesaid that there was no rent due from him—I asked him to give up the wharf; he refused to do so, unless we gave him a sum of money—he said that he had distrained on the iron rails for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for fourteen weeks' rent, at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, due from Messrs. Bird and Co. to him—I told him I understood that could not be so, as the rails were allowed to remain by his permission, when he took the wharf—he said that he did allow them to remain there for a short time; but the understanding was that they were to be taken away soon after he took the wharf, and that I could not suppose he was to allow the rails to remain there fourteen weeks without some rent, and he had been put to some expense by moving them about from time to time—I was anxious to get the wharf, and asked him what he would take to give up the wharf, together with the iron rails; and ultimately he said that he would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I would see Messrs. Bird about it—after seeing them I saw him again, and agreed to pay him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I produced this bill to him, and asked him for the duplicate of it, and produced this paper to him—he cancelled it, and signed this receipt for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the document admitting the iron rails on the premises to belong</p>

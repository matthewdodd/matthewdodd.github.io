               <p>This fork was missed about two, on Thursday morning, the 2d of June; it is marked with L. M. in a cypher at top, a four-prong fork; on the Wednesday night I put it into the closet myself, and locked the closet-door; the next day the fork was gone, I am sure of it; here is another the same, we have only these two.</p>

               <p>Last Wednesday week, at night, Miss brought the knife-box down as usual, and this fork was in it; I put it into a kettle of water, and after washing my dishes put it into the kettle, it went into the sink; one end went in, and I was trying to get it out; it bent, and bent it so that I strove to straighten it, and it broke, and that is the truth; I would have wished to have made it good, and my mistress had hired a cook; then I told her I could not stay; I had a scald in the house, and came out to help her, I never robbed her; I meant to have made the fork good when she paid me my wages; I had all my witnesses here till nine at night, I did not think my trial would come on; I am a poor widow woman with three children.</p>

            . I am a slopseller, and live at Aldgate. On the <rs id="t18250217-29-cd175" type="crimeDate">1st of February</rs>

They had scarcely passed me an instant, when I heard an exclamation of terror or agony. I turned round and observed the stage driven by the prisoner stop short, and the deceased, (who was a <rs id="t18250217-29-viclabel178" type="occupation">watchman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18250217-29-victim244 t18250217-29-viclabel178"></join>,) laid on the ground about three yards behind it. The prisoner must have used much exertion to have stopped so short. I went up, and in answer to a question how he came to run over the man, he said he had used every exertion in his power to avoid it. The deceased was taken to the watchhouse, and the prisoner taken into custody. He did not attempt to go on. The deceased appeared in the act of crossing from the Minories to the watchhouse, which is opposite.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK - Q. This was a two horse coach? A. Yes; two Blackwall stages. It is not a time when many people cross the street. I saw a lad there, but did not hear him hail the coach.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch. I was at the watchhouse door, and heard the rattling of stages. Two passed rapidly by the watchhouse. I saw the deceased fall before the coach nearest to the curb. The hind wheel went over him. I ran to the spot and found it was one of our watchmen, named John Coe. I had him taken to the watchhouse, and took the prisoner in charge. He stopped as soon as he possibly could. Mr. Wiskard, the surgeon, was sent for; he came directly. Coe was sent home in a coach, and died on the Monday following. He fell about five feet from the curb. Both stages were going at a rapid rate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. - Q. He pulled up directly? A. Yes. I did not see the horse galloping - they were going fast. It was certainly not done wilfully. The deceased was above seventy years old. The prisoner offered to take him home, and expressed his sorrow.</p>

            . I was coming up the Minories close behind the deceased - when I came to the top of the Minories I saw two coaches driving very fast, and the deceased crossing the road within a few yards of the curb, the pole of the prisoner's coach knocked him down, and ran over him. I ran across. The coach immediately stopped. I fetched an officer from the watchhouse, which is close by. Taylor took the prisoner. He said he understood he had driven over the man, and was sorry for it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased at the watchhouse about 9 o'clock. His scalp was wounded, and he complained of being bruised about the body. I had him taken home, examined him, and found his ribs and his collar bone fractured. He died on the Monday following. I opened his body, the ribs were fractured, and some of them perforated his left lung. He died from that injury I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Some person hailed me as I passed the Minories, I turned my head before I saw the man, and could not pull up before I did.</p>

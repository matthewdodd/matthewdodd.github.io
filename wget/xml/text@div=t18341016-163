               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever state with respect to your insurance and the fires any thing contrary to what you have stated to-night? A. Nothing - I did not on the last trial state different to what I have to-night - the prisoner has never produced, or offered to produce, Mr. Alexander, the executor, to me - I never should have parted with a shilling, except on the authority of that paper - he never produced the will to me - the magistrate offered to admit the prisoner to bail - he has given seven or eight notices of bail - they have been examined and rejected.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This transaction took place on the 27th of June? A. Yes; at the Bank Coffee-house, opposite the Bank of England, between twelve and two o'clock - I paid the 25l. at that time - I went to make inquiry of Robson, No. 6, Bank-buildings, before I paid the money - my inquiries were respecting the bill, and respectability of Alexander - the prisoner told me the bill was given him by Alexander before I went to make the inquiry - I paid him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160075"></xptr>the money more on account of the document than the inquiries - my inquiries related to the document.</p>

W.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe you have known me some years? A. As coming in and out of the prison; prisoners have made complaints of you, as well as others - I never knew the prisoner to transact business for Alexander - he knew he was imprisoned for debt.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBSON re-examined. I have been to Doctors'-commons, and made inquiry if there is any such person as Alexander, executor to Mrs. Bradshaw - I searched the books, but could find no such will as Bradshaw's, nor executor as Alexander.</p>

It is a painful duty to address you, not only because I have never been in the habit of speaking in public, but because I have to contend against the evidence of a man not worthy of credit. I will state the real facts, and on the evidence I will produce, leave you fully convinced that Millingen is not worthy of credit - he has said I owed him 25l., and how the 25l. originated - he says the debt never was paid - but I know it was paid in the beginning of last year - when this bill was put in his hands, I was not in his debt - I gave it to him, explaining that it was an accommodation bill - I admit that I had the money, and he sold me a gold watch as part of the consideration, for which he charged me fifteen guineas, deducting the remainder as discount - he never applied to me for payment of the bill when dishonoured - he never let me know it, but apprehended me on a charge of stealing the watch - I was tried here last Sessions, and the Jury, without the slightest consideration, acquitted me - in order to keep me in prison, he preferred an indictment for fraud - I have not, to my knowledge, given more than one notice of bail, and he went to those persons and so alarmed them, that they never came forward, though he says they were all examined and rejected - he explained the serious consequences of becoming bail for any person in Newgate - I do not know that it is necessary for me to say much - you are not to be led away by any thing I or counsel can say - respecting the memorandum, I acknowledge it is my writing, but certainly it was not given to him at the time the bill was discounted, nor till three days afterwards, when he met me at the Royal Exchange, and asked me for it, stating the purpose for which he wished it, and that it should never prejudice me - he did not discount the bill on any representation of mine - he knew that it was an accommodation bill, and for what purpose I wanted money - he was from the 18th till the 27th of June satisfying himself of the statement I made before he parted with the money, and it was nothing but the extraordinary discount, the great benefit he expected to derive, that made him do it - he is a discounter of bills - I will prove he offered to compromise the charge for 45l. last week - 25l. to be paid down, and security for the rest in twelve months - I believe he made the proposition to a witness, in consequence of her going to him to know if he intended to prosecute me, and the dangerous illness of the whole of my six infant children - he then said he did not wish to prosecute if the matter could be compromised - he offered his own terms, and told the witness to go to his house in the evening, at Hackney, and it might be settled - when it was told to me, I rejected it - I preferred going before a Jury and taking their acquittal, or be found guilty there, as without going into the world honourably acquitted, I may as well be transported.</p>

I have known Mr. Millingen some years - my first transaction with him was a very few months before his first bankruptcy, thirteen or fourteen years ago, or I should suppose nearly twenty - he was indebted to me very largely - I indicted him for a conspiracy- I think him a person not worthy of credit on his oath.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you and he are on bad terms? A. Certainly we are; five Juries have decided that he is guilty of corrupt perjury and conspiracy - a rule nisi for a new trial has been granted, but not argued.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The one case does not apply to the five Juries? A. No.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. I saw Mr. Millingen last Tuesday - he told me he would settle the prosecution for 45l. - he said he would not appear against him for the sum of 45l., half money and half in security for twelve months; my own security and my brother's, or any body's, not the prisoner's - I had no authority<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160076"></xptr>from the prisoner to originate such a proposition - I did it from a wish to prevent his being prosecuted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You made the proposition to him not to appear? A. I did; I proposed to him to know what he would settle it for, and, after some hesitation, he proposed to settle it for 45l. - I told him I would consult with my brother, and know what he would assist me in - I was to let him know that evening at his house at Hackney, at half-past eight, either in Well-street or Hackney-terrace, I think it was - I met him at the Bank Coffee-house, and from there walked with him into the Exchange - the conversation took place on 'Change, in the middle of the day- I saw the prisoner next day - I did not see Mr. Millengen after seeing him.(

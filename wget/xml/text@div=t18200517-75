            . I am clerk to Messrs. Pearce and Son, Surry-street, Bedford. On Tuesday, the 9th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the horse at New Close. I knew it before. I have seen it in town since, and am sure it is the same. I do not remember having ever seen the prisoner. I missed the horse on Wednesday morning, about seven o'clock. I was in the habit of going there morning and evening, as my pony was in the same close. I found the gate taken off its hinges. I looked round to see if the horse had got out at any gap, but could not perceive it had. Bedford is fifty miles from town.</p>

            . I live at No. 178, Church-street, Bethnal-green. I have the horse now in my possession. I bought it of the prisoner, Sinfield, on the 10th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon - it was tired, and very lame - it appeared to have come off a journey. I asked where he brought it from - he said from Newton, in Buckinghamshire, and that he bought it a little after Christmas; he asked seven guineas for it - I was to give him 4 l. 15 s. I asked him several times where he brought it from - he told me so many different stories, therefore I suspected him, and did not pay him. He said his name was

I asked him to refer me to somebody in town who knew him - he said he was going to Chequer-alley, Bunhill-row, for some things his father had left there. I asked him to take me there, he said he could not, as he was in a hurry to go into the Borough. I said I would not pay him unless he went with me to Worship-street Office - he went willingly. When he got there I mentioned the circumstance to Garton and Armstrong - they detained him. The prosecutor and Reeve have seen the horse.</p>

            , that he came from Newton, and he bought the horse at Leighton, in Buckinghamshire, about Christmas. I asked him whom he bought it of - he said he did not know the man. I then went and made enquiry in Twister's-alley, returned to him, and said your name is Sinfield, he said, it is. I then asked how many weeks it was since he bought it - he said he hardly knew. I said was it two, three, or four; he said</p>
               <p>"It is five weeks ago, and the man's name was Coster that I bought it of, and I gave him 5 l. for it; I do not know where he lives." I detained him, and advertized the horse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury - I have been completely brought into his most serious charge by my inexperience and ignorance; I was bred in Layton, in Bedfordshire, and at the age of fifteen was with my uncle, working at his business, until he was obliged to give it up. I was determined to come to London for work, and when I was within ten miles of town I saw the horse standing at the door of a public-house, and whilst I was looking at him the owner, as I supposed, came out and asked if I would purchase him? I enquired the price, and was informed it was 5 l. Thinking that it would not only help me on the road, but likewise I should make something by him on my arrival in London, I bought it. In Church-street, Bishops-gate, a person asked me if it was for sale, I answered it was, and then agreed about price, &amp;c.; he then questioned me, and asked me to go to Worship-street to receive the money, which I did, without any hesitation, believing he was actually going to pay me the money in lieu of which I found he had brought me to the office, under the consideration of my having stolen the horse.</p>

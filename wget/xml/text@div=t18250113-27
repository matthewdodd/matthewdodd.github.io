The prisoner was in my employ, and entrusted to receive money due to me; on the 2d of October, Mr. Watkins, of No. 6, Queen-street, Haymarket, was indebted to me to the amount of 2 l. 5 s. 8 d. - I asked the prisoner if he had received any money from them - he said they would pay in a short time, but they had not paid him any then; he left me on the 12th of October; he ought to have accounted to me for the money, as he received it - I applied to Mr. Watkins, after he had left, for the 2 l. 5 s. 8 d., and he disputed that amount; the prisoner was apprehended some time after - I told him Mr. Watkins said, that he owed me nothing; he could not deny it, because I had the bills and his own receipts - they are in his hand-writing; these are receipts for about 34 s. or 35 s.; he left me without notice, but on the day before he left me. I told him he must leave me in three or four weeks.</p>

On 2d July, I was in the Broad Sanctuary, with In<lb></lb>spector Brannan, Fyfe, Elliott, and Shore, and saw the prisoners at the corner of Tothill-street—they stood there about seven or ten minutes, and Flynn left them, and went up Dean-street—he was absent seven or ten minutes—he returned down the same street and joined them—after a short time, they went up Victoria-street—I gave the officers directions—they ran round Princes-street, and through Storey's-gate—I was afraid to get in sight, because Flynn knew me very well; but I think they went down to the Broadway—I saw them cross the road to the second lodge in the Park, near Queen-square—when I came up, the other officers had taken the prisoners, and Inspector Brannan handed me this packet—I opened ft, and saw that it contained counterfeit coin—I said, "I have received instructions from the solicitor to the Mint to look after you, Flynn" (but I called him by his proper name, not Flynn), "as a dealer in counterfeit coin"—he said, "I have just picked them up here"—he was then inside the inclosure of the park—they were taken to the station—Flynn was searched by Brannan, and he produced from his pocket another half-crown—I have here two half-crowns and six crowns.</p>

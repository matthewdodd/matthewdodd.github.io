               <p>Is not Mrs. Hall partner with him? - Yes, I saw the hats hanging on a nail close to the window, I had them to finish.</p>
               <p>Was the window open? - Yes, I missed them directly, I saw something whisk over the window, and I saw the hats bulk out under his jacket.</p>
               <p>Under whose jacket? - Under the prisoner's jacket: I saw him close to the window, I called stop thief, and he ran up the next lane, and a man stopped him, I do not know who it was.</p>
               <p>How near was the prisoner to you? - Close to the window.</p>
               <p>Did you see his face? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how can you swear that is the man? - I am sure.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080060"></xptr>Why? - Because there was nobody else nigh.</p>
               <p>If you did not see his face, how can you swear that was the man? - I saw him immediately before he passed the shutters.</p>

               <p>Was you present when the prisoner was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was found upon him? - Nothing, he threw the hats away before he was taken, I saw him throw them away when he was half way up the lane.</p>
               <p>Was he out of your sight? - No.</p>
               <p>How far might it be before you took him? - About ten yards, I took him immediately, I was close by the hats when they were picked up; the hats are here; I do not know who picked them up and gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Gates. I produce the hats, I had them from Mr. Hall.</p>

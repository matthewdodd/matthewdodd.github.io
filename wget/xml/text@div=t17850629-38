            , with intent to buy a pair of shoes of him, went to Mr. Oliver, No. 10, St. Clement's-lane; and was recommended by him to a friend of his in Field-lane, Holborn; returning home, I found three mahogany backs of chairs, between Fetter-lane, and Chancery-lane: I then in consequence thereof, went to Mr. Oliver's and acquainted him therewith, he agreed they should remain there, in expectation of their being advertised; after waiting eight or nine days, and not being advertised, I thought it would be proper to advertize them, in order to find the owner, the intended advertisement I accordingly drew up, as follows, viz.</p>
               <p>"To all master mahogany chair-makers,</p>
               <p>"who have lost any chair backs, wholly</p>
               <p>"framed and glazed, the back legs not</p>
               <p>"finished carving, may see them at No.</p>
               <p>"10, the corner of Plough-court, St. Clement's-lane,</p>
               <p>"and proving their property</p>
               <p>"therein, may have them again, on paying</p>
               <p>"the expences, &amp;c . - They were</p>
               <p>"found between Fetter-lane, and Chancery-lane,</p>
               <p>"Holborn.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of May, I had the intended advertisement ready, and meant then to have delivered it to the printer, but unluckily on that day fell, by treading on a piece of orange peal, on stone steps, and broke three of my ribs, and on the 11th was carried to the Westminster Infirmary, being in inexpressible agony, soon after after which I sent to Mr. Oliver, who came two or three times to see me, and the last time of his coming compelled me to go with him before a Magistrate (Justice Girdler) concerning the said chair backs - Then and there to my surprise, I found that Mr. Oliver had been endeavouring to sell them unknown to me. - So that by his misconduct, I was sent to New Prison, innocent I am of any crime respecting this affair, as the child unborn. - The above misfortune prevented me from publishing the intended advertisement, which I produced to the constable. - I was very unfit to be moved from the hospital to New Prison; the removal caused me to be confined to my bed three weeks; notwithstanding the care and skill of the doctor, and the indulgence and kindness of the wardsman; to whom I render my sincere thanks.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290043"></xptr>Court to Oliver. Did the prisoner tell you how he found them, or how he came by them? - He did not, if he did I being deaf, I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Were they left with you on account of the debt that was due to you? - No, by no means in the world, they were only left in my house till he called for them.</p>
               <p>How came you to sell them? - Being distressed for money, and to pay myself what he owed me.</p>
               <p>Then you had no authority from him to do that? - No, I never heard any more of him.</p>
               <p>When did you receive the chairs? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How many days did you keep them before you carried them to Rockhead ? - I kept them near a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did you get them in the morning or evening? - About six in the evening.</p>

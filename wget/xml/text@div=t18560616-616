In May, 1855, I was in partnership with Mr. Kitcher as sugar agent, at No. 1, Mincing-lane—on 16th May the defendant came, and I sold him two half tons of refined sugar, for cash—(I had told him that we never gave credit when he first applied, about six weeks before)—on Thursday evening he called for the delivery orders, and gave me this crossed cheque on the Borough branch of the Royal British Bonk, for 471.—I gave him the delivery orders for the two separate half tons, and told him I did not like crossed cheques by town buyers, but I took it—it was afterwards returned to me dishonoured—I should not Have parted with the sugar an any other terms than cash—it came to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he asked me what he should draw it for, and I told him 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to the city. On Thursday night, the 6th of January, going round on my duty, between the hours of seven and eight, I was in Lad-lane, I observed the prisoner with a smock frock on in Lad-lane, I observed something to bulge out at the side under it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking? - Walking; I stopped him and asked him what he had got? and he immediately took out this loaf of sugar from under his frock; I then asked him how he came by it; he said, he was a porter at Mr. Davis's and Newman's, in Fenchurch-street; I then searched him and perceived when I put my hands into his pocket; I said, my friend, I shall take you to the Castle, the corner of King-street, and search you; he said, I will go with you; he went with me very quietly, and then when we came to the Castle, I took one of these parcels of sugar from his pocket, and the other he gave me from his pocket; I then searched him farther and underneath his smock frock and waistcoat, in his breeches, I took this quantity of sugar, it contains moist sugar in two bags; I then searched him further, and in one of his jacket pockets I found fifteen nutmegs; I then went to Mr. Davis's and Newman's, in Fenchurch-street, and went to the counting house and did not hear that he belonged to that house, and there they went with me to Mr. Bennett's, where I found he was a servant.</p>
               <p>- GARDINER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with Mr. Jostling at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him when he stopped the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what Mr. Jostling has said on that subject? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was present all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Jostling stopped him did you see the prisoner produce any thing from his smock frock? - He produced this loaf of sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say where he came from or whom he lived with? - He said, he lived with Davis and Newman, in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got to the Castle did you see those other articles produced? - Yes, just in the same manner as Jostling says.</p>

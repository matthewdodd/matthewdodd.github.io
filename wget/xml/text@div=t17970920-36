             sworn. - I went to the prisoner Holden's house, in George-court, Fleet-market, on the 11th of September last, between one and two o'clock, by order of the Magistrate of Worship-street, to buy some sixpences; when I went in, I saw both the prisoners, I asked Holden for some sixpences; he took four out of a paper,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200043"></xptr>and gave them to me; I asked him the price of them; he said, three pence halfpenny a piece; I gave him one shilling and six-pence, and he gave me four pence in change, (produces the four sixpences); I have had them ever since; on Tuesday morning, the 12th, I went again by the direction of the Magistrate, between eight and nine o'clock, Jane Raftey was in bed then; and on the Wednesday morning, I went again, the officers went with me as far as Fleet-market; I saw that some of the pannels of the door were split, and I knocked at the door; they asked who was there; I said, a friend; Jane Raftey let me in, Holden was in bed; she told me they had got no things, and so I came away, and told them I would call again in the evening; accordingly I did; I knocked at the door, and nobody answered; there was a light in the room, and just as I was coming away, Holden and Raftey, and another, came up the court, to go in doors, and I went in with them; they told me they had got nothing then; I believe it was her that said so, or both, I do not know; the officers were in Fleet-market, opposite the court, and when I had got in, they went in.</p>

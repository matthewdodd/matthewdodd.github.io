The butler came to my assistance and released me from the prisoner; he was then secured, and the bag examined; it contained eight forks, ten spoons, half a dozen desert spoons, a silver fish-trowel, a sauce-spoon, two silver-handled knives, three butter-ladles silver, a silver soup-ladle, a silver butter-trowel, and a pair of silver asparagus-tongs; I have no idea of the value of them, I had seen them in the cupboard just before I went out for the water.</p>

               <p>I am butler to Mrs. Rowe: On Whitsunday morning, just after I had set these things on the board, I went to the next room to breakfast; I had not been there long before I heard a violent screech, I went to see what was the matter, and found the prisoner and my fellow-servant on the floor; I lifted the prisoner by his clothes, and asked what business he had there? He said let me go, I have got nothing; my fellow-servant as soon as he could speak said, I have got the rascal; and I saw the bag with the things at the side of the bedstead.</p>

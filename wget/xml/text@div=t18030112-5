               <p>THOMAS WHITEBREAD sworn. - I am a lighterman; I lost a sack containing four bushels of wheat, from the bow of the barge, about half past six in the evening of the 13th of December; we went on shore to get some beer, we were gone about a quarter of an hour, and when we came back, I saw a boat athwart the bow of the barge, and the prisoner and another were in it, the others got away; I found the sack in the boat; we immediately hauled the boat along side our craft with a hitcher, and they said directly, overboard with it, I suppose twenty times; the other man jumped over-board and swam away; the sack was thrown over-board, we got it up again afterwards, (produces the sack); it is my master's property; his name is John-Shepperd Killick; the sack contained four bushels of wheat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe maltsters, and persons dealing in corn, frequently lend their sacks? - A. Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was not the person who ran away? - A. No, he threw the sack over board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any body on board when you went ashore? - A. Yes, a lad.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether he gave any direction to the prisoner or the other man, you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I was at work with the last witness; when we returned, I saw a boat lying athwart the bow of our barge, I laid hold of it with the boat-hook; the barge laid off St. Catherine's stairs; as soon as I laid hold of it, they cried out, heave it overboard, which the prisoner immediately did; the other man jumped into the water, and swam away. I laid hold of the prisoner, and brought him into the barge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prisoner attempt to make his escape? - A. No; he wanted us to let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had a fare, a man desired me to row to that barge, which I did, and he took the sack into the boat; when this man came and pulled the boat back again, the man then jumped over board, and swam away; I could have done the same, if I had been guilty.</p>

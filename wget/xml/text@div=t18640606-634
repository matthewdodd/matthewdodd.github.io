I live at 2, Windsor-terrace, Sydenham—I shall be twelve years old on 8th July—I work for Mrs. Mary Ann Dean, a laundress—I take out the clothes—on 16th May I was sent to Mrs. Foster's to fetch some clothes, of Peak-hill, Sydenham—I had a wheelbarrow—before I went there I had received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mrs. Charlotte—I tied it up in a corner of a towel—I received at Mrs. Foster's 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put that in the same towel in another corner, and placed it inside on the clothes in the barrow—on going down Peak-hill the barrow turned over—the prisoner with a man was there—she said, "Shall I help you to take it up, my dear?" and she came over and helped me up with the barrow—I went down Peak-hill, the prisoner was walking by my side, and I was in front—they passed, and then I missed the towel—that was only two minutes after they lifted the barrow—they left me together—I went after them—I said to the prisoner, "Please have you picked up a towel with some money in it?" and she said, "No, my dear, I will go back to your mother"—she said she had not seen it—there was then another man on the other side of the road—I did not say anything to him; but a man coming down the road took something from the hedge close by where I had overtaken the prisoner; the towel I had missed—the money was gone—it belonged to Mrs. Dean.</p>

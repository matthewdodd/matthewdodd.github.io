                  </hi>. I live in Earl-street, Lisson-grove. On 3rd June, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Lisson-grove—the prisonercame up to me, caught hold of my person, put her hand into my pocket, andtook out sixpence—I had two sixpences and a shilling there, not a minutebefore—I asked her for it, and said it had got a hole in it—she said she hadnot got one, all the money she had was ninepence in halfpence—she abusedme—I called a policeman, and gave her in charge—I did not lay hold of her—she did not run away.</p>

I am wife of a policeman, and search females at thestation—as soon as I took off the prisoner's shawl and bonnet, she put twofingers into her mouth, to force some money down her throat—I called forassistance—Crouch came, put his hand on her throat, and she spit two sixpencesand a shilling into my hand—this sixpence is one of them.</p>

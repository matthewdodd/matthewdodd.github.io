In the morning about eight o'clock I got intelligence there were some thieves taken; I took pen and ink and penned the things down, and sent my wife with the paper to the Justice's; a watchman came and desired me to bring some of the fellow spoons; I carried three, and they were compared with what were found; there were no marks upon them, only the maker's mark: the Justices desired I would send for the man that made them; I fetched him; he said, he believed them to be the same spoons which I bought of him.</p>

            . I was the officer of the night. On the 29th of April, about a quarter past three in the morning, the prisoner Gibbs was brought into the watch-house; I ordered him to be searched; there were found upon him this pistol and knife, and three metal spoons, (produced in court.) The watchmen went out in pursuit of Rutherford, who had made his escape from them; another watchman brought in this parcel of wet things, (producing the things Mrs. Swanblow had mentioned to be lost from out of a plate in the window, deposed to by Mrs. Swanblow.) Rutherford was taken and brought in soon afterwards; I asked Gibbs how he came by them spoons, (I called them silver, thinking they were so then;) he said, a young woman gave him them about twelve months ago. I asked him about the pistol; he said he had it from a young man, an acquaintance of his.</p>
               <p>Abednego Lambeth. I am a watchman. At three o'clock that morning, we heard of several houses broke open; I and my brother watchmen went out, with an intent to take the persons concerned if we could; there came two men by the watch-house door, one after another; we pursued them along Ayliff street into Mansfield-street; we lost them and came back again, and by King

I lived along with a girl at Bristol; she came up to London with me, and was here about a month, and then went away; she left these three spoons with me; I having a value for her, put them in my pocket.

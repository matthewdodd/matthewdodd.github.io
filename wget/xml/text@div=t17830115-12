               <p>Court. Why, was it new? - Yes, quite new: about three o'clock on the day I lost it, Justice Walker sent to me to know whether I had lost a seat; the prisoner at the bar was taken, my foreman looked round the shop and missed this seat; I went to the Justice's at six in the evening, and saw it was my property.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it? - I know it by the cloth and the lace.</p>


               <p>You can swear it was your seat? - Yes, I had it in my hand about twelve, and it was taken about two.</p>
               <p>Who was it making for? - It was for a phaeton I had for my own use.</p>

               <p>Court. What was Crony? - He sells old rags and other things, he lives in Short's Gardens; I took him to my master, Mr. Mountain, he is a coach-master: the prisoner said he found it in Scotland yard on a dunghill.</p>

I am a cigar maker of 30, Albert Street, Shadwell—on 28th February, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I was going along; Cable Street, Whitechapel—three men met me—I think the prisoner is one of them—as soon as they met me they parted, one turned to my left, the other two kept on my right, and I felt one tear my coat open, and I felt a smash across my bead—I could not exactly say that the prisoner is that man but he is very much like him—I became senseless there and then and fell—I hallooed "Police!"at the time he struck me—I came to and some ladies gave me some water and bathed my head—I was taken to the hospital and was there four weeks—I felt two blows on my head and then remember no more—one of the men wore a cap.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Andrew Nairn, of 237, Cable Street—on the night of 28th February, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I heard a voice in broken English in the street say "You have stolen my watch," and he then called "Police!"and I heard three heavy blows—I went to my win<lb></lb>dow and looked out and saw the prosecutor lying on a grating on the oppo<lb></lb>site side of the road and a man was stooping over him, emptying his pockets and putting into his own whatever he took from him—I raised the window, and the man who was robbing stood up erect and looked at me, he had no hat on—he then ran, and as he ran he stooped and picked up a hat that was lying on the pavement and put it on, it was a large felt hat, a wide awake.—the prosecutor made a mistake in saying it was a high hat, it was a round hat: he speaks very bad English—I believe the prisoner to be the man that robbed him, although I could not swear to him—I picked him out of about twenty at the police-station that night or the next, and I feel confident in my own mind that he is the man; there was a lamp very close and it shone on his face as he stooped to pick up the hat and it is a face once seen not forgotten.</p>

               <p>on this night, about 11.30, I heard a cry and went to the window and saw two men knock the prosecutor up against the wall and one ran away, apparently as if he had taken the watch and chain—the other one stayed behind and gave him three violent blows on the head, he fell down and lay as if dead—I ran downstairs—he was lying insensible—the man ran away, and as he ran he picked up the prosecutor's hat—the prisoner very much represents the man that gave the blows.</p>

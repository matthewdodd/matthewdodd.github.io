Spreckley's—all I saw occurred before I went to prison—I went to Mr. Spreckley on 27th February—no one was present but the prisoner and myself on these occasions when Palmer brought the cloth—I never told Johnson I had my suspicious about what was going on—I did not ask him at any time for direct information—on the 20th February, after I came out of prison, I went to Bridport Place and found Johnson had left there—I was thinking of giving information at that time—I remained on good terms with him all the time—it was on the 23rd he told me not to let anyone know where he had removed to—he had told me there was an action threatened against him—I supposed he wished me to think it was in reference to the action.</p>

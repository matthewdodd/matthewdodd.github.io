                  </hi> I am a surgeon, at Bunhill-row. On 18th Feb., by the Coroner's direction, I opened the body of a person represented to be James Lyle—it was in an extreme state of emaciation, a perfect skeleton—there were several wounds on the back and loins, and wound on the left breast, and one on the left groin—I could not from an opinion of how they were</p>

               <p>occasioned—they were not sufficient of themselves to cause death—the heart, lungs, and liver were diseased—the stomach was comparatively healthy, and quite empty, except about two able spoonsful of gruel—the membrane cover<lb></lb>ing the bowels was extensively ulcerated—the bowels were diseased, and the liver denoted that he had been a drunkard—finding what I considered suff<lb></lb>cient to cause death, I went no further—it appeared to have arisen from inanition, probably from want of food; and it might be from drink as well—I cannot say, from the liver, how long he had been a drunkard—person in charge of the house was present.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You think the disease in the heart, liver, and bowels, may have produced death without external violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if there had been no disease, but simple want of nourishment, life would have been prolonged by what I found in the stomach—withholding of nourishment, could not have been the immediate cause of death—the bruises may have accelerated death, finding the body in that emaciated state, but they were of trivial importance.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 11, James-street, Islington. I knew James Lyle for nine or ten years—I have seen his dead body—he was a whiskey-mer<lb></lb>chant—I last saw him three weeks previous to his death, when he called and paid me a little money—he seemed somewhat declining in health then to what I had seen him—for the last year and half his business had been going to decay, and he had taken to drinking—he principally drank whiskey—he lived at 3, Upper Fountain-place—I resided with him there four or five years, and left last August—I know the prisoner, Thompson; three weeks previous to my leaving he was sent away from the Post-office, and he came and asked Mr. Lyle's permission to stop there; and he had not been there long before he brough the other two prisoners, his relations—they continued with Lyle down to the time of his death—I have been to the house twice since I left—I never had any conversation with Thompson about Lyle—in Oct. he called at my house, and he then had two black eyes and a bruised face—I supped at Lyle's one night after I left—I did not see Thompson, the nephew, John Spottiswood, was there, but Thompson was not allowed to come into the room, because he had not behaved well to his sister (<hi rend="italic">the female prisoner</hi>,) that day, and Mr. Lyle had locked the sister up in the whiskey-cellar—I met Thompson in Pitfield-street, on 14th Feb., the supposed day of the death—I said, "How is poor Mr. Lyle"—he said, "Very unwell"—I said, "Is it dangerous; does he keep his bed?"—he said, "No;" or I should have gone to him—when I got home at night, I heard that he was dead.</p>

                  </hi> I reside at Islington.

On the 19th of December, I saw the prisoner about half after twelve come up Holborn, and go round the corner of the linen draper's, by Gray's inn-lane; he sorted his money out; I saw him place some in one pocket and some into another; he had a good deal of silver about him; after that I watched him into Mr. Mackey's the ginger bread baker; I saw him take a bun at the widow, then he went into the shop to pay for it; I looked in at the window, he tendered Miss Mackey a shilling, with a mark on it; that I saw very plain; after he came out he went up Holborn; I went in and asked to see the shilling; I desired her to rub it on the stone; she did so, it was a bad one; I left the shilling with

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (read). My lord, and gentlemen of the jury. I am innocent of the charge of uttering in the way alledged to me; I never in my life wilfully passed a bad shilling, or any current coin of this realm. On the day mentioned in this indictment I purchased a ticket of a watch pawned in Holborn. I stood at the shop of my prosecutor, to separate and take out this duplicate from my money. I was rather weak in my person, having been lately discharged from the house of recovery, of the fever. I fancied one of the buns in the window, I asked the price of them, she said one penny; without my having any forethought that I had less change, I threw down one of the shillings that I had in my hand; I went in the shop and got the change; I had got change of a pound note of Mr. Nowland, a victualler, and the change he gave me was found on me when I was taken in custody. I have endeavoured to subpoena Mr. Nowland; therefore I hope you will take my case into consideration, and restore me to my liberty again.</p>

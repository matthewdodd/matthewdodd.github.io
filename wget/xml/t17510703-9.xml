I said, we had, two ducks and a drake, and that I should know them. They shew'd them to me dead, and I knew them to be mine. The prisoner was there, he said, he had been at Highgate, at the White Lyon, and lay there all night. He at first owned to me, before the Justice, he knock'd them down at one blow; then he said, he did it at three blows.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner come down the town on Thursday morning, at almost four o'clock, he came over against our house, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030005"></xptr> made a stop, and look'd about him, then he went over a gate into the Bull and Gate yard. I knowing he had no business there, after about ten minutes he came out, so I followed and overtook him near the Castle. He had got a wallet on his shoulder, I ask'd him what he had got in it, he said, victuals. Then Mr. Morgan call'd out of a window, and ask'd, what was the matter. He said, I had stop'd him. I said, I thought he had things about him that did not belong to him: then I took him back to the Bull and Gate, saying, if you are clear I will call for a pot of beer. When we came there he said, don't make a noise, I have got three ducks in my wallet, and I am a poor man. Then I took him to the constable, and heard Mrs. Bury describe them before we took them out of the wallet.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Highgate, and saw the ducks in the road, so I took up a stick and threw at them, and knock'd them down.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Bury. Where do you keep your ducks?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bury. We have a field they are in on days, and they come home on nights and are in the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the stable this night?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bury. I cannot say they were.</p>

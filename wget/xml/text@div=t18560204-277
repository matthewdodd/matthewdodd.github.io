                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Crawley. On Saturday night, 2nd Feb., between eight and nine o'clock, I was in a grocer's shop at Stratford, waiting to be served—I had a purse in my possession when I left Mr. Johnson's shop about four minutes before—I went from Mr. Johnson's to that shop—I did not see the prisoner; but while I stood in the shop I put my hand into my pocket to pay for what I asked for, and I missed my purse and money—I turned round to come out of the shop, and met Mrs. Taylor—she said, "Mistress, you are robbed"—I said, "Yes, of my purse and all my money"—I went out of the shop, and found the prisoner in the hands of Mr. Brown, the shopman, a few yards from the door—I got this purse from Mr. Turvey—it is mine, and it had all the money in it just as when I had it.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of an engraver, but I am a lithographer by profession—I have been in business forty years—on the 10th of April the prisoner was introduced to me by my daughter—he showed me a medal of the French Exhibition, and asked me if I could engrave that—I told him "Yes," and better than that—he then pulled out a bank note engine, turned at the back—it was partly folded, and he asked me if I could do that—I told him I could, and he then wanted some bank note engraving—I told him I was rather busy that morning, and would rather he called the next morning—he said he would, at 8 o'clock—I told him it would cost a great deal of money, which I did to frighten him away—he said, "I have got plenty of money, and do not care whether it is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after he left I put myself in communication with the police authorities, and the Prussian Consulate—when I got to the shop about half<lb></lb> past 9 the next morning, I found the prisoner waiting—I showed him some specimens, of bank note engraving, and he was satisfied with them—he did not ask what I was going to charge—he left this part of a note with me—he left me a sovereign as deposit, and I asked him in what name I should make the receipt out, and he said, "Mr. Love"—he showed me different thaler notes, and one of the value of 100 thalers—he said, "Do not you think this is very difficult to do"—I said, "I dare say we can manage it"—he said he should want a good many of the 100 thaler notes, and that I was to get the paper exactly like the note, with the water mark—he asked me if I had a private address—I said "Yes," and gave him my address at Hyde-street—he said he wanted the mark done in private, and he thought my shop was too public—I again placed myself in communication with the police—he called on me the next morning, and was with me till past 4 o'clock—he asked me if I could give him a book to read, as he would not go out all day—at this time I only had a quarter of the note in my possession, and I told him it was no use my doing part of the note, because I could not fix it together, and then he gave me the other part—this is the other portion (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was occupied in tracing the note that day—these are some of the tracings—he said that mine must be exactly like the original—the next day he came, and when I had done work he took up the note and folded it up—I said, "You cannot disturb that note; I have got my tracing on it"—he said he should take it with him—I said, "If you won't leave me the note I won't do any more to it," and then he left me the note—he said he was lodging at 42, Pratt-street, St. Pancras, and that he did not like being at my place, would I go to his?—I asked him whether I should ring or knock at the door—he said he should be at the door waiting for me—I met him next morning by appointment—I was there the whole of the day engaged in tracing—I think he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion—he wanted it to be done on steel plates, but I said copper for the back—I went the next day and took a lithographic stone with me—as for as I remember I did these words, "One hundred thalers," and some tracing on the back—he said I was to get the plates, and he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—next day, Sunday, he called at my private house, and I went with him to Hatton-garden to get some tools, and then to Pratt-street—I worked on the stone, I think, that day—he said I was late in the morning through coming such a distance, and that I was in consequence fatigued, and he had better have a place nearer</p>

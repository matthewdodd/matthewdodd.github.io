            's waggon. On Tuesday the 14th of March I had occasion to go to the stables at Tottenham about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of the mill as I returned from the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any occasion as carman to go into the mill - A. He had not; he was ordered the week before not to go into the mill.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him - A. He had a bag in his hand; I said what have you got there; I supposed it was flour; I said where did you get this, who gave you this; he said nobody; I took the bag from him, and took him and the bag into the house; I looked in the bag, I found it to be fine flour; I told him the short time that he had been in the mill I thought somebody might have given it him out of the mill; he said nobody; he persisted in it that he took it himself; he said he had taken it, having only received six pence for unloading a score sacks of flour; and it was a very hard thing they were not better paid for their work. We pay him eighteen shillings a week, and the bakers give him six pence for unloading the flour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was this part of the flour he had delivered - A. No; it was of a different quality to that he had delivered; that was the third and this was the finest. I sealed the bag and brought it here; I have every reason to believe this is Mr. Pratt's flour we never have any body else's flour there; the value of the flour is five shillings.</p>

            Where was this flour kept - A. Up a flight of stairs in the mill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Curtoys was going to the house, he happened to turn his head round and saw me. I picked this flour up on the premises, he asked me what I had got there; I said I did not know, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120032"></xptr>picked it up; I being intoxicated in liquor I did not give him a proper answer, he did not understand me.</p>

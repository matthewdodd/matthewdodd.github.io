I am treasurer to Drury Lane Theatre—I was at the theatre on this evening—the prisoner was brought to me in front of the theatre—Regan said, in his presence, that he had been offering this order for sale, and he put it into my hands—no orders were being issued at that time—I held it up to the light, and in doing so I tore it—the date of the year and the day of the week has been altered—"Wednesday" has evidently been written over some other day—it appears to me as if it had been "Tuesday," and the figures following the 18 have been erased, and "70" substituted—I asked the prisoner where he obtained it—he said it was given to him by a bill-poster for exhibiting the bills of Drury Lane Theatre—10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is the price of two admissions to the dress-circle—this ticket appears to have been given to a Mr. Cohen.</p>

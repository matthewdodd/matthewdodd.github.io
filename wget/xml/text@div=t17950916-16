On Tuesday, the 4th of August, where had you been, in the evening? - I went to have a pint of beer at the Bunch of Grapes, the corner of Green's-court, in Peter-street, one end comes into Little Poukney street, and the other end into Peter street. After I had drank my pint of porter, I came out of Green's-court into Peter-street, about eleven o'clock at night, I see the two men driving some sheep into Peter-street, Peter-street has no thorough fare, but the court where the public house is, that is Green's-court; and I watched them to see what they were going to do with these sheep, and I see one out of the two take one by the horns to pull it up, and the other man drove the next after; then they drove them to a rag shop and green shop, in the court; when he got the sheep to the door, he pulled it on the step of the door, and pulled it into the passage, and the other man drove the other sheep after it; when he got them into the passage, he drove them through the passage into the yard, and shut the door after them.</p>
               <p>Q. The rest of the sheep followed? - Yes, they all followed, and went in then; after they were all in they came out and shut the door, and went some where to drink together, I don't know where they went to, but they went away from that house; so after I had seen them drive them into this passage, where I had seen them drive them into, I went in where I had a pint of beer, and acquainted the landlady with it; I immediately goes to that watch-house of St. James's, I told the constable of the night my suspicions, and they came along with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Who came along with you? -Holmes, the constable of the night, and Carpenter, the beadle.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go with them? - They came out with me from the watch-house, and came with me to the place where I had seen the sheep go in; they knocked at the door some time before the door was opened. We found the sheep in the yard, and in the necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheep did you find in all? - Seven sheep and three lambs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who opened the door to you? - The landlady of the house opened the door.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you see any body else at the time but the landlady of the house? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had seen the sheep in the yard, what did you do then? - Drove them out, and carried them to the work-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body at that house besides the landlady? - We were coming out of the house and I met the prisoner, and he was dressed like a drover, and I charged the watch with him on suspicion; he was in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to the house when you stopped him? - Very near, about four yards from the house, coming to his lodgings in that house; he lodged in that house where the sheep were.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he endeavouring to do? - When we first came up to come home he wanted to run away when he see the mob at the door; we went round the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160055"></xptr>corner, and the watchman catched him by the coat, and I desired the watchman to hold him.</p>
               <p>Q. He took him, did he? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same person that was coming towards home that you had seen? - Yes, that is the man that I charged with the watch, and went to the watch-house and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us just now that there were two persons drawing these sheep into this house; the one by laying hold of the horns, and the other by driving the sheep. Do you know that the man that was taken was either of these men? - I cannot swear to the persons of either, but this is the man that was stopped an hour afterwards, when I brought the constable and beadle, by seeing him in a dress like a drover, and coming to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose house it was where the sheep were in? - Mrs. Harrison's, a widow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What time did you begin to spend the evening? - I imagine it might be about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you go with to the public house? - I went to the public house with myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the public house? - I staid about a couple of hours, as I generally do when I have done my work.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking a couple of hours in the public house before you see what you tell us? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. The watchman who took them is not here now? - The man that had the care of them is here.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes he not to be here? - I don't know, it is not my fault.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how many there were? - The prisoner was a lodger of mine at the time that he drove them; he knocked at the door between eleven and twelve o'clock, I got up and let him in, and when I let him in he came into the passage, and when he came into the passage he said, will you be so kind as to let me put a few of my master's sheep in your yard for a little while, and I will take them to my master's when the rest are ready; I replied, no, I had no room in my yard for sheep. With that I went into my own room and shut myself in, very much terrified indeed; in three or four minutes after that, the sheep were brought into my passage and put into the yard; they put them into the yard and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the persons that put them into the yard? - I see them through the door, and heard them speak, I heard that man at the door.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had they been gone out of your house before the alarm was given? - About an hour afterwards. This alarm was given between twelve and one, and they put them in between eleven and twelve. I would have made the alarm myself but I was afraid of going out of my own parlour door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Spencer after this? - Yes, at the door of the house; he was coming to the door at the time that the alarm was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him stopped? - I did not, I was in my own place; but they had him at the door at the time that I opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the justice the next day? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. How many lodgers have you in your house? - It is only two stories high, and two rooms on a floor; I have got a lodger in my one pair and in my two pair, at this time; I have only two lodgers and a single man besides, his wife is in the country.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you let him out? - No, I did not, or else I would have made the alarm myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the key? - There was no key to the door; but nobody can get in when it is fastened and bolted.</p>

               <p>Q. That is away from the passage? - Yes, it is away from the passage; the light is right opposite the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so frightened at his asking you to let him put some sheep in? How came that to frighten you? - It did frighten me, and when I was in my room I had not power to come out again. I have two small children, and work hard for my living.</p>
               <p>Q. You know sheep are not-lions? - It was a bad time of the night to bring things into my yard; that was the reason that frightened me so very much, so that when I had got into the room I could not have power to come out again; and when the alarm came to the door I plucked up my spirits and went to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you see this man? - Yes, I did; at past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know who this man worked for? Did not you know that he worked for a Mr. Steele? - I have seen his master, but I did not know him by name.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you never said to any person that you never see the prisoner that night? - I never told any body but what I tell you; if I did, I did not tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you told the truth or not, did you tell any body that you did not see the man that evening? - I never told any man but what I tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken, did not you tell Mr. Steele that you never see that man that evening? - No, I told him as I tell you; that I will be upon my oath; this was between eleven and twelve, and it was not three minutes, or between three and four minutes, after he had asked this permission that the sheep came in, and I was terrified in my own room, and they were brought in by him and another man; I heard him and saw him through the hole in the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray what is this hole in your door? - It is my key hole.</p>
               <p>Q. I think that you told me that you were extremely frightened? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you see him and the man through the key hole of the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord you were so frightened that you could not stir in your bed? - I did not; I told him when I got into my own room I was terrified, and could not get out.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet in that state you see this man through the key hole? - I see him pass me through the key hole, and heard him talking.</p>
               <p>Q. So you are sure that in that state of fright it you was in, you see him through the key hole, will you stick to that, thought you have once sworn it, that in that extreme state of alarm in which you was in, that you see him pass through the key hole? - I was so alarmed that I was not able to stir out of my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, when did you see Phillips last? - I see him a little while before I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not at the public house with the last witness? When were you at the public house with Mr. Phillips? - Since I have been waiting about this business; but not at the public house with him; I don't go to public houses with men. I never was here before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk over this business with him, or between you and him? - I never knew what he had got to say; he never told me what he had got to say, only he alarmed the place at the first. I knew he did that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you so or not? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you told me that he did not tell you what he had got to say? -He did not tell me any thing particular, but that he was the person that see the sheep brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I will ask you whether he did not tell you the whole of what he told us to day? - No, he did not, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you that he was there first, and he told you that he see the sheep brought in; did he tell you that he gave the alarm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tell you this? - I cannot say. I dare say that was not what he had got to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Were you before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you heard what he had got to say there? - No; he was examined before I came.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mrs. Harrison. Is that the person who had some conversation with you? - This man did come to my house once; I believe this is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. To Steele. Had you any conversation with her at any time? - I don't know that I changed half a dozen words with her in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever converse with more than one woman in Green's-court? - Yes, with three or four women.</p>
               <p>Q. What character do you give the prisoner? - I have known him for seven or eight years, he has been my servant, and he used to porter at St. James's Market, porter for the butchers, and carry out fish. I have trusted him with four hundred or five hundred sheep and lambs in a drove, and I never lost any thing; and have trusted him with oxen and a number of calves likewise.</p>

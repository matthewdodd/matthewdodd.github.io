                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker, of 31, Throgmorton Street—on 6th March, about 12.50, I was entering the Stock Exchange, by the New Court entrance—I had a heavy pocket-book in the pocket of my frockcoat—I had to pass my hand under my coat to get at my pocket—I felt a hand in my pocket and felt a difference in weight, turned round and heard some one call out something—I saw the prisoner go round the screen which is 2 yards inside the door, and also a companion of his—no strangers are admitted there, the porters know strangers—I went round the screen, siezed the prisoner on the other side, and said "You have stolen my pocket-book"—he said "No, but I have picked one up"—there was only half or three-quarters of a minute from the time I felt the loss of weight to the time I said him—noticing that his coat was very much bulged out I opened his two coats and found my pocket-book under his arm, held by his arm—I took him into the housekeeper's room—my pocket-book contained a lot of memoranda and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of telegraph forms, and several papers very valuable to myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mean to say that I never saw any strangers in the Stock Exchange, they are turned out the moment they come to the door—the prisoner did not offer me the pocket-book before I charged him—my pocket was deep, there was no hole in it, and it was impossible for the book to fall out, it was very heavy and went to the bottom of my pocket—I have said that I thought it was done in <hi rend="italic">chaff</hi>, but the prisoner was a stranger to me—I do not think anybody went in with me except the prisoner, and the other man.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SELIGNAN</hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Penner, a stockbroker—on 6th March I was in the lobby of the Stock Exchange and saw Mr. Goldsmith go in and two men close behind him—the prisoner was one, he had his hand in Mr. Goldsmith's pocket—I opened the door and called out "Do you miss anything."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 671). The prisoner was given into my custody—he refused his address, and said that he picked the pocket-book up—I found a gold watch in his waistcoat pocket, with an Albert chain attached, a double sovereign and another coin, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in Bronze and two bird calls.</p>

John Benyon. I am a special constable of the Stock Exchange—on 6th March I saw the prisoner come round the screen and go out again and Mr. soldsmith with him—I know all the members of the Stock Exchange—trangers are not admitted on any pretence whatever.</p>

On the 26th of November my husband and I went out between 9 and 10 o'clock, I locked the door and left no body in the house. I was sent for between 11 and 12, and told my house was broke open; I went home and found the prisoner in the house. There was a shift, two aprons, and a pair of stockings missing; I found she was stopped with the things upon her, and brought back with them.</p>

               <p>M. Longstaff. No part at all. I asked her how she got in, she said she could not tell; I asked her what business she had with my things, she said she could not tell.</p>

            . I live over-against the prosecutor. Between the hours of 11 and 12 I saw the prisoner go up the alley, and go into the prosecutor's house, and soon came out again with the things in her apron. I went after her, and took hold on her, and asked her what she had got; she said she had nothing. I took her back, and she laid the things down; I then got assistance, and kept her there till the prosecutrix came home, who owned the things as her property.</p>

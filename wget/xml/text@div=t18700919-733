                  </hi>. I live at 3, Havelock Terrace, Stratford—on the evening of 12th August I was in High Street, Shoreditch, walking towards the station, and about midway between the street and the station felt a blow behind which knocked my hat off—I saw the prisoner in front of me—he snatched at ray pocket, and pulled my chain, which was a very strong one, over my head—he took my watch and chain, worth 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and ran away—I informed the police, and afterwards went to the station and recognized the prisoner, who was with five or six others—it was a light night, there was a full moon—I have not got my watch and chain back.</p>

Q.</hi> Where had you been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had left the White Horse, at the corner of Church Street—I had been there a half hour or more—I had been to at least a dozen public-houses before that, it is my duty to go there—I daresay I had something to drink at each; when I go to a public-house I always call for something, whether I drink it or not—I am collector to a brewery, and know the landlords—I wish each landlord to take something—I drink something at most of them—I had nothing but beer, except some port wine and water at Bryan's house—that was on the top of beer, but a long while after—I am fond of pale ale—beer and port wine is all I recollect having—I left the White Horse about 11.10, to catch a train—that public-house is not 100 yards from where I lost my watch—the blow did not stun me, but it knocked my hat off—there were at least twenty people about—I did not see the man who knocked it off—I stooped to pick it up, and the prisoner was in front of me, and as I was stooping my watch and chain went; the whole thing was over in less than a minute—the person who took it had something white on—I think the prisoner's dress (a <hi rend="italic">smock frock</hi>) is the very thing—he ran away immediately, but I saw his face and his white smock frock—I told the police he had a white smock frock on, and he had it on when I went to the station—I recognized him in an instant by his face, not by his smock frock—he was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Old Antigallioan public-house, in Tooley Street—on Thursday evening, 10th January, I was in Duke Street, Tooley Street, going home, something after eight o'clock—I was in the act of putting my top-coat on—the male prisoner came up and asked me to let him help me on with it—I offered him a glass of ale for doing it—we went into the Green Man and had some drink—while there another man came in—I called for some brandy for them and treated them—I was not drunk—I had been out on a day's leave, and had had a couple of glasses along with a friend—as I came out of the house I did not mind which turning I took, I got under the railway arch, after which I could not tell where I went—I remember at last being at a public-house where I had a glass of wine—I don't know the name of that house—when I came out of there I did not know where I was—I looked to see if I could get a cab, and saw the prisoners coming after me—the male prisoner put his foot before me, gave me a push, put his knee in my back, and threw me down in the gutter—he held me down, and the female prisoner came up—I had my top<lb></lb>coat on my left arm, and she knelt on my left arm on the ground while I was down—my watch was in my breast pocket; she made several attempts to take it while I was on the ground, and in rising up she snatched her hand at the ribbon guard, and I had my watch no more—it went—when I was knocked down there were four persons round me—the female prisoner was there at the time I was knocked down—she was coming up behind</p>

               <p>me—she came up at the time the man knocked me down—I saw the prisoners both together on my left side when I was on the ground—the female was within a yard or so of me when I was knocked down—I could not say exactly who took my watch, but the female made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at the ribbon that was attached to it, and broke it—that was while she was kneel<lb></lb>ing on my arm, and as soon as I got on ray feet I missed it.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">M</hi>). I received information of this robbery, and on the Saturday after, the 17th, I met McCarthy in Newing<lb></lb>ton Causeway—I told him I wanted him for being concerned with three others in violently assaulting and robbing a young man of a silver watch, in Kent Street—he said, "I was with the young man, and I had something to drink with him; we were in company together. We took a walk from London Bridge, and I took him into Kent Street. He wanted to hear a song. We had something to drink at a beer shop, a public-house just as you enter Kent Street. There was <hi rend="italic">Curly Poll</hi> (that is the name Sidebotham is known by); <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Kenrick and George Basty were there, and I will not be put away for them. We all went out together. The prosecutor went on ahead, going towards the Kent Road. I turned aside to ease myself and within a minute or two after that I saw him all covered with mud, and blood trickling down his face"—I took him to Stones'End Police Station, and placed him with five others, and fetched the prosecutor, who deliberately picked him out, put his hand on him, and said, "That is the man."</p>

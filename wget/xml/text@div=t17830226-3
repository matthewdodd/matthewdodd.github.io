               <p>On Saturday the 14th of January last, I was coming to town from Chatham, in a hackney post-chaise, I took a hackney coach from the stones end near Westminster-bridge, I had a trunk, and a mahogany shaving case with me, containing the several articles mentioned in the indictment; the shaving case was distinct; I directed the coachman to drive me to the admiralty, he desired time given him to refresh his horses, I told him I was going to Islington, and if he chose in Oxford road, he might stop, as I had occasion to stay there; the coachman drove on, he stopped at the watering house, the corner of <placeName id="t17830226-3-crimeloc15">Berner's-street</placeName>

               <p>Did you at any time recover any of these things? - Yes, my Lord, I was at the publick-office, and was shewn the trunk, and a part of the things, some few of the things, that was I think on Friday last.</p>
               <p>Did you call there, having any intimation that the things were found, or by accident? - From an intimation that the things were found.</p>

               <p>We found this trunk full of whipcord, in the house of the prisoner Dudfield, at a little court in Middle-row, Holborn; an information was lodged at the office, that there were some people lodged in that court that cut off trunks from behind chaises and hackney coaches; the prisoner Dudfield keeps the house; the trunk was in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it now in the same condition, and does it contain the same things as when you found it? - No, my Lord, the things were not in it, the things that are now in it, were found in different parts of the same house.</p>

               <p>When this shirt was produced to me at the publick office in Bow-street, though it was so exactly like mine, as to make me almost sure of it, yet there was a third button on it, and the mark had been altered; it has the letters of the prisoner's name; the mark had been very plainly taken out.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it discernable what those letters were that stood there? - No.</p>
               <p>Do those letters that are there appear to be an old mark? - No.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. I believe Dudfield had this shirt on when he was taken.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you swear to any one of these shirts? - This third shirt I should readily swear to, but that the name seemed to be cut out, and another name inserted; here is the hole.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you from any other particulars, say it is your shirt? - I cannot positively say, that it is; here are a pair of slippers which my name is in.</p>

               <p>Carpmeal. That was found in Dudfield's bed-room. When we first went in there, was none of them at home; we asked what lodgers they had, and a woman said, Hart Levy lodged up stairs, and themselves.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you do not know otherwise then by the information of the woman, that Hart Levy lived there? - There was a great many of his cloaths found there and boots and shoes which he claimed.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were any of the other things found? - Here is one neckcloth which I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is the trunk yours? Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. The razor is not particularly specified in the indictment, it says, a mahogany shaving case, but the contents of that shaving case are not enumerated; are you sure, sir, that that razor was in the case at the time you lost it? - Yes, my Lord, positively so.</p>
               <p>Court. These shirts that you lost had they been in wear any considerable time? About six months.</p>
               <p>Do those that you have been looking over now appear to have been worn about the same time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. Here is abundance of locks and things that we found in the cellar, paper and books; and in the hand of Levy was that cane, which is very remarkable, being a loaded cane: Hart came in by himself, and Dudfield came in with one Read afterwards.</p>

               <p>Court to Carpmeal. Did this woman tell you that Hart Levy lodged in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins. When they came in I was alone, and I was very much frightened, that I did not know what I said.</p>

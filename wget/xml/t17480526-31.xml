               <p>Q. What sort of a house is it?</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body else with you?</p>
               <p>Lickley. Yes, one man more, an acquaintance of mine, a taylor.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174805260034"></xptr>Q. What countryman are you ?</p>

               <p>Q. What did you drink?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Two or three pints of beer, and some drams; and three women came in, and pushed him, and pushed off his hat and wig ; and one of them desired me to go up stairs with her.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you go up stairs with her?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Yes, I did go up with her, and staid for about an hour or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it a bedchamber that you went into?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed ?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What you and the Prisoner at the bar ?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lie there?</p>
               <p>Lickley . About two hours; and when I came down stairs , there were four staymakers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Because they told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day light when you got up?</p>
               <p>Lickley . I believe it was about four o'clock, and then I went to drink with them, and the day light began to come in; I looked upon my watch , to see whether it was time to go home, and it was about twenty minutes after five ; and then the Prisoner got hold of me, and led me to another box, and said she would give me a quartern of rum , which she did, and she took my watch from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it?</p>
               <p>Lickley . I cannot say I saw her; and she would have had me have gone to another house with her .</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say she took it, when you did not see her take it?</p>
               <p>Lickley . Because I was in no other company; we went out of the house together; when I was got about ten doors down the street, she turned back again ; then she was got about three doors; I went back again, and followed her into the house, and she asked me if I had no money; I said, I would pawn my watch for a pint of beer; she said I had no watch; I said I had; but when I felt for it, it was gone. The landlord began to push me out of doors, and I said, keep your hands off me, or I will shew you something else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Lickley. No.</p>

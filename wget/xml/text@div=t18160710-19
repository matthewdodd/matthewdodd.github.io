On the evening of the 19th of June, at about half past eight, the prisoner was talking to a lodger of mine at the door, and asked to go into the parlour with him, as he had something particular to say; they went in; and after they had gone about a quarter of an hour, I missed my watch; it was most usually hung over the mantle piece in the parlour; but whether I left it there, or whether in the privy. I don't know. The lodger was a female lodger; she is a distant relation of my wife, and was out of place then; she is in service now. She went into the parlour with the prisoner, and came out first, leaving him. When the prisoner was apprehended, about half past eleven the same night, he acknowledged he had been in my parlour; but denied taking the watch. The outside-case of the watch was found in his waistcoat pocket; the other part in his other pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the watch on the seat on the necessary, and I took it up to look at it, and being rather intoxicated, I let the case drop, and put it in one pocket, and the body of the watch in the other, with intent to give them to the owner of the house; but, being so drunk, I forgot it, and I quite forgot having it in my possession when I was sober. If I had taken it with any fraudulent intent, I had plenty of time to make away with it; but I forgot entirely that I had it.</p>

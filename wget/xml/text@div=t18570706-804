                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and was working at Chingford on 17th June. About half past 8 o'clock that night, we went to a beer shop to try to get lodgings—we could not get any, and went and laid down in a shed in the field—we left our scythes in the field—between 10 and 11 o'clock we heard some persons come by the place where we were sleeping, and go into a shed near, and kick about the loose straw—I suppose to see if the scythes were hid there—they could not find any there, and I heard one say to the other, "Bring two of the best of them"—in about three minutes I heard the prisoner bring them, and lay one down before the door where we were sleeping—I got up and pushed open the door, and there he stood with the other scythe in his hand—we took him into custody—he said he took them with the intention of using, but he could not see to mow at</p>

               <p>11 o'clock at night, and he was going away from the grass—I did not know the prisoner, he was a stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was working with Messam—when we left off work I left my scythe with Messam's, and was sleeping in the shed with him—I went out and collared the prisoner, and detained him—one of the scythes was mine.</p>

Zago and Bevole lodged in my house for three weeks—I knew the other two prisoners, Rossi and Dominini—they were in the habit of visiting Zago and Bevole two or three times a day—on Thursday, 2nd Aug., I went into Zago's room with a tray of linen, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—I saw Dominini and Bevole measuring a great quantity of black stuff—I could not see what it was—it was wide, and was like the silk that I afterwards saw—I had lent Bevole a measure that afternoon—I left the room, and went down stairs, and soon afterwards Zago and Rossi came, it. might have been in about half an hour—they went into the room where Dominini and Bevole were—in a few minutes Bevole brought down the money for the lodging, and the washing also—I had taken the account for the lodging when I went up, and, when I saw them measuring, I gave it to Dominini—Rossi had told me the day before to let the lodgers have their account, for they were going away on Thursday—while Bevole was giving me the money, Rossi and Zago, the lodgers, came into my room, and asked why Bevole was so long—Bevole had paid me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. too much in the account, and Rossi took back a sixpence, and gave me a penny; that made it all right, and settled the account—I saw no more of the prisoners that night—I heard them go out about 7 o'clock, soon after they left my room—I went into their room, about 9 o'clock the next morning, to make the bed—I did not see any black stuff there then—it was all cleared away—it was in the bed room that I had seen them pleasuring it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I apprehended Zago on Saturday, 4th Aug.—I have known him since May last—I went to his lodgings, searched them, but found nothing but his own papers—I found on him this <hi rend="italic">pork monnaie</hi>. containing three sovereigns and a sixpence—I have known Rossi and Dominini since May last—I have seen them and Zago repeatedly toge<lb></lb>ther since that time—when I took Zago he looked very earnestly at Mr. Mornement, threw away his cigar, and walked up White Rose-court—he was about to run when I seized him—I thought he was about to resist—he opened his coat—I seized both his hands—he pushed me across the road to the other side—I took Rossi in Desborough-terrace, Harrow-road, on Monday the 6th—I said, "You are Mr. Rossi?"—he said, "Yes, all right!"—I said, "I want to speak to you about your friends, Zago and Dominini"—he said, "Yes, all right, Bachiazo and Gavazzini"—I told him we were police officers, and they were in custody—he said, "What, in prison again?"—I said, "Yes they are, and we are come to take you for receiving the silk knowing it to have been stolen"—he said, "I know nothing at all about it, it is all right"—I found a coat in his lodging which</p>

               <p>I had seen him wear, and in that coat I found three duplicates in this purse—these duplicates do not correspond with anything that has been pro<lb></lb>duced, but they are the same date—they relate to property pawned at Mr. Attenborough's—I saw Dominini in custody at the station—I found on him a <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>. containing four sovereigns and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gold eye glass, a gold pencil case, and a cigar case.</p>

This silk produced by Charles Cotton, is a part of the silk we lost—I have a pattern of the silk that was cut from it when it first came in—it is the same piece exactly; but we have it from France in metres, and for our own convenience we measure it in Eng<lb></lb>lish—this is wider than any French silk that we had—these pieces pro<lb></lb>duced by the other pawnbrokers are the same stuff exactly—here are about forty yards produced—we lost about fifty yards.</p>

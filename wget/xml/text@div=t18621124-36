                  </hi>. I am a medical student, of Alfred-street, Bedford-square—on 23d October, about ten minutes past 6 in the afternoon, I was walking along Bloomasbury-street, and was pushed by some one rather violently, and about a second afterwards I was knocked down by a very heavy blow on the mouth, and my head coming in contact with the pave<lb></lb>ment the blow stunned me—one of my front teeth was broken, and several others were loosened in the lower and upper jaw, and my lip was cut rather severely—I thought they must have had something in their hands—I do not know who the men were—I saw one running off when I came to my senses; and I called "Police!"—I missed my watch from a small watch-pocket in my waistcoat—the swivel was bent out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Henry-street, Upper Kennington-lane, Vaux<lb></lb>hall, and am a clerk—I was at the corner of Bloomsbury-street on Thursday evening, 23d October, at a little after 6 o'clock, and saw Mr. Le Sueur there—I was about twenty yards from him—I saw one of the prisoners, who, I should think, by the look of him, was Anderson, push against him, and then another struck him on the mouth, and ran away—I should not like to say, who that was—I saw Mr. Le Sueur on the ground, and Anderson feeling about his chest—Anderson then ran away past me—I saw his face, and fol<lb></lb>lowed him through two or three streets; he then turned round the corner of a street and walked back again—I was running behind him at the time, and was able to see his face again—I looked him in the face, and said, "You are the one who took the gentleman's watch"—he said, "Bill, look here</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240049"></xptr>
               <p>what this young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> says, that I have been and took a gentleman's watch"—there were several persons walking behind him, to one of whom he spoke—when he said that we just came to the corner of a street, a crowd began to collect, and a policeman said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "A man has taken a gentleman's watch;" and when I looked round again I could not see the prisoner—when Anderson ran off, Roberts passed me—that was before Anderson ran down the street—I was not able to see him as he went by; I took no notice of him—I saw Anderson next, at Bow-street station, on the following Saturday, with several other men, and pointed him out to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Anderson.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Roberts.

               <p>after him—he turned round and upon we, under lamp, in Thorney-street, and I stepped back and saw his face—he turned round on me a second time—I saw him again, on the following Friday week, at Bow-street Police-court, and picked him out, the first man, from among a number of people—on the night this took place I gave a description of the prisoners at Bow-street—when I left, Anderson was in front of the prosecutor, and there was a boy close to them—I did not see Anderson again till the Saturday morning; the day after I recognised Roberts—I picked him out from among thirty people.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Anderson.

Q.</hi> Who gave you information concerning me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not tell you, for his sake—the sergeant who assisted me is not here—I received a description of you at the station, from the police orders issued from Scot<lb></lb>land-yard—you left one cuff in my hand, and one in the hand of the other policeman—I cannot produce them—I have not seen them since—I did not throw them away, I must have dropped them in the struggle, I suppose there are several witnesses here who saw them—(<hi rend="italic">Roberts here took off his coat and handed it to the Jury, to show that the cuffs were not torn</hi>)—you wore a coat something like this, but the sleeves wave torn from about there—I am not a tailor, but this sleeve has been torn—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that he could prove that the coat had been mended in the gaol, if necessary</hi>)—I was not at Bow-street when the prosecutor was brought there—Webb was not brought that day, because he had not been found, I believe—I made no charge against you but for assaulting this gentleman and stealing his watch; I know nothing of any charge of loitering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Roberts' Defence.</hi> One witness says that Anderson knocked the gentleman down, and the other that I did it. One says that I went to the station at 7 o'clock, and Ackrill says 8 o'clock. He says that he saw Holmes at the police-court, and Holmes says that it was at the top of Bow-street or Long<lb></lb>acre. The evidence is only got up. They know no more about me than you do. There is not a robbery that these men do not get up, especially for garotting, and nobody says that this gentleman was garotted at all. They take people up a week afterwards, and then say that I left my cuffs in their hands. There has never been a cuff torn off my coat, but, as they have apprehended me, they do not care what they say to convict me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Anderson's Defense.</hi> I was apprehended, charged with loitering, taken to Georgs-street, and let go, I was then taken to Bow-street, charged with loitering, and remanded for a week. Holmes says that he received informa<lb></lb>tion from Webb; way did not be bring Webb against me at my first hearing? he did not bring him for a week afterwards. He says that the man struck him and that I struck him. If he knew that I was one who had done the robbery, why did not he charge me with it? I am innocent, but I am known to the police as a convicted thief; therefore they do not care what they say to bring the charge against me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman. I saw the prisoner, with a companion, about ten minutes to 7 o'clock on the night of 27th of this month, in the Minories, near Page's public house—there was a truck there and two ham<lb></lb>pers on the ground—the men that belonged to the things were taking a flat of stout into the house, and I saw the prisoner and his companion each take a hamper, and put it on the truck—the prisoner took the handle of the truck, and drew it away, and his companion pushed behind to the top of the Minories; he then left it, and turned round by Moses', towards Leaden<lb></lb>hall Street—the prisoner went on alone with the truck towards Aldgate—I told a policeman, and he went after him—I saw him take him—when he was within a yard of the prisoner, the prisoner dropped the truck and ran away.</p>

I received information from the last witness, and went after the prisoner—I saw him drop the truck, and run away—I ran after him, and secured him at the corner of Petticoat Lane—I did not say anything to him—he said, when I caught hold of him. "Don't choke me"—I do not know that he wheels trucks about Whitechapel.</p>

We search'd him, but found nothing but a Belt about him. We carried him before Mr Poulson, and there he behaved in the like Manner.</p>

             . On the third of this Month I happen'd to be at my Kitchen-Window, my House is opposite to Mr Briller's, looking out of my Window, I saw the Prisoner very busy at the Shop Window; he look'd to the right and left, both ways, and by and by I saw him take the Table from the Shop Window , and walk away.</p>
               <p>Q. What Table was it?</p>
               <p>Horton. A little Table that clasp'd down.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him walk away with it, what did you do then?</p>
               <p>Horton. I went down Stairs , thinking my Servant might not see him, but when I came down my Prentice was gone after him, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the Table stand? Was it within or without the Shutter?</p>
               <p>Horton. It stood in the Shop Window.</p>

             . I live in Clerkenwell close , I am a Tenant to Justice Hole . The young Man, the Prisoner, was Apprentice to me, and I never desire a better than he was. He has work'd Journey-work with me ever since, except about a Twelvemonth . I was the most surpriz'd to hear this, he was so sober a Man, I thought he would not have done this Fact . Whilst he was an Apprentice he belong'd to a Religious Society, and received the Blessed Supper; but when he gets a little Liquor he is like a Mad-man .</p>

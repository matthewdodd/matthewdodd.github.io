               <p>Westminster Bridge Road—on 3rd April, about 9.15 p.m., the prisoners came in together—Hows asked for two Manilla cigars, which I had not got—I gave him two cheroots, which came to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he laid down a half-sovereign, and I gave him the change, two half-crowns, four shillings, a sixpence, and a penny—he picked it up, and put it in his waistcoat pocket—Willing then said "I have sixpence; why did you change I have your half-sovereign back, and give her the change "—Hows gave me the change hack, and I gave him the half-sovereign—I had remarked that the half-crowns I gave him were old and worn—one of the half-crowns he gave me back was good, and the other bad, and not worn at all—they were just moving from the shop, when I discovered that it was bad—I sent a servant after them—Hows also said "If you give me a sovereign, I will give you a half-sovereign and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of silver—that was while I was biting the half-crown—I took the two half-crowns from the till, and the rest from a bag in a drawer—I had put them in the till about 8 o'clock the same evening—I had taken them from other people, but I always look at money—I observed that they were worn—I gave the bad half-crown to the constable, who brought the prisoners back—it was a George IV.—I am quite positive it was not one of those I gave them—when they were brought back, Hows threw down a half-sovereign, and said "Take it, take it! I had rather give anything than be locked up—I said "I will lock you up."</p>

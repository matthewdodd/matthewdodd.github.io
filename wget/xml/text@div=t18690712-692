About 8.30 on Saturday even-ing, the 8th July, I went to Mr. Folkard's, a pawnbroker in the Blackfriars Road, where I saw the prisoner—the assistant showed me this part of a spoon or fork (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it is silver—he said in the presence of the prisoner, "This man has brought this to sell," and he gave it to me to look at—I asked the prisoner how he came by it—he said, "It was given to me by a man at the top of the road, he gave me the name of Happy"—I took him to the station and charged him.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Folkard, pawnbroker, in the Blackfriars Road—on Saturday evening, 3rd July, the prisoner came to the shop and offered me half a silver fork for sale—I sent for a constable—on the 26th June he brought some knife handles to me—there is a crest on the spoon and on the knife handles as well—they were very much defaced when they were brought, I had to file them to see if they were silver—I did not see the crest till they were cleaned—when he came first he handed them to me and asked me to buy them, and said he had got some more at home—he said they belonged to his grandmother, and had been some time in the family, and the blades were rather old, so he had brought them to sell—he said he lived at Kennington Road—the whole of the knives would be worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you whether he was acquainted with a man named Young? A. Yes; he said they took a great deal of property from the Quaker's, and should have taken a good deal more, but they could not stop, as the dogs were there, and they were afraid the master, or somebody would come down; he said they had sold 13l. or 14l. worth of goods - I afterwards saw Young, he told me that him and King,

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you sleep last night? A. In the House of Correction - I have been there thirty-one days - I was there once before - a young man had taken a handkerchief; I was in a public-house with him, and was taken up as well as him. I know Mr. Dickenson of Twickenham; I was not a witness in a case of his, it was my brother. The property was given to me the morning after the robbery, as they told me; they told me it was committed the night before. I knew them before, but we were not intimate; I asked one person to buy the gown pieces, they said No; I told King I understood the property stolen was worth between 200l. and 300l.; he said it was not 20l.; I asked if he had committed it, and he said, Yes; he had been living about there, and doing nothing; I thought he could do nothing else - I told nobody of it till I was apprehended - I was afraid; it was my intention to tell if I was taken - I cannot say whether I should have told if I had not been taken. Tom cannot be found.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you been able to see Little Tom since they told you he was in the robbery? A. No; I have known the prisoners fourteen years, and have drank with them several times; they said there were some silk shawls and a great quantity of black silk, and some red twill and muslins among the goods; I asked how they got into the house, they said through the brickwork, and it was at near three o'clock in the morning; what made me ask if they were in the robbery was, because they had always plenty of money, and never did any work.</p>
               <p>Mr. J. ALLEY. Q. You did not see them frequently at public-houses? A. Yes; I have seen them full twenty times; they were always about the place; there was so much talk about them, every body wondered how they got so much money, and yet never worked; I had seen them with money two months before the robbery.</p>

Mr. Key's house is not in that direction - they were going towards Twickenham - William Stears was a particular acquaintance of theirs; I have made diligent search, but cannot find either him or Tom - I saw them all at Twickenham on the day of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Little Tom was not with the prisoners? A. He came along in about two minutes after them; I did not see them afterwards; they were a mile and a half from Mr. Key's - Stears' father was brought up about this, but he was only asked how he came by a bag.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say that Little Tom is a bad character? A. Yes - very bad; I have met the prisoners about before, but never so late as that; they were coming from their own house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Robert Thomas Wells and Hesketh Davis Wells, firewood merchants, at Canal Wharf, Deptford. I know the prisoner Morris—he goes by the name of Harris—he is a wood<lb></lb>cutter—he had a particular part in the shed parted off where he worked—he works at so much per hundred—each man has a place, and keeps it sepa<lb></lb>rate—Burke was in the service as a carman—his duty was to come at 7 o'clock, when he had cleaned his horses, and then come to me and ask for his orders—on 23rd Feb., I gave him an order to take 1, 000 bundles of 14 in., and 1, 000 of 15 in.—he was to get the 14 in. from Morris, and the 15 in. from a person of the name of Collins—he was to take the 21, 000's, and also 500 of 15 ins., 1, 000 to Morley in Somers Town, 500 to Mr. Chambers, in Somers Town, and the other 1, 000 to some one else—he had no authority from me to take away more than 1, 000 of 14 in. that day—I gave the order—all orders go through me or Mr. Wells—each day we re<lb></lb>ceive an account from the men—Morris gave me his account of 1, 000 14 in to Burke—I saw Burke when he came home—I asked him, "What have you had? "—he said 1, 000 15 in. and 1, 000 of 14 in., and he paid me for the 1, 000 15 in., but nothing for the 14 in.—Mr. Gilbert had the 1, 000 14 in. accounts monthly—the value of 200 bundles of 14 in. is 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

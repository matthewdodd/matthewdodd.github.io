On the 13th of April the servant, before she went to bed, missed a spoon, and informed her mistress - the prisoner had been employed in the house that day, but had no business in the room the plate was kept in: his business was to clean the shoes and knives - he came next morning as usual, and in consequence of what the servant said, I went down stairs and charged him with stealing a spoon; he denied it - I spoke sharply to him, but made him no promise or threat; he then took me into the shoe-house, went to his coat pocket, and delivered me; up a silver table-spoon - I then asked him about the spoon missed the day before; he denied having taken that - I gave him in charge.</p>

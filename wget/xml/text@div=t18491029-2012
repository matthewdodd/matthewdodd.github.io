                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, and live at 123, Aldersgate-street, City. On Tuesday, 28th Aug., in consequence of a message which I received, I went to the Clarence Hotel, and in the coffee-room there I saw the prisoner, Smith, and a Mr. Collins, in his company—Captain Smith, as he called himself, stated to me that the landlord had gone out of town, or he would have given him the money for this check (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I unfortu<lb></lb>nately knew Smith for a few weeks before, as a customer—I looked at the check, and finding it was made payable to Mr. F. Collins, who was in Smith's company, and his companion, and knowing Mr. Collins to be a man of pro<lb></lb>perty, and as it was drawn payable to him, I supposed it was a good instru ment, and immediately took out my purse and gave Smith 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; that is the amount the check is drawn for—I did not at that time perceive that the check was post-dated, the circumstance of its being crossed was the only thing that induced me to give them the money without its going through a banker—Smith alluded to its being crossed, and said, as the check was crossed, would I give him the money for it, as the landlord was out of town—I did not discover that it was post-dated till next day, when it was going to be sent to the bankers; Smith never alluded to it—I afterwards charged him with giving me a post-dated check—he did not explain the circumstance at all—the only explanation I had was, that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184910290160"></xptr>
               <p>Fraser, the man that drew the check, had the cholera; and then that he had died—the first time I saw him after he gave me the check was on the 3d the day before it was due—he then wished me not to pay it in, as Fraser was ill of the cholera, and could not go to Gravesend—I said I certainly should pay it in, and let it go through the bankers—my brother paid it on the 3d, with other moneys, and it was returned to me on the 5th—I afterwards went to the Commercial Bank; I found they had moved from 3, Moorgate-street, more than twelve months before, and they told me they knew nothing of such parties—I afterwards saw Smith, and spoke to him about the check being returned—he said that Fraser was dead of the cholera—I told him he had given me a forged check—he said it would be paid, I could go to Mr. Lawes, his solicitor, in Moorgate-street, who gave him the check—we had a long conversation—I saw him several times—I afterwards went to Lawes, in Moorgate-street; I told him that I had a forged check, and that Captain Smith had sent me <hi rend="italic">to</hi> him; that he told me he had received it from him—I pro<lb></lb>duced it to him—Lawes told me that Fraser had a rich brother at Gravesend, and there had been some misunderstanding, which was the reason the money had not been paid; he did not pay it—I told him Smith said Fraser was dead—he said, "Oh!" and put it off in an <hi rend="italic">au fait</hi>, easy sort of way—he said, never mind that, "Come in and see Mr. Hall," that was a gentleman in the front office—I did so; and Mr. Hall stated to me, in Lawes presence, that Fraser's brother was a man of property at Gravesend, and it would ultimately be settled, and he thought I should get the money on the following Saturday; Hall said that Lawes should come to pay the check on the Saturday, and Lawes said it certainly should be paid on Saturday—neither Lawes or any one else came to pay it on the Saturday; it has not yet been paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, on your oath, were you not desired to pay 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr.</p>
               <p>Cuthbertson, I only want an answer, yes or no, and just be cautious? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I cannot state which way it was now, the two transactions have been so mixed up together—I swear 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is all the money I have received for the purpose of paying the parties—that is not all the money I have received of Lawes since 3d Aug.—he did some private business for me—I do not know how much I have received—I have no account—I have not received more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him to pay checks—I have not received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him since 28th Aug.—I received the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Saturday, and I do not remember that I have received any other sum of him since 28th Aug.—I may have received money on my private account; but not to my recol<lb></lb>lection—I fancy it was previous to that—it was not 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I should say it was between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear that was not for the purpose of paying the two 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. checks—I did not undertake to pay the other 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the private accounts between us were about some money Lawes had got for me, for which I gave him a bill, which I shall have to take up at the end <hi rend="italic">of</hi> this month—I think it is for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I suppose I received between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him; but I cannot tell—besides that, I have received nothing <hi rend="italic">else</hi> except the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your name on Mills's check? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw it at the police-court—I did not see it before Mills had it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of course you have paid back the money to the prosecutor, the half <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the amount of this check? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had reason to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184910290163"></xptr>
               <p>believe the account would be made all square with the prosecutor, as far as I was concerned—that was not in order to keep the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my own pocket—I have not got it in my pocket now; I can send for it. <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> They have not indicted you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They have not. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you got 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the world? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have at Pocklington's and Laceys, in Smithfield, my trustees keep my accounts—I can have money by applying to them for it—I cannot draw any<lb></lb>thing out myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What has become of the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> God knows; I can repay it at any time—I suppose it has been spent; since that, money has been obtained by another party, and I did not think this would be brought in question—I have paid away the money, and I have had a party receiving that money through some rather indirect transaction—I would rather not mention names; it would not criminate myself, perhaps I might say more than I should wish; there is nothing very particular about it, but perhaps it might go further into private matters than I should like—it might involve me in another transaction; I do not know whether it would involve me in an indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'MAHON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you receive the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Laws? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Dolphin, in Milk-street; an officer was with me; Lawes was not in custody—it was on the Saturday we went to the police-court, I forget the day of the month—I went from the court to Lawes, to inquire whether there was anything not fair or fraudulent in the transaction—I told him that Smith was then in custody, and I should like him to come up and see whether anything could be done in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give any part of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you received from Lawes to Smith? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I lent him some money, Smith bad taken up the trans<lb></lb>action on my behalf; at least I let him do the <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi> work, going backwards and forwards—he received it for me one day, and brought it me, and had some of it: we were <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> together—he was not my agent to raise the money, and we were rather more intimate than I liked—I am not yet twenty years old.</p>

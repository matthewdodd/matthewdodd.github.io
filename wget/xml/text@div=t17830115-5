I left nobody in the house, I locked the door, and returning for a waistcoat that I wanted, I found I was robbed of coats and waistcoats, and the door was wide open; it appeared to have been opened by false keys or pick lock keys, it did not appear to be broke; I lost nine close coats one surtout coat, two waistcoats thirty one pair of sleeves; I do not keep a shop, I <rs id="t17830115-5-viclabel42" type="occupation">buy for dealers</rs>

               <p>Court. What was the value of the whole things? - Four pound I put my hand in my pocket, and I gave her half a guinea, in the course of five or six minutes I was very uneasy to see the goods, then she called in a man and gave him a key out of her pocket, and told him to go and fetch them, in a little time the man came back, and brought no goods; he said your daughter said I suppose you made my mother drunk and stole the key from her, and that you mean to hang us all; the prisoner and me then went for the goods ourselves, she desired me to come with her and she would produce them; she told me to stop at the sign of the King of Prussia, in Salt Petre Bank, and she would bring me the goods presently; I waited, and in a very little time I was very uneasy, I thought I had lost both the half guinea and the goods; but in a few minutes the goods were brought on a man's back tied up in a patchwork counterpane; the prisoner was with him, I then missed part of my property which were not there, there were two coats missing,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150012"></xptr> and all the sleeves; I asked the man where the remainder of the goods were; the prisoner said, if in case I gave her a little time to find the thieves, I should have all the goods and the thieves to: I went home with her to her house, and took another man with me; the prisoner was so much in liquor, I let her alone till the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. You went home and left her? - Yes, when I came next day she told me, if I was to come so often she never could produce either the thieves or the goods, for my coming so often kept them away, and would raise a suspicion; when I went afterwards, she said sessions was coming on; and as I had compounded felony with her, if she went to bloody Newgate, I should go with her. I went to Whitechapel court, and gave information, the man that was with her was very rude and stripped to fight; we took her to the justice, and she produced a couple of girls, which she said brought her the goods to sell; but as she could produce no witnesses, she was fully committed, the justice would not admit her as evidence against them.</p>

               <p>On the same night this man lost his goods, the goods were brought to my place to be sold; I buy and sell old cloaths as well as he: There were eight coats and two waistcoats, the people asked me a guinea and half for the goods, I looked at them, and thought they were too cheap; I stopped the goods, and would not part with them; my daughter lay in on Friday, I could not come out, on the Saturday morning, I was going to advertise them, and I called into the Blue Boar, and there I heard Mr. Clark say to one

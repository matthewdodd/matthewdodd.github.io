The prisoner came on that morning, and asked me if I was going, I told him, yes, Bill, will you come in, and he said, no, I can't stay; he then went away. He came afterwards; but I did not see him. I went to the Hospital, and when I came back. I picked up the drop of an ear-ring, which the officer has got.</p>

            . I am in my eleventh year. I am the daughter of Mrs. Fulmer. I know the prisoner; I was at home when my mother went to the Hospital in February last, she left my sister at home with me; it was on Monday, the 16th; the sister that was left at home with me was about four years old. The prisoner came to my mother's house, when she was not at home on that day; I knew him very well; he said, your mother is gone to the Hospital, is not she, and I said, yes; I said, will you come in Bill, and I put a chair for him to sit down, and he said, here is sixpence for you to go and get some cakes. I said, I must not leave our place, my sister is ill, and my mother would beat me if I left the place; and he said, it would do the child good to take her out. So he reached my sister's bonnet down, and gave the sixpence to my sister, and told her to go, and said, now you go, meaning me, and he pushed my sister and me out, and shut the door; I was gone about ten minutes. I looked in at the window, and saw him go into the parlour; then I went and got the cakes, and then came back, and knocked at the door ever so long before I could get in, and when he opened the door, he said, he did not hear me.</p>

            . I am a constable, and went on Monday the 26th of February, to search for the prisoner, but did not find him; but as part of the ear-ring was produced to me, which I have now, and a clasp, and this key. Mrs. Fulmer gave me these things. I endeavoured to find out the property, but could not. I went round to all the pawnbrokers, and described the articles missing, and told them, should any thing be offered, they should detain the persons. I know nothing of the prisoner. The first time I saw him, was when he was in custody at Queen's-square.</p>

I missed my watch at night. I had two gold rings, two gold breast pins, and four silver clasps. The watch had a gold chain, seat and key. They were all in this desk. It was locked, and I kept the key in my pocket. I found the desk locked; I don't think my wife knew what was there. These were her earrings.</p>

On the 1st of August the prisoner brought a bundle of lint - she asked if I would allow her to mangle it; I asked her to walk in, and said I would do it myself - I placed the lint in the mangle, and at her request I left her to turn the mangle, whilst I went into the next room - I went into the room where the mangle was, about ten minutes after she was gone; I saw a basket of linen had been disturbed, but I did not miss any thing then - no one had been in after she left - I had seen her stooping towards the basket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.How were you able to see her? A. Quite well; I was standing against the door - she was touching the basket, and I thought she was placing the lint on it as she took it out of the mangle; I do not let my mangle out, but she had a particular wish to do it herself - I never saw any lint mangled before, and did not understand the nature of it.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK EDWARDS. I am a pawnbroker. I have two caps, which I took in of the prisoner on the 1st of August, for 2s. - I have known her two years, and am certain of her person; I believe her an honest good girl.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I took the prisoner to the pawnbroker's - she denied all knowledge of it, and said the pawnbroker must be mistaken.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

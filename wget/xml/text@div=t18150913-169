            . My premises were broken open on the night of the 18th of June last, after I went to bed. I saw the house fastened before I went to bed. The servants alarmed me the next morning, at half past seven; I found then the house had been broken open, and all these articles missing. In consequence of an information, I went to the house of the prisoner, and there found part of the ham; it is now in my possession, and in court. The prisoner told me he had found it, and shewed me the garden at Haggerstone, where he said he did find it. He told me that a gentleman had seen him take it out of the garden. The prisoner then went with me to my garden, and on trying, his foot exactly fitted the foot-marks in the mould in my garden.</p>

            . Early in the morning of the 19th of June, I saw the prisoner by Mr. Clanfield's house. The prisoner was coming along with a two horse cart. A ham was laying in Mr. Clanfield's garden. When the prisoner came up, I shewed it to him, and he got over the pales, and took it up; I remember it appeared as if it had been gnawed by some animal. He took it under his arm, and drove his horses on. I was dressed that morning in a pair of grey pantaloons, a blue coat, and a buff spotted waistcoat.</p>

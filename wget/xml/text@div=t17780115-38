I left my house on the 24th of December, at about eleven o'clock. I fastened up all the windows, and double-locked the door. I left no one in the house. On Saturday morning a neighbour came and informed me that my house was broke open; I went home, and found the parlour window shutter cut; there was a hole big enough to put one's hand through, and the bolt of the shutter was almost wrenched off, and it was wide open; two panes of glass were broke, and the inside shutter forced off, and it lay in the middle of the room. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) I found a tinder-box, a hammer, and a small iron crow in the room; I also found half of a twopenny loaf, and likewise a leg, a sidesman, and another small bone of a goose, that had been broiled.</p>

On Friday, the day after Christmas-day, I was fast asleep upon my box, having got a little liquor, it being holiday-time; Stevens came to me, and asked me if it was agreeable for me to go with him three or four miles; I said it was; I asked him where; he said to Chelsea; this was between eight and nine at night. He ordered me to drive to the George, Little St. Andrew's-street, Seven Dials, and call for a pint of beer, and he would come to me; I went there, and called for a pint of beer, and Pugh came in and took part of it, and paid for it; then he said we are ready; the company came, and got into the coach.</p>
               <p>Who were the company? - I could not see them then, it was dark, nor could I see what number there were; Griffiths got upon the box; the coach was full. Pugh went into the coach; at the end of George-street Stevens got out; he ordered me to drive to the Fighting Cocks in Dartmouth-street, Westminster; when we came to Dartmouth-street they all got out of the coach but Green; I was asked in with them.</p>

               <p>Did you see Green in the coach? - Yes; they had a cold goose, not quite done enough, they had some of it broiled; when they had supped they all got into the coach except Griffiths, who rode with me on the box. I was ordered to drive to the top of Church-lane, Chelsea; I went there; they got out of the coach, and Griffiths got off the box, and they ordered me to wait; there were six of them; one they call Bob is not taken. It was between eleven and twelve o'clock when I got to Church-street; I waited between two and three hours; then they all came back together with bundles; they got into the coach; Griffiths got on the box; I don't know how many bundles there were; I was sleepy, as I had been drinking; I drove them to the end of Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury; there three of them, Griffiths, Bob, and Green got down, and a woman, whom I don't know, got into the coach, the other three stayed in; then I was ordered to drive to the end of Petticoat-lane, Whitechapel; there they took the bundles out, and discharged me, and Pugh said he would see me the next day, and pay me for my trouble; I saw no more of them till Monday night,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150028"></xptr> then I saw Harvey, who they call Bob, and he paid me 15 s.</p>
               <p>You say you had been drinking that day, was you sober enough to know the circumstances you have related? - I had been drinking, it was holiday-time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you know upon what errand they were going to Chelsea? - No; they never said a word to me about it; they asked me to go to Chelsea; I said I would.</p>
               <p>You had been drinking that day, and was very sleepy? - Yes, I was asleep when they spoke to me on the box.</p>
               <p>What size were the bundles? - I did not take notice of them, I was on the box.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice how many there were? - No.</p>

               <p>I keep the Fighting Cocks, a public house, in Dartmouth-street, Westminster; I have looked at the prisoners, but I don't remember them; I remember a company coming to my house the day after Christmas-day; they had all great coats, silk handkerchiefs, and flapped hats on; they asked for a room to eat some supper in; I told them I had no room, there was a good box in the taproom; they sat down, and asked for knives and forks, and a plate to put a goose upon; they began to cut it up, but they cut it up very awkwardly; I bid them cut it in the middle. I said it was very badly done, if they would give it me I would take it into the kitchen, and my wife should cut it up and broil it for them; they said they were very much obliged to me. While my wife was broiling it they ordered a pot of beer; I brought it, and asked for the money; they asked if it was the custom to ask for the money first; I told them it was in holiday time.</p>
               <p>Do you know how many there were? - Not the exact number; I thought there were eight or nine, my wife said six or seven. I can remember none of their faces, nor none of their persons, nor could I remember any of their faces before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they eat all the goose? - No; while I was taking money for some beer, I saw them wrap some of it up, and put it into their pockets, but what part I cannot tell.</p>

On the Sunday after Christmas, at about twelve at noon, as I was on the stand in Broad St. Giles's, I was called down by Griffiths and Pugh, and then Griffiths, Pugh, Sidey, and Green got into the coach, and ordered me to drive to Petticoat-lane, Whitechapel; when we got there Griffiths staid with me; we went and had a pot of purl; the others returned in about twenty minutes, and they got in, and I drove them to Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury.</p>

               <p>Is Sidey a woman of the town? - I suppose so.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Is your master here? A. No; he is well enough to come to town; he lives in Suffolk- I knew the colt well; my master sometimes buys and sells horses - I do not know a man named Johnson; I have heard of him, and heard he deals in horses; I cannot say whether he might have taken this horse on sale from my master; I am quite certain I knew the horse again - the place I missed it from was about seven miles from Norwich.</p>

            . I remember this colt being brought to the Fountain inn, Lower Clapton, by the prisoner, on the last day of April - he was on the back of it when he came to me and asked if I had any stabling - I said Yes, and he put it into the stables; I asked how long he was going to stop - he said he might stop, perhaps, till Monday, and said he suspected it was going to Dixon's; he did not offer it for sale, or any thing of that kind - he might say he was going to take it to Dixon's, and he said he expected there were two or three coming up besides; I did not see any one else - I am not able to say whether he said he himself was going to take it to Dixon's, but he said it was to go to Dixon's; I did make my mark to my deposition before the Magistrate, and what I stated before Mr. Alderman Kelly was true, to the best of my knowledge - the prisoner took out the colt to exercise it; he did not seem to keep it concealed in any way - he took it out with a halter to walk it about in the main road; he had no opportunity to take the horse to the repository- he did say he was to take it to the repository on the Monday, but it was swollen under the girths, on Mon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120024"></xptr>day and he said he should not take it till such time as the swelling went down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the horse rather unwell? A. He broke out with heat bumps, and the prisoner led him about; he said he was going to Dixon's repository, and he expected two or three more to come up, but he did not say that horse was going with others - he said he expected two or three more were coming up, but whether he expected them to come there or not, I do not know; the Fountain is opposite Clapton-green, near the reservoir- the prisoner never crossed the horse from the time he brought him into the yard; he walked it to and for in the main road; he never offered it for sale, to my knowledge- I never heard him say a word about Mr. Johnson; he said he expected a person there - he said the horse came from towards Norwich.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is not Glapton the high Norfolk road? A. am not able to say whether that, or the Romford road, is- the mail does not go through there, but the Telegraph and the Magnet do; I do not know how many miles it is from there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (written) I knew nothing of the horse being stolen; it was placed with me to bring to town from Norwich, by a horse-dealer, whom I had seen for several years at the Norwich market, and whom I knew; I knew him by the name of Johnson - in case I had had the least idea that the horse had been stolen from the prosecutor's farm, I would immediately have delivered it to the owner, or Tann, who has known me ever since my childhood, and he well knows that there never was at any time the least charge against my character; I lived at Dunston, in Norfolk, till within the last two years, when I left there and obtained a situation with Mr. Edenborough, of Milk-street, with whom I remained one year - I then went to Mr. Sampson's, and remained with him till I went into the country, and was entrapped into my present unfortunate situation: on the 13th of April I left London to see my relatives, at Wilbarton, in Norfolk - I remained with them till the 27th of April, when I went to Norwich for the purpose of taking the coach to London; I went to a public-house, in St. Stephen's, Norwich - I there saw Johnson, and told him I was going to London; after some conversation, he said he was going to Dixon's repository in London, and I might ride one horse there for him; I slept there that night, and the next morning he placed the horse in question saddled and bridled, in my hands, and said he should catch me on the road before I got to London, this was on the 28th of April - I took the horse and proceeded to London very slowly, expecting Johnson to overtake me; he did not, and I arrived at Lower Clapton, on Saturday, the 30th, at eight o'clock, by day-light; I asked the other to accommodate me till Monday - I told him I brought the horse from Norwich, and how long I was going to stop; he has told you I was not at all private - I led the horse about publicly, and did not secrete myself for one moment; the horse was unwell, and I led him about several days, waiting for Johnson; he did not come, and I took the saddle, went to Dixon's, and inquired for him - I could not hear any thing of him; I then went to Mr. Duffield in the morning; I left the saddle there, called again in the evening, and was given in charge of a constable - had I have been guilty I should not have gone a second time; these are the facts of the case - I did not steal it, it was placed with me by Johnson; I am innocent of the charge, and look with confidence to your verdict for my acquittal - this is the first charge against me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a public-house broker, and live at 614, Old Kent-road—on the night of 21st July, I was with Mr. Fisk, and met Mrs. Mandy and Mrs. White—we went to Mrs. Mandy's house—I followed Mr. Fisk in—I did not go in with him at first—I went down stairs, and found there Mrs. Mandy, Mrs. White, the servant, and the prisoner—I heard Mrs. Mandy tell the prisoner to leave the house—I understood him that he had come right there, but I did not rightly understand him—ho spoke with a foreign accent—Mrs. Mandy asked me to stay there—the prisoner sent out for some wine—I fetched it—he paid for it—that was just upon twelve</p>

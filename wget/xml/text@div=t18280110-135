The prisoner was in my employ, helping my apprentice to work a loom, on the 9th of December; my own work was on another loom, in the same room; there were about eight yards and a half of velvet; on Sunday night, the 9th of December, I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock, and left the prisoner up - my wife told him to fasten the back door - he said he would - we had fastened the front - I was awoke about four in the morning, by my child, who had the small-pox; I struck a light, and feeling wind, I went into the next room, and missed the prisoner from his bed - Hindmarsh, my apprentice, was there asleep - I awoke him - I then went into my work-shop, and missed the velvet from my loom; a box there was broken open; the stockings and other things were taken out - they were safe on Sunday.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Sample. On the 9th of December, at night, the prisoner told me, if he were to cut the velvet out of the loom, it would not be my master who could punish him, but the person belonging to the velvet; after I was in bed, he came and put two plums into my month, and gave me two apples - I saw him take a table-cloth from our room; he put a walking-stick against the door; he went up into the shop, came down, and came to bed with his clothes on, and about a quarter to four o'clock he took his hat and the stick, and went away; my master came into the room in about a quarter of an hour.</p>

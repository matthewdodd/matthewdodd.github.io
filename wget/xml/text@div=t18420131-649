At half-past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th of January, I was in the Strand—I had a reticule containing a pocket hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and a purse containing two sovereigns, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—Beckett told me I had been robbed of my purse, and pointed out the prisoner—I</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Miller, a cabinet-maker, of Marchmont-street. On the 13th of January, between nine and ten o'clock, I was passing through Wilsted-street, and as I crossed the road Edwards called me, and gave me information - I then went into the middle of the road, and saw a tall young man, with his clothes splashed with whitening, opposite a broken pane of glass, at the prosecutor's shop window; the prisoner and two young women were near him; the prisoner was within a yard of him; I saw the tall man put a wire into the broken pane, and pull out some parcels, which he gave to the prisoner; they appeared like cards. About a fortnight after I saw the prisoner in Tavistock-place - he was not taken then - I was confident of him. When I saw this done I ran and told a watchman; he came to the shop, but the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050020"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You looked very attentively round the Court before you could point out the prisoner? A. I did not look at the bar; the boy, who pointed him out to me in the street, said before the Magistrate, that he did not know whether the prisoner was the person; I have talked to some of my companions about this; I have no recollection of saying I expected any thing if the prisoner was transported; I will not swear I never said I expected money for it; I am sixteen years old.</p>

            . I am a brass-founder, and live with my father in Wilsted-court. I saw two young men standing by the prosecutor's window, between nine and ten o'clock at night; I think one of them had a piece of wire in his hands - I cannot say which, as I did not take much notice - I told the witness, and then went on an errand - I could not distinguish their persons, as I did not take much notice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you point out two boys to Brown? A. I said, "Look over there, at those young men;" I told the Magistrate I would not swear whether the prisoner was one of them or not.</p>

On 9th Sept., between six and eight at night, I was at Deptford-bridge, watching the prisoners—Sarah went into a great many shops, the others waited outside, sometimes twenty and sometimes thirty yards off—she went to Mr. Winch, Trafalgar-row—I saw a bottle of ginger-beer put on the counter—she laid down a shilling—the land<lb></lb>lady took away the ginger-beer, and she took up the shilling—they had some conversation—Mrs. Winch put up a glass of ale, which she drank—Mrs. Winch gave her some money from the till, and she left—I inquired, came out, and followed the prisoners to another public-bouse, and then to the railway, where I took them—I told them they were charged with obtaining money at various shops by false pretences—they said they did not knowwhat I meant—I re<lb></lb>peated it—Sarah said, "The shopkeeper was a great fool if she did not get the shilling"—I searched John and found a number of aricles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Winch, who keeps a beer-shop at Trafalgar-row, Greenwich. On 9th Sept. the female prisoner came and asked for a bottle of ginger-beer—I served her—she laid down a shilling and asked if I had a fourpenny-piece—I said I had not, and gave sixpence and fourpence—she said she wanted penny beer—I said I did not tell it—I missed the shilling, and gave her another, supposing I must have takenit—she said she would have a glass of ale—I gave her a glass and tenpenee—she gave me a shilling—I afterwards found I was a shilling short.</p>

            . I live in Swan-street, Minories. On Wednesday, the 15th of February, between six and seven (nearer seven) o'clock, I went to Mr. Elkins', to spend the evening - it was dark - it is a private house; Mrs. Elkin let me in, and, to the best of my knowledge, the door was shut after me; I went into the kitchen, which is even with the street door - a door leads from the kitchen into the passage, and then into the parlour; Mrs. Elkin went into the back parlour to look for her handkerchief - Mr. Elkin was up stairs - I was alone in the kitchen; Mrs. Elkin left the kitchen door open and I had a view of the passage - I heard a rustling, and, knowing she was gone up stairs, I cast my eye into the passage, and saw a man come out of the front parlour - I called out Stop thief! and got up immediately; I cannot say, in my fright, whether he had to open the door, but he ran out - I ran out, calling Stop thief! but returned without catching him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the evening in question I let Mrs. Green in; she knocked at the door - it opens with a spring-lock; I shut the door after her, to the best of my recollection - it always shuts very easy; I went up stairs for my handkerchief, and heard a cry of Thief! I ran down - I had put a key into the lock of the street door that day, inside, and when I came down we looked at the door and the key was just falling out.</p>

            . I have been in the army, and occupy this house, which is in Stepney parish. On the 15th of February I had been out, and when I came home I took out my silver watch, gold chain, two gold seals, and a gold key, my gold chased ring off my finger, a silver pencil-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060020"></xptr>case, and pen-knife, and laid them on the front parlour table; I saw them there before dark, about half-past five - when I shut up the front parlour window.

            . I belong to the Thames police. On Thursday, the 16th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, I and Wilson were in Shadwell-market, and saw the prisoner there, with one Murray; one of them turned round - they looked at us, and spoke together; Murray then crossed over to the left hand side, and the prisoner went strait on; I took hold of him - he asked what I wanted him for - I said he knew, and told him about another robbery; I took him into a public-house, and when we got into the parlour, he said "Jeffery, I will give you what I have got;" he then pulled up his waistcoat, and pulled out a watch, which he said he had found last night; in his left-hand pocket I found a pen-knife, a gold finger ring, 4s. 6d. in bad money, and a good sixpence - he said he had found them all together. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Jeffery, and took Murray into the tap-room of the public-house; I went into the parlour and asked the prisoner where he had been last night - he said he had slept with Murray - I asked where - he said at Murray's father's, in Shadwell-market; Murray had said something to me, in consequence of which I brought them together, and said to Murray "You told me you had only met Sullivan at the corner of the street, and that you knew nothing of him; Sullivan tells me he slept with you at your father's;" Murray then said "If he did sleep with me I know nothing of what he has got;" we had not told Murray we had found the watch on him. On taking them down to a public-house in Lower Shadwell, which had been robbed, I told Sullivan he had not had the watch the morning before; he said No, he had only had them an hour and an half; he told me on the road that he had found them in Stepney. I had seen them together the morning before the robbery, and searched them both. The bill against Murray has been thrown out by the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you brought them together Murray did not deny having slept with him? A. No; he said he knew nothing of what Sullivan had got, before I told him he had any thing.</p>
               <p>MR. ELKIN. The watch, chain, ring, seal, pen-knife, and every thing, are mine.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

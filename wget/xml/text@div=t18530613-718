                  </hi>. I live at No. 39, Beech-street, Barbican. I conduct the business for Mr. William Sharp, a pawnbroker—the prisoner has been in Mr. Sharp's employ for about three weeks—on Saturday, 4th June, I came down stairs between 8 and 9 o'clock; before I came down I heard five parcels thrown down the well—they fell in the shop—one of them was a pair of boots—I was told they were pledged for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the well is at the too of the house—I looked into the box where the tickets were put, and found the ticket for the boots Was not there—I found four other tickets—I looked round the shop for that ticket; I did not find it—I asked the prisoner if he had delivered a pair of boots for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., given them out—he said, "I believe I have"—I Asked him for the ticket—he made no answer—I told him he knew where it ought to be—I could not find it, and told him to see if he could—he took out the box where the tickets should have been put, and looked in it—the boots were under a case under the counter—his countenance told me where the ticket was, and I told him to turn out his pockets—he told me he should not do so—I told him if he would not turn them out I would go in the parlour, send for an officer, and have them turned out for him—he said he should not go any further, and was going down stairs—while I was laying hold of him, and struggling, he took the ticket out, and threw it down; I picked it up, and gave him into custody—there was money missing, and that was the reason I suspected him; eighteen pence one night.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185306130046"></xptr>
               <p>at all—I told him the second day that he was of no use to me, and as soon as I got suited he should leave—he did not say he did not want to suit me—as foreman, I am master—the night before this I heard him and the maid servant laughing, and I told the girl it was not proper conduct—this was between 10 and 11 o'clock—I was not listening—I came down to do up the street door and heard the young man and the girl giggling together—he did not say, if he had known I had been listening he would have pitched me down stairs—I have no books here—I put the accounts together—there was nothing offered at that time in the morning—there were two lads in the employ besides this man, one up stairs, and one down—there was a young man of the name of Franks in the shop—as regards this ticket, it goes in a bag <hi rend="italic">up the spout</hi>—we ring a bell at the bottom, and a little boy at the top throws the parcel down with the ticket—I was unfriendly with the prisoner because I was deceived, and he would not suit me—he did not come from Wingfield.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer belonging the Thames police office. I know nothing further than apprehending the prisoner on the 18th of October. He knew me perfectly well, he saw me very early in the morning out of the window, he asked me if I had got a warrant against him, I told him I had, he immediately bid his wife open the door and let me in, I was so far satisfied of his innocence, that I took his word and his attorney's for his appearance, he knew the charge was for stealing a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no right to take his word for his appearance, you did very wrong, we are not trying the prisoner by your opinion of him, have you the watch. - A. No, the watch was brought to the office by Strong, and claimed at the office by Languist.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH KING sworn. I live in Cinnamon street, Wapping, I keep the sign of the White-hart, Languist lodged with me, on the 10th of October about four o'clock, he drank tea with me.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he left your house, do you know whether he had a watch or not. - A. I am quite sure that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he drank tea with you, was he sober or not. - A. Yes, he was as sober as I am at this minute, I heard that he was arrested at seven o'clock, I went then to the lock-up house, I was then informed that he had lost his watch, he said he supposed it was taken from him by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not know any thing about the watch, I never saw the lame man in my life, (Henry Strong) they they have got a spite to me and that is they reason the have done it; I came of a respectable family, I think myself better than to do such things as them. The prosecutor said when I was down along with him for that you show me to the officer, I shall do you a spite again; I do not think that he could do any more spite to me than he has done.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JENN sworn. Examined by Mr. Alley. You are a sheriff's officer for Middlesex. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand the prisoner accompanied you and pointed out the prosecutor for you to arrest him - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in the street it was about five o'clock, what distance was it from the public house that you found the prisoner at your house. - A, About three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. It was quite daylight. - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing the conduct of the prisoner during the time that you were on the journey to your house. - A. I was close behind him, arm in-arm with the attorney's clerk. I think he could not have robbed the man without my seeing of him.</p>

               <p>Q.When you went into the public house, how many women were there. - A. Eight or ten, or more than that; the moment that Ammers shook<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290053"></xptr>hands with him, a number of women got around him and he was arrested by Ammers. I said no, it is Johnson, I dare say there was forty women and sailors in the house together. I never heard that the watch was lost till after he was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he was not certain where he lost it. - A. Yes, sometimes he said he did not know, but he might have lost it among the sailors, and the women that were there; he said many times that when he got out he would be revenged of the prisoner one way or the other for showing him to the officer.</p>

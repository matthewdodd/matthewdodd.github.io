On the 12th of December, about half past three in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my house and walked up the three pair of stairs; the street door is generally open. She stripped my son's bed of two blankets, two sheets, and two pieces of carpet; I I saw her coming down the second pair of stairs with a bundle in the front of her gown; I asked her who she wanted. she said one Mrs. Parsons that lodged there; I told her I had no woman lodger in my house; I was suspicious, as she had such a great bundle before her, that she had robbed my son's bed; I asked her what she had got, she said she had some things for Mrs. Parsons; I told her to come down and let me see what she had got for Mrs. Parsons; she came down with the things, she said you may see if you like what I have got; I looked in her lap, I perceived she had got my blankets, sheets, and carpeting; I put my fist up, I said you wretch, you have been up three pair of stairs and robbed me of my bedding. I took hold of the things and in vexation I tossed them into the room and she ran down stairs. Mr.

            . On the 26th of February I and my family were sitting at tea in the parlour; this barometer was in the shop, behind the door, for sale; the prisoner, whom I knew by sight, came in and took it off by force; I said, "Let that alone - what are you going to do with it?" but he would insist upon taking it, and went off with it - I did not know his name, nor where he lived - he ran up the street - I followed him, with three others of my family; I did not see him taken - I saw him put the barometer down at Mr. Allardyce's door.</p>

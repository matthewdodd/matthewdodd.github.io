I found the trowsers and a yard of calico in the kitchen where Seares lodges; his mother was shewing them to a person as her son's property; and on Thursday I took him - I could not find him before; he kept from home; he lives at Sunbury, about a mile and a half from where the robbery was committed.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Sunbury. I was with King when he bought the clothes; and about three o'clock that afternoon saw the prisoners with his bundle - I knew it to be the same - it was tied in a large red handkerchief. I told King of it half an hour after. I saw Westbrook with it at first. I knew them both before.</p>

               <p>WESTBROOK'S Defence. Seares' father told me, if I should meet him, to tell him to come home. I saw him in the brick field, and asked why he did not buy some things his father told him to buy; he said he had; he took me down the lane, and threw the bundle over a hedge to me - I returned it to him.</p>

On the 24th of April, I received information and description of four men, by Jackson and another young man: I know none of the prisoners: I thought the description applied to a Jew. On Wednesday, the 26th, I was sent for: the evidence, Smith, was at his house: White was then in custody at Jackson's: I went and took the prisoner Smith; he turned evidence; and he told me of the other persons, and where these implements were to be found; I took him with me into the field; and in a hallow tree he said there was the chisels; I got up there, and found they were gone; then he looked for this cutlass and this crow, that were hid in the hedge, and a little hay thrown over them; they were gone; then he took me to a little place in the field, and there was this dark lanthorn hid; that I found: then I went and took Isaacs into custody: I went afterwards with Maxfield to the same field; that was to the same tree that Smith took me to: Smith, the accomplice, shewed me the very same spot where Maxfield told me he found the crow. On the 29th, I took Read and another in company, close by where Jackson lives. On the Saturday, I took Jenkinson at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found that relates to this subject, on either of the prisoners? - No: Isaacs gave me these things.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260013"></xptr>When did you see any thing of those persons again after that morning? - At night, in the public house; I think there were three together; and then afterwards came another.</p>
               <p>Who were the three? - I think it was Jenkinson and Read; and I cannot take upon me to say whether it was Mr. White or not: but Smith came down afterwards: Smith came down; but I never saw him in the public house; he was in the street.</p>
               <p>Was White either at the public house, or in the street? - My lord, it is a very hard question to resolve you; I cannot take upon me to swear.</p>
               <p>Did you pay any body any thing that evening? - I did: I paid Mr. Smith on Mr. Isaac's account, two guineas and a half in gold, and one half guinea in silver; I think there was six and six-pence left; and they were to come the next day for it. Mr. Smith came the next day, and he was paid.</p>
               <p>Had you any share in the bargain? - Not a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Did Isaacs re-pay you your money? - He did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow There is honour among -</p>
               <p>Jury. Did Isaacs pay you any interest for the use of the money? - Not a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>When you saw the three men in the public house first, are you sure these three prisoners are the persons? - I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Court. As you are not sure to White, are you sure of the other two? - I am positive.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them before? - I never saw them before; but I saw them three times within the two days.</p>
               <p>Jury. You knew what bargain Isaacs had made with them, and what it was for? - He told me he had bought a parcel of goods to the amount of four pounds ten and six-pence.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Recollect it is your duty to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, and the whole truth? - I will.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of breaking into this house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who were the persons concerned in it? - The three prisoners and me.</p>
               <p>When did you first agree to go on that business? - On the same night.</p>
               <p>When was that? - It was Friday night.</p>
               <p>What Friday? - It is a month ago last Friday; it was the 23d of April.</p>
               <p>Where did you meet that night? - At my lodging.</p>
               <p>Where did you live? - In Camomile-street, which I have not left. I had a small house near Jenkinson's, which I was going to live at.</p>
               <p>What time did you meet together? - In the afternoon and evening; we were drinking at Mr. Jackson's skettle-ground.</p>
               <p>Had you been there on any former evening? - I never was in the skettle-ground, to my knowledge, before; I had been in the house once, in company with the man I took the house of; his name is Skettles; we staid there till dark, or near upon dark; till about seven at night.</p>
               <p>What became of you after that? - We went home to my lodging in Camomile-street. We sent White away to this little house, to stay there till we came to him, which was about twelve o'clock, at the back of Mr. Jackson's skettle-ground. Read, Jenkinson, and me, went to White; he was asleep: then I went and looked at Jackson's; he was not in bed, and we came home: at two o'clock, Jenkinson got over Jackson's pales; there was no light then; there was a light at twelve; I followed Jenkinson, and Read followed me: White continued in the little house; our dark lanthorn was so very hot (the candle was so very thick, it heated the lanthorn) we were obliged to put out the candle; it rained very hard: Read and me shoved up the cellar window, and put a chisel in; then we broke the bolt: White never was in the yard at all; he staid in the small house till we brought every thing to him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260014"></xptr>the small house joined the skettle-ground; he waited to lend a hand away with the things.</p>
               <p>Supposing there had been any alarm, could he have afforded you any assistance from that place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was that small house situated, by Jackson's? - It joined the skettle-ground; only a small passage parted.</p>
               <p>So that he was as handy there, as if he had been with you? - Yes; and out of sight.</p>
               <p>Did White know the purpose you was upon? - We made an agreement to do it, in the evening; we all supped together; then we went up the cellar stairs, and let Jenkinson in at the back door; the cellar door was open; then I got a gimblet that was on the stair-case, and fastened the staircase door, that nobody should come down stairs; it was a cooper's gimblet, which we found on the stair-case: while I was doing that, Read went in and brought out a milk-pot and some spoons; then we all three went in together, and got all these things; the till and all; then we took them over to my house, and packed them all in a box; we took the money and the candles we had taken, and put them in a bundle, and put the things into the box: then Read and I went forward; Read had the plate, and I some of the candles; we went back again; we thought we had left the money behind; White put the box of candles on his head; and Jenkinson put the money in his pocket: White was in the passage of my little house; then we all came away to Isaacs: White carried the box; I had nothing; I gave

             the candles which I had: Jenkinson had the money; we sold these things to Isaacs; I made the bargain, because he could not deal with us, all talking together; he gave two guineas for the clothes, six shillings for the candles, forty shillings for ten ounces of plate; and for the silver handled knives and forks, half a crown.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Isaacs make a good hard bargain? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Were you paid? - No; they gave me a guinea; he borrowed it of Sakie in silver; it was given to me; we all went away. White was sent away as soon as he had brought the box; we were to call again in the evening, for the rest: we went to Leadenhall-market, to a house that was up, and had a pot of beer; then we went and bought some steaks for breakfast; we breakfasted together; in the afternoon, I was gone out, and Read and Jenkinson went to get the money; but he would not pay it to any body, till we were all together; then he paid us all together: when I came there, Read and Jenkinson were waiting: White was with me all the day; but he was not with me at the place, when I received the money; I left him at home at my place, while I went for the money in the evening; I got two guineas and a half, and some silver; and they said there was six and sixpence due; I was very much in liquor; I went the next morning for it, and they would not pay any body; for we had a quarrel and a fight, about not parting the money, in the middle of the street; we went home to my house, and parted the money.</p>
               <p>Had you any implements? - Yes; there was a pistol and crow, a dark-lanthorn, and two chisels.</p>
               <p>Whose were they? - Read bought the chisels.</p>
               <p>What did you do with these, after you committed the burglary? - White and I went and hid them in the field, while Read and Jenkinson were counting the money.</p>
               <p>You afterwards described to Shakeshaft, the place where you placed them, before the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the place where White and you took them to? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any cutlass? - Yes; it came out of the house; it was in the hedge.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Isaacs? - About a month.</p>
               <p>When was you taken into custody? - On the Whit-Sunday after the robbery: White and me were together; then I gave information against the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260015"></xptr>What did you do with the light that you had in the house? - We left it burning on the dresser, and the gimblet still in the door.</p>
               <p>Jury. What part of the dresser did you leave the candle in? - At the corner of the dresser.</p>
               <p>Not near a shelf? - No; we left it to give a light: the pistol belonged to one Selwood, over the water; and I borrowed it.</p>
               <p>Was it loaded? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you cohabited with these people? - I have known them some time; but I have been acquainted with them about a fortnight. Jenkinson lived at Lambeth, with his sister. White lived over the water: I took this small house, to keep out of the way of every body, that nobody should know where I went to; that I might work, and nobody know me: I am a cooper.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Jackson deposes to the jacket and great coat.)</p>
               <p>This is my wife's cloak: one large damask table-cloth; there is my name at full length; the other is not marked; one of the sheets, I believe, is marked with H. M. or E.; I believe them to be my property; the knives and forks, and cutlass, I am sure to.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jackson. This cloak is my property; I know it by a piece; the jacket is mine, and the large table-cloth; I believe all the articles to be mine.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. Was it day-light, at the time this business was transacted? - No, Sir, it was not day-light; it was about two o'clock, when we returned the second time.</p>
               <p>Was it quite dark? - Yes: it rained, and was very dark.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long have you had this small house of Jackson's? - Since Easter.</p>
               <p>Who projected this robbery? - We all agreed upon it together.</p>

               <p>My witnesses are not here; I told you so.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was you at the time this robbery was done? - I was at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Have you any body to prove that fact? - No: I told you if you would put it off till to-morrow morning.</p>
               <p>What business do you follow? - A stay-maker.</p>
               <p>PRISONER READ's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I laid at my mother's that night.</p>

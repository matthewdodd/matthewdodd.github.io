                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old. I went into the service of Mr. Davis on the 10th of May, 1840—he then kept the coffee-house—when Mr. Markwell took the house I continued there, first as billiard-marker, then as junior porter—the prisoner came into Mr. Davis's service after me—I remember Blyth being discharged—I and the prisoner slept in the same room—one night the prisoner said, "We must do something for Blyth, we must get some wine"—after that, about five o'clock one Sunday morning, he said he was going to get some wine out of the cellar, and asked me to go—I went down with him as far as the last landing—I would not go any further—he went into the subscription-room, and got a map-stick with a book at the</p>

               <p>end—he told me to come on—I said I would not, I was frightened—he called me a coward, and told me, if I would not go down, to stop there, and not to whistle, but to cough, if any body came—I stopped there—he went to the bar, then went into the cellar—he told me he could put the stick over the beer-engine into the bar, and draw back one of the window-bolts of the bar, then he could get the keys, and get the wine out of the cellar—he took the stick with him when he went towards the bar—he then went into the cellar, came up again, and had four bottles of wine—he went up towards the bed-room—he told me to go into the cellar, and I should find two more—I went down, and saw two bottles at the bottom of the steps—I took them up stain into my bed-room—four bottles were put into a lumber-closet, one we put into a box, and one we drank directly—the prisoner said we had better drink it, as it was a broken one—I drank some of the other that day, and at different times afterwards, up stairs in the bed-room—Bryan was with me when I drank some—the prisoner was afterwards dismissed—I was never taken up-after we had drunk the wine, we used to take the empty bottles down in our pockets, to be put into the empty-bottle crate, and sometimes we left them on the landing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first give information? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till I told Bryan, five weeks ago—he had left Mr. Markwell's service—when he drank the wine he merely called to see the servants—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther my master knew he was there—the housekeeper did—I or the prisoner asked him up into the bed-room, as I was going out with him—he did not know it was my master's wine—there was some in a bottle—I will swear there was not more than a bottle—it was a whole bottle I took out of the box—he came about twelve o'clock, and staid about an hour—be went oh the leads, and I gave him some wine on the leads in a glass—I did not say where or how I got it, and he did not ask—that was the first time I had given him wine—the prisoner was there—I went out with Bryan to a good many places—after that I went to the Golden-cross, Charing-cross, to wait for him—he was then living at Morley's hotel—he had to be in at such a time, and he was to come out again in an hour—I went into the tap-room, and staid till nine o'clock in the evening—I did not see him any more that day—I went to see another old fellow-servant, who lived near the Angel, Islington, before we went to Morley's.</p>

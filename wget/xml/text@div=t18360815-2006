On Wednesday evening, the 6th of July, from five to six o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming down the Westminster-road with a young infant in her arms—she had two little girls, very young, by the side of her—she put the little boy across the little girl's lap, and said, "I am going for change; I will come back"—she turned very quick and walked off—I had some suspicions, and told the girls not to leave the child till I came back—I went her, and came up with her—I said, "Where are</p>

            . About five or six Weeks ago I had been out about some Business, and had drank too much, and the Prisoner enticed me from Place to Place, to go to her Lodging with her. Accordingly she took me to a House in Rag-Fair, and there picked my Pocket while I lay backwards on the Bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you seize her?</p>
               <p>Herne . It was two or three Hours afterwards before I could, for she ran out of the House. My Money was in three Papers, and I had put it into a Bag to pay three Persons that I dealt with.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business are you?</p>
               <p>Herne. I am Master of a small Vessel, and trade from London to Ipswich; and this Money I brought from Ipswich to pay away - I have never had it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going through Rag Fair for a Pound of Mutton Stakes, and met the Prosecutor , he was pulling some Women about, and me among the rest. I asked him what he wanted? he said so and so, and went to be rude with me, but I got from him. He watched me Home, and I was no sooner got up Stairs but he followed me, and swore he would lie with me. There was another Woman in the Room, whom he desired to fetch a full Pot of Beer. I told him I would go myself, and he gave me a Shilling, and I brought him the Change.</p>
               <p>Herne. There was another Woman in the Room, but the Prisoner was the Person that did the Fact, and we never had any Drink, or any Thing at all. <rs id="t17411204-3-verdict13" type="verdictDescription">

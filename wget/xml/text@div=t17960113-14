            </rs>.(The Case was opened by Mr. Fielding.)</p>
               <p>EDWARD ROGERS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer of the Police office, Shadwell: On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130030"></xptr>the 8th or 9th of October, I had directions from the magistrates to look after people in this line; I was passing in Great Queen-street, and saw Mr. Kay, and Mr. Barber who has been convicted, and Mr. Nichols, from Birmingham, standing at the King's-head door, they spoke to me; and we went in together to drink in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass respecting any transaction? - A. Yes; between Barber and I, and the prisoner was in company in the tap-room; I am not certain the prisoner heard what passed; it was said to me in a whisper, Kay, and Barber and I were sitting altogether in a box, and Barber whispered to me, and then whispered to Kay what he had said to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him? - A. I saw him whisper to him, and then he whispered to me again; Kay went away, and I saw him again in about three quarters of an hour after, in Robins's auction-room, Covent-garden, he was sitting at the table, and purchased some lots of plate, but no conversation took place till he came out to the door; then Nichols, Barber, Kay and I, went to a public-house near the Seven-dials; Kay, Barber and I then spoke relative to the money Barber had told me of before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Kay heard what was said? - A. Yes; I told him I wanted some of the whites, meaning sixpences I had been speaking to Barber of, and asked what time I could have them; Barber, Kay and I agreed to meet at eight in the evening, at the house we had been previously at, in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields; Barber mentioned the terms, and Kay and I agreed to it; we agreed for fifty sixpences for a guinea; I agreed to the terms.</p>
               <p>Q. What part did Kay take in this? - A. He mentioned the hour of meeting; I was to have twenty-five for half a guinea; I said that was a small quantity; they both said they were of a superior quality half copper and half silver; I went to Great Queen-street in the evening, according to appointment; Barber and Kay were in the tap-room; Barber whispered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear him? - A. I cannot pretend to swear he did; when Barber and I had agreed, we went into the kitchen, and I gave him half a guinea, and he delivered me the twenty-five sixpences; we returned to the tap-room, and Barber handed the half guinea to Kay; Barber told me he could let me have twenty-five more; we went again into the kitchen, and I gave Barber a guinea; we returned to the tap-room, and Barber handed the guinea to Kay, saying, you owe Mr. Rogers half a guinea; accordingly Mr. Kay put his hand in his pocket, and handed me half a guinea. (The sixpences were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You communicated this at the Magistrate's office? - A. Yes, immediately. On the 16th of October, I went with Armstrong, and some other officers, and pointed out Kay, at the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days intervened, between the transaction and the apprehending them? - A. The transaction was the 8th, and this was the 16th; that night I had to go to other places; and the next morning I went to the Magistrates.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To whom did you say you wanted the whites? - A. To both; but Barber was the most active.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say it so that Kay could hear it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Barber proposed to give you fifty for a guinea? - A. Yes. I wanted more, at the house at the Seven Dials, and they both refused to give me any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Kay was not in the kitchen when the twenty-five sixpences were given for the half-guinea? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor when the other twenty-five were given for the guinea? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. This man surrenders this sessions to be tried, for this charge, a second time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Although the agreement was entered into between you, Barber, and Kay, at one place, yet at the time the money was put off to you, was Kay present? - A. No; he was not.</p>
               <p>Court. In this case, it does not appear that the prisoner was present at the time of putting off this money; and the putting off is a personal act; which a person must do himself, or be present at the putting off, which is not the case here.</p>

The shop street - door was only bolted at the bottom, they are folding-doors - They were bolted at the top the night before; any person could bolt those bolts when outside; by slamming the doors they would fall into the holes. The wire-guard over the skylight in the back-parlour, was taken up, and a pane of glass taken out; there were marks of feet, as if they had come down that way.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of August I took the prisoner into custody in Rupert-street; he said he had slept in the Park the night before - He had only 1s. 6d. about him; he said he had paid a man in the room twelve shillings; I asked him where he got it; he said he received a 1l. note from Mr. Baynam, No. 8, Little Nelson-street, City-road. I took Mr. Baynam to him, and the prisoner said he had the money of him; Mr. Baynam said, "I cannot admit that, for if I say so, I must swear to it." He then said he knew he had told me an untruth, but he had received 3l. from a woman who was now married to a publican over Blackfriars Bridge, that she had lived two years with Mr. Brand, and her name was Mary; he could not say where she lived, or what her name was now. On the Monday following I found a pair of stockings on his legs with the tops cut off, which Mrs. Nicholay claimed.</p>

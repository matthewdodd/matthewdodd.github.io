On the 13th of May, I gave him 4 sovereigns and a 10l. note, to pay the journeymen's wages; I told him particularly to pay the men, and to see that each man paid his score; this was more than he had to pay them, and he brought me 6s. 4d. as change, within ten minutes after he had the money - I never saw him again till I was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. How long had he been in your employ? A. Only four days - he came from the society of tailors; he never informed me that in going to get change he had lost the note; he said before the Magistrate, that he went to my sons, and told them he had lost the note, and they offered to take 1l. a week of him - but I knew nothing of it.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody about half-past eleven o'clock that Saturday night, for absconding with the money. I saw him standing in the Broadway, Westminster, and he said to me "What induced you to come down here?" I then explained to him - some men come past whom I knew; I called to one of them named Morgan - the prisoner then ran off and I pursued him - the watchman took him, and he was taken to the watch-house where he pulled out 23s., and said he would produce the rest of the money the next day - he afterwards said he would pay 5l. of it, and after that he said he had lost it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know of Mr. Thomas's sons having been with the prisoner? A. I heard from the watch-house-keeper that they had, but Mr. Thomas was in the country. He said he had lost the money, and was willing to pay it by instalments. He is married and has two children.</p>

            . I am a watchman. At half-past ten o'clock on the night of the 13th of May, I heard a cry of Stop thief! and I took the prisoner: he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out 1l. 3s. 6d., and said "I will give you this to let me go;" I asked "What for?" and he then told me what he had done - I said he must go with me to the watch-house and settle it. Here is the bill which he said his master gave him to pay the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you take a person you generally search him? A. Yes; he offered me this in the street; I would not take the money, and he put it down on the table in the watch-house, and this bill - I asked what he had done with the rest of the money - he said he had got some things out of pawn.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOMAS THOMAS. Q. You say that you gave him this sum of money on the Saturday night? A. Yes; about eight o'clock - there was a 10l. note, and four sovereigns - his own wages were included in it; it was his duty to go and pay the men immediately; he went with the men to the public-house and brought me back the change directly; he had not left my service.</p>

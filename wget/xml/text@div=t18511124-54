                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and live at East Acton. The prisoner Sessions is my father—I have been in Mr. Shaw's service three or four years—Bray was Mr. Shaw's hay-binder—on Monday, 10th Nov., I returned from town about 3 o'clock, Bray was then in the rick-yard, and I asked him how much hay he had bound—he said a load and nineteen trusses—my father afterwards-came, and he and Bray loaded a load into a cart for London—my father afterwards put five trusses in a hay-cart, which my father drove away about half-past 5 o'clock to the Princess Victoria—I went with him—when we got there we missed one truss, and my father <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the other four down in the yard of the Princess Victoria to the prisoner Allum, who was there—he is the ostler there—when my father got down, he asked him why he did not bring more—my father said nothing, but backed the horse out, and turned round for home again—Allum put his hand in his pocket, and I think he gave my father 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said he would owe him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my father then went towards Bray's house, but I did not go with him—I saw Bray next day, and said to him, "Mr. Bray, did you say there was a load and nineteen trusses bound?" he said, "No; a load and fifteen trusses"—I said, "You told me a load and nineteen trusses"—he said, "No; a load and fifteen trusses."</p>

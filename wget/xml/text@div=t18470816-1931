                  </hi> I am apprenticed to a carpenter, and live in Great Wild-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields—on Wednesday, the 1st of July, between twelve and one O'clock, I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoner I was pass<lb></lb>ing him on the kerb, and he struck me in the eye with a stick, which cut my eye, and he then struck me twice on the wrist, and broke the bone of my wrist—I had not spoken to him or annoyed him in any way—he was taken into custody, and I was taken to the hospital, where I remained three weeks—I have pretty well go the use of my arm again—there were ten or more boys following the prisoner at the time, but I did not see them annoying him or say anything to him.</p>

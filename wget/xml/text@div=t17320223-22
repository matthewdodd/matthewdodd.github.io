             (Mr. Rider's Clerk) they were to be sent by the Watford Carrier. I put them into the Pantry, and the Prisoner took them. Coun. Did you see her take them? Powell. Yes. Coun. And why did not you stop her? Powell. I did not think she would have carry'd them away, because she was acquainted in the House. Coun. How acquainted? Was she a Servant? Powell. She was rather a Mistress; she kept Company with my Master Bass. Coun. Did you inform Mr. Bass of this? Powell. No; he was gone aside, the Landlord had distrain'd his Goods. Coun. Did you acquaint any Body with it? Powell. Yes, I told our Chamberlain, William Street, but he is not in Court; I desired him to enquire after her, and send her back, for she was gone into the Country ; but in about two Weeks I heard she was Dead, and Mr. Rider took me up. Coun. Did not Bass and his People carry off what Goods they could? Powell. They carried some away the Sunday before; the Prisoner took these on the 19th of February was a 12 Month, between 10 and 11 in the Morning, she carry'd them out of the Pantry into the Kitchen, and then I went into the Cellar, and when I came up again she was gone, and the Goods too. Coun. What Goods were they? Powell. There was 9 Pieces of Camblet, and 9 Ells of Tabby, some Black, and some White; they were all put up in Papers, with Directions. Coun. Did you see the Papers open'd. Powell. No. Coun. How then can you take upon you to swear to the Colour and Quantity? Powell. I knew what was in the Papers by Mr. Rider's Bill of Parcels. Coun. Did Mr. Rider find the Bill against the Prisoner, or has he been at any Charge in this Prosecution? Powell. No; he had no Hand in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the George public-house at Walham-green—I am foreman to the London General Omnibus Company—on 29th November I was at the King's Arms yard at Fulham—I had been there the day before—it is my duty to look after certain harness there, and other things belong<lb></lb>ing to the London General Omnibus Company—I saw these two pairs of harness there on 29th November, these two pair of traces, and pads, and cruppers—the value of them is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were safe on the 29th, and I missed them the next morning—I did not see the prisoner any time in No<lb></lb>vember—this harness is peculiar in the buckles; here is a stud goes into it; there is none made like them—I have been engaged with omnibuses for forty years—I have driven an omnibus.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a harness-maker, and live at Union-road, I Brompton—I made this harness—I supplied the leather on 1st May—I know it is my own make, made on my own premises—the make of it altogether is mine, beside the buckles—on these tugs here is a particular pattern, a dia<lb></lb>mond mark from a stamp I have—I have not supplied harness with these marks to any person besides the General Omnibus Company—I never saw a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you supply other omnibus proprietors besides the London General Omnibus Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I get these buckles wholesale from the country, from a saddlers' ironmonger, who is a manufacturer—I put these diamonds on all I make—I do this part of them myself—I do not make double harness for private persons, not of this description, only for the General Omnibus Company—all that I make for the company has the same mark and these buckles—this mark is made by a stamp—I don't buy the stamp—it is sometimes the custom for saddlers to take back the old harness I when they make new.</p>

On 26th January I went with two other officers to the prisoner's house, 12, Granby-street, Waterloo-road—I searched the house, and found these articles there—they were all in the same place, in a small recess—I went through the shop to a back parlour, and I turned to my left hand and there was a recess—the door was shut, and I opened the door—theprisoner was not at home—I despatched another officer to fetch him—I asked him how he came in possession of this harness—he told me a man had left it there, and he did not know him, nor where he lived, nor anything more about him—when at the station he said he bought it of a person at Kennington-cross, and had given 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he could not give any account of who that person was—I asked him who he was, and he said he did not know him—I did not hear him say anything more about the harness, for I was engaged in taking care of the property—siuce he has been committed he has asked me to apprehend the party of whom he bought the harness—he did not tell me who he was, but he said he would go with me and point him out—I did not go any where with him—the prisoner has been out on bail.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This was on the same occasion as you found the hotel <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; on 26th January—I found two females in the shop—the cupboard that I speak of is not connected with the shop—it is on the same floor with a private parlour where they live—it is separated—there is a door leading from the shop into the back room—this recess has a door to it—the door was unlocked—the harness hung on pecs—it was not the room door going back that closed the recess—the door which leads from the parlour where they live had a glass window—directly I opened that door I got to a passage, and there was a recess and this private door—I should not have known it, but I had information—there was no light there—the light did not come from the other part of the house—if the door of the private room were open it would not throw light upon the recess—there are no means whatever in front of the house or shop of throwing light on that place—there was no chance of any light till I took a candle with me—in the mid-day it would be in the dark—the front shop leads into the back room, and there is a door leading from the passage, and that door has glass in it—the prisoner was fetched to the house—he did not seem to be at all agitated—I did not see anything the matter with him—I don't know that he was actually laid up with illness—I heard that he attempted to commit suicide—I don't know that he has been confined with illness—I did not see that he was at all con<lb></lb>fused—his wife was a little bit when I told her who I was—I believe at the police-station the prisoner said something about a bad debt—I heard he did say so, but I did not hear it—I did not hear all that he stated at the time</p>

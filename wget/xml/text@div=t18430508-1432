I live in Brunswick-street, Brunswick-buildings, Bruns<lb></lb>wick-square, in the parish of St. Pancras—I occupy the house—on Tuesday, the 28th of March, I went out about ten or half-past ten o'clock, leaving no one in the house—the door has a spring lock—I open it with a key, but there is a string which will open it—when I went out I left the door shut, and the</p>

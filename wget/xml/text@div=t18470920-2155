                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen much of your son latterly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, frequently—he has been out of employment since he left the Eastern Coun<lb></lb>ties Railway, I have maintained him—I live in my own house in Southampton-street, Pentonville, and have done so for twenty-five years—the prisoner has not been living with me, only coming occasionally to dine and take tea, and so no—he lodged in Cavendish-street, New North-road, Hoxton—I have fre<lb></lb>quently seen his writing lately—he has been frequently writing to his sister and different members of the family, and young friends in the country—is my opinion neither of these three documents are in his handwriting.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Wenlock-street, City-road—I was employed in the Baggage department of the Eastern Counties Railway Company—I left about the 20th of July—I gave notice myself—I was there during the whole period the prisoner was there—I had an opportunity of seeing his writing as well as any of the other clerks had—I have seen this check before, but not the note—I do not believe either of these three papers to be his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What have you been doing since you left the Eastern counties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing, I have been living on my friends—I have had the promise of a situation—I have not been traveling a good deal—I was down at Gravesend with the prisoner—the expenses were partly paid by him, and partly by myself—I had no conversation with him about money while we were out—he said he had spent some money, that is all—he did not tell me how much—he might have said that he had spent 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the last month, I belive he did—I recollect it perfectly—the journey to Gravesend was about the 30th of Aug.—I saw him on the 27th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say how he had got the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he had had some money left him by one of his friends, his grandfather or grandmother, I cannot tell which.</p>

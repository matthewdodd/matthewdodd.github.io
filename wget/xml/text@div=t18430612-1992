                  </hi>. I am a sailor. In Oct. last, I had occasion to go to the London Hospital—I left my chest with Jane Sonnex—there was a cap and gold band in it—this is the cap—the band is not found.</p>

                  </hi>. The prosecutor lodged with me, and left me his clothes—among the rest there was a cap and a band—the prisoner lodged with me from the latter end of December till the 4th of January—the cap hung in my front parlour, and when he went away I missed it—his ship did not sail till the 5th of January—I went down to Blackwall—the ship was hauling out of the basin—I could not see the prisoner—I saw no more of him till Tuesday week last, when he was at the Spread Eagle, at Limehouse—I asked him to deliver me the cap and band up that be took out of my house—he called me a b----w—, and a bitch, and ran into the Windmill—I followed—I was going in, and the landlord put me out twice—I gave the prisoner in charge—I had seen him with a cap on, but I could not tell whether it was this one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many times did you see him with the cap? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell—I saw him with a cap and a band, but I could not tell whether it was gold or not—it was such a made cap as this—I never gave information that the cap was lost till the prisoner was in custody—I went to see the pro<lb></lb>secutor every week—I did not ask the prisoner why he did not come back to lodge at my house, nor say, "You b----, I will do for you"—I go by my own name—I am not called Mrs. Murray—I might be, but I never answer to that name—some persons might call me so—I do not know it—the prisoner gave me five sovereigns the day he was paid, for getting his clothes out of pledge—he had a cap on his head at the time he paid me—he did not owe me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and say he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, and that would pay for the cap, and perhaps he might stay a day or two longer.</p>

I took the prisoner—he said he had got the cap in bis chest, but it was given to him by Mrs. Sonnex, and he bought the band—I took him to the station—the sergeant sent me back to hit lodging, and I found this cap in his chest—he said he had given the band away, and he had promised to give 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Sonnex.</p>

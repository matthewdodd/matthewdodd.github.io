                  </hi>. I am an engravor, and live in Fann-street, Cripple<lb></lb>gate. In September, 1834, the prisoner came to my house, and brought a plate with him, and wished to know how much I could print them at per thousand—he called them "Mining Tickets"—I told him the price, and he went away—he came back the same day, and brought with him a small backing plate, and two oval pieces of copper—a backing plate is for printing the back of the ticket—this is the backing plate he brought—I believe six or seven were printed from it—an objection was then made to a mark at the back—Balls stated that he must have a new plate for the back, in lieu of that one, and asked me the price of it—I told him my part of it, which was the outlining the letter part, would be about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him when I had outlined it, I could proceed no further without taking it to the ornamental engraver—the new plate, which I outlined, I took to David Forman, in Fetter-lane, to have the engine part done; which is laying the ground, that it might afterwards go to the machiner—I took it to Forman to be done, in company with Balls, and received it back from Forman, in a few days—this is the plate—It is the larger plate which I did the outlining on; the back plate—the front plate was already engraved when I received it—this is the front plate I received—I took off five thou<lb></lb>sand impressions from the front and the back plate—one is the back and</p>

               <p>the other is the front plate—I took off five thousand impressions from the front plate, and the corresponding impressions from the back plate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ornamental engraver, and live in Fetter-lane. I remember Labon and Balls calling on me on the 12th of September, 1834—they brought this plate—the letters <hi rend="italic">pieo</hi> were outlined, and the square—Labon said he wished it machining—I said I did not do the machinery, and</p>

               <p>recommended them to Bacon, as he kept a machine, and I was busy at the time—he said they were in a hurry to get it done, and would feel ob<lb></lb>liged to me to take it to Bacon, and get it done for them—I consented, and took it to Bacon, and gave him instructions what to do with it—he put in the ground-work of the machine; but previous to that they could not go on with the machine-work without the ovals were prepared—Bacon did the work, and returned it to me—I gave it to Labon—I believe it was on Monday, the 12th of September, that I received it—I returned it to him on the Friday or Saturday following.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After Koerner returned did you and him converse about forged notes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I only spoke to him to pay the rent—I never had any con<lb></lb>nexion with Koerner respecting forged notes—I communicated to the Consul every thing I heard from Koerner, the day after he left—I was never tried before a court—no one told me any thing—when I was discharged, they merely sent me a passport as a merchant, as usual, and dismissed me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you go to Vienna? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Consul showed me a letter that I was to go to England, and told me the government required I should come to Vienna, and proceted to England I only reveived two hundered to enable me to come over to England—I am a Jew—Koerner is a Jew, and his wife Jewess.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Accountant-General of the National Bank of Austria. I was sent over to England by the Austrian government to make inquiries respecting forgeries—Samuel Flaum came with me—I when I first knew Flaum, he was at Vienna, and at liberty—I never knew him in confinement—Ihave heard he was, by official communication from the authorities—when I first came to this country, I applied to Sir Frede<lb></lb>rick Roe, at Bow-street, on the subject of my business—he gave me advice,</p>

               <p>and directed George Ruthven, a Bow-street officer, to assist me—In what I did afterwards, I acted under the direction of Sir Fredrick Roe—I em<lb></lb>ployed Flaum here on the business on which I came over—I gave him money for his expenses, both abroad and here—he had on the Continent four florins, or about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in England—that was for his support, not for his expenses in travelling—he constantly accounted to me for the money he received from me—he had other money of me for payments, in conse<lb></lb>quence of the business he had to perform, and for that money he accounted in the same way as he did for the other—he gave an account to me almost every day of what he did in the business, and I took down memo<lb></lb>randums instantly, at the time, of what he told me—I have them here—besides the reports I heard from Flaum I went about myself to watch him and the parties—I saw them many times—Ruthven sometimes went with me—I saw Flaum with Balls, Harris, and Mordecai Moses—the first time I saw them was about the 21st of August—I then saw him with Harris only, on the Royal Exchange—I saw him with Balls about the beginning of September, Harris was with them—after that I saw Flaum, Harris, and Balls together—I saw them at the Flower Pot Public-house—at the Eagle, and other places—several times at public-houses, and in the street—I was present when Balls was taken, at the Star coffee-house, in Crown-street, Finsbury, on the 9th of November—Harris and Balls were together—I had before that seen Harris and Flaum at the Auction Mart coffee-house, but not Balls—on the 1st of September, Flaum brought me a Polish note—I made a memorandum of the note at the time—this is the note—Flaum only showed me the note that day, but he gave it me afterwards—I think the last day before the prisoner's apprehension, or the same day.</p>

The King of Poland is the Emperor Nicolas the First—this note is drawn for five zlotych—I think the translation of zlotylch is golden or florin—I think it is quite the same—florin and gulden is always zlotych—It is always thirty Polish groschen.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told my friend that you knew that Nicolas the First is King of Poland—how did you know it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am an officer nominated in his name, and sent here by his government—his orders are executed in the kingdom—I never heard him give orders—I never heard him speak—I have seen him where I have been—I saw them put the crown on his head at Warsaw, in a church—I have seen the Royal Commissioner write—his name is Warsaw, in a church—I have seen the royal comminssioner write—his name is stanislas count Szymanowski—this is not his writing, it is a good imitation of it—It is a very good imitation—It could deceive beady not will acquainted with it—I swore here on Friday, and Saturday, that the English word to denote zlotych, was gulden—I know that the Austrian coin is also named called florin—so florin in Polish signification and gulden are quite the same—In Poland they call it zlotych—they call it gulden in Germany, and I thought also in England—I have heard people in England call the zlotych a florin, but I do not remember who.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What we want to know is, what is the English word—did you ever hear any person in England call the zlotych a florin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think where I live I heard it in counting the Polish money, at Leicester'-place—If a person in Poland had an estate of fifty thousand zlotych a year, I should say in England, he was worth fifty thousand guldens, or florins—I think florin is most often used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if the word florin is most often used, how was it you stated on Friday, that the proper translation was gulden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought that is England it may be so, but the word is quite the same as to value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now as to the forgery, will you venture to say that this is not a genuine note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, surely—I have a genuine note here—I do not know the gentleman whose name is in the corner—I know his writing—this is similar to it—this is not his writing, because the note is forged—I do not remember that I ever saw the gentleman write his name—I have seen his writing—I know several gentleman named M----.—I have seen the Gentleman, but I do not remember his person—I am not certain whether he is dead or alive—I know Mr. Szymanowski well—I have seen him write signature only that this note is forged—I can see a difference between these and the genuine signature—It is not so perfectly made as it should be—I have seen several forged notes here, and several at Warsaw—I never saw a forged note abroad, with the water-mark to it—the water<lb></lb>mark is, assuredly, one of the great distinctions between a genuine note and a forged one; but this has the water-mark.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what do you judge of the note being forged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Beside the signatures not being so perfect as they ought to be, I have observed it a long time, and have found that there are difference that assure me it is forged—I can see that the squares are larger in this note than in my genuine note—the colour of his note is the same, but it is not the same kinds of paper as our notes are—our notes are all on one sort of paper—there should not be any difference in them—a person in England, not understanding the Polish language, might take this to be a genuine note—the word "<hi rend="italic">Roku</hi>," signifies the year—I persist in saying there is a dif<lb></lb>ference in the size of these squares.</p>

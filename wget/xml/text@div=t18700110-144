               <p>Cranford Park, Middlesex—on Sunday morning, 2nd January, about 6 o'clock or a little after, I heard some guns in the cover—I was in a coyer called Churchyard cover—the sound came from one of the coven on the other side of the house—I went alongside the cover—I met the witnesses, Hill and James—I did not hear any more guns—I think it was three reports altogether that I heard—that was in the direction of the Beech Walk cover, which adjoins the garden of the house—we went to a part where the avenue ceases—it is a plantation which joins the cover—we waited there about two or three minutes—the three prisoners then came along in a direction from the covers—I rushed at Thomas Baldwin and apprehended him—he struck me over the head with the butt end of the gun—I guarded it off as well as I could with my arm—it caught me on the arm and on the head as well—I then hit him with the staff, and secured him—Hill and James secured the others—they all three had guns—Thomas Baldwin had three pheasants in his possession, and a powder flask—Henry Baldwin had two pheasants, and Mason three—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock when they were secured; I should say about 6.30, or something like that—the sun rose about 8.10 that morning—Henry Baldwin said, "This won't be settled at Uxbridge; we shall get two years for this"—in going to the station, he said, "You don't feed them very well"—I said, "You feed them pretty well yourself'—I afterwards went to the cover, and found the footmarks of three persons—I could distinctly trace them in and out of the cover.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener in Lord Fitzhardinge's service—I sleep over the stable—on Sunday morning, 2nd January, I heard six reports of guns—I was in my bedroom when I heard the first, and after I got up I saw the flash of a gun in the cover, and joined Beechey and James, and went with them to near the occupation road on Lord Fitzhardinge's land; and about 6.15 or 6.20 I saw the three prisoners coming from the direction of the covers—I seized hold of Mason, knocked him down, and took a gun from him—it was loaded—I took three pheasants from him—I heard Henry Baldwin say, "I wish we had <hi rend="italic">went</hi> out the other way; what a fool I was"—he also said, "Why did not you come into the covers and face us like men, and give us a chance"—he said there were ten pheasants, we only found eight—he said, "It was a good job we did not shoot at them"—there was only one gun loaded, that was Mason's.</p>

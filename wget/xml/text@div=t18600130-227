                  </hi>. I am a baker, of 13, Brick-lane—on Sunday night, 8th January last, about 11 o'clock, I was going down Whitechapel—I there saw a female who owed me some money—I went up to her and asked her for it—a disturbance took place, and she was very abusive, and told me she did not owe me any—a crowd collected immediately after—she approached towards me with her fist in my face—on that I pushed her away with my umbrella—then the prisoner spoke behind me and said, "This is not a night for collecting debts"—I turned round, and said, "Mind your own business"—I then turned round to the woman again, and a policeman pushed her away, and told her to go away; and the prisoner came and gave me a violent blow on the ear, and knocked my glasses and hat off—I turned round, and he was <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> up at me again, and I cut him down with my umbrella, and he staggered rather on one side; then he came again a third time, and my umbrella was broken with the first blow; we struggled together, and three more came on me scrambling at my watch, and I said, "Keep away, I shall give him something; keep clear," not thinking for the moment that they wanted to get at my watch; I thought they were going to see fair play—he and I were struggling, aud these three men came on me—we fell down in the road, and these three men, one at my legs; the prisoner fell just at my head, and as he got up he gave me a violent kick on the left cheek-bone; it swelled up in an instant—I got up then, and looked for my hat and glasses, and said to the policeman that was there, "Have you seen my hat and glasses? you are a fine fellow to stand here and not see any thing of this sort;" he told me he did not know where they were—he stood by just at the commencement, but he was turning away this woman while these others were on to me—after that the policeman said something to me—the prisoner was then throwing off his jacket, and running like a madman behind the rest—I cannot say whether he was near enough to hear what the policeman</p>

               <p>said—when he got up off the road the policeman told him to go away, and then he went behind the crowd and came round another way—he came back to me; I walked away—the policeman said to me, "You had better go straight home, or you will lose your watch;" and I buttoned up my coat, and kept my hand on my watch—I was walking home contentedly, without my hat and glasses, and they followed me up directly after—when I had gone about forty yards I heard the prisoner say, "I will have the b—'s life or his watch at the b—corner," or words to that effect—when I heard those words I ran across the road to a coffee-shop that was open—before I could get there the prisoner seized me by the arm, and gave me another blow right in the face—several more came on me just at the same time—they struggled with me all the time till I got to the coffee-shop door; and three or four came out of the coffee-shop, and some of the gang got before me and made a noise, and broke some glass—three or four came out of the coffee-shop, and pushed me off the steps with their hands; and there were several on to me then; but the prisoner held me by the hair of my head, and three or four came by the side of me and got my watch—my coat was buttoned up all the time; and I had my hand on my coat all the time, but they got it by some means—I can't tell how the watch was taken; it went—it was fastened to a gold guard—I think the guard was cut—the people all dispersed after that; they ran across out of the mob—there was a mob of more than 100 persons at least; no one interfered on my behalf—the other persons ran away directly after this man let go of my hair, and he ran away after them across the road—my foreman came down then; some one had called at my house and told them that I was ill-used in Whitechapel—I was ill for some time after; I was obliged to put some one in my shop for more than a week, in consequence of the ill-treatment—I have since been attended by Mr. Ed<lb></lb>munds, a surgeon—my groin was injured; it was quite well before this took place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live in Mile-end-road—on 8th January last, about ten minutes past 11, I was walking down Whitechapel-road—I saw the prosecutor there—he was before me, I followed behind him; I dare say I was three or four yards off him—I heard him say to a woman there that she owed him a great account—she said, "No, I don't; I paid your wife before she died"—he said, "No, you didn't"—she said, "I don't owe you a b—y farthing," and with that she came and put her fist in his face—he just shoved her away with the umbrella, when the prisoner said, "This is not a night for collecting debts"—the prosecutor did nothing, but the prisoner hit him at the side of the ear, which knocked his hat and glasses off—they were immediately picked up, and ran up Queen Anne-street with—I did not see what became of the glasses—the prisoner sparred up to Mr. Dunbar, who hit him across the face with his umbrella—he was coming the third time to him again, and he and Mr. Dunbar had a wrestle, and then a mob was all round him—they both fell into the road together—the policeman came up, and the prisoner got up and kicked Mr. Dunbar in the left eye—he asked the policeman where were his hat and glasses—the policeman said, "I do not know; do you think I have got them; you had better go on, or you might lose your watch"—there was a lady and a gentleman who said it was a shame—the policeman said, "Well, you had better go on, or you might be served the same"—then Mr. Dunbar said to the policeman, "You had better take me or the prisoner into custody"—nothing else was said—Mr. Dunbar then went on—he had got two or three yards when the prisoner and two or three more came after him first, and then a lot behind them—just before they got to the end of the workhouse,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Spital-square—I examined Mr. Dunbar a few days after this happened; I am his medical attendant—I found that he was ruptured on the left side, and bruised over several parts of the body, and over the legs—there were some slight bruises about his eyes; nothing of any importance—it is impossible to say whether the rupture was a recent one or an old one; it was apparently a recent one; it was not a very old standing one—it will be necessary for him to wear a truss in consequence of it for the rest of his life—such an injury would be produced by a violent struggle.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Wood's-buildings—I remember the Sunday night when this <hi rend="italic">row</hi> took place—I was with the woman that Mr. Dunbar accosted—I was in for my supper beer at the Star and Garter, and came out with Mr. Whitehead—Mr. Dunbar met her and asked her for some of the money that was due to him—she said that she did not owe so much as he said; with that he called her a false woman, using rather abrupt language, and hitting her with his umbrella twice, and he made aim at me, and I never saw the man in my life before—he was not sober—he was really drunk, in my opinion—he was flourishing his umbrella about—he struck Mr. White-head once across her nose, and in the side of her face—a crowd did not come round while we were there; we did not see one—I went away with my beer with this woman—I did not see any one come—we went home immediately—I do not see Mr. Wills here—I did not see him here yesterday to my knowledge.</p>

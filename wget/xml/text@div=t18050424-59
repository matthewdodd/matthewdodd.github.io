               <p>Q. When was this you were attacked by any person? - A. The 8th of April, about half-past one o'clock in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the morning of the ninth? - A. Yes; I was coming from <placeName id="t18050424-59-crimeloc338">Long Acre</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - A. I had two pints of beer; I had the share of seven pints of beer with my mate and another man; I was sensible of every transaction that happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all intoxicated by liquor? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you coming alone? - A. Yes; as I came out of the end of the court, there came four or five men and seized hold of me, and threw me flat on my back; they thrust their hands into my left hand pocket, and took six shillings and sixpence out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of your clothes? - A. My breeches, which they tore in taking the money out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men - Were these two men at the bar either of them? - A. Batters held me by the collar, and endeavoured to hold me down by one hand, and with the other he held my mouth and throat. I with my right hand several times drew his hand from my mouth, and called out for assistance; I called out, watch, and I called out, murder; Freak, the other prisoner at the bar, was endeavouring to take this watch out of my pocket that I hold now.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the shorter man of the two? - A. Yes; he endeavoured to take the watch out of my pocket, and in trying to take it out he tore my breeches at the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take it out? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of either of them? - A. I laid hold of that gentleman there with the blue coat, and held him fast till such time as Kelly, the watchman, came up to me; I did not loose him before I asked Kelly twice if he had got him safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other prisoner? - A. Yes, by endeavouring to take the watch out of my pocket; while I was endeavouring to give Batters up to the watchman, I cannot say what became of him, but I saw him the next day at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man? - A. I am positively sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Freak offer you any money the next morning? - A. Yes, he offered me the money that was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he offer it you for? - A. If I would not say any thing before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take it? - A. I took it in fear, because I was rather afraid of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were all in custody of the peace-officer at that time - What did he offer you? - A. A seven-shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took it? - A. I took the seven-shilling piece into my hand, and gave it into the man's hand at the watch-house, and he gave change for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You took 6 s. 6 d. and gave Freak the sixpence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And your reason for doing this was because you were afraid? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Batters. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate, when we were first examined, that we were all drinking together? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And when we were coming out of the public-house, we began fighting one with another, and the watchman came and took us altogether? - A. No such thing, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did; then the Magistrate said he would put us all three back till he inquired into our characters, and then you said you would tell the truth? - A. It is false.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you known them before? - A. I never saw the men before in my life, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember hearing any body crying out? - A. Yes, I heard somebody crying murder; I was in my box; it was just by St. Giles's pound, opposite, in the back passage.</p>
               <p>Q.With that what did you do? - A. I was not in a hurry; it was some time before I went, being in a different parish, and thinking it was some of the bad girls (the girls of the town) because they kick up a cry among themselves; I did not go till I heard the voice get slower and lower; then immediately I made my appearance, to make out what it was, and when I had got out of my box, I met with Butler, a watchman of St. Ann's watch-house; I asked him to go, and he went along with me; I took the lead of him and came up first.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to where the voice directed you, what did you observe? - A. I caught Batters over the head and shoulders of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prosecutor situated? - A. He laid upon his back between the men, and Batters was on his head and shoulder; they were busy about his small clothes, but what they did I cannot say; I was in a flurry, as well as him; the other man made a start to run away, but Butler popped on him, before he could get away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Freak doing of before he made a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240053"></xptr>start to get away? - A. I cannot tell; I had hold of Batters; he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Freak over Jaggers? - A. Yes, he was over him all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. It was Butler that took Freak? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got them into custody you took them to the watch-house - You are sure these two men are the men that you took? - A. I never left them, they were never a yard out of my sight; there were two more, but they ran away when they saw the lantern come with me; they could not see me till I popped upon them and smashed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a hat? - A. The hat I know nothing of; Butler is the man that knows about that.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoners being brought into the watch-house by the watchmen? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a hat brought in that night? - A. The man said he was robbed of a hat and six shillings and sixpence; it was impossible for me to get at the rights of it, there was such a bustle and noise; I left it to be adjusted at Marlborough-street the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take possession of that hat? - A. Yes, last Monday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Jaggers.) Look at that hat - Is that the hat you wore that night? - A. Yes, I will swear to it.</p>
               <p>Wygate. That is the hat; Jaggers changed hats with me on Monday at the attorney's office.</p>
               <p>Jaggers. The hat that I lost I picked up from the ground; I heard the watchman say, whose hat is that; I picked up that hat the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. And the same night that the watchman pointed out to you the hat, then on the ground, you knew it to be your hat - Was that the hat you wore till you went to the attorney's office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the hat that you picked up at the time this happened to you you wore till last Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Wygate.) The hat you now produce is the hat you received from Jaggers at the attorney's office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Butler.) Q. What happened about the hat - You have said, after you stopped him, I saw one hat on his head and one in his hand, and the other in his hand which he held, you asked him whose hat that was, Freak said, I do not know, it is not mine, and immediately threw it down - Did you see what became of that hat? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Batters's defence. I had been to my uncle, and was coming home to Cumberland-street, Tottenham-court-road; I heard a noise, and saw three or four men together; I had not come up two minutes before the watchman came up, and laid hold of me by the collar.</p>
               <p>Freak's defence. I had been to Paddington to supper, and coming back down Tottenham-court-road, there were some people knocked my hat off, I cannot tell by whom; I was taken into custody by that man who stands there; I went to the watch-house very civilly.</p>

On 18th Dec., at twenty minutes before 6 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come out of Richmond mews into Parliament-street—he had this coachman's box coat with him, and these five whips—he came towards me; and asked me what time it was—I told him it wanted twenty minutes to 6 o'clock—he said, "I am afr Ald I shall be too late for the rail," and he hastened off—I went into the Mews, and tried the doors—I found the coach house door of Sir Charles Merrick Burrell open—I had seen it about a quarter of an hour previous—it had the padlock on then, and it was locked—I had had the padlock in my hand—when I saw the door open the padlock was gone—I called the coachman, and after speaking to him I went and overtook the prisoner at Charing-cross, walking very fast—I asked him where he got the coat and whips—he said he came from over the water, and they belonged to his master—I told him he must come back with me—he let the coat drop—I told him not to drop it—he threw it down, and said, "B—r the coat; carry it yourself"—I took him to the station, and found on him a black linen bag, a knife, a small looking glass, and 1 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he threw the whips down, and I took them up.</p>

I live at No. 5, Richmond-mews, and am coachman to Sir Charles Merrick Burrell—that stable and coach house are his property—there is a road from the stable to the house, in Richmond-buildings—you go over the leads—you cannot go from the house to the stable and coach house without going into the open air—I sleep over the coach house—the door of the coach house had not been open for four or five days, because a carriage stood there—I know it was locked that morning, because I heard the police</p>

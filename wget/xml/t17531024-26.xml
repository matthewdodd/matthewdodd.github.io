            . I am a pawnbroker, the prisoner at the bar brought these spoons (producing four) at several times, the marrow spoon came the first of last September, another of the large spoons came the 8th of August, another the 10th of July, she had twenty-nine shillings upon the whole, I am sure these are the spoons she pawned with me. She said her mistress sent her, so I went and acquainted Mrs. Portress with the affair, who said she sent her with none but the marrow spoon at other times, but with none of them then.</p>

               <p>My mistress was ailing a-bed, and her support was not sufficient for us, she had but four shillings a week, and I have one ; I have made money of the things, because she should not know how she was drove.</p>

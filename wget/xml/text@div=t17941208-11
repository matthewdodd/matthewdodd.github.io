               <p>Prisoner. I went in that gentleman's shop to buy a bit of muslin for a border of a cap, and the gentleman shewed me some; I asked for a remnant that would come cheap; and he took a piece of muslin and asked me how much would do? and I put my hand across the counter in this manner, and he shewed me about that much for a border of a cap; he said it would come to five-pence, and I told him I would give him four-pence halfpenny, it was as much as I could afford. I pulled my arm from him, and he catched hold of me, this handkerchief was coming off the counter with my cloak, and he said I meant to steal the handkerchief; I had not a ha'pworth with me in the world, but three shillings and three halfpence, I was just as you see me now, gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Court to witness. In what condition were they under her arm? were they lapped up or loose? - Loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they quite under her arm? - Yes, she had hold of them.</p>

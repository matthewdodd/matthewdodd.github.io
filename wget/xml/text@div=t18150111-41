            .</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set out at the General Post office - A. Ten minutes past eight.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day the accident happened - A. I do not recollect what day of the month it was, it was in the month of October; I believe we left the Post office about ten minutes past eight; the Bath mail coach was drawn by four horses, and when we came to the two mile stone or thereabouts I heard a crush; I then looked of one side, and saw a man laying in the road; I looked of one side at Hammersmith; I saw a cart with the shafts broken, and a man laying in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the mail coach go over the man - A. I cannot say it did.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18150111-41-person366">Q. </persName>
            Where was the man that you saw laying - A. He was laying between the cart and the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he near the wheel of your coach - A. He might be two or three inches off; I looked on one-side; I saw the man laying in the road; I desired the coachman to stop. I have every reason to suppose he stopped as soon as he could, considering the rate the horses were going, he pulled up as soon as it was in his power, and sent somebody back to help the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When you called out to him to stop, how far might he be from the man - A. It might be an hundred yards off the man.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had passed, he pulled up, did you tell him why you desired him to stop - A. I said Akerman, pull up, I believe you have run over this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe he had run over this man - A. By seeing the man lye in the road I thought that he had, I cannot swear that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. He had got an hundred yards past the man, you called out to him to stop the coach - A. He stopped at the Hand and Plower, and sent a shopkeeper at the next door to the Hand and Flower to the man's assistance; I did not get off my box; I had two foreign mails on the top of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other mail coaches before yours - A. Yes, two; the Exeter first, and the Worcester second, and our coach behind; we were as close to the Worcester as we could go, without running foul of her; it was a dark night, we were obliged to have all our lamps a-light.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the crush that you heard - A. I suppose it must be our coach that ran against the cart, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. And upset it - A. I have every reason to believe our coach ran against the cart, I cannot say upset it, the cart stood in the road, and no shafts; I saw the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the road were you - A. The near side, about eight feet from the path.</p>
               <p>COURT. You were on the left hand side of the road when this accident happened - A. Yes, when I heard the crush our near wheel was about six feet from the path.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cart standing - A. On the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the cart on the off side of the road - A. The cart was more on the near side then on the off; the man appeared to me laying about two or three inches from the wheel of the mail coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You were going on the near side, how happened it to touch him - A. The man that was run over was on the off side, if any wheel run over him it must be the off wheel; the man was more on our side than he ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the man's name that was run over, do you - . No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You were going about eight miles an hour, that is a common mail coach pace - A. Yes, the road was very heavy, we were going a steady trott; we were following the Exeter mail and the Worcester mail.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you running a race with one-another - A. We were keeping steadily behind them; we driving<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110023"></xptr>on the near side of the road, about six feet from the bank; the road at that part is about sixty feet wide, the middle of the road was fresh gravelled; our off wheel ran over the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. Your lamps were lighted, had the cart any lamps - A. No; the cart might see our coach, we could not so well see them. I am sure we were following in the same track as the mails before us; the other mails had their lamps lighted at Lad-lane, there can be no better lights than the mails have, they have the best oil.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITE. I am the coachman of the Exeter mail.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how this accident happened - A. No, I cannot; I only know I was first coach, and it was on a Saturday evening, I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It was on the 22nd of October - A. I was before the Worcester coach, I might be twenty yards off the Worcester coach; the Bath coach was just behind the Worcester; the Worcester and the Bath coaches were following me; I was on the left hand side of the road. I neither heard or saw any thing of the accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other carriages on the road at that time - A. I did not see any other carriages; I did not see the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark night - A. Particularly dark, we all had our lights, all of us three coaches had lights; we went our usual pace, about seven or eight miles an hour, perhaps not quite so fast, the roads were bad and heavy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gravel upon the road - A. Yes, rather more on our side of the road than on the other, which kept us more on our side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from the foot-path - A. The off wheel from the foot-path was about four yards; I was on the left hand side of the road, the coaches were all following us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I have had the road measured, it is fifty feet mide - A. It is.</p>

            . Q. You are brother of the deceased - A. Brother-in-law.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did your brother live - A. In Devonshire.</p>
               <p>Q. On this night were you in the chaise with your brother in the Hammersmith road - A. Yes, I was in a chaise cart, we were coming towards London, we had one horse in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, tell us what happened to you coming on the Hammersmith road - A. We met three mail coaches; we hailed in on the near side of the road to let them pass; we were on the left hand side coming to town: on seeing them we pulled nearer in on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the center of the road - A. I think we were about six feet from the center of the road our right hand wheel; the coach coming in contact with our wheel, the violence broke both our shafts off, the horse went off with the shafts, and run away; the horse was not hurt; the body of the cart directly fell down; I and my brother fell out my brother fell on the right side of the cart, the wheel of the mail coach went over his body, he was then laying on the left hand side of the road, about six or seven feet from the center of the road, on our own side; he fell nearer the mail coach than me; my brother called out when he saw the mail coach coming over him, it was too late to call them; he did not call until the mail coach came upon him, the mail coach did not stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any of them heard your brother or not - A. I cannot say. The jerk of the mail coach coming against our cart was so sudden, I should think they could not be of hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gravel on the road - A. I believe not; I did not see any gravel on the road where my brother was laying; I think our near wheel was about four feet from the ditch, and about six feet or more from the center of the road.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the mail coach was on its proper side of the way when it run over your brother - A. No, the mail coach was rather on the wrong side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the road was the mail coaches when you saw them - A. The first mail coach was a considerable distance to the right, the wrong side of the road, we did not notice the hind mail coach; we got out of the way as fast as we possibly could.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was your brother thrown from the cart - 
               <persName id="t18150111-41-person368">A. </persName>
            Perhaps one or two feet, I don't think more; it was a moon-light night, rather a cloudy night. My brother was taken up, and taken to the Hand and Flower; Mr. Weston was one of the gentlemen that helped to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of your brother - 
               <persName id="t18150111-41-person369">A. John Southcomb</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>Q. You have brought an action against the proprietors of this mail coach for damages done to this cart of yours - A. Yes. I myself was thrown out of the cart, and hurt also.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before any person came from the Hand and Flower to pick your brother up - A. Within three minutes, there was a gentleman passing by assisted my brother up before I could get up; we were quite sober; we had been to Windsor; we dined at the market-place, we drank a glass of gin and water at the Cricketers; we did not stop any where between Windsor and Hounslow; as we were going through Hammersmith we met these coaches, we were going a steady and quiet, quite a gentle trot about five miles an hour, the horse will not go more than six miles an hour; the road is wide at that part; all the three coaches were on the wrong side; we were on our proper side; I think the first mail coach was on its proper side, I will not take upon me to swear the second coach was on its proper side, the last mail was driving completely on the wrong side; the second and last coaches was over the center of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the last drive steady in a strait line - A. I do not believe it did.</p>
               <p>Q. You think he drove against you for the purpose - A. No, I do not mean to say that.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you saw the coaches coming, why did not you pull out of the way - A. We pulled in, and made sufficient way for them as soon as we saw the first coach.</p>

Mrs. Cannon; Mr. Cannon was in company with me, his boy came in, and informed us of the accident; I and the landlord Mr. Atkins went to the assistance of the man, I found the man laying in the road, one side of his face was bloody, he was quite speechless, and insensible, and quite lifeless, he lay on the right side of the road coming to London, about six feet from the center of the road, and four or five yards from the edge of the right side of the road; he laid lengthways, I do not think he moved hand or feet until he was taken up; I put my face to his face to see if I could find breath; a mail coach was coming along I jumped up behind, and went to the Broad Way Hammersmith for a surgeon; Mr. Bewlin the surgeon came with me; we found the deceased at the Hand and Flower on our return.

            . I was on the Hammersmith road at the time this accident happened, I was coming from Hammersmith to Kensington. The mail coaches were apparently upon the center of the road at the time of passing me; when the last coach had passed me six or twelve yards, I heard a loud crush, it appeared to me as if it was a collision of two bodies, it drew my attention of course, I immediately looked towards the road, I saw a horse with the shafts of a cart dangling behind him, coming from behind the mail coach, the horse proceeded towards London, walking with the shafts dangling behind him; the mail coach proceeded two or three yards at a slower pace, and stopped about three or four yards from where the accident happened, it stopped for a few seconds, when a voice exclaimed from behind the coach, drive on, never mind; upon which the coach proceeded on its way; I was fearful that some accident had taken place, I went immediately over to where the cart was, and the cart was standing on its hinder end, with the bottom turned towards the north edge, without its shafts, its shafts being torn away; the body of the deceased was laying obliquely in the track which the coach must have passed going along, his face was bleeding; he growned very deep, and appeared to be in the greatest agony; I said he ought to be taken to the nearest public-house, directly he was taken to the public-house, I do not know the names of the people that took him; Mr. Hollis was with me; Mr. Southcomb, the brother of the deceased, was there. When I first came up the deceased was quite speechless and lifeless, the body was laying about half a yard from the center on the North side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the road new gravelled - A. I don't think it was; it was new gravelled about a week before.</p>
               <p>MR. BEWLIN. I am a surgeon; I was sent for; I went to the Hand and Flower; I saw the deceased on the floor of the parlour at the Hand and Flower, he had a wound on the right side of the head, it was about an inch long, quite to the bone; the right collar bone and the three first ribs were broken very much; I bled him, but he died in about five or ten minutes. By the desire of the Coroner, he was afterwards opened; we opened the brain, in the brain there was a small quantity of extraversated blood; the collar bone broken in several places, and the three first ribs were broken very much, a large blood vessel had been torn in the cavity of the chest in the right side; the extraversation of blood in his chest was the immediate cause of his death.</p>

            , ESQ. I reside at Woodbine, in Oxfordshire. On Saturday night, the 22nd of October, I was outside passinger on this mail; I sat upon the roof in the front; we were following two other mails; I think we were about fifteen yards behind the Worcester mail, and the Exeter mail about the same distance from the Worcester. I first discovered the cart passing the Exeter mail, I saw distinctly the cart was upon the n gravel; I saw the cart pass the Worcester mail, the cart run very close to the Worcester mail: afterwards the cart came in contact with the Bath coach.</p>

               <p>Q. Before it came in contact, did any person in the cart call out or say one single word - A. I did not hear any one until the crush. The prisoner appeared to drive in a strate line to the other coaches. I think the accident happened by the driver of the cart pulling the wrong rein. We stopped at the Hand and Flower directly, and sent back assistance. I think the prisoner was neither careless or negligent, I saw nothing that he could have done to prevent the mischief.</p>

            . I am a clergyman. I was travelling by the Bath mail on the night of the 22nd of December last, an outside passenger, there was two mail coaches before us; I observed the cart just as it passed the second mail, when the cart had passed the second mail, it appeared to come towards our horses; I heard a loud calling out by the coachman, the coachman called to the man in the cart, the cart came very near our front horses, it appeared to have struck the bar by which the leaders drew; I am sure the cart struck against some part of the coach; the cart was dashed to pieces; I heard the boards of the cart crack,</p>
               <p>COURT. You had an opportunity of observing the prisoner's conduct, was there any blame in the coachman - A. I did not perceive any in which his conduct was blameable at all.</p>

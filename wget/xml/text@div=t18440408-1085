                  </hi>. I am a manner, and live in Connaught-place, with my wife, the prisoner lodged in the same place. On the 18th of March we were all three sitting at dinner—the prisoner took a wrong seat—I put my finger on his side pocket, and said, "Sidney, remove from that, and go to your own seat"—he refused at the moment—we began to push each other about, in good humour, in a jocular way, and as we were <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> over a chair, the chair fell from under him, and in falling he tried to take hold of my arm or shoulder, and cut me—had he not done so, he probably would have fallen across the kitchen fender—he had a clasp-knife in his hand—it might have been quite accidental.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are the prosecutor's wife's mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prisoner took his meals with us, and is a respectable young man—I did Dot see the knife in his hand myself, but have often seen it—he usually pares his potatoes with it—he seldom uses a dinner-knife.</p>

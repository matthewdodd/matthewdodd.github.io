On the 17th of November I left the house at half past five o'clock in the afternoon; my husband had gone out before me - I double-locked the door; I left nobody in the house; there is only one outer door - all the windows were secure; I returned at eight o'clock in the evening, and found my door open; it had been opened by some key, or something - I missed two sheets, four shirts, three table-cloths, two pillow-cases, two shifts, three towels, one table cover, two pieces of printed cotton, measuring five yards and three quarters together, and a petticoat; they were all in the drawer, which was open - every thing was taken out of the drawer; they were all in there clean when I went out, and nothing was left but two pairs of stocking; I saw the property again on the 24th of November, at Lambeth-street office - all my linen was marked, except the towels - I found all the marks taken out, but knew them although the marks are picked out; I know nothing of the prisoners - I found them in custody.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I know the prisoners; they came to me on the 18th of November together, to pledge a sheet, table-cloth, three shirts, and all these articles which I have - while I was making out the duplicate I thought the things were too good to belong to them; I then examined them, and saw some of the marks were picked out - I detained them and the goods, and sent for an officer, who took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you know either of them before? A. I think I have seen Flana<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090010"></xptr>gan before, but cannot swear it; my shop is in White chapel-road - I know nothing of her dealing in such things in Petticoat-lane; I mentioned the marks being taken out - she said at Lambeth-street that she had brought them in Petticoat-lane, but I do not remember her saying any thing of the sort in the shop - I will not swear she did not; I gave them in charge directly I discovered that the marks were taken out - I had offered to lend 30s. on them; they wanted more - I think they wanted about 2l.</p>

            . Here is a mark on the corner of the table-cloth which I can trace; these are part of the goods missed on the night in question - I have not a doubt of the whole of them being our property; my own work on some of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they your own things? A. Part of them; the rest were sent to me to wash - this shirt belongs to a young man I wash for; the things were all in a drawer, and all clean; I had put them  away on the Monday morning before the robbery, but saw them in the drawer five minutes before I went out; here is my own needle-work on several of them, and this sheet is mine; some are my own wearing-apparel.</p>
               <p>Phipp's Defence. I never saw the things till they were on the pawnbroker's counter; the other prisoner came to my house, and asked me to go with her and pawn them - I said I would, and carried her child, and sometimes the basket with the things, and was much surprised at her being detained.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BARNES. I took the goods from both of them; I saw them in possession of both of them - I asked who they belonged to; Flanagan said they were her property.</p>

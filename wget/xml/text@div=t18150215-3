His brother said, you must know there are coals in the boat, and how did they come there; he said. I took them off a boat going up the River to lighten it. He asked him what boat; he could not tell him the name of the boat, nor who she belonged to. I then said, I saw clearly how it was, and went home, and sent to Kingston for a coal-metre to measure the coals, his name is Perchmouth; he measured the coals; he is here. The prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150004"></xptr>apprehended in December; Redoap and Moore have absconded.

               <p>Q. You employed the prisoner's brother to bring the coals by water - A. Yes, and the prisoner's brother employed other persons to navigate the boat, and when they were brought to a given place, the carts and horses were to bring them to my house.

Mr. Turner called; his man got a boat and went after them, and when we got to the lug-boat, the men whoever they were, were then gone; in the lug-boat there were coals: there were three sacks filled.</p>

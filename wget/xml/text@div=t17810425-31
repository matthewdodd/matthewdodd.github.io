               <p>I am servant to Mr. Pagett. On Monday, about nine o'clock, I carried up the tea-things to my master to breakfast; I went down to butter the rolls; I was gone about five minutes; going up again, I saw the prisoner coming out of my master's parlour; I asked him what he wanted; at first he said, nothing; then he said, he wanted some gentlemen. I was going to take him up stairs to see who he wanted, but he slipped out at the street-door; there was not any person in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Was the street-door open? - It was then on the jar; I do not know whether it was so when he came in; I went into the parlour, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner was taken immediately by the coachman; I met him as they were bringing him in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined.</p>
               <p>Your street-door usually stands open? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>It was open that morning? - I cannot say whether it was or was not.</p>
               <p>Have you lodgers in your house? - No: I never saw the prisoner before, till I saw him come out of my master's parlour.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of March, between eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250038"></xptr> and nine, I saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards before Mr. Pagett's house, looking in at the window; I live directly opposite; Mr. Pagett's door was on the jar; I saw him open the door, and go in; in about five minutes, I heard Mr. Pagett's maid cry out, Stop thief! I went out; the prisoner had then turned up the passage towards the coach-house.</p>
               <p>(The plate was produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I am entirely innocent. I met a young woman, who asked me if I bought old clothes; I told her I did; I said I would come on Monday, and see them; I went to this house, and found the door on a jar, and I went in; I met this young woman; I asked her if Mrs. Dixon lived there, for the woman told me her name was Dixon; she said, no: I went out; I never was in the parlour; I went up the court to go into Windmill-street; I found there was no thoroughfare; I went into the coach-house to ease myself, and the man came and took hold of me: I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

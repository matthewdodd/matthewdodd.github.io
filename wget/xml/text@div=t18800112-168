I am a chairmaker, of 5 13, Hackney Road—about 2.30 a.m. on Boxing Day I was passing down Tuilerie Street, when I noticed one of the shutters down, and a window abroken at Silver, No. 22, I think—I saw two constables standing at the corner of the square, and I gave Information—we went back to Silver's, and saw the prisoner half-way Across the road leaving the shop—the constables caught hold of him, and The uppers fell out from under his coat.</p>

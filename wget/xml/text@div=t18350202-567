                  </hi>. I am the grandson of Clarissa Cutbush—she is owner of the house, No. 130, Whitechapel-road—it is unoccupied—Harper was there to show it—on the morning of the 22nd of January, I went into the kitchen, and every thing was right—I went again about five o'clock in the afternoon, and missed a metal cock, which appeared to have been wrenched off—this appears like the cock; but there are many of this pattern, and I cannot swear to it.</p>

I was in the house about two o'clock that day—the prisoner came, and said his father was coming to do something to the top of the house—he asked me which was the way up stairs—I went up with him—he then went away, and came back—I asked where he had been—he said, "To the shop, to mix up some mortar"—he then went down stairs, and came up again, and said he had fallen into the cistern—he was very wet with water in front of him—he went down again, and was down some time, and I heard him knocking—I went down, and saw all the water running about the cellar—I said, "O, what have you done?"—he said, "To-day is water-day, the cistern runs over"—I said, "It will not run if you turn the cock off"'—I went to look, and found the cock was gone—I said, "You have cut the cock off"—he said, "No; to-day is water-day"—he then took and jammed the end of the pipe together—he came up and stood against the fire—I asked what he had in his pocket—he said, "Only a bit of lead"—I put my hand in, and found this cock—he said, "I have cut it off, but do not tell any body," and I said I would not—he then said, "Chuck it down the privy, or put it behind this fire-place, that will be best—I said, "No; the fire-place is coming down to-morrow"—I took it into the yard, put it into some dust, and told him I had thrown it down the privy—he said that was best, and then he went away—I stopped till dusk, and shut up the house—I then took the cock to my master.</p>

I went there with Mr. Day and one or two more: I went up to the garret where we were informed the girls lived, and I saw only one girl there; we searched under the bed, and Mr. Day found a loaded pistol: we had not been three minutes before Kelly and another came up into the room; I thought she seemed to have something bulge in her pocket; upon searching her I found this watch in her hand: she cried, and said I will shew you the lads that I had it from. I took a coach and went to Frog-lane, Islington; she said she was to meet them at a public-house there; Mr. Phillips and I took Davis there; she pointed him out to Mr. Phillips; we put him into the coach; he said, What do you take me up for? I pulled the watch out of my pocket, and asked him if he knew anything of it; he said, Yes, I gave it and a pistol to that girl: he said it was given him by one Stokes, and that Stokes was gone on board a ship.</p>

I went to meet them next morning, but they did not come; I met them next night at the Cock in Craven-street in Aldersgate-street; they sent word where I should meet them; I had the watch with me, but I left the pistol at my lodgings; a person came into the house that knew me, and I came away without giving them the watch: I spoke across the table, and said I would meet them next morning at Islington; I got up in the morning to go there, and went to my mother's for my cloaths; when I returned these men were in the room, and they took the watch out of my pocket; then I went with them to Frog-lane.</p>

               <p>So the watch was only delivered to you to take care of? - No.</p>

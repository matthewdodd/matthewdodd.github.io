                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ANN KELLY</hi>. I saw the prisoner on 27th Aug. at my shop, in Par<lb></lb>sonage-row, Newington—she came between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon for a London Journal and half an ounce of tobacco—I served her, and she gave me a shilling—I gave her change, and put the shilling into the till—there was one sixpence in it, but no other shilling—I kept it till my husband came home—he tried it, and found it bad—I saw the prisoner again on 10th Sept.—my husband served her then—I saw her pass a shilling to him; I saw him trying a shilling—he took it of her, and put it into the till—I was writing at the desk, and on looking up I recognised the woman—I was so near to my husband that I touched his foot, and he put the shilling into the till where there were some halfpence, but no other silver—when she was gone I took the shilling out of the till.</p>

I went home about half-past 4 o'clock—my wife gave me a shilling—I examined it—it was bad—I locked it up in the casbbox—I afterwards gave it to the officer—on 10th Sept. the prisoner came again—I served her—she gave me a shilling, and I gave her change, and put the shilling into the drawer with some halfpence—my wife nudged me, and after the prisoner was gone I examined the shilling—it was bad—I broke it in two or three pieces, and they were destroyed in the fire—on 24th Sept. I was called into the shop, and saw the prisoner there—my wife gave me a shilling in the pri<lb></lb>soner's</p>

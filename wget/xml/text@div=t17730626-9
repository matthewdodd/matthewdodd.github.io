            . The two prisoners, and one that is called the Captain, who is not taken, and I, agreed to go to one Mr. Paxton's, in Titchfield-street, Oxford-road; the scheme was, Paxton was to knock at the door; and was to knock the maid down as she opened the door, and so rob the house; we went there; a person over the way saw us knock at the door. Then we agreed to go to Mr. Fox's, and I was to secrete myself in the house and let them in; we went to the house and had a pint or two of beer; I let them in about two o'clock; we went into the tap; the Captain went into Mr. Jeffereys's cellar and broke open the door which parts the two cellars; then he went up stairs and opened the bar door with a key; then Evans and Plastow came up into the bar, and then the Captain shoved the sash back and got into the compting-house; after that we went into the tap room and broke open a box, and took out some wearing apparel; we took away some table linen and silk gowns, and some money; Evans told me the Captain had taken about 20 s. out of the till in silver, and some small pieces of gold; the Captain gave Evans about 4 s. We went to the top of Little Queen-street together; after which I went to a night house in St. James's; then Evans and I went and breakfasted at a house in St. George's-fields; afterwards we met with Plastow in Long-lane. The Captain gave Evans a guinea; I had half a guinea out of it, the Captain gave me the hat and bid me get it altered; Evans took it from me and pawned it. I heard they got two or three silver spoons and some buckles, but I did not see them; Plastow took a pair of new shoes to his lodgings; some children's petticoats were found at his lodgings; I think his wife said he brought them there.</p>
               <p>Q. What, Mrs. Burford?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes, she went for his wife. I saw these petticoats; they were taken out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Plastow lodged with this woman, did he?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the lodgings when the pistol was found?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I was at the lodgings on Sunday, but fell asleep there; I saw the bullets taken out of his pocket; they told me they were going to sell the spoons and buckles; I do not know whether they did or no.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Do you know any thing about any bank notes being taken out of the till?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No; they told me they got one bank note but had lost it.</p>

             that night till about ten o'clock; then I left him; I got very fuddled: about three o'clock I met this man; he mentioned that he had got some things, and asked me to go with him; he gave me these things, and bid me take care of them, and the pistols were tied up in them. I am a baker: I lived in Tyburn-road last; I have been out of business but about a month.</p>
               <p>Evan's Defence.</p>
               <p>I leave it to my counsel. Upon the Friday night as Mr. Fox's house was robbed on Saturday morning, I met Wilson going down Drury-lane; he asked me to go with him to Jefferys's to drink a pint of beer; at first I refused, but afterwards complied; we had a pint of beer; I fell asleep; Wilson had another pint of beer, and asked me if I was going; I said yes; he said he was going upon a message for Jefferys and I could not go with him; he said he would stop and drink the remainder of the beer with me; I laid my head down again and went to sleep; when I waked Wilson was gone; I went home to bed. I went next day to see a friend at Smithfield; going up Long-lane I met Wilson: as we came up Catherine-street, Wilson said he had a hat making for him, he must call for it; this was Saturday night; I went to the Crown and waited for him; while I was waiting for him, the people at the Crown told him there had been some constables after him; he came in with the hat; I told him of it; he seemed frightened and went out; as soon as we came out of the door he asked me to carry the hat; he asked me to pledge it for him; I did, at Murthwaite's, for 5 s. 3 d. and brought him the money; he went to my lodgings and slept with me all night. As to the dark lanthorn, going to Plastow's lodgings to call upon him to go and play at skittles, I found the dark lanthorn in Holborn. I have been in a gentleman's service. I have been out of place about a month.</p>

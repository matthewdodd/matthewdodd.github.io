             sworn. - I live at Mrs. Wilson's, in Half-moon-court, Wapping: Last Sunday I was coming from the Ship and Star about twelve o'clock at night, or half an hour after, I met two men dressed in sailor's clothes, one confined my arms, and the other took the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you struggle? - A. No, I was too helpless to struggle, I was rather in liquor, I sung out watch, three or four times; when the watchman came, I told him I was robbed, and shewed him which way they went; the next day I went to every pawnbroker's shop in London, to the best of my knowledge, for them to stop the watch; one of the runners came to me at the Ship and Star, and told me my watch was found; it had my name round the dial plate instead of figures.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the persons were that laid hold of you? - A. No, only that they were dressed in sailor's clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner one of them? - A. I cannot safely say that; the prisoner was stopped with the watch.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Sowerby, pawnbroker, the corner of Millyard: On Monday morning a man came to our shop, in order to have his watch stopped; he said, the name of Benjamin Berry was round the dialplate, that the number of it was 99, the maker's name he did not recollect, but it was at Chelsea; in the afternoon of the same day the prisoner tendered the watch to pledge, and seeing the name round the dial-plate, Mr. Sowerby jumped over the counter, and told the prisoner that he was detained; Mr. Sowerby enquired of him where he got the watch; he said he found it at the landing-place at Union-stairs, to the best of my recollection he said that morning; my master sent for an officer, who took the prisoner into custody. (Produces the watch.)</p>
               <p>Berry. I am sure this is my watch, I had it made on purpose for me, it cost me five guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Berry.) Did either of them strike you? - A. I had a blow from somebody, but I cannot say from whom.</p>

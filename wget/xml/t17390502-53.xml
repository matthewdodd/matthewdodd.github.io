And happening to meet Mr. Parry, we held him, while Bull searched his Pockets. He pulled out a Penknife with a Buckshorn Handle, and threatn'd to rip out his Guts if he did not deliver his Money. We took three Shillings and one Penny Half-penny from him, and divided one Shilling and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173905020018"></xptr> Half penny a piece. I never saw the Prosecutor before that Night, to my Knowledge, but I heard his Name, for while Bull was rifling his Pockets, he said, don't hurt poor Mr. Parry, for he is a Man that hurts nobody. When the Prisoners were carry'd before the Justice, and Mr. Parry was sent for, Bull, as soon as he saw him, said to a Gentleman that stood by him, - here comes the Jamming Cull, (meaning the Man that was to hang him.)</p>

The two Prisoners and Dent were brought to us at Twelve o'Clock at Night, and the next Morning were carry'd before Mr. Justice Farmer; the two Prisoners were hand-cuff'd, and the Evidence had an Iron on: When they were before Mr. Farmer, Dent told us where Mr. Parry liv'd, and a Porter was sent for him, but he return'd, and could not find the House; upon which Mr. Farmer order'd me to go with Dent, and see if we could find it; so we went out together, and he carry'd me to it, and told me at that Time, that the Man's Name was Parry; I enquired at the House for Mr. Parry, and his Wife told me he belong'd to the Custom-house, and was not at Home, but he should come between Two and Three o'Clock; and he accordingly came, and gave an Account of this Robbery. As to the Knife which the Evidence mentions, I search'd Bull, and took it out of his Pocket the Morning he was hand-cuff'd: I heard the Evidence mention before the Justice, that while they were rifling the Man, he said, Don't hurt poor Mr. Parry, &amp;c. When we had been before the Justice, Bull snatch'd up a Pint Pot, and gave the Evidence such a Knock with it, that I thought he had beat his Brains out.</p>

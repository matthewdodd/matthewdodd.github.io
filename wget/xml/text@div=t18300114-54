On Christmas-day, at twelve o'clock at night, I was sitting in my back parlour; my mother gave an alarm, and I saw three persons in the shop - I went into the shop; two had gone out, and the prisoner remained; he had a piece of meat in his hand when I came out of the parlour - I ran, and caught him about a hundred yards off without losing sight of him; he had not got the mutton then - I did not notice if the others had any thing; it was a darkish night; he said he had done nothing - my shop has a kind of half door; the windows are broken out of the frame - it is a door with a glass, which comes half down; I had seen the door half an hour before, and left it latched - it is a spring lock, and pulls back; a person putting a hand through the glass, which was out, could unfasten it - as I brought the prisoner back my father found a piece of flap of mutton, about 2 lbs., and about 3 1/2 lbs. of neck was stolen; I had forgotten to put up the door shutter - the meat is worth about 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you go on leaving the shop? A.Into the parlour: I had some friends, and sat with my back to the shop door - I have a lodger, who might have come down; I did not notice that the prisoner was tipsy - it might have been a jest.</p>

On the 6th of January, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I shut up the shop, and went to bed at ten o'clock. There is a casement window in the shop, which was nailed up, and there are three bars across, inside, it does not open. I fastened the door and the other shop windows, which have shutters. Next morning about six o'clock, or half-past, on getting up, I missed the cheese from the window, and two sides of bacon from the front of the counter, which were in the shop the night before. It was dark, and I had a candle to examine; I found the door a little way open and the casement window broken all to pieces, and hanging outside; a man could squeeze between the iron bars. One side of bacon was very long and thin in the neck part; I had bought it in London, on the 1st of January, and on bringing it home in the cart I sat upon it, the corner stood out, I rested my shoe upon it, and it made a mark on the corner very black and dirty. I saw it again in possession of the constable, and know it to be the same; I am quite positive of it. I also saw 4 lbs. of cheese, the same sort and quality as I lost. I lost 40 lbs. and 2 cwt. of bacon; I found 50 lbs. I locked the door at night, and left the keys inside; if a person broke through the window, they might get out by opening the door.</p>

            . I am constable of Feltham, about a mile from Bedfont. I have known the prisoner some years, I had occasion to go to his house on the 17th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and found him there - it is about a mile and a quarter from Gamble's. I found a quantity of bacon and cheese there. I got a warrant, and went again in about three-quarters of an hour, and found the house shut - I knocked - there was a padlock on the door. I broke it open, but he was gone. I found 50 lbs. of bacon and 4 lbs. of cheese. I also found some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140011"></xptr>instruments, a chisel, pickaxe, a saw, crowbar, and some other pieces of iron. I could not see him again till the 5th of February, I then met him in a lane between Chelsea and Kensington, near twelve miles from Feltham. I had not been particularly looking for him. I told him he was wanted for a burglary committed at Gamble's; he said he knew nothing of it, and wished me to let him go. I know the house was his, he lived there from the 9th of September, till the day I searched his house - he is a single man, and knew I was a constable. I went to enquire for his father.</p>

Yesterday morning, between the hours of twelve and one, I saw the prisoner come in the shop; she had a child in her arms then; she asked for a small piece of sprigged muslin. I had one other customer in the shop. I saw her set the child on the counter. She took the child off the counter again, and took it in her arms. She was anxious to be served before the other customer left. I made a reply that I would serve her directly. The other customer went out of the shop. I perceived the prisoner with the child in her arms had got something under her shawl. She bought a quarter of a yard of plain book muslin; she paid nine pence for it. I espied three pieces of lawn on the counter; I was certain my employer had left four pieces on the counter; I missed one. I had observed four pieces on the counter twenty minutes before this. I let her go out of the shop. I followed her, and asked her whether she had got any thing that was not her own; she said, no, I pulled her shawl aside, and took the piece of lawn out of her hand. She had got the child in one hand, and the piece of lawn in the other. The lawn was twelve yards.</p>

               <p>JOHN STILES. I only know that is my property. I left home about eleven o'clock; I left that lawn on the counter; it has my shop mark; it is worth eighteen shillings; that is the price cost of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I get my living honestly. I went to purchase muslin; I sat the child on the counter. When I came out of the door I heard the child say, dolly. I said, what have you got there. The shopman came up and said, my property. I did not know the child had got it. I was taken in custody immediately.</p>

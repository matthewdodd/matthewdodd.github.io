            . I am a green-grocer, and live in Vinegar-lane. On Monday night, the 17th of May, about ten o'clock, I heard a cry of Watch! Watch! I ran to the door, and another young man that was in my shop ran in the direction the voice came from; I stood at my door for a minute, and saw two young men approach my window, one of them had a hat in his hand, and both had hats or caps on; their heads were covered - the man with the hat in his hand said, "Before they shall take the hat away from me, the b-rs, I will take and job his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270008"></xptr>eye out;" they were as near the size of the prisoners as I can calculate - the man who had the hat wore an open short jacket; the other, a coat, but what colour I cannot say - I did not notice them much; I saw them pass up Vinegar-lane, and kept them in sight till they came to the next lamp, then one ran across - both ran away, and one of them sang out Jack, and separated; it then struck me they were the men who took the hat from the man, instead of him trying to take it from them - I believe the prisoners to be the men I saw pass my door; they answer the description I gave to the Police at twelve o'clock the same night - I cannot swear to them, but I certainly think they are the men.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at the Robart's Arms, Portland-street, about two hundred yards from Vinegar-lane: I lived there a week and three days. On Monday, the 17th of May, about ten o'clock, Quin and the prisoner Collins' sister came in, and had a pint of beer; in about a quarter of an hour Collins came in with a hat on his head and a cap under his arm - when he came in he said to Quin, "Jack, I have found a hat;" Quin said, "Where did you find it?" he said on the dung-hill, and said.</p>
               <p>"Shall I sell it;" Quin said, "What do you want for it?" he said, "Oh, I shan't sell it now;" in about five minutes another girl came in - the officer came in, and took Collins and the hat; Quin was taken next day.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. In consequence of information from a private watchman, I went to the Robart's Arms, about a quarter to eleven o'clock- I had not seen the prisoners; I found them at the Robart's Arms, with two females - I inquired of Collins if he had a hat to sell - he took it up; it was on his left-hand side, on the settle - he said, "Is this it?" I asked what he meant by saying that - one of the females rose up, and said, "Oh, he knows nothing at all about it;" I had said nothing about any robbery or any thing; I told her to mind her own business; she sat down, and the colour came in Quin's face very much - I went to the landlady, made inquiry, and then took Collins with the hat; I found some receipts in it - Collins had a jacket on: I did not search him.</p>

I said I believed it was a dog - he went and took it up, and said, "It is a hat, shall I take it with me?" I said, "Yes, if you don't, somebody else will," and he took it - the dung-heap is in the turning in Vinegar-lane; he went strait along into the Robert's Arms with it; I went with him, and was there when the Police-man took him out - I had been no where; we came from Bluegatefields - I know Quin; the next witness keeps company with him - I live with my mother, who does needlework for a shop in Smithfield; I get my bread by needlework- I had finished my work, and came out for a walk; Collins asked me to walk with him - I left home about ten o'clock, and went into the public-house between ten and eleven, it was nearer eleven; I have known him for years- I was standing at my door, and he asked me to go to the Robart's Arms with him; they say the prosecutor was knocked down at this turning, but we do not know it - I did not cry "Halves" when the hat was found.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, S</hi> 28). On 14th May, in consequence of information, I went to a loft belonging to Mr. Giddens, in the parish of South Mimms, and under a quantity of loose straw I found a bundle of rowen hay—I put some pieces of paper in it—I went back again the same evening expecting it would be removed, but it was not—I went again the following morning, and again on Friday evening, the 16th, about 10 o'clock, it was still there, and the paper that I had placed in it—I then went and examined a load of hay which stood in a cart in the yard, and under the cloth of it I found a bundle of rowen hay which I marked by tying two pieces of string round each band—I then put the cloth down as I found it, and went away for about an hour—I put on private clothes, returned to the premises and watched—about 1 in the morning, Taylor and Stokes came to the stable—I was concealed in a wheeler's workshop, about a dozen yards from the stable—it was a dull cloudy morning, but I saw Taylor and Stokes pass me, they were not three yards from me—I have known them three years—I have not the least doubt it was them—they went into the stable, and fed the horses—Taylor then went from the stable to the loft over the stable—Stokes called out, "Do you want me up there?"—I did not hear Taylor's reply, but Stokes went up; and in about a minute the hay was thrown through a hole in the loft floor into the stable</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185106160005"></xptr>
               <p>—they then came down, and remained quiet in the stable for an hour or an hour and a half—Stokes then came out, and went up a ladder into the same loft, and threw down a sack containing chaff—he then returned into the stable, and remained there till about 4 in the morning, when they brought out the shaft horse, and put it into the cart—Stokes then returned into the stable, and during that time Taylor unfastened the cloth which covered the hay—he got on the hay, and Stokes brought out the bundle of hay which I had pre<lb></lb>viously marked; the same which fell from the loft—he took it to Taylor who was on the cart, who placed it on the hay—Stokes returned to the stable for the other horse, and during that time Taylor got off the hay and pulled the cloth down—the other horse was then hooked-to, and they both left the premises with the cart—I remained on the premises for a few minutes, as from where I stood I could not see whether both the men had left—I then went out—I could not see them nor the cart—I followed the cart, and after walking half a mile I got in sight of it—I only saw Stokes then, he was driving—I fol<lb></lb>lowed with an officer to the Swan with two Necks at Finchley—I had lost sight of Taylor from the time they turned out of the yard—when Stokes arrived within about four yards of the stable-door he struck the cloth that was over the hay several times with his whip, and in about a minute or so he walked round and undid the cloth, and Taylor who was under the cloth rose up and stood on the load of hay and looked round—I was within about forty yards of the house—Taylor then put the small bundle of hay which had been under the straw on Stokes's back, and Stokes carried it into the stable—Reynolds was in the doorway of the stable—he stepped back, to allow Stokes to past with the hay—Stokes put that hay down in the stable, and returned to the cart—Taylor put the other bundle of hay on his back, the one that I had marked with the strings—Stokes carried that into the stable—he then returned to the cart, and fed the horses with some chaff during that time Taylor got off the load of hay and fastened down the cloth—I passed by the stable where the hay was, and Reynolds, the ostler, had removed near to the first bundle of hay—I then returned, and met the constable whom I had placed to watch—I went to the stable, and found the door fastened—I looked through the hole, and saw a nail placed over the latch which fastened it down—I saw Reynolds standing by the large bundle of hay in the stable—I went into the tap-room, and saw Stokes and Taylor sitting down getting tome re<lb></lb>freshment—I passed out of the passage to a back-door, and as I opened the door I saw Reynolds with the large bundle of hay, in the act of placing it on two trusses of hay near the door, at the foot of a ladder leading to a loft—I told him I wanted him, for receiving hay knowing it to be stolen—I took him in the tap-room, and delivered him and the other two prisoners to the officer—I returned to the yard, and took the bundle of hay that I had seen with Reynolds; I gave that to the officer—I then went in the stable, and found the small bundle of hay; it weighed 33 lbs., and the larger one about 67 lbs.; I found on them the marks that I know them by—I told Taylor and Stokes that I took them for stealing hay.</p>

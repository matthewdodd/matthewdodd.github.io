                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant P</hi>). On 10th January, about 3 a.m., I received information, and found six pigs and seven ducks, dead, on the prisoner's father's premises—some of the ducks had their heads pulled right off, and others had them stretched out from the windpipe—the pigs appeared to have been hit on the head—there was a little blood on them—I con<lb></lb>cealed myself in a shed, about four yards from where they were lying, and remained there from 3.30 till 5.45, when the prisoner came in through the large shed, which is a railway arch, under the North Kent Line, with doors at each end—he walked through 'the premises, and round the shed, where we were secreted—he moved a temporary board, which stood in front of the little shed, stooped down, and felt in with his hands, then got up, went into the big shed, lit a candle, came out with it, and stood for a second; he then commenced moving the pigs from his left side, passing them over to his right—on picking up the second, he said to himself "Oh, you are nice little chaps, too!"—he bad a lantern in his hand, and as he was picking up the third pig, I stepped out, and said "Halloa, Tyler, what are you doing?—he said "Nothing!"—I said "Well, there were some dead pigs and ducks, for I saw you remove them"—he said "Well, I get up early in the morning, for we have had several things removed from here"—I said "We will see about these ducks and pigs "—he said "I do not know anything of them"—I said "Why, I saw you remove them "—he said Well, three men brought them here last night"—I said "What time?—he said "Be<lb></lb>tween 12 and 1 o'clock "—I said "Who were the men?"—he said "I don't know, they were entire strangers to me"—I took him to the station; we arrived there about 6.30, and about 9 o'clock when I was searching him, he said "Well, I bought them List night"—he afterwards said "If I had not been drinking I should not have gone with them "—he was taken before the Magistrate, and remanded—on 10th January I took his coat off, examined the pockets, and found some feathers in one—both the pockets were clotted with congealed blood—the feathers correspond with those of this duck's neck and head (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was found lying on the premises—the prosecutor's premises are 300 or 400 yards from the Tunbridge Railway; to get there people would go as far as the junction between Lewisham and New Cross, and then down the North Kent line, to the shed, which is right underneath the North Kent Line—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not remember his saying that he had been drinking all night till after 11 o'clock—he did not appear under the effect of drink at 6 a.m.—I did not tell the solicitor, at the Police Court, that I could see that the prisoner had been drinking overnight—the prisoner may have said at 6 o'clock that the persons who brought them had asked him to buy them, but I do not recollect it—he did not say "He brought them, and I found they were dead, and then declined to buy them"—he did say "They asked me to buy them"—it is possible that he may have said at 6 a.m. that he was asked to buy these things lute last night by the strangers—he repeated that at the station—I will not swear that he did not tell me that he had been out drinking all night, and met these strangers, who were entire strangers to him—two constables, Fielder and Franklyn, were in the shed with me—they are out of Court—I could not manage to squeeze seven ducks into these pockets—they weigh from 4 lbs. to 5 lbs. each, and the pigs</p>

               <p>16 lbs. each—I have seen the prisoner at pigeon-matches—I do not know whether his father keeps ducks, fowls, or pigeons; I saw one lire duck fly over from the Ravensbourne—I was there three hours, but it was dark, and I did not see a duck-pond—this was not on my beat, it is not the section I belong to—there was snow on the ground—I followed the footsteps behind the constable, and the way I traced them it was about a mile and a half from Mr. Sheppard's house to Mr. Tylers's—there were six sets of footsteps, three going each way; they went up to Heather Green Bridge, just through the bridge, which is three-quarters of a mile from where the prisoner lives—I traced the three sets of footsteps to within twenty yards of Tyler's house, and then one set went up to the shed on Mr. Tyler's premises—I did not trace them back, but they went both ways—I did not see a shoe compared with the foot-marks—the snow was just deep enough to cover the ground, so that you could trace the steps, which left a deep impression—one foot-print appeared as if the toe-cap was off; I noticed that for the whole mile and a half, where we could get a direct print of it—that was between 3 and 4 a.m.—it was moonlight, and I had the assist<lb></lb>ance of my lamp—the snow was not all melted away before we went to the Police Court next morning—we went there at 10.20, and did not leave till 2 p.m.—I did not notice whether the snow had melted then—here is where the toe-cap is off the boot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also saw the impression of these four nails—it is not an uncommon kind of boot for a labourer to wear—it was taken from the prisoner's feet—I took two men, named Hazlewood and Calverly, in custody—that was not after comparing their boots with the snow, it was some days afterwards—one set of footsteps was, I believe, smaller than this boot, and another set about the same size.</p>

I am a labourer, in the service of Mr. Sheppard, of Heather Green—on the afternoon of 9th January my pigs and my master's ducks were safe at 6 o'clock—my sow and six pigs were kept in the piggery, and the ducks near them, in the hen-house—the piggery door was bolted, and the hen-house door locked—I missed them next morning at 6 o'clock, and afterwards identified them—these are duck's feathers which are pro<lb></lb>duced—I saw them compared with the neck of one of the ducks I lost.</p>

               <p>then secreted myself—I could not trace them quite up to the shed; hut within three yards of it, and that was only of one person—I had traced that particular pair of shoes among the three the whole way from where the robbery was committed to the shed—after some time the prisoner entered the yard; he felt into the shed, and then went back into another shed, and lit a candle—he then commenced moving the pigs—Elston and I went to him—we took one of his hoots and compared it with the impressions in the snow, which was melting; but they were clear and clean—I put the boot alongside the impressions, and then went on further, and tried them again—the toe-plate was off the hoot, and there was a piece off the iron of the heel—I measured the length with a piece of stick, and it exactly fitted, from toe to heel—these nails, from which the plate has been wrenched, fitted the impressions—I compared this boot with all these three impressions, leaving the premises and entering the shed, and found one like it all along.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said, at the Police Court, that the plate was off the toe, and the hind clip was loose, and a piece of it off—I will not swear that I said that a piece was off—I heard the prisoner say something when I was in the shed; but I could not tell what—the other officers and I were close together—the shed is about 250 yards from the junction of the railway—where they came off the railway was about four yards from the shed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer and carpenter, and have worked for Mr. Jerrard for two years—I was apprehended for this robbery on the Tuesday evening, but was discharged at Greenwich Police Court—I was never before a Magistrate before that—on the Monday night I was drinking at the "Bee Hive "with Tyler and another man; we parted as near as I can tell between 10 and 10.30, he was then the worse for liquor—we were also at the "Albion"—I met him at 8 o'clock in the evening, and was drinking with him till 10.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know where Sheppard's place is—I did not see two men with ducks and pigs—I did not see Tyler home—I left him, I think it was just outside the public-house—I know Hazlewood, he works for the same firm as I do—I think I heard him own this stick at the Police Court—I was in bed at 1.15 that morning—I went home at 10.30, and went to bed, and was never out afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and have been in Mr. Jerrard's employ seven years in March—I was once fined I/, for the unlawful posses<lb></lb>sion of some cloth; that was about six months' ago—I am still in Mr. Jer<lb></lb>rard's</p>

               <p>employment—no other charge has ever been made against me, that I am aware of—on 9th January I was with Tyler and Calverly, at the "Albion" and the "Bee Hive "—I left the "Bee Hive" about 10, or 10.30, and got home about 11 o'clock—Calverly lives not fur from the "Bee Hive," and he went home by himself—I left Tyler not far from Lewisham Bridge, and he went towards his home—there are a great many public-houses there—Tyler was much the worse for drink—I did not see him home—when we went past the "Roebuck/' he wanted to go in, but I would not—I thought he had had pretty well enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Calverly and I were both charged with this, on suspicion—this is my club—I put this bit of iron on the end—it was just before Christmas that I was charged about this cloth.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Attwell-street, Goswell-street, and am a smith's labourer at present. Last Saturday fortnight I was coming from the pay table with my wife, and was coming home—I met the prisoner underneath the passage entering into Attwell—street; she accosted me, and said she wanted to speak to me—I said I did not want to speak to her—she asked if I had any money for her—I said, "Not half a farthing"—she deliberately took a knife from underneath her shawl, made aim, and stuck it into my breast; it was in the dark, I could not see what kind of knife it was, I felt the blow—I felt the blade of the knife on the breast—I ran away direct to the station, and made a complaint there—I then went with the officer to point out the prisoner, and give her into custody—I afterwards went to Mr. Mather's, the surgeon, who dressed my wound—I had cohabited with the prisoner in 1851—I have been married about seven months—I was never married to the prisoner—her name is Honora M'Sweeney.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I was walking with him on the evening of Saturday fortnight; when we got under an archway, near Goswell-street, the prisoner and her sister came up, and accosted my husband—the prisoner asked me to stand on one side, and she went about four yards distance from me with my husband—I heard her ask him for money, or else to allow her so much a week—I did not hear what else she said—she said a great deal, but I did not hear it—I was about four yards away—she said if he did not give her money she would do something to him; it was some threatening language—I do not remember exactly what it was—he said he would not give her half a farthing, and I saw her lift her right hand, and hit my husband; I then saw him run away—I went towards home, and the prisoner accosted me—I was about five doors from the house where I live; a struggle ensued between us, and T felt the knife with her, I got a cut on the wrist with it—I do not exactly know in whose hand the, knife was then, whether hers or her sister's, for I was struggling with them both—I got it away in the struggle, I believe from the prisoner, but I was so faint, I do not know whether I dropped it, or what became of it.</p>

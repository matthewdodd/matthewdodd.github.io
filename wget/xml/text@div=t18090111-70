            . I am a labourer in the employ of Mr. Passingham. On Thursday the 22nd of December, I went to thrash in the barn, I found it had been robbed; there was a hole in the heap of oats I had left on the Wednesday evening, that made me know there were some gone; there were some beans scattered among the oats, there was a great hole in the heap and the heap was diminished; on Friday I found a lark in the heap.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how West was employed at that time - A. I know he used to catch larks; I do not know what he was doing then; I locked the bar on the preceding evening and I found it locked on the Thursday morning.</p>

            . Q. On the Thursday morning in consequence of information from the last witness you went to your barn - A. On the Friday morning I observed there were a great many oats scattered about the barn; there had been a large fall of snow on the Thursday, where they were shed, from the barn door to the prisoners house door; there were oats scattered all the way to the prisoner's door; I got a warrant from Mr. Fraser the magistrate; we searched the prisoner's house; the children were at home, the woman was gone to sell the larks that had been catched the day before; I found a good deal of corn under the bed in tubs, some tick beans and barley; some cleaned and some not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any barley - A. Not as I know of; we found some oats scattered under the bed; we found no oats in the house that I was looking for; we found oats in the poultry house, in an old bran sack; they are my oats and I will swear to them; we took a sample from the barn to the magistrate and compared them there.</p>
               <p>COURT. You might as well have produced a sample to the jury, as well as to the magistrate - A. I have not brought a sample here from the barn; I am sure they are my oats.</p>
               <p>Q. We can best judge of that by the sample from the barn with the oats here - A. The beans that were in the barn are among them; they are tick beans; there were tick beans among them in the barn, and there are tick beans with these.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Do you know that the prisoner was a lark catching - A. He was; his wife was gone to sell them he had catched the day before. After the prisoner was apprehended I took him before a magistrate; as we were going along he said he hoped I should not hurt him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Now be correct - A. I said what shall I hurt you for, you said they were not my oats; he did say that when he first came into the house; we went into Mr. Fraser's, into the hall; the magistrate said West, I am sorry to see you here upon such an occasion; he asked him how he came to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the magistrate say you had better tell us how you came to do it - A. No; he said if he had not been drunk he should not have done it, he hoped I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Do you, Mr. Passingham, looking at them oats, believe them to be yours - A. Certainly; there are two bushels half cleaned, about five shillings value.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when he took them - A. He acknowledged before Mr. Fraser that it was eleven o'clock at night when he took them, and that he got up between the barn door and the barn rack.</p>
               <p>COURT. Nothing of this sort was taken in writing - A. Nothing taken in writing while I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Mr. Fraser's, Mr. Fraser never took pen or paper in his hands - A. No, not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the magistrate what was your charge against him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell the magistrate - A. I told him that my man told me that my barn was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man tell you that the barn was broken open - A. No, he told me that somebody had entered the barn door; the door was fast when he left it and when he came there in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell the magistrate in the hearing of the prisoner - A. I charged him with stealing the oats, my barn was robbed and I found the oats on his premises: after I said this the high constable was examined; the prisoner confessed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the prisoner confessed, it is a short receipt - was that the next thing that followed - did not the magistrate tell him it would be much better for him to give an account of it - A. The magistrate said if he did not steal the corn he had bought it under the value; he gave him an hour to go to the public house, and if he would own who he bought it of, it would be the better for him; that was not my corn. This is my corn.</p>
               <p>Q. I know that is the corn you claim - what was the question the magistrate asked him - A. How he came by the oats and beans.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not he tell him it would be better for him to tell him how he came by it, and he would give him an hour - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me the magistrate said he had better tell, and he would give him an hour to go to the public house - what did the magistrate say to the prisoner, before he said any thing - A. He asked him how he came by the corn; the prisoner said he had not stole the corn from me, he had bought it of somebody else under the value.</p>
               <p>Q. And this you call a confession - was the prisoner sent back to the public house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before he got to the public house - A. He got in between the rack and the barn door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the magistrate told him before that it would be better for him to give an account of it - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you trace the oats to the prisoner's house - A. No; I went to the prisoner's house, I found the oats in the fowl house, they were in a sack.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you found the oats was the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110051"></xptr>apprehended - A. In the course of an hour or two. I saw him at his own cottage afterwards; the prisoner there said he came by them honestly. We went to Mr. Fraser's into the hall; Mr. Fraser came to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Fraser wrote any thing down - A. I do not think he did. Mr. Passingham told Mr. Fraser that he had found the oats, and that he was ready to swear that they were his property; he told me he was ready to swear they were his property; he told him he had found them in an outhouse at the back of the prisoner's cottage; Mr. Fraser said he was sorry to see him in that situation - West, how did you come by them; he said, sir, I will tell you the truth; I got up between the barn door and the rack and got in; I was drunk or else I should not have done it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean to say that Mr. Fraser did not say it would be better for him to tell - do you mean to swear that - A. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what the prisoner is - A. A thresher, sometimes, a brick maker, and a lark catcher in snowy weather. When I went after him he was a lark catching then.</p>

            . I am bailiff to Mr. Passingham. I went with Mr. Passingham to his barn door, I saw a quantity of oats laying at the barn door; we traced these oats from the barn door all the way on the snow to the prisoner's door.</p>
               <p>COURT On the Friday - A. Yes; the 23rd. I found no oats beyond the prisoner's door.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you find any beans among the oats in the track - A. Yes; one at the door. I saw the oats brought out of the fowl house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Is there the same proportion of beans among them as with those in the barn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As far as you can form your judgment are they of the same description - A. Yes; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. That question is not worth while asking, if they would not bring a sample from the heap in the barn for the jury to tell for themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Without any sample from the heap in your master's barn to compare that sack of oats with, would you venture to swear they are the same - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the public house after I came home from larking, I was in liquor; going home I picked up these oats in the road; I carried them to the fowl house; in the morning when I got up I found they were oats.</p>

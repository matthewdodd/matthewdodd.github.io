            . I am a labourer at Haydon-square warehouse. I was ordered to watch a chest of tea; on the 8th of December, about ten minutes before ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner come down the alley, between the row of chests. When the prisoner came down he put his hand, and felt about it, I could not see who it was; he had a military coat; he turned the chest on its edge; he took a bag out of his pocket, and began to fill the bag; I let him go, he filled the bag, and shook it, he turned round and faced me, and put it in his hat, and then put his hat on his head; I called out what are you doing there? I jumped down and seized him; he said, what is the matter? I said, you know what is the matter, you have plundered a chest of tea; he said, pray forgive me, I have a little tea in my hat. I told him I knew he had, I could not forgive him; I took him down into the elder's accompting-house, he then laid down his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of tea was there - A. Eighteen ounces, the officer told me, I did not see it weighted.</p>
               <p>- WARBURTON. I am an officer. The prisoner was brought into the office, he pulled off his hat. This is the bag of tea that was taken out of his hat</p>

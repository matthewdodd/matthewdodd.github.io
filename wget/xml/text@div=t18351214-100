                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my service, and during that time we missed a great quantity of linen—I have seen the articles stated in the indictment, and they are my property—I lost them about two months ago—the prisoner was not in our service when I missed them.</p>

                  </hi>. I had a child to nurse for the prisoner—the parish paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for it, and at the end of the quarter the prisoner was to pay 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a week—the prisoner was twenty-four year's old when she was confined—she is now nearly twenty-six—I saw these gloves drop out of the prisoner's pocket when she came to my house on the Sunday before her mistress was confined—I took them up, and put them on the side-board—and when she came again I told her she had dropped her gloves, and she told me to keep them for the child—she came down to me the Sunday before her mistress was confined, and desired I would bring the baby to her once a week, that she might see it every Sunday—I agreed to do so, and sent my daughter with the child, and she brought back three plates and a cup—she left her place on the 21st of October, and on the Sunday week after she came home, Nichols, the last prisoner, came to see her, and then they bad the plate on the table, and I saw her take the handkerchief out of her box—she used it for three or four days—I washed it for her, and she asked me for it, and said she would not part with it for five shillings—I said it was up stairs, in an upper room—I would not give it up to her, she said she would not care. but it had a mark on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not she take her child away from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she did not—she wished to have it herself—she wanted a washerwo<lb></lb>man to have it who worked for Mr. Kelly—she did not wish it taken away from me—she came once when she was tipsy, and then she did, but it was only when she was tipsy—I did not tell bar she might take it away—I said I would give it up to the parish officers—I would not let her take it—I did not say I would do her all the hurt I could, if she took the child away—I sent my daughter with the child to see the prisoner at Mr. Kelly's on Sun day evening—my daughter brought home two plates and a cup when she returned—that was the second Sunday she went—she never brought me any dripping—the plates were as they are now—I never washed them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—the pri<lb></lb>soner gave these plates to me at Mr. Kelly's house, in the kitchen, and told me there was one for my sister, and tow for her own child, and the cup was for the baby to drink out of—I have a little sister—the plate with the horses in it was for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not she tell you she had bought two of the plates in Whitechapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—my little sister is about four years old—these two small plates may he called children's plates—I believe I took coffee with the prisoner on the Sunday evening—there was some butter on the dresser—I did not see a handkerchief lying on the chair—she gave me no dripping that evening—my mother was not angry at the child's being taken away—all she said was, that she would not give it up to her—Mrs. Ryals lives next door to me—I never heard her talking about the child—I am not at home except on Sunday—the prisoner never gave me any dripping to</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I do not know any thing about the gloves—Grant came to tea with me, and put the handkerchief into her pocket by mistake—we afterwards quarrelled, because I wanted to take the baby away, as she did not keep it clean—she told me she would do me all the injury she could, and get me in prison—I bought the plates in Whitechapel, and I gave her the dripping because she said her mother wanted to make a gooseberry<lb></lb>pie—I put it on the plate, and told her to bring it back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. GRANT</hi>. The prisoner never complained that I did not keep her child clean enough—she did not say that she should take it away because I did not keep it clean—the things were found at my house after her child had been removed.</p>

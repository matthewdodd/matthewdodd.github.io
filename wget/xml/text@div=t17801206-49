A child found a pawnbroker's duplicate of a sheet, in the room where she lay; that gave me a suspicion of her. I went to Justice Wright and got a warrant against her and another servant of mine, and a Mrs. Riley, whose name was on the ticket. When the constable came I went down to the prisoner to know if she knew a Mrs. Riley, and finding she did, I took her only up. The sheet I had found the ticket of was not marked. The pawnbroker, after she was committed, found out another sheet, and a spoon, which she acknowledged she had pawned.</p>
               <p>Was any promise made to induce her to confess? - I promised before the justice, the first time, if she would confess to all the things I would not prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Did she own to the spoon before or after you made the promise? - Afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did she acknowledge any thing before you made the promise? - She said before the promise, that she had only pawned one sheet.</p>
               <p>Were any of the things found? - Only the two sheets and one tea-spoon. I missed at different times nine sheets, two table-spoons, four tea-spoons, and three table-cloths.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they were in the house when she came to live with you? - Yes. About a fortnight before the linen was right, all but one table cloth.</p>

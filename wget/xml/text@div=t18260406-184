            . I am matron of the Queen's Lying-in Hospital - Sarah Buckley came there to lye-in; she was put to bed on the 8th of January and died on the 16th: I found a small key and an old purse in her pocket after her death; the prisoner came to see her the day before she died, and she came after her deatl; and asked me if I knew what she died of; she said she thought it was of starvation, but she had got very good clothes, and she wondered she had not parted with them; I said it was not easy to get them out of pawn again - she said she was very sorry for her; I never saw the last witness till she came to the hospital after the decease of Sarah Buckley; she seemed to know her; I told the prisoner she must give up Buckley's clothes to the parish - she said she had not any clothes belonging to her, and she had nothing but what she stood up in.</p>

            . I remember seeing the prisoner during the hard frost - she came to my house in Upper Bryanstone-street, where I keep a chandler's shop- the prisoner and a girl came one Monday evening and brought a trunk - the prisoner said it was her own, and asked if she might put it in my shop, as her husband and her had had a quarrel, and she had brought them from him - I knew her perfectly well, and allowed her to put it there- she brought the box behind my counter and opened it; I asked her if Sarah Buckley was put to bed - she said Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060076"></xptr>and as she had no box of her own she had put her things into her box, and she was going to take some of them to her in the hospital - she came again the same evening and took some more things out - she came again on the Wednesday and took the box away; I noticed a blue gown and a parcel, but there was no book, to my knowledge, except a Bible, which she took out of the box the first time, and put into my hands, but I cannot say whether it was this or not- I only noticed it had the Common Prayer-book with it- I cannot tell what day of the month it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would you swear that she did not say that her husband had threatened to sell off every thing they had and leave her? A. No; I could not swear to any thing, except the Bible, from its having the prayer-book with it.</p>

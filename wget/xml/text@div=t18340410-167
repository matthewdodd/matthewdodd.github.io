            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker. On the 24th or 26th of February, the prisoner brought this part of a fork, and asked if we bought such things - I replied that we sometimes bought old silver - he asked what it was an ounce - I said, "About 4s. 8d." - I showed it to 
               <persName id="t18340410-167-person1050">Mr. Law</persName>
            , my master - he asked if I had inquired about the other part - I came and asked the prisoner about it - he said he had lost that, or he could not find it - he then said he had broken it in opening a cellar door, as he had a dish in his hand at the time - I saw a policeman in the back room, whom my master had called in - I went into the shop, and asked the prisoner if he wished to sell it - he said,"Yes" - the officer then came in, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Do you know that the prisoner was then living in <rs id="t18340410-167-viclabel953" type="occupation">General</rs>

             (police-sergeant D 41). I took the prisoner - he said he merely went to ask what it would cost to get this repaired, or whether he could have one made like it - I asked how they could tell the value of it, without he produced the other part - he said he could not do that for he had lost it; but when we got to the watch-house, I found this other part of it in his waistcoat pocket - he said he did not know he had it - he had before told me whom he lived with.</p>

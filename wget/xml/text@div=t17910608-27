On Monday the 23d of May I was at work in Duke-street, St. James's; in passing along to Mr. Batstone's shop, to borrow a hammer, I perceived the prisoner at the bar and two more in very deep consultation; as I was about half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080039"></xptr>yard from them, I heard the prisoner mention to them, that when he repeated a whistle, they were to come up; this was in Ryder-court, in Ryder-street; I immediately was struck with a suspicion, and made a stop, and heard him repeat the whistle again; I went to Mr. Batstone's other shop in Ryder-street, he has two shops, and I saw two men, one about fifteen yards distant from the shop, and one about twenty-five yards distant, both fronting the shop; I received the hammer of the boy, and proceeded to my work; about half an hour after, I heard a robbery had been committed, and I communicated my suspicions.</p>

On the 23d of May I was coming along from my dinner, and I saw a man going along with a couple of large bolts under the end of his coat, just turning into Ryder-street; I stood and watched him, and the man ran along as fast as he could; by that I takes myself as fast as I could to Mr. Batstone's shop; and when I came there, the prisoner at the bar stood in the shop, leaning on one of the vices; I asked him if any of the workmen had been in the shop for any iron bolts belonging to the building that Mr. Batstone worked for; he told me no; I asked him how long he had been in the shop; he said half an hour; and then I thought I had no more business to ask him, for I thought he was one of the workmen, not knowing he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Court to Batstone. Had any part of this property ever been recovered? - No, none at all.</p>

               <p>I came to work in the morning about eleven or twelve, and Mr. Batstone asked me why I did not come sooner; I said I could not come sooner; says he, I have put on another man in your stead; says I, that is rather too sharp, without letting me know it; I went out, and going along Ryder-street, I met this man (pointing to Howsy) and he asked me where I was going; I told him I was going to look for work, and I went down to Westminster, to seek for work, and got work on the Tuesday following at Mr. Egerton's, and was going to work at the time I was committed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called Mr. Egerton and one more, who gave him a good character.</p>

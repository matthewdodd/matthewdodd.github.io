                  </hi>. I am a draper, at Hoxton. Willis came to my shop on Monday 12th Feb about 9 o'clock in the evening—the shop was just shut up; he knocked at the door, and I let him in—he asked for two shirt fronts—I took down the box, and showed them to him—he agreed for two for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down a sovereign; I took it up, and rung it; I found it good—I was about to give him change, when a second knock came at the door, and Watson came in, and said, "I want some coat buttons"—I desired my young woman to show him some—he came up quite close against Willis, and I heard something drop like money—I felt suspicious about them, and refused to serve them.) I told them both to leave my shop—they went outside together—I said I would follow them—I shut my shop door and went out at my side entrance—the prisoners were standing together at the public house at the corner—I watched them, and they went from there to Mr. Bourne's, an oilman's—Watson stood outside, and Willis went in—I went into the shop, and went through the shop into the parlour—I saw that Willis had a bottle of pickles in his hand—I went out at the side entrance, and saw Willis leave the shop, and he joined Watson—they went up the street in conversation till they got to Mr. Britnell's, the butcher's; Willis went in there, and Watson stood outside—I did not go in; I went for a policeman, and both the prisoners were given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher; I manage Mr. Britnell's business. On 12th Feb., about 9 o'clock in the evening, Willis came into the shop; he looked at a bit of pork—he said, "Weigh me this piece"—it weighed three pounds, and was to be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—before Willis came into the shop, I had seen both the prisoners at the shop window—it being frosty weather, we had only two shutters down—there is no glass in front of the window—I did not notice what became of Watson when Willis came into the shop—when I had weighed Willis the pork, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he gave me a sove<lb></lb>reign, which was a good one—I went into the parlour, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it down</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a butcher's shop in Exmouth-street.

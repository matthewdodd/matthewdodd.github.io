                  </hi>. I am a publican and live in St. John-street. I was acquainted with the prisoner for three months previous to July last—I was married on the 5th of July—on the 17th the prisoner came to my home, and went into the parlour—she asked my permission to go to the water-closet—I said I had not one, but if she chose to walk into my bedroom she might—she went up stairs alone, and shortly afterwards came down again—she had some bread and cheese and a glass of ale in my bar—my wife returned home at the very moment I was putting away the refreshment, and some words occurred about the prisoner being there—I explained, and she was satisfied—my wife afterwards went up stairs and came down, and she, her sister, and the prisoner went out, and returned shortly—after my wife was sent for to go to Hatton-garden, and during her absence the prisoner made tea for me and another person, a bottle-merchant—after tea requested her to leave, as I thought there might be some unpleasantness occur between my wife and her, as she appeared jealous—she said she would leave, and went up stairs to put on her bonnet and shawl—she then came into my bar parlour, and rubbed out her address which she had put on my slate that day—I had not read it before she rubbed it out—my wife returned shortly after the prisoner left, she went up stairs, and missed the spoons from the bed-room—when I got up that morning they were safe on the dressing-table—not a soul had been up in the bed-room but myself, my wife, and the prisoner—we have no servant—next morning I missed my ring, my watch, six spoons, a veil, and two handkerchiefs after some inquiries I found the prisoner at her lodging, No. 2, Buxton-street, Clerkenwell—when I went there, the door was opened by a little girl—the prisoner was standing at a room door, and seemed confused—she said she was very ill, and was very glad I had called to see her, she had not been out, and in fact was just up—it was then between one and two o'clock in the afternoon—she did not appear ill, but seemed rather confused—I had not been in the house more than three or four or five minutes, when a young man came in who was introduced to me as her husband's brother—she had told me previously that she was married, and had introduced a gentleman to me as her husband at the room where I first met her—I said to her that I had come on very particular business, and the young man then left—I then told her I had a robbery committed at my house, and had lost such and such articles, had she seen, or did she know any thing of it she said, "I saw the spoons lying on the table, and I told Mrs. Parker what a pity it was she let them lay about in such a way, as she might be robbed"—I then asked her if she had any knowledge of it at all—she said "No, only from seeing them"—she denied taking any property from my premises—I gave information to the police, and on the Thursday following the property was shown to me at the station-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you had known her sometime before, did it not occur to you as strange that she should come to visit you without her husband, and while your wife was out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did not occur to me it the time—I always took her to be a respectable woman from her appearance, and likewise from the manner in which she had entered into conversation with me at a public concert-room—I met her accidentally in Smithfield-bars, nine or ten days previous to her coming to my house, and she then addressed me by my own name, and said, "Mr. Parker, how do you do?"—I immediately turned round, and she said, "I understand you have taken a house somewhere in this neighbourhood"—I said I had, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183708140069"></xptr>
               <p>told her where—she said, "I shall give you a call"—I said, "I shall be most happy to see youat any time," and that was the reason she came to my house on this day—I had told her I was married—it was done merely out of a feeling of good fellowship towards her, and which I would do to any person I had known, to invite them to my house to partake of a cup of tea, hat I have great cause to regret it now—I certainly did not allow her to take any of these articles—I did not know they were gone till I was getting up next mornings—my wife was the first person who missed the things, and informed me of it—my wife's sister was on a visit to us at the time, and the shawl belongs to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When I came to your house, did you not ask me into your smoking-room?

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ball on her When you had lost' your property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—there certainly was some familiarity took place between us then—after her strongly denying it, and from the expression of her countenance I was induced to believe her innocent, and then, and not till then, did I know she was a bad character—we had criminal connexion—it is no use to make a <hi rend="italic">mince</hi> of the matter in a Court of Justice—that might have been an inducement for her to get off—I was not sober at the time, which I can prove—had I been sober, I certainly should not have committed that which I regret now—I did not resume the charge against her after that—it went on till Thursday, when I was gone to bed, and was called up between twelve and one o'clock in the morning to go to the station, and the prisoner was brought in by a policeman—I did not get rid of the brother in-law in order to form any acquaintance with her in the room—it was merely to ask her about the robbery, but one thing led to another—I missed the watch on the same day as I called on her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you called, did you not say, "lf you have taken them let it pass, but don't call at my house?" <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi>, I said, "If youhave taken the things and pawned them, if you will give me the tickets to redeem them; and make up the difference at home, I should not object to it"—I did not say, "Let it pass and keep from my house"—I had been drinking all the morning at different public houses—I did not give you any money on the Tuesday, because I had been to the Clown before and there I had not enough to pay for the last glass of ale—I did not give you three half-crowns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I saw the prisoner at our house on the 17th of July, and she went out with me and my sister—we returned to our house, and I then went out, leaving her there with my husband—when I returned again the prisoner was gone—in the course of the evening I missed half-a-dozen spoons and my veil, and next morning I missed my husband's ring and watch, some silk and cotton stockings, and a pair of bracelets—when the prisoner went up stairs with me that afternoon, I saw one of the spoons on the dressing-table, and the watch and all the things—the prisoner said to me, "Mrs. Parker, I am surprised.</p>

               <p>at your leaving your property about," and I said, "Being very unhappy, I have left the box unlocked"—I was rather fatigued that day, and when I went to the box I left it unlocked—I left it in the same state, and left the key in it, and found it in the lock next morning—I do not know why I did not lock the box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not the boy inform you next morning that Mr. Parker had been up stairs with me? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, No, he did not—when I returned home and saw the prisoner in my bar parlour, I became jealous, and said, "William, it is very strange, whenever I leave the room, you have a parcel of women at your house"—the prisoner got up and said, "Mrs. Parker, when you come to be a mother of three children, and married six years, you will know better than to be jealous"—I said, "Well, if you are a decent woman, I will go out with you," and we went out to a public-house to have a quartern of gin and cloves—when I got home I began to make tea for her—a gentleman came in at the time, and said, "Mrs. Parker, do you know who you have at your house? a woman who I know well has borne a bad character all her lifetime, and has been walking the street for years; for goodness sake bundle her out"—I told my husband this, and I up with the kitchen poker, and said, "William, if you don't <hi rend="italic">out</hi> with her, I will knock you down," and he took the poker from me—just at that time I was going to Hatton-garden about a char-woman who had robbed me, and I left her there.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

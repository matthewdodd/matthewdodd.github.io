            . I am a pawnbroker. I produce a watch which I received from a person answering the description of the prisoner. I firmly believe him to be the person - it was pawned on the 20th of October for 1 l., in the name of East; on the Tuesday following, the prisoner came and asked me if I had taken a watch in - I fetched it down, and said I had - he came the next day with an officer, and said his name was Stribling; he then denied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280054"></xptr>that he was the man who had pawned it. I have no doubt that he was the person.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL EAST. I keep the Green Man public-house. I saw this young man come in with two others, at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th of October; they called for a supper, and the prosecutor fell asleep; when he awoke he missed his watch; he was not sober; the prisoner appeared perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>J - OSBORN. Last Sunday week I went into the Green Man. I saw the prosecutor take the watch out of his pocket, and give it to the prisoner to see what it was o'clock - he fell asleep afterwards, and what became of the watch I do not know.</p>

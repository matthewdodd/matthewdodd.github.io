                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Gee, a butcher, at West-Ham; he keeps his hay in a loft; the prisoner was not in his em<lb></lb>ploy. On the 10th of February I saw this hay under the loft door, which was not the right place for it, and the prisoner was in the shed—I asked him what business he had there—he said he had been doing no harm—I said it looked very suspicious, the hay being outside, and he being in the shed—he afterwards told me that he did steal it, and it was the first that ever he did steal, and begged me not to tell my master—the shed was locked up, but there was no lock on the loft door—it was fastened inside—it was shut when I saw the hay in the yard—the hay was under the loft door—I did not see the prisoner in the loft—the shed leads to the loft—I had seen the hay in the yard five minutes before—I had not been there for five hours—the yard was open to other people, but not the loft.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The shed door was open—I went there for a necessary pur<lb></lb>pose—I never touched the hay—he said, "What do you do here?"—I told him what I had come for—I never touched the hay—they said, "Give it up to us"—I lifted it up to them in the loft. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He helped my fellow-servant up with it after he had told me that he took it—I told the foreman of it, and he told my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Renwick, and saw the hay and the pri<lb></lb>soner—Renwick asked him what business he had there—he said he was not doing any harm there—Renwick said, "You must have been doing harm, the hay lying outside, and you inside the shed;" and then he said he was going to take the hay away; that it was the firsthe had taken; we asked him how it came there—at first he said he did not know how it came there, but he afterwards said he was going to steal it—he said, "Jump up into the loft, and I will give it you up;" and I did—he af<lb></lb>terwards helped me to get some sheep in, and told me not to <hi rend="italic">split</hi>, and tell my master—he helped me with the sheep before that—I knew him before—I thought it looked like master's hay, but was not certain—we brought the hay to Lambeth-street—master saw it the same night—the shed door was not fastened—the loft door was bolted inside—I found it still fastened, and so was the shed door—the prisoner was locked in—he must have got in there through a hole in the partition from Mr. Reeve's premises, which we found the same night—it was large enough to get a truss of hay through.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher.

               <p>not conceive how any body could get to the shed, because the gates were always locked, and found still locked—after I received this information, I examined the premises—I found three small boards taken down between my shed and the adjoining shed, which is full of wood and bricks—there is a door from that shed into the adjoining yard—I found the staple of that door drawn, by which, I suppose, the prisoner got through the door, then through the partition into the loft, and put the hay out into the yard—he could then bolt the door after him, and return to where the hay was—I should not then know how any body had got in—the prisoner had no right in my shed—the yard is not mine—it belongs to Mr. Reed, at the pub<lb></lb>lic house—this happened at nearly seven o'clock at night.</p>

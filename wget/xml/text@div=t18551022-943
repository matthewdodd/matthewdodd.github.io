                  </hi>. I am by trade a carpenter and cabinet maker. I know person named Humphries, he lives at No. 19, King's-road, Theobald's-road—in May last I was working for him—I was working for him about a fortnight or three weeks in May, and from eight to ten weeks altogether, on and off—I was not there every day—I know the prisoner, I knew him by the name of Jenkins—he came to see Mr. Humphries—he and Humphries appeared to be dn friendly terms—I think it was about the beginning or middle of June that Agar first came while I was there—he entered into conversation with me—I was in the East Indies when I was young, at Calcutta—Agar remarked my arms being marked with Indian ink, what is called tattooing—he asked me what parts I had been to—I told him to Calcutta, St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope—he told me be had been to America and the West Indies, but never to the East—after that he used to talk to me when he came, about the war, or anything—he used to come at least three or four times a week—sometimes he remained an hour, and sometimes two or three hours, and sometimes the major part of the day—Mr. Humphries used to he a great deal out, and he used to stay many times in the front office, and enter into conversation with me—he did not distinctly tell me that he had business with Humphries, but I have heard him speak to Humphries about some leasehold property—one evening in June he asked me to take a small box for him to Pickford's booking office, in Oxford-street, opposite Newman-street—when I got there I saw the prisoner, on the opposite side of the way—he had not said anything about my meeting him there, I did not expect to see him—about a week after that I was in Mr. Humphries's office, making a drawing of a door that I was about fitting up (I had known nothing of Agar before seeing him at Humphries's)—he said to me on that occasion, "You seem handy with your pen, old fellow; would you like to leave off carpentering, and get a better," or, "an easier Bert he?"—I said I should, and he said he would see if he could not do something for me in the course of a little time—he asked me if I could meet him that night, at 8 o'clock, at Raymond's-buildings, where I had met him before when I took the box—I did meet him—this was still in June—when I met him, he asked me if I would take ten sovereigns for him to a coffee house in Orange-street; that I should there see a tall, stout man, very dark, with spectacles on; that I was to ask him if he was waiting to see Mr. A—and if he said yes, I was to ask him what he was waiting to receive; and if he said 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I was to give him the ten sovereigns—I went there, and saw a person exactly like the one he described, and gave him the money—I did not</p>

               <p>stop there two minutes—I then went to meet the prisoner at Tom's Coffee-house, Holborn, nearly opposite Day and Martin's—he had appointed to meet me there, on my return from Orange-street—I told him that I had seen his friend, and given him the money, and it was all right—he then gave me a sove<lb></lb>reign, and gave me a small parcel to take charge of for him—he told me to take particular care of it, and asked me where I lived, in case he should want it in a hurry—it was a small parcel, about four inches wide, eight or nine inches long, and about half an inch thick—it was a very heavy parcel I never knew the contents of it—I told him I lived at No. 36, Blenheim-street, Chelsea—he said, "Why don't you get apartments in town?"—I said I thought I should do so shortly—the parcel remained in my posses<lb></lb>sion something less than a fortnight (I had seen Agar in the meantime at Humphries's)—at the expiration of ten days, or a fortnight, he asked if I would meet him the following morning, and bring the parcel with me—I met him at the Black Horse, in Coventry-street, Haymarket, the next morning, and gave him the parcel—he asked me to meet him again the fol<lb></lb>lowing evening, at the same house—I did so, and he then gave me another parcel—he told me to take particular care of it—that parcel was never opened until after his apprehension, I kept it until then—about the middle of July, he asked me if I had ever transacted business at a banker's—I told him I had repeatedly—he said he should want me to do a little for him some time—I believe that was all he said about it at that time—this was as we were walking from the Black Horse towards Oxenden-street—on 4th Aug. I moved from Blenheim-street to No. 61, Theobald's-road—on that day I met the prisoner by accident in Southampton-row—he spoke of the current things of the day, and then I think he said, "Can you meet me on Monday night?"—this was on Saturday, I believe—I told him that I had moved to Theobald's-road that day, or that I was going to do so—he said he wanted me to take a cheque for him to get the money—I do not know whether he mentioned the amount of the cheque that day, or on Monday—before this, he asked me if I should like to earn 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot positively say whether that was said on the Saturday, or the Monday, but I believe it was on the Saturday—I said I should, and asked him what it was to do—he said it was a matter where there was some little risk to run, but if I minded his instructions no harm could come of it—he then told me it was to present a cheque at a banker's for payment—I do not think he told me the name of the bank then—he said, "Take the cheque and present it in the usual way"—he did not produce the cheque to me then—he said, "If they ask you any ques<lb></lb>tions you may judge then that it is wrong; they will most likely take you round to the manager's room, and ask you who you brought it from"—and I was to say from Captain Pellatt, of the Euston Hotel, and if they asked me if I was his servant I was to say, "No, a gentlemen as I was passing the Euston Hotel asked me if I would take a note to Mivart's Hotel to Captain Fitzgerald, "to hurry there and back, and merely give it to the porter"—I was to say that on my return to the Euston Hotel the gentleman asked me many questions as to my character, and that he then asked me if I would take a cheque to the banker's and get change for it, and that I consented to do so—that was the story I was to toll if I was taken into the manager's room, and asked questions—I think that was all that was said on that occasion—nothing was given to me at that interview—these conversations occurred so frequently that I can scarcely say upon which day the separate conversations were—I met him on the Monday at Tom's Coffee-house—he said to me on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220061"></xptr>
               <p>the Saturday, "As now you have got up to this end of the town, can you look in at Tom's Coffee-house every night at 7 o'clock, and if I am there I shall see you and I will follow you out"—I met him there on the Monday and Tuesday outside the coffee house—it was on those occasions that the con<lb></lb>versation I have related passed—I could not pledge myself as to any particular day—on Tuesday, 7th, he appointed me to meet him at about half-past 3 o'clock on the following Saturday outside the coffee-house, in King-street, Holborn—I was to walk up and down there until he came—I' did meet him there be<lb></lb>tween 4 and 5 o'clock—I walked up and down the street until he came—he then asked me if I thoroughly understood what I had got to do, and asked me to repeat to him what his instructions were—I did so as well as I could, and he said, "You'll do"—he then said, "Take this cheque"—he produced it at that time, and also gave me a canvas bag and a half-sovereign—he said the cheque was dated for the following Wednesday, and he told me to go on the Wednesday, and I was to take a cab or walk to Sey-mour-street, Euston-square, first, I was to get a sheet of blank paper and an envelope and address it to Captain Fitzgerald, at Mivart's Hotel, to take a cab from Sey-mour-street and drive to Mivart's Hotel and leave the note, and then drive back to the Euston Hotel—I was then to go on to the bank with the cheque and get a glass of ale on the road, so that the change of the half-sovereign and the cab hire and the price of the ale should correspond with my state<lb></lb>ment—he said, "Take the cheque and present it in the usual way, if they ask you how you will have it, say 10 fifties and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and if you get the money all right come back to me in Southampton-row, Bedford-square, or Russell-square; I will be walking about there."—he said if I saw him I was to take no notice of him, but give him the money and meet him next morning at 11 o'clock, at Tom's Coffee-house, and he would give me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, but if I was detected he should not expect me after 6 o'clock, he should not wait after 6 o'clock, he should then watch the morning papers, and he said they could not do anything to me if I kept to that state<lb></lb>ment—he then gave me the cheque—after this I made a communication to Mr. Mullens, I believe on Monday, the 13th—Mr. Mullens gave me certain directions, which I followed—On Wednesday, 15th Aug., I walked up to Eaton-square and inquired at the hotel if Mr. Pellatt was there—the waiter said she believed he had slept there last night, but he was not there then—I then took a cab from there and drove to Mivart's Hotel in Brook-street, and left a letter there—I then drove back again to the Euston Hotel and paid the cabman—I then walked towards Lombard-street—I had a glass of ale on the road and some dinner, and then I rode outside an omnibus to the bank—I changed the half-sovereign for the cab hire and paid for my dinner out of the change—I got on to the omnibus in New Oxford-street and got to the bank a little after 3 o'clock—I went to Stevenson and Salt's banking-house in Lombard-street and presented the cheque—I gave the canvas bag which the prisoner had given me, and something was put into it by one of the clerks, I did not know what it was, I did not see it—I saw Mr. Mullens there—the bag was given back to me tied up, I took it in my hand outside the bank door—I was instructed to do so by Mr. Mullens—when I got out<lb></lb>side the bank I put it in my breast pocket—I walked direct down the Poultry and Cheapside and up Holborn, and to Southampton-row—I got there about 4 o'clock and walked about there for some time—I walked from there towards New North-street, and had a glass of ale at a public-house—I walked from there to Bedford-row, and was standing there some little time when the prisoner came up to me at the corner of Bedford-row and Theo-bald's-road</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220062"></xptr>
               <p>—he came up to me, shook hands, and asked me if I had got it all right—I said, "Yes"—he looked across the road, and said, "Who are those two fellows over the way?"—I said I did not know, he looked round again and said, "They are following us, walk this way towards Holborn"—he then said "<hi rend="italic">Sling</hi> me the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>, and then I will run for it"—I gave him the bag—before I gave him the bag, he said to me, "How b——y careless you were in putting the bag in your pocket at the bank in Lombard-street"—I do not recollect that he said anything further—he said that I believe as we turned down Eagle-street, or one of the little streets from Bedford-row—it was after he said, "<hi rend="italic">Sling</hi> me the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>, and I will run for it"—I gave him the bag soon after, I could not at the moment, because the men were behind watching us, but as soon as an opportunity offered I gave it him, and he ran away as fast as he could—he told me to go into a baker's shop, and he would run to the fields, meaning Lincoln's Inn fields—he pointed to a baker's shop at the corner, so that I should not run the same way as he did—I saw him again in five or six minutes in custody of Thorogood and Goddard—I was also taken into custody by the officers, and we were hand<lb></lb>cuffed together—while we were at the Mansion House handcuffed together, he said to me, "It was your fault that I was taken, through running the same way as I did: but if you stick to me, if it costs me a thousand pounds I will get you out of it"—this was not said loud enough to be heard—we both sat on chairs together—it was before the handcuffs were taken off.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came they to be so unkind as to handcuff you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was their instructions—it did not surprise me—I had been acting as a friend of the public and of society—I could not help being handcuffed—I believe it was part of the trick—I was not aware that I was to be handcuffed, the officers thought it was necessary that I should be—I was not altogether innocent all through this transaction—possibly what transactions I have done have not been altogether honest—I was not joining in this transaction with a view to commit a forgery, I was acting innocently from the beginning to the end—I swear that—I never intended to present the cheque—I went to Mr. Mullens on the 13th—the conversation on the 4th was a queer conversation—I began to suspect then that Agar was not so honest a man as he ought to be—I did not make a communication to anybody on the 4th, nor on the 5th, nor, I think, on the 6th—I do not know why I did not—there was no offence committed—I thought what was spoken of I was not bound to tell everybody of at the time—I did speak of it about the 7th or 8th to Mr. Roe, on one of those days he is a hair-dresser—I do not know whether I told Mr. Mullens that I had told Roe—I have told him so—I do not know whether Roe is here—I have not seen him this morning—I believe he is to be a witness—I also told Mr. Humphries on the next day, I think, after telling Roe, on the Wednesday, the 8th—I have not seen Humphries here—I do not know whether he is to be a witness—I told Mr. Mullens that I had told Humphries—I was advised to go to Mr. Mullens by Humphries, and from that time I acted as an agent of the police, for the purpose of getting Agar taken into custody Humphries told me that Mr. Mullens was the attorney to the bankers, and that he was the proper solicitor for anything of that kind—Humphries at once lent himself to the discovery, and did all he could to suggest the means of discovery—he did not behave as if he were a very intimate friend of Agar's—I am a cabinet-maker by business, but I do carpentering as well—I am a master cabinet-maker—I do not at present carry on business at any place—I gave my address as King's-place—I gave it as King-street at first,</p>

               <p>but I corrected it afterwards—I should have said King's-place—it is in Pall Mall—I did live there three years back—it was what is generally termed a lodging-house—they are let as lodging-houses, houses of assignation—it was not a brothel—I believe there is a distinction between the two—if parties came there to hire a room, to stop for any period, I never asked them their business—the question was never put whether they wanted to stop a night or a week—if any persons wanted to occupy a room, they could do so by paying for it—there were no women kept in the house—that is, no women for the purpose you imagine—I believe men and women could come and hire a room there for the purposes of fornication whenever they pleased—I never let a room myself—I derived a little of my livelihood from it—I was living there and keeping the house with my wife—I was not gaining a livelihood by that, I was still at work at my own business—I did not leave my wife to manage the house—my servants did—she was never seen in it—she did not attend to the door—I kept that house about two years, it might be three—I have been an eating-house-keeper at St. George's-street in the East—that is since that—I have been nothing else, except my own business of a cabinet-maker—I have never been in this Court before—I have been in the Old Bailey before, tried as a prisoner, but I do not know in which Court—that is between eleven and twelve years ago—I was then eighteen years of age—it was for baying a watch, receiving a stolen watch—it was only one article—I was convicted, and had twelve months—that was the only time—I am quite sure of that—I am not sure whether it was in 1849 or 1850 that I began to keep the house of assignation—I was tried here in my own name—I kept the brothel in my own name—I have always gone by that name, never by any other name, not for one day—I swear that—I do not know whether Humphries is a married man—there was a woman who passed as Mrs. Humphries—her name is Emily Campbell—I never did mes<lb></lb>sages for her—I have gone out for spirits for her—I have not acted as servant at Humphries's house, but if I was asked to go on an errand, I did not hesitate to do so, and I have occasionally acted as clerk to Humphries when he has been out—he is a house agent and auctioneer—whenever I was there at work at carpentering, and he has said, "Smith, would you mind the office for to-day?"I have done so, and taken any names that came—I never knew him to act as an attorney, the only affair I knew of was when you had him at Bagnigge-wells for an assault, or some such case—I read of that, and I know of nothing more—I have known him to be engaged in collecting debts—he did not help me through the Insolvent Court—I have passed through the Insolvent Court in 1854—I never saw Humphries about that matter, to my knowledge—I do not know whether he is to be a witness; I have never heard—he had nothing whatever to do with getting me through the Insolvent Court—I did not know him at that time—he has never been concerned in preparing a bill of sale for me—I have not been very intimate with him—I have dined with him, at the same table with him and Emily Campbell—I do not know that the prisoner ran off with Emily Campbell—I swear that—I have heard it—I only know that the prisoner was living with her, in the name of Adams, from the evidence of the servant at the Mansion House, and from what Thorogood has told me—Humphries never spoke to me about it, and never alluded to it at all—Emily Campbell was not there at the time I made the communication to Humphries—I do not know that she was with the prisoner—she told me that she was away, with her mother, ill—she was not with Humphries—I do not know whether she</p>

Dr. Scholfield, for the purpose of getting into the house in Ormond-street—I was not supplied by Humphries with a broad brimmed hat, nor had I my face blackened for the purpose of not being seen—the whole of it is a fable, as far as I am concerned—I have heard of it before, because I was at the examination—I never had anything at all to do with it—I had not the curiosity to see what the first parcel contained which the prisoner gave me to take care of—I have no idea what it was—I gave the second parcel up to Forrester—it turned out to contain several forged plates—I have no idea why the prisoner should have trusted me with it—he gave me no reason, no more than I was to take care of it for him—I have never seen the forged plates, except when they were exposed at the Mansion House—I did not look at them—I had not shown them to Humphries or Mr. Mullens—I told Mr. Mullens that I had a parcel, and I told Humphries—he did not ask to see it—he asked me what it was like—Mr. Mullens did not ask to see it—I rather think 1 told him about it on Monday, 13th, but I could not be positive—he did not ask to see it—nobody ever saw it until I gave it up to the officer—I had on previous occasions presented cheques, and received money for them—that was all in an honest way—I do not know a Mr. Sid serf—I know a man named Sidd; his name may be Sid serf—they call him Said—I do not know that his name is Sid serf—I have not heard him called Sid serf—I do not know whether Sidd and Sid serf are the same person—I have repeatedly spoken to Sidd at Humphries's—I used to call him Mr. Sidd, not <hi rend="italic">Sidd</hi>—I have known him dine there once, and only once—I do not know what he is—I have been a good deal with him lately—I have not been about the Court with him—I was not with him to-day nor yesterday—I saw him yesterday, but not here—I do not know anything about him—I saw him yesterday in one of the streets leading out of Gray's Inn-lane—I met him by accident, not by appointment—he and I have never had any talk on the subject of forged plates—I never learnt from him anything about his habits, or what his business was; I have always believed him to be a solicitor—I have seen him write at Humphriea's desk repeatedly—I believe him to be a solicitor from the style of his writing—I have never met Sidd here upon a former occasion, I never saw him here—I do not expect anything for this matter, more than my time to be paid for, I suppose—I have never said that I expected to get 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or that I would not take 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my share, not to anybody—I am quite sure about that—I have seen a good deal of Roe since I made the communication to him—I saw him yesterday—I have told Roe that if I did not give Agar into custody, that Agar would</p>

               <p>transport me—I cannot say the exact words I said—I said that Agar's object was, no doubt, to transport me, but he should not have the chance—I meant, by his using me as a tool in the matter—I should judge that was his object—I only give my own opinion—I do not know that I am right—I cannot recollect exactly what it was I said, or when it was; I kept no memorandum, it may have been three months ago; no, not so long, two months—it was since Agar has been in custody—I said this, that in the event of anything occurring, if I was taken for arrears of rent or anything, and these things had been found in my place, no doubt I should have been transported for the possession of them—I meant the forged plates—I have not had any money or clothes from Humphries since this matter has been going on, no more than what he owed me—I think he owed me about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I have had that in two or three different instalments; at one time he gave me, I think, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at another time 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the third time half-a-crown; I think that was how I received it—I have not had any clothes from him—I have not been concerned in any matter connected with a will with a person named Wisheo—I know Wychelo—I know something of a will under which Wychelo claims—I do not know that it is said to be forged—Humphries is also a claimant on behalf of Miss Campbell—I believe he was appointed executor to the last will.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a magistrate of the county of Hampshire, and reside at Purbrook-park, in that county. I have kept an account with Messrs. Stevenson and Salt for the last thirty years—this cheque is not my writing, nor signed by my authority, but it is a very fearful repre<lb></lb>sentation of it—I think it has been done by tracing paper, against a window—there is a tremulousness about the hand—I never signed a cheque for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or authorised it—the transaction is a false one, as well as the signature—I have not the slightest idea how the prisoner could have got at my signature.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor to the associated bankers of the City of London, and conduct this prosecution. I first knew the witness Smith. on Monday, 13th Aug.—he made some communication to me, upon which 1 gave him instructions how to act—on the following Wednesday, the 15th, I attended at the banking house of Stevenson and Salt, in Lombard-street—I gave instructions to Forrester and Goddard, and two officers were placed in Glyn's banking house just opposite—about a quarter to 3 o'clock I noticed a man standing on the pavement opposite Stevenson's bank, smoking a cigar—he was under my observation altogether nearly a quarter of an hour—I was looking through the window blind of the bank—just about 3 o'clock a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up very fast, and pulled up all at once exactly opposite Stevenson's window, where the man was—the person in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> put out his hand, and beckoned to him, there was only one person</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220066"></xptr>
               <p>in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and they spoke together very earnestly for a very short time; the man in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> then got out, just said a word to the other man, and went away, and I saw no more of him—I observed the countenance of the man who was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I noticed him sufficiently to be able to form a belief as to who he was—I believe the prisoner to be the man—I wag just the width of the pavement from him—I was sitting at the window of the bank, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up immediately to the window, on the same side—he got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on that side—I believe it to be the prisoner—I saw him again that same evening at the station-house—he was dressed much as he is now, I think, but not in a coat of that colour; I did not see much of his dress, because all the time he was speaking out of the window of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw him get out, but he was away in an instant—all the conversa<lb></lb>tion was while he was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; I could only see his face, not his figure—when he got out, he walked quickly away—my impression is that it was a dark coat, not exactly a frock coat; it was cut away at the corners; I think it is called an Oxonian, but I would not undertake to say anything about it—I saw him again that same evening, but I have no idea how he was dressed then, I took no notice—from seven to ten minutes afterwards Smith came into the banking house—the man with the cigar remained—he was walking up and down before the banking house in Abchurch-lane until Smith came—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went away empty—the man who got out of it went away before the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man could get on his box again, he went so quickly—Smith came in, and presented the cheque for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he brought this canvas bag with him—I put into the bag 200 farthings, and some marked pieces of paper, and tied up the bag—I had not arranged with any one what should be done—Smith did not know—I delivered the bag to Smith, and he carried it away—I gave him some directions as to putting it into his pocket as he went out—he carried the bag in his hand until he got outside the door, and I saw him stand on the pavement, and put it into his breast pocket—any person standing about would have an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you before the Magistrate in any capacity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I conducted the prosecution as the attorney—I made no opening of the case, I examined the witnesses—I was not examined—I did not think it judicious to call myself, while the other man was at large—I had at that time learned who that man was who was smoking the cigar—I thought it would have been injudicious to have been called at that time, although I affirm that it was the prisoner whom I saw—I am not aware that he had any conception of that fact until to-day—I gave notice to Mr. Wontner's clerk that I should be examined, but not as to what; yes, I did tell him about the man with the cigar—I did not tell him anything about the prisoner—in the progress of this case, Mr. Humphries has been to me when I have sent for him—I have seen him several times, perhaps a dozen times, more or less—I have seen him when I have thought it necessary to send for him—I do not know a person called Sidd, or Sid serf—I have heard of such a man—he is not a forger to my knowledge, or a coiner, nothing of the kind—I never knew him to be convicted, nothing of the kind—it is a totally dif<lb></lb>ferent matter in which I have heard his name, nothing whatever connected with the Bankers' Association.</p>

                  </hi>. I was for many years an officer attached to Bow-street office; I have retired. I was engaged by Mr. Mullens to assist in the detection of this affair—on 15th Aug. I went to Glyn's banking house, in Lombard-street, which faces Messrs. Stevenson's—I saw Smith go in and come out—before that I saw a man standing about five or six yards off, leaning against the side of the building—he was doing nothing, but merely looking towards the banking house—the fact is, there were two men—I observed one standing by the banking house for some time, looking towards the entrance, and shortly after I had observed him, I saw another man—whether he got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> or not I do not know, but I saw a man stand<lb></lb>ing opposite the door smoking a cigar—I have seen that man since, and have heard his name to be Pearce—I have endeavoured to take him into custody on this charge—I have not been able to trace him at all, not beyond his place of residence, at Kilburn—I saw Smith come out of the banking house; he remained a few seconds outside the door, and put a canvas bag something similar to this into his side coat pocket—Thorogood, a nephew of Forrester's, was with me—I cannot say that I observed the man with the cigar at the time Smith came out, because my attention was then directed to Smith—Thorogood and I followed Smith to the neighbourhood of Bos-well-court, and Theobald's-road—I saw him at last in Bedford-row—after being there some time he was joined by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>five minutes—Thorogood was there also—we were all close together in the parlour—we were not sitting, we were standing—I heard what they said—I heard Humphries say to Smith, "He will not be here, "meaning, as I understood at the time, the prisoner—he said, "He will not be here now he will be at my office at 5 o'clock"—I do not know whether Smith made any answer—I am not aware that he did, I cannot recollect—this was said by Humphries openly, so as to be heard by me and Thorogood—Humphries then left the house, and Smith went out afterwards, and I after Smith—I saw what became of Smith until he joined the prisoner at the corner of Bedford-row—he did not join Humphries afterwards—Smith was walking up and down at the end of Bedford-row, and the prisoner came and joined him, and they shook hands—they remained in conversation for a very short time, and walked together up Bedford-row, and turned the corner of a street leading into Red Lion-square—the prisoner looked back—they walked on to Red Lion-square, and crossed Red Lion-square, the prisoner occasionally looking back, down Leigh-street into Eagle-street, and then into Kingsgate-street, where I lost sight of them for a few seconds—when I turned the corner of Kingsgate-street, I saw Smith, and he waved his hand, and said, "That way, that way, down Turnstile"—I went on down Turnstile, Thoro-good was on before me—I pursued down Gate-street into Great Queen-street, and saw the prisoner being led out of Parker-street into Queen-street by Thorogood—I did not see him taken, Thorogood was on before me—he and I had raised the cry of "Stop thief!"in Queen-street—I took him into a shop there, and as I was leading him into the shop Thorogood turned back and brought Smith in—I directed that they should be handcuffed together—the prisoner asked me what it was for, and said he would go quietly—I told him it was for uttering a forged cheque at the banking house in Lombard-street—I said, "This young man," pointing to Smith, "has been followed from the bankers, where he has uttered a forged cheque; have you received anything from him?"—he immediately put his hand into his pocket, and gave me this canvas bag—I said, "From whom did you receive this?"—he said, "He gave it me," pointing to Smith—that was all he said—I then took him to the Mansion House—they were together there in a room—there was no examination then, it was after hours—I observed that they spoke to each other, I did not hear what they said—I was at the Mansion House at the first examination—Smith was then examined as a witness—after the examination was over the prisoner said, in the room, that he was as innocent as the child unborn; that he was like an innocent man going to the slaughter; that he was innocent of this case—he said he had not knownn Smith, he never had more than a dozen words with him in his life—on the same evening that the prisoner was taken into custody, the 15th, I went to Smith's lodging, in Theobald's-road—I saw a parcel taken from a little box there—Smith gave it to Forrester—Smith was not com<lb></lb>mitted at all—on 4th Sept. I was with Thorogood, in Union-street, Black-friars—we followed a man who came out of a public house there—it was the man that I saw smoking the cigar in Lombard-street, the man they call Pearce—he went to Mr. Wontner's office, in Snow-hill—there had been two examinations previous to that—I think the prisoner was not then committed—Mr. Wontner had acted as his attorney—I was there, I heard him put questions to Smith in cross-examination—some time after Pearce had gone into Mr. Wontner's office, I and Forrester went in—I waited at the door—I did not see Pearce come out, in fact, I went away to fetch Forrester</p>

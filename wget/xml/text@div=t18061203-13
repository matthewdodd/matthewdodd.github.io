               <p>Q. There was a fire on your premises, when was it. - A. On the 3d of November. I only know that I lost a variety of things, and a pair of pantaloons.</p>
               <p>Q. What else that relates to this indictment. - A. I do not know of any thing else; I do not know that the mahogany belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pantaloons before the fire. - A. Yes, I had them in my hands, six or seven days before.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen them for six or seven days, you had many persons about your premises, and on this night every thing was in confusion. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. Were you at this fire. - A. Yes, I was; I am a volunteer in the second regiment of Royal London volunteers. I was on duty at the fire, about half past nine o'clock on the evening of the 3d of November, we had formed a line across the street to prevent passengers from coming up and down; I observed the prisoner at the bar as he passed having something under his coat, exactly at the hollow of his back; I tapped him on his shoulder, I says, my friend, what have you got; his answer was that it was his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might this be from Mr. Brown's premises. - A. About the next door, he certainly must have come from the fire, in the direction he was going; the fire was in the timber yard, the door of the house was open, and the windows were broke, all the furniture had been taken out; there was a number of people going in, and coming out of the house. I saw something in the front of the prisoner's coat; I asked him what that was, he said it was a box. I insisted upon seeing it, he unbuttoned his coat and took it out; it was this piece of mahogany; I was pushed by the croud, and an engine coming, and some other person searched him concerning the things that were behind his back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact the prisoner was not upon Mr. Brown's premises. - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time a great quantity of Mr. Brown's things were removed into the street. - A. Yes, the prisoner was going from where the things were piled up.</p>

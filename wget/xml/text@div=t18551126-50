On Monday night, 29th Oct., I went to bed about 12 o'clock—I was the last person up, every thing was then safe, and the doors and windows shut—about 5 o'clock in the morning I was awoke by a noise of glass breaking—I got up and opened the bed room door, to which there is a bell attached, which rings in the bar parlour—I cannot say whether it rang on that occasion, but I suppose it did—I called the servant, but did not succeed in awaking her, so I looked at my watch and went to bed again—at 7 o'clock the barmaid, Elizabeth Barber, went down,</p>

               <p>and immediately came up and called me—I had called her about a quarter of an hour before that, and desired her to go down—I went down, and found the bar in the greatest confusion; cigars lay all over the floor, the back door was wide open, and the bar down—I ran into the bar, and found the spirit bottles on the floor partly empty, and table spoons and cigars strewed all over the place—a square of glass was broken in a sort of glass cupboard, which contained the cigars—a bottle of rue gin had been carried out into the back yard, but it was full—a panel was broken out of the outer door, the till was on the floor empty, and I missed from it about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was there the night before—some cigars were also gone—about 2 o'clock I was sent for to a chandler's shop, a few doors off, by the man who keeps it, named Rolf, and was shown these cigars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), lying on the counter—the female prisoner was there—I believe these pale cigars to be mine, but can swear to them, but not to these others—I know these by their being a very light dry leaf, and by their being broken about.</p>

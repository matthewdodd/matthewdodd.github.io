                  </hi> I am one of the inspectors of the Dock-yard police—I was on duty on Saturday, the 26th of June, and in consequence of information I received, I directed a watch to be kept on the people belonging to the ship <hi rend="italic">Acron</hi>—I do not know whether they were assisting to load the stores at the <hi rend="italic">Trident</hi>, but I saw the people belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Acron</hi> coming up from the yard, and I said, loud enough to be heard by them, "Stop the <hi rend="italic">Acron</hi> people, and search them thoroughly"—the prisoner was one of the <hi rend="italic">Acron</hi> people and on my saying that, he stepped back and went to run down the yard—the sergeant, and I called out after him, and the sergeant caught him—I saw him searched, and saw something taken from between his blue shirt and his white shirt—I think it was a copper ring-bolt belonging to a gun—I afterwards went with the sergeant, and compared it with a screw on the deck of the <hi rend="italic">Trident</hi>—I tried it, and it fitted exactly—it is worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is the property of her Majesty—the <hi rend="italic">Trident</hi> is one of the Queen's ships in commission—I fitted it into the <hi rend="italic">Trident</hi>, and have not the least doubt it belongs to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was working on board the <hi rend="italic">Trident</hi> with fifteen more shipments; we had to clear out some dirt; I shot a sack full of dirt on the dirt heap, and there I picked up this copper bolt, and not knowing it to be marked I took it.</p>

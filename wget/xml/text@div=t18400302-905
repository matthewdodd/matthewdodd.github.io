                  </hi>. I am a labourer at the West India Docks, and live in Marmont-street. Joseph Connell is the landlord, and lives in the house—the prisoner lodges in the house, and occupied the same room with me—he came on Tuesday the 25th of February—he called himself a shoemaker—he lodged only one day with us—I keep my money in a box close to the bed—there were seven sovereigns, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I had a handkerchief in the box—I keep the key in my waist-coat pocket—I got up and missed the key of my box, and told him I had lost the key—there were four penny-pieces in my pocket with the key—he pretended that he was not well—I left him in bed, and went to breakfast—I went up again to look for the key, and met him coming down stairs—he had left his jacket and waistcoat on the chest—I asked him why he did not take his clothes down, that I might lock the door—he said nothing, and I took his things down, locked the room-door, and thought every thing was safe, till I came home in the evening, and he was not there—he never returned to his lodging at all—I got a smith to open the box, and missed seven sovereigns and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, in another purse, a waistcoat, and a pair of stockings—nobody but him had been in the room—I locked the door inside when I went to bed.</p>

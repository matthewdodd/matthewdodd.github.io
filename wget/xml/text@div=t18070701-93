               <p>Q. Were you so on the 6th of May last. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts were you about four or five o'clock in the afternoon of that day. - A. At about five o'clock I was at the Three Crowns, in the Old Jewry; there I received information that a man had shot two men, and they wanted a peace officer to go and take him; I went in company with Sherrin, my brother officer, to <placeName id="t18070701-93-crimeloc569">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. What I want to know is this, was there any alarm in the crowd of what had been done. - A. I do not recollect particular that there might; when I got to the door, I was going to pull my staff out, some person thought it was not adviseable to pull my staff out, and told me to be careful, for he was armed. I looked up the passage, I saw Mr. Garren standing at a passage door, up the passage; there is a door that parts two passages; there are two doors close together, and a passage to each; I saw him at the passage door with a pistol in each hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him, and saw the crown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010064"></xptr> about the house, did you then generally understand whether any mischief had been done. - A. I do not recollect whether there was any thing about mischief mentioned; I was anxious to get the man; I did not go up the passage to meet him, I went through a door in the passage, into a hardware shop, and went into the kitchen, at the back of the hardware shop; there I saw Mr. Garren's daughter and Barber the sheriff's officer. The door of the kitchen was fastened on the inside with a cross wooden bar, and I think Barber took the bar down, and the door was opened; and when I first saw him, I was nearly opposite of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How far distant were you from him, when you first saw him. - A. Not more than three yards, if so much; I said what is the matter Mr. Garren, you know me very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you. - A. I think he must, I knew him; I have been in the habit of meeting him in the street frequently; I have conversed with him about a dozen years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him in the street, did he appear to know you. - A. I have sometimes bowed to him when I passed, and he returned it; and sometimes we passed.</p>
               <p>Q. When you have bowed to him in the street, have you ever had your staff. - A. Never to shew it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him he knew you, what answer did he make. - A. I do not recollect any thing. I am sure he had both the pistols in his hands I went up close to him; by this he got into the other passage were the stairs (as I understand) led up to his apartments; he got about two yards from where he first stood, we were face to face; I took the opportunity of striking his right hand with my left, to make him drop the pistol. but he did not drop it; he was not pointing the pistol towards me, he was holding it down; when I found that he did not lose his hold I took my right hand and laid hold of him by his left arm, and threw him on the stairs and threw myself upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do that for. - A. Thinking he might shoot me, and to secure him, and to take the pistols from him; when I threw myself upon him he he turned one of the pistols at my head, and I kept it down; he turned the muzzle of the pistol towards my head as I was laying upon him, he was upon his back and I was upon my belly; I kept the pistol down with my left hand, and it went off almost immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he pointed it towards you so that the contents might reach you. - A. I believe so I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the effect of this pistol going off. - A. I had the flash in my face, it was black; I received no injury at all. The contents of that pistol lodged in the skirting board; Sherrin will produce you the piece of wood, he took it out afterwards; both the stairs and the skirting board were penetrated by the firing of the pistol. I then got the pistols from him; after I had got both the pistols from him he reached out his hand to catch the pistol; there were plenty of help then, he was secured. The other pistol I took in company of Bennet to Bartholomew-lane; here is the contents of it, it was loaded with five small pieces of lead and some gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. It is a dozen years since you and Mr. Garren spoke together. - A. I do not know that it is as much as that, it is a good many years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him in the street, having known him as a clergyman, you pulled off your hat. - A. I seldom pulled off my hat; I sometimes bowed to him but seldom did that.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first of all went to his house, upon seeing him in the passage, you went round and got this door open, and got into the passage; was there a considerable noise in the front of him. - A. In the front, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. He was looking towards the street when you first met him. - A. No, he turned round to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You chucked him upon the stairs and threw yourself upon him. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other person join with you in laying upon him. - A. I cannot say, my attention was too much upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether Sherrin was upon him or not you cannot say. - A. He was not upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was upon you. - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the pistol was turned towards your head, you took hold of it with your left hand and turned it down - A. I turned it down; I cannot say whether it was my right hand or left; I think it was my left.</p>
               <p>Q. You had touched it with your left hand before it went off. - A. I think I did, for it went off just at the instant that I touched it.</p>
               <p>Q. And the powder of the flash discoloured your face. - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume your laying hold of it with your left hand was rather a sudden act. - A. My hand was not near the trigger.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the pistol turned toward you you gave it a sudden snatch. - A. It was a quick motion.</p>
               <p>Q. But finding the muzzle approach you you took hold of it, and it instantly went off - there was some struggling between him and you before this took place. - A. There was not much struggling before the pistol went off, it was done almost as soon as he was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he or had he not pointed the pistol to you before you laid hold of it. - A. He pointed the pistol to me before I turned it down; I seized the pistol between the lock and the muzzle.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had been disposed to have shot at you before you were down he had opportunity enough. - A. He had; I went to him, having full confidence that he knew me, thinking he would not.</p>
               <p>Court. If the pistol had gone off in the direction in which it was before you put your left hand to it, do you believe it would have hit you - A. I have every reason to believe if I had not prevented him he would have shot me; there was not time for a great deal of aim, but he put it round towards my head; my putting my left hand to it altered the direction,</p>

            . - Mr. Watson. What are you. - A. I am a city constable. On the 6th of May I was at the public house in the Old Jewry, in company with Leadbetter; I went from thence with him to Fenchurch-street to Mr. Garren's house; from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010065"></xptr> Information of a boy that two men had been shot; I went to the dwelling house of some person, I was given to understand it was his house; I suppose there were two or three hundred people assembled round the house.</p>
               <p>Court. First of all let me ask you whether there was any cry in the croud about what had passed. - A. I think I heard the mob say he had fire arms, and to take care of ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had fire arms. - A. Mr. Garren; a man had been shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear that. - A. I cannot pretend to say that; I went into this passage with Leadbetter, I then saw Mr. Garren with a pistol in each hand at the further end of the passage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. At this moment had either of you shewn any staff of office. - A. I shewed none at all; not Leadbetter as I know of. Then a door was opened to Leadbetter, which led him through a hardware shop into the kitchen; I remained in the passage, the prisoner was walking about at the further end of the passage; Leadbetter came out of a door, which I judged to be the kitchen door, where the prisoner was standing. I then heard Mr. Leadbetter say to Mr. Garren, you have known me for some years; I did not hear the prisoner make any reply. Leadbetter went up to him; he turned himself round as if he was going out of the passage, with intention of going up stairs; I then observed Leadbetter rush on him; and he throwed him on the stairs quite flat, and throwed himself upon him; and I immediately fell upon him also, before the pistol was fired; I then heard the report of a pistol, I did not see the motion of his hand, I merely heard the sound; and the flash of the pistol came into my face; the confusion was great, I was upon Leadbetter at that time. After we were upon him, there were a large quantity of people rushed in upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards observe the effect that that firing had. - A. I did; I took the bit of the stairs and the skirting board out (producing them); that nail in the stair turned the bullet off; the bullet is in the wood. I now produce them. We secured him and brought him away to the counter; in going I did not hear him say any thing; he hung back and was obstropolous.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the kitchen of this house when Leadbetter came in. - A. I was; when Leadbetter came the prisoner had shot a man.</p>
               <p>Court. Relate under what circumstance the prisoner had shot a man before Leadbetter came. - A. Porcus, a serjeant at mace, had a warrant against a person of the name of Gerrard, I was with him; about thirty yards to our coming to Mr. Garren's house, he saw the prisoner standing at the door; he says there he is; when we got there Porcus went up stairs along with the prisoner, he told the prisoner that he had got an execution against him for one hundred and twenty pounds; the prisoner says to his daughter, these fellows are come to rob the house, to rob me, and murder you. The prisoner at the bar made his escape; he went into the kitchen and went up stairs; Porcus followed him, he called to me, and said, Barber follow me; when Porcus got midway of the stair case, the prisoner chucked down large pieces of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. In a direction to hit you and Porcus. - A. Yes, two large pieces; Porcus and I withdrew, and Porcus left me in the passage. Porcus returned with a man of the name of Jones, a fireman and ticket porter; when he returned I pushed my foot against the door and forced it open; the prisoner was on the landing place on the stairs; we advanced on the stairs towards the prisoner, Porcus was in my rear; when Jones had got on the sixth or seventh step on the stairs, I saw the prisoner point the pistol at me, he shot at me, and shot Jones; I took Jones down stairs and I delivered him to Porcus; he took him to the doctor; he was dangerously wounded; he was four or five weeks in Bartholomew's hospital. After I delivered Jones into the care of Porcus, I went up two or three stairs, I came down stairs and said I would not be shot; he had another pistol pointed. When the constable came I told him he had got fire arms, I was in the kitchen; I saw the warrant; Porcus shewed it to the prisoner before Jones was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. You have since found that the prisoner was not the real man against whom that warrant was directed. - A. He was not; I found it out the next day (the warrant produced).</p>

               <p>Q. And you had known that the reverend Mr. Garren was living at No 61. - A Not directly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not know that the reverend Mr. Garron lived at No. 61. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that the reverend Mr. Garren lived in Fenchurch-street. - A. I certainly did know that his name was on the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You knew that Mr. Garren lived in Fenchurch-street, but not at No. 61. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that the reverend Mr. Garren's name was on a brass plate on the door. - A. No, it is white paint; you will not allow me to state the outset; there is an outset in every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know that the name of the reverend B. Garren was on the door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know that the name of the reverend B. Garren was on the door, when you entered the door. - A. Not correctly, not on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before you entered the door see the the name of the reverend B. Garren on the door. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Pray sir, have not you passed that door many thousand times in your life. - A. Many.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you know that the name of the reverend B. Garren was on the door. - A. I was incorrect upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is not an answer.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you not hear the question, that admits of an answer, aye or no - did you before you went into the door, see the name on the door, aye or no. - A. Not the name when I made the arrest.</p>
               <p>Q. When you entered the door, did you see the name on the door. - A. Not that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I know you did not see it on that day because you did not look, had you not seen it in former days. - A. Not minutely.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I shall not put up with that answer.</p>
               <p>Court. You are either a foolish fellow, or you are keeping back something - at the time you entered that door, were you acquainted with the name of B. Garren being on that door. - A. I knew there was a name, but whether it was Garrard or Garren I did not know; I certainly was not correct whether it was Garrard or Garren.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now I should like one plain answer - had not you before that day observed the name of the reverend B. Garren on that door, aye or no; now recollect. - A. I do not conceive that I have seen the name on the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you entered the house did you look to see whether it was 61 or 63. - A. I certainly did not; as we were going along Fenchurch-street I saw him at the door, I thought he was the man.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw him at the house, which afterwards turned out to be 61. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. After you had done the mischief, I take it for granted you went to 63. - A. Yes, the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. On the door of 63 did you see W. Garrard painted on a board at the door. - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>

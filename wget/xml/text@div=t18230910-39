            , a widow, keeps the house. The prisoner was a fellow lodger of mine. On the 1st of April. at six o'clock in the morning, I went to work, and on returning at nine at night, I missed a bronze colour great coat, a handkerchief, and two pair of gloves were in the pockets; it was worth 3 l. 10 s., and the gloves and handkerchief 4 s.,; I never gave the prisoner leave to take it; he left the house that day. I did not see him again till the 18th of August, when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I asked you the day before to lend me the coat - A. On my oath he did not; he called on me in Piccadilly, but said nothing about it. I bought it in November last for 5 l.</p>

            . I rent the house. On the 1st of April, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Ashdown's room making his bed; the prisoner came in and took this coat off the peg. I said it was Ashdown's - he said,</p>
               <p>"I know it ma'am, he has lent it me." I said,</p>
               <p>"Is that all right;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes; it is all right," and walked out with it. I was quite satisfied, and looked out of window, and saw a gig at the door; he laid it across the gig; I called to him,</p>
               <p>"Is it right you should have this coat;" he said,</p>

            . I am an officer, and apprehended the prisoner. On the way to the watch-house, he wanted us to take him to his friends to make matters up, but Ashdown said he should go to the watch-house; he said voluntarily, that he took the coat. I asked what he had done with it. He told different stories, and at last said he gave it to a friend, who had pawned it, but where it was he did not tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I considered that I took it with his consent, and intended to return it, but my friend deceived me, and pawned it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a compositor, and live in Ball-court, Giltspur street. I was at Sydenham on 23rd Sept.—I was returning home from there, and in consequence of losing the last train at ten o'clock I had to walk—I was a complete stranger in that part—I met the prisoner I believe at New<lb></lb>ington-causeway, and I asked him which was the nearest way to the City—I got into conversation with him, and we proceeded in the direction of the City—I went into a public-house, to give him something to drink for his kindness—after that we went into a second public-house—when we came out from there I saw two women standing outside—the prisoner seemed to know them—he went up and addressed them, and I spoke to them in common conversation—I felt a touch in my pocket—I turned round and asked the prisoner what he had been doing—that was a very few minutes after coming out of the public-house—the touch was inside my pocket, as if some person had their hand in—the prisoner was standing adjoining me—it could be no other person's hand but his—I had a snuff-mull in that pocket, and I missed it—I had seen it safe not two seconds previously—I turned round, caught the prisoner by the wrist, and asked him what right he had with that—he said he had nothing—I heard something fall, but I did not see him throw it—a policeman happened to turn the corner, and he found the mull.</p>

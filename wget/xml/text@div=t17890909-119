               <p>I am a sorter of letters at the post-office; the Lampetre bag of the 18th of July last arrived at London the 20th; I opened the bag, I found a money letter in it, and this letter bill; the deputy post-master of Lampetre had put the superscription of the letter on this bill; I took notice of the letter by the weight only; it appeared to me to have money in it, and I should suppose gold; I delivered the letter to the clerk of the money book, Mr. Pippard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray when you took this letter into your hand, you say by the weight of it you supposed it contained money; might not any thing else besides money be in it? - Possibly some other substance might; I judged from its weight it was gold, and being minuted as gold by the post-master-general, in the country as containing money, I concluded it was money.</p>
               <p>Was the letter sealed? - I believe so; I have no doubt but it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you concluded it to be gold, from the weight and description of the bill? - Certainly; and it appeared to me to be compact, and in the usual form of money letters.</p>

               <p>Can you tell me then, whether that letter was sealed? - I did not remark whether it was sealed or wafered, it was one or the other; it was fast.</p>
               <p>Do you say it was fast, upon the memory you have it was fast; or do you suppose it was fast, because you would have taken notice of it if it had not been sealed; is that the reason upon which you say it was sealed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I remember, on the morning of the 20th of July, receiving a money letter from Mr. Pippard; I signed the book; it is the custom of the office; I do not recollect the direction; it appears by the entry, to Mr. Hutchins, Bell Court, Grays-inn-lane, Holborn; the name Lovatt, in the column of receiver, is my writing; I delivered the letter to Mr. Girling; it was delivered to me as a money letter; it appeared by the weight to be a money letter; and I believed it to be so; it was sealed, and had not been opened to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you deliver it to Girling as a money letter? - I did, I desired him to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Was it at that time in the same condition that you received it from Mr. Pippard? - It was.</p>
               <p>When did you give it Girling? - In the course of two minutes after I received it from Mr. Pippard.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you deliver it to Girling? - For Girling to deliver it to the person it was directed to; Girling was a letter carrier of that district.</p>
               <p>Court. This was at the general post-office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All this was done in the course of a few minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is, it comes from Mr. Devereux to Mr. Pippard, and from Mr. Pippard to you, then you deliver these letters, that are money letters, to the carriers that take them to the several districts; do you recollect any particular circumstance that makes you remember desiring him to take care of that particular letter? - I remember his telling me he would be careful of the letter and deliver it.</p>
               <p>Were there any other money letters at the same time? - I had no other.</p>
               <p>How comes it you happen to recollect this particular letter? - As being very careful of our employ; I desired him to be as careful.</p>
               <p>Do you do that with all the money letters you receive? - I generally do.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose you did it with that particular letter, from that general practice, or do you remember particularly, that you gave these directions with that particular letter? - Particularly.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember? - I remember it as a circumstance to be very true.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the direction of the letter? - No, I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>Why do you think you gave particular directions with that letter? - That he might be careful to deliver it, and bring back a receipt for it, as it was not in my own delivery; I desired him to be particular in the delivery of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lovatt, I think I heard you say you did not recollect any other money letter, or that there were no other that morning; you know it was not your place to inspect into these cases, therefore you cannot say whether there were or not? - There was no other that I had signed for your delivery; I can say nothing to the others.</p>

               <p>Do you know Mrs. Horne Lloyd, of Wales? - Yes, she is a relation of mine.</p>
               <p>Do you remember to have received any letter on the 20th of July from her? - No, I have not on the 21st nor the 22d; I know the prisoner, this is the fifth time I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Did he call upon you any time in July? - The 25th of July he called; I believe so, as nigh as I can guess, at my apartment.</p>
               <p>What was his business in calling upon you? - He enquired for me of a neighbour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090166"></xptr>down stairs; I came down; he asked me if my name was Hutchins; I asked him to come up stairs; when he came in he told me there was a letter in the post office for me, I am certain of the words; I said what is the matter you have not brought that letter to me? he said, Mr. Hutchin's the next time I come I will bring you the letter; but I never saw him till I went to the post office the next Monday, this was on the Wednesday or Thursday; I enquired for the prisoner, and he came to me; I said to him, my friend, where is my letter; says he, I have not got it yet, but I will come to you in the evening; I never saw his face till I came into Bow-street; it was the 12th of August when I was sent for to go there; I received a letter on the 12th of August, from Mrs. Lloyd, informing me that three pounds three shillings had been sent to me; upon that I went to the post-office, to enquire for the letter I had lost, and the gentlemen at the post-office promised to see me righted; and they directed me to go to Bow-street; there I saw the prisoner; I know he is the man that spoke to me before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The letter was delivered into my care on the 20th, as near as I can recollect; I wish to ask him whether he is positive to the 25th, that I first went to him or not? - It was the 25th of July or the 26th; it was on the Thursday, though I believe at night.</p>
               <p>Court. Might it not be the 20th for any thing you know? - I am sure it was not, because I always keep an almanack in my room.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure as to the day of the week? - I believe it was on the Wednesday or the Thursday the 25th.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to stand there and say positively, on your memory, that it was on any particular day? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Then why did you say just now it was on the Thursday the 25th? - I am sure it was on a Thursday.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was it? - Why the 25th, I believe.</p>
               <p>You will not venture to speak to the day of the month, only the day of the week? - The letter was dated the 18th of July, that was on a Saturday; I went the Monday following; the prisoner came to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you that I had lost the letter? - He told me he had lost the letter out of his pocket; that was the second time I saw him, that he said so.</p>
               <p>Did not I ask you to write to your friends, when I told you I had lost the letter? - Yes; he asked me whether I had written to my friends or not; and I told him I had sent a letter away.</p>
               <p>Court. When was that? - That was the second time that he came to me; I told him I had written a letter to my friends.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was there not a person with me, when I came to you? - Yes, a little man.</p>
               <p>Did not he ask you as well as me, to write to your friends? - I never heard him.</p>
               <p>Did not you, before a witness, after I had said I had lost the letter, agree on the receipt of an answer to that letter, to take to the amount of whatever was contained in the answer from me, as I had lost it? - I thought I should hurt myself by taking any money.</p>
               <p>The question repeated. - Yes, he did say so; but then, when I received the account of what was in the letter, I went to the post-office; and on enquiring for him, I heard he was in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it that he told you he would pay you the money that was in that letter, when you knew what it was? - It was some time in July.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether the person with me did not offer payment as well as myself? - I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Did not I leave him my address? - No; he gave me a bit of a direction with his name.</p>
               <p>Court. But you could find him out at the post-office? - Not by that paper.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any place upon the paper, where he lived? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it said, post-office, or anything of that sort? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether he is confident there were not Lascell's-place, Broad-street, Bloomsbury, on the same paper? - No, nothing but his name.</p>
               <p>Where is the paper? - It is at home.</p>
               <p>Have you ever looked at it lately? - Never.</p>
               <p>Are you sure there was not upon it, Lascell's-place, Broad-street, Bloomsbury? - I am sure there was not; I have it at home in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg the paper might be produced, if possible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, one of the Counsel for the prosecution. Now, honest man, be cool, and recollect yourself; do you remember perfectly, when that young man came first to your house in Gray's-inn-lane? - Yes, I remember it.</p>
               <p>He told you that there was a letter for you at the post-office? - He did so.</p>
               <p>Did he say anything more than that? - He said there was a letter at the post-office for me; that was all; and I asked him what was the matter he had not brought it? and he told me he would bring it the next time he came that way; he said no more at that time.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you at that time, that it was a money letter, or contained money? - No; the second time, he told me he would look for the letter, and bring it to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prisoner. Do you wish him to fetch the paper? -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes; and I wish an officer might be sent with him.</p>
               <p>Court to Lovatt. By the course of the post-office, are not the letters delivered on the same day? - They should be.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am inspector of the letters at the general post-office; I know the prisoner; on the 20th of July, it was his duty to take letters, and deliver them the same day he received them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, may I be permitted to call some persons respecting my character.</p>
               <p>Court. I will tell you; it is for you to make the best defence you can; and you are at liberty to call any witnesses that you think fit, either to disprove any of the facts that have been proved, or to prove any other facts that may explain those facts; or any thing that you think advantageous to your defence; and besides that, you may call any witnesses to your character; and before you call them, you may, if you think fit, address the Jury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, the letter was delivered into my care; and according to my usual custom with many letters, I put it into a book which I kept for the purpose; between the post-office and Mr. Hutchins's house, I missed this letter out of my pocket, near Furnival's-inn, where I began my delivery of letters; I went to a friend of mine, and asked him what I should do in the case; whether first to make application to the post-office, or to the person that it was directed to; I had a written receipt from the post-office, in my pocket at the time, which directed me to go to the prosecutor; my friend advised me to go first to the prosecutor, and advise him to write to his friends, whom he supposed might send a letter containing cash; as I supposed by the weight, it did; I went to the prosecutor, and asked him if he expected a letter that day from Wales? he answered no, he did not; but that he had a relation who very probably might send him one; he had a daughter in the country; the person who was with me, said, he had heard me say I had a letter, but I had unfortunately lost it with some other papers, of no value, but to myself; and I immediately begged of him to write to this daughter, whom he supposed might send to him; and whatever it contained, be it what it would, I was very willing to make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090168"></xptr>him any ample recompence; I desired him not to let the post-office know; the person with me told him, if he would not take my word for the payment, he would be answerable for it; the prosecutor said, all he desired, was to the amount it contained; I immediately wrote him my address on a piece of paper; and told him as soon as he received an answer to his letter, I would immediately wait on him with the money; he agreed to that, and said he was perfectly satisfied; I called several times afterwards, two or three times; I cannot recollect the particular times; but he was not in the way; I asked whether he had received any answer; there was a man in the shop who could not tell; I saw him no more, till I saw him at Bow-street; when I was apprehended on the other matter, he then denied what he had said before; and almost denied my being with him at all; I have nothing further to say; and I submit myself intirely to your consideration.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>(Hutchins returned without the paper, not being able to find it.)</p>

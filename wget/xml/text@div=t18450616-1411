                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Sally Cann, at Woolwich—she washes for the Ordnance department—we have missed a number of counterpanes which were entrusted to her to wash—John Lloyd was in her employ—on the 24th of May, when I missed the counterpanes, I was looking for them, with the assistance of John Lloyd, and several others; and while so doing, I saw John Lloyd with this remnant of one of the coun<lb></lb>terpanes in his hand—he was trying to conceal it from ray sight, and then threw it down—I took it up immediately—it has the mark of the Board of Ordnance upon it—I found three other pieces, with the same mark, con-cealed in a bag containing cloth, which was in the store-room, where the counterpanes are before they are washed—John Lloyd had access to that room, and to the counterpanes—he had no particular charge of them—I can speak positively to having lost twenty-six counterpanes.</p>

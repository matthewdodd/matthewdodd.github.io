            . I lived at No. 10, in the Cresent, in the Minories, with Mr. Young, who is a merchant. I was a servant there; I had left my situation and lived with my brother, whose name is Barker; he lives in Lizard-street, City-road; I left my two boxes in the care of Mrs. Daniels, on the 20th May; she sent her son to tell me that my two boxes had been broken open, and all my clothes stolen out. I went down to her directly and saw her. The prisoner is her son.</p>

            . I am a carman. I saw the prisoner get into his mother's window on the 20th of May. I had known him some time. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. In a few minutes he threw a sack out of the window. The room is over a coach-house; he got in by climbing up the doors; he jumped out after it, and carried it away. I believe he was not upon good terms with his mother. The mews forms a square; his mother kept two rooms over the stable; the door is at the side of the coach-house; it is called America-mews. There is a staircase up to the rooms.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you thought I was doing wrong, why did you not stop me - A. I thought you was not doing wrong, as it was your mother's house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BELCHER. I live with Mr. Prince, in Whitechapel; I have one petticoat and two shifts pledged for 10s. on the 20th of May, about six o'clock in the evening. I have every reason to believe they were pawned by the prisoner. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORRESTER. I am an officer. The prisoner was advertised, and I apprehended him; he denied his name. I took him into custody.</p>

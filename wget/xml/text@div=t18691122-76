I am a bricklayer, and live at 7, Little Suffolk Street, Borough—the prisoner lodged in my house, and the deceased, Sarah Ann Wright, lived with him as his wife—he is a shoe maker or a shoe finisher by trade—they had a little boy about eighteen months' old—they occupied the first-floor back—Mrs. Harper occupied the front room on the same floor, and I occupied the two lower rooms, sleeping in the front one under Mrs. Harper—they had lived there about twelve weeks—on Saturday after<lb></lb>noon, 25th September, about 4 o'clock.

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's son—I am fifteen years of age—I have been living at home, at Red Cross Street—I remember my mother's death, and my father going to live with Sarah Ann Wright—he was always very kind to her, and to all of us—I saw him on the Saturday, the day before this occurrence, and I had seen him all the week—he seemed as if he was a little in trouble—I went round to Suffolk Street on the Saturday, and he was walking up and down the room all the while I was there, about twenty minutes—he did not say whether anything was the matter with him—he held his head down—he seemed a little changed from what he had been before—he had had very little work—he is a boot finisher, and worked for Mr. Bowden, in Union Street, Borough, for about five or six years—he did a little work the week before this—I saw him twice or three times on the Saturday, walking up and down the room in this way, with his head down; that was between 2 o'clock and 7—I took him some boots—he was walking up and down the room, and I asked him what was the matter, and he threw up his hands and made no answer—the deceased came in with a shawl, which she had been to fetch from the pawn-shop—he then sent me home, and an hour afterwards he came home and gave me a half-crown, and told me to come round in the morning for the washing—the deceased was in the habit of doing the washing for us—I remember her going out on the Friday night to get some supper—I saw these two knives there—this knife father was in the habit of using to eat with—I don't know the other—he used to keep this one sharpened, and used always to call it his own knife—he took it from Red Cross Street, when he moved to Suffolk Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness—the prisoner came to live at our house in May, 1868—as far as I have known him with his family, he was kind and good-tempered towards them, and a possible, quietly-disposed man—I had known him fifteen or sixteen years before he came to reside with me—we were in the same way of business, and worked together at some shops—for five or six weeks before this occurrence I noticed a great change in him—I did not speak to him about it—I did to my wife—on the Saturday before this took place, I said something to her about his manner, and she said something to me—I believe his manner was kind and affectionate to the deceased and his children—I have had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of observing them.</p>

I am the wife of George Robinson, and live at 16, Little Quildford Street, Borough—I have known the prisoner turned four years—he has frequently visited at our house—until lately he has been a quiet, pleasant, good-tempered man, and a good husband and father—from Whitsuntide up to the time of this occurrence, I noticed a very great change in his manner—about a fortnight before he called upon me, and remained about an hour and a half—he walked up and down the room in a very distressing manner—I noticed that he was very much changed—I asked him what was the matter, but he made no reply—he said he did not know what was the matter, that was chiefly all he said to me—I saw him twice or three times with the deceased—he was kind and affectionate to her, and so he was to his wife, during a very long illness.</p>

I live at 6, Gravel Lane, Borough—I have been several times in the prisoner's company—I used to call on my mother, who lived in the same house—on one occasion I saw him crying—I have noticed a strangeness about him several times—on the Monday before the murder I was in his company, in my mother's room—there was myself, my wife, my mother and father, Mr. and Mrs. Waugh, and the prisoner and deceased—the deceased sang a song, and my father said it was a pretty song—the prisoner said, "Yes; it was," and some few minutes afterwards he suddenly jumped up, and said, "I will hit any man a bleeding nose that insults me"</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 37, Albemarle Street, and at Chiswick—I am a fellow of the College of Physicians—I have had great experience in cases of mental disorder—I have been about twenty-one years in practice—I have been present in Court during the hearing of this case to-day, and have heard the evidence both for the prosecution and defence—I hare also had a personal interview with the prisoner in Newgate, on Monday last—I should think his mind then was perfectly sound, although it was weakened, I presume, by confinement, and the nature of his position; but it is a perfectly sound mind, I think, now—I have heard the evidence as to his previous good character, and the change in his disposition; that would be exactly compatible with a temporary attack of insanity at the time of his committing this crime—from my own examination of him, before I heard the evidence, I also came to the conclusion that at the time he com<lb></lb>mitted the crime he was of unsound mind—it struck me that he was a man of remarkable kindness of disposition, naturally—he told me his rela<lb></lb>tions with this woman, whom he took out of charity—there was no attempt on his part to assume insanity, and he had no recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he know you were a doctor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose so—his account of his condition, in which he could give me no information what<lb></lb>ever, would be exactly compatible with a crime committed in that way—the recollection would go entirely, supposing it was committed in a paroxysm of insanity—he clearly had no recollection whatever; nor could he assist me in the slightest degree—he had a badly formed head—I have no doubt that the cause of the insanity in this case was the drinking acting upon a pre<lb></lb>disposed mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you to say that he was of unsound mind when you saw him in Newgate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so—I have now reason to doubt that he was of sound mind the day before he committed this offence; I had not then; I had no evidence before me—from the evidence adduced to-day, I certainly think he was of unsound mind the day before he committed this offence, from the entire motiveless character of the deed itself; the absolute difference between the man's real character suddenly taking place, culminating in such an act; his affection for this woman; his attempt at self-destruction; the nature of his pursuits; the drinking before hand; the hour at which the deed was committed, it being common, in insanity, that the most dangerous period of suicidal impulse is at that hour of the morning, the first waking from sleep—I don't know whether he had been to sleep—when I went to Newgate I think I told the prisoner I had</p>

               <p>come to see whether he was insane—not at first, but after some time—I did not speak to him for some time—Mr. Gibson was present, and he was speaking to the prisoner—the first words I spoke to him, certainly, were not that I had come to see whether he was insane—I did not tell him that—I think I told him, which comes to the same thing, that I had been asked to investigate the state of his mind, at the time of this murder—I was with him about half-an-hour—I keep a large private asylum—Mr. Gibson, the surgeon of the goal, was with me the whole time the interview lasted, and assisted me very much in the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the most dangerous period is at that hour in the morning, on the first waking—why is that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is rather a practical experience of my own—it is supposed to arise from the recumbent position—that is one theory—I don't give it is my own, but the sudden rising from the recumbent position to the upright one, acting upon a brain diseased, pro<lb></lb>duces a change in the mental functions—another theory is that the intellect is suddenly called upon to act; and a third, the heart's action being suddenly called upon to do an extra work.</p>

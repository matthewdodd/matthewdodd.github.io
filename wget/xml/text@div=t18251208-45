            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 4th of December, about twenty minutes past three o'clock, in the morning, I stopped the prisoner at Tottenham, coming towards town, with these stirrup irons, and a pair of pattens; I asked what he had got there - he said a pair of old irons and pattens - that the irons belonged to his pony saddle - that he had sold his pony and saddle, and was going towards town, to Greenwich for his pension - that his wife had given him the pattens in case he wanted money to pay his expenses - that he had come from Ealing, near Cambridgeshire, and his wife had come up by the carrier; I insisted on his going with us - he said if we took him to where he took the irons from he would: when we had got a few paces he slipped his arm out of ours, and ran away - I secured and took him to the watch-house.</p>

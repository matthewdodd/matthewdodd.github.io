            . On Saturday morning, the 27th of July, I was returning from Leadenhall market, and I saw the prisoner hunting the pig along, with four or five boys. I heard him say to them,</p>
               <p>"Hunt it along - that is right, hunt it along." I did not know it was the prosecutor's at that time. I saw the same pig again that day, and knew it. Mundy claimed it. I went with him, and found it tied to the public-house rails; we left the boy in care of it, and went to look for the prisoner, and found him in ten minutes, with the pig. I went up to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have got a nice pig - will you sell it?" he said, Yes. I said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want?" Mundy came up at this time, and he said it was not exactly his, but that the man wanted to sell it very bad, and if we would go into the public-house, he would come to us in an hour; but I secured him.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Armitage-street. On Saturday morning the 27th of July, between nine and ten o'clock, the prisoner asked me to let him put a pig in my stable. I did not see it; he said he would pay me to let it be there an hour, while he fetched his son to drive it home; that a man was in prison for debt, and he got this pig to pay the debt.</p>

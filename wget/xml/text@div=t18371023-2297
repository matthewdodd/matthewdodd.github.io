                  </hi>. I keep the George public-house at Uxbridge, in the parish of Hillingdon. On the 28th of December, 1834, about three o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed—I got up, came down, and examined the state of the premises—I found the window open in front of the street a pane of glass had been taken out, the fastening removed, and the window opened—the window lifts up, and has a screw-pin which goes through both sashes in the middle, and a drop at both ends—the removal of that pane of glass would enable a person to put his hand in and undo the fastening—it could not be done without, that window had been down the night before, and the fastening all secure—I missed a quantity of things, among then some knives and forks, which were safe with the rest of the property the night before—there was a poultry knife and fork among them—I missed about two dozen knives and forks—I found the window open on coming down, so as to admit the person of a man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and live at Watford. About Christ<lb></lb>mas, 1834, I remember being at the Leather-seller's Arms there—it was close upon Christmas-day, but I can<lb></lb>not say precisely on what day—I can not say whether it was before or after Christmas-day—it was within two or three days of Christmas-day, or it might be a week—it was in the win<lb></lb>ter time—about Christmas—it might be within a week on either side Christmas-day—I bought some knives and forks, which I afterwards gave to Birch, the constable—I do not know what quantity I bought—I gave Birch all I bought—I gave 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I do not know the person I ought them of—it was candle-light—one man took the money—I cannot say what time in the evening it was, exactly—I took no notice—there were several persons in the tap-room—I only dealt with one—I thought them rather cheap at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—as soon as I examined them, I asked, "Pray how did you come by these knives and forks?"—he said in his travelling he exchanged new ones for old ones, at gentlemen's houses—some small waiters were sold at the same time to Mr. Tookey—I do not know by who, but it was not the same person as I bought the knives and forks of.</p>

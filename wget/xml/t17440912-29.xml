She was taken on Monday morning, and on Tuesday morning I went to her to the toll-house, and found some handkerchiefs upon her, and a shift which she had on her back; she had likewise my cap, apron, handkerchief, stockings, clogs and cloak on. I asked her how she came to rob me, (I had lent her 2 s. to take a gown out of pawn) she said, because I was to send a woman with her to fetch the gown out of pawn, and she was afraid the woman should tell me her character, and I should turn her away. She sold a parcel of my things for two guineas to Mrs. Bartlow - A pair of stays, two shirts, two spoons, an old gown, and some other things, and took me to the place where she told them .</p>

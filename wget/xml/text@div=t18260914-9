            . I am in Messrs. Gunns' employ. Having lost property I and Bass concealed ourselves in the cellar at dinner time, and saw the prisoner come into the shop alone - he stood there about five minutes, then went out with this property on his shoulder, and shut the door after him; we secured him on the step. The door had a secret spring, which he knew how to open; I jumped out of the cellar, and secured him with the pump-handles and hooks; he said, "Oh! Cook, it is not your's"</p>

            . I was in the cellar with Cook. I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140007"></xptr>the prisoner go up the steps, and saw him go out with the property - we secured him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was looking for work, and met a gentleman in Houndsditch, who said he wanted some pump-screws and handles; I gave him my direction - he said he would call on me on Saturday. I was passing the prosecutors' shop - there are two windows to the cellar; I called to Cook - he made no answer; the door was not fastened, and I went in, but not seeing him, and these things laying there, I took them in my hand, and was going down the steps to call him from the cellar - the moment I put my head down he seized me - I had no idea of taking them away.</p>
               <p>MR. GUNN. When I came down he was in the street - it is evident he had left the shop with the property; not to go to the cellar.</p>

            . When I took him he had shut the door, and was beyond the steps. I heard him call out Oh! before he opened the door - he called to nobody when he came out. Our dinner time is between one and two o'clock - he knew that. He has a wife and child.</p>

            . I live with my father, he is a surveyor. On the 4th of July, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw a woman sitting down in a path in the field: she took something from under her petticoat and put in her apron, whether it was plate or pewter I could not then see, it was in the shape of mugs; I went out of my father's accounting house and called our servant, his name is Reader; I told him my suspicion and to stop the woman if he judged she had any thing with her; I saw the pots when he stopped her, the name being upon the two pots; he took her to the Three Colts; she said she picked them up.</p>

            . Q. You are servant to the last witness - A. Yes, my master desired me to go to this woman; I came up to her about three hundred yards off; I saw the form of a quart pot; I said have not you got some pots of Mr. Hartley's, she said she had got two pots in her apron, she had picked them up; I took the pots out of her apron; I saw Mr. Hartley's name upon them; I took her to Mr. Hartley's, she was taken in custody; I have kept the pots ever since.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had occasion to make water, stooping I saw these pots; I took them up; if they had not belonged to Mr. Hartley, I should have carried them down to the Salmon and Ball; I never stole a pot in my life; that gentleman saw me stoop and pick them up.</p>

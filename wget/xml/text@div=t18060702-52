             sworn. I am an officer; on Sunday the 29th of June about half past eleven o'clock I was going down Diot street, I was informed there was a man that had been used ill, I searched the prisoners in the watchhouse; under the arm pit of Kite I found this key and thimble, and under the arm pit of Gogan I found this shilling and three halfpence, I suppose they had no pockets, it is their plant, as they call it; I went to the prosecutor's house, and the key fitted his drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. And the thimble fitted his finger. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- BELL sworn. I was passing the end of Bembridge street on Sunday the 29th of June; I saw a great number of people ghting, which is no uncommon thing there, I went up to make peace if it was in my power; the prosecutor was certainly ill used, he was bleeding, the prosecutor gave me charge of these two prisoners for robbing him; there were a a great many of them fighting, the prosecutor had knocked them down and they were bleeding; I took them to the watchhouse, Blackman came in and searched them; I saw the property found on them exactly as he has described.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) You had rather a bit of a bustle there had not you, they struck you and you struck them again, or was some of them taking your part now was it, there was some of the women beat. - A. I cannot tell whether some of them took my part or not.</p>
               <p>Kite's Defence. When I came to the end of Diot street I saw a great many people, I saw him fall over the girls he was with, and some of the people lifted him up, the girl got up and ran up the street, I stood against the side of the Maidenhead, I saw the key and thimble lay on the ground, I picked them up; he said that us two girls had robbed him of fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Bell) Did he charge the prisoners with having robbed him of fourteen shillings. - A. He did mention having lost fourteen shillings; there was only this one shilling found.</p>
               <p>Gogan's Defence. I was in Diot street, and as I was standing there this man was quarrelling with several girls, he said they had robbed him of fourteen shillings, he said I was one of the girls; Mr. Blackman found a shilling in my bosom, which was my own, he then said he had lost fourteen shillings, and when he was at Bow street he said he lost only one shilling.</p>

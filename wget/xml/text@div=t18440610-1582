               <p>lived, and was present when my husband died—I and my daughter were present—I do not remember anything especial that then occurred be<lb></lb>tween my husband and the prisoner—when the prisoner came into the room my husband was unconscious of everything—he had said nothing previously to the prisoner, that I am aware of, in reference to myself—my husband told me the prisoner had said something to him—the prisoner said he would assist me as far as he could—I was aware before my husband's death that my daughter was to become entitled to some property—she became entitled to it six months after her father's death—the prisoner was perfectly aware of that fact—I have had conversations with him on the subject since my husband's death, and my husband has had conversa<lb></lb>tion with him about it—it has been a matter of conversation between my family and the prisoner—after the death of Mr. Hawkins, the tenant for life, I consulted the defendant in reference to this property, in consequence of which he took the deed to Mr. Hammond, his solicitor—I showed him a copy of the settlement, and he took it to ascertain if the child was entitled to the property—this is the copy I gave him to take to Mr. Hammond—that was about the 23rd of January, 1843—I also showed him this letter about the 12th of October—(<hi rend="italic">This was a letter from Christopher Pemberton to Mrs. Wortham, dated Cambridge</hi>, 11<hi rend="italic">th October</hi>, 1843, <hi rend="italic">advising her, as Mr. Wortham had not made a will, to apply to the Court of Chancery, as early as possible, to appoint her guardian to her daughter</hi>)—I also showed the prisoner this letter the day it arrived—(<hi rend="italic">This was a letter to the same effect, from John Hawkins, dated 2nd October</hi>, 1843, <hi rend="italic">accompanying an account of the rents of the estate from the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th of October to the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th of January, and showing an annual rental of</hi> 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">odd.)—after</hi> giving him the copy of the deed, he told me Mr. Hammond would write to the trustees—after my husband's death my daugh<lb></lb>ter was at school at Stockwell Common—the prisoner was occasionally in the habit of visiting her there with me—I was not aware of his doing so by himself—I showed him the letter which has been read on the 12th of October—I saw him on the morning of the 13th—I asked him if he had seen Mr. Hammond—he said, "No," but he would see him, as he wished the bill filed in Chan<lb></lb>cery—no further conversation took place that morning on that subject—the prisoner returned to Gerard-street in the afternoon, about half-past three—my daughter was then present—a servant of the landlady of the house was also present—I was going out when he came in—my daughter asked me if I would be home to tea—I said, "Yes"—I then went out—I returned between seven and eight, and my daughter was not there—I found the doors locked, and on opening the front dressing-room door, this note, in the prisoner's handwrit<lb></lb>ing was on the table—(<hi rend="italic">read—</hi>"My dearest Jane,—We are gone to Furnival's Inn.—Yours affectionately, dear Jane, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM")—</hi> he had never addressed me in that style before (Mr. Hammond's offices are in Furnival's Inn)—I waited their return till the morning—I then went to Mr. Hammond's—he was out of town—I saw his clerk—acting under the advice of my friends I took certain measures—I saw my daughter and the prisoner again on the 28th of March this year, at the station-house—the prisoner never, during the whole time I knew him, made any proposals of marriage to me in reference to my daughter—he never spoke of such a thing—I never consented to his taking my daughter away from Gerard-street, Islington, on the 13th of October—I received this letter in the envelope—it is in my daughter's handwriting.

               <p>never saw any of his family—I have made no inquiries about him for the purpose of learning who he was—no one ever came to my house, nor any letters—I thought very favourably and very highly of him—I found him, both before and after my husband's death, a very stedfast friend to me and my family, when my relations would not say a word to me, and I believed him to be very much my friend—he left his furniture with me to save ex<lb></lb>pense—I told him I did not want it; but he said, if it was not in my way, I surely would allow him to leave it there—I was in the habit of using it every day of my life—I had no place to put it, unless I used it—I had some furni<lb></lb>ture of my own, but not sufficient—the furniture I had was not bought from time to time by Mr. Newenham—it was in the house in which Mr. Wortham died—he never bought me any furniture—he might have added a few books to his own things, but be never purchased new furniture—when my husband died my circumstances were very much straitened—I was in a house at the time—I sold my furniture, and paid for the house and funeral—it was not to avoid an execution that Mr. Newenham advanced money for that purpose—there was a half-quarter's rent owing when Mr. Wortham died, and Mr. Newenham advanced the day after the funeral 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay the remainder, on purpose that my furniture should go out of the house to be sold, to defray the funeral expenses, in order that it might not be stopped by any process; but I still owed rent when I left the house—there was one chiffonnier and two arm-chairs belonging to Mr. Newenham, and a carpet, hearth-rug, fender, and window curtain; not carpets—there was only two rooms of his furniture—there was one hearth-rug and carpet, and so on, not hearth-rugs and carpets—there were crimson damask window curtains and muslin curtains hanging to the windows—those things are all perfectly safe—there were some cut glass lustres on the mantel-piece—Mr. Newenham bought them, and sent them in a few days be<lb></lb>fore he went away—there was one picture and six tea-spoons—those were a present to me from Mr. Newenham—there were two table-spoons—I never saw any plated candlesticks—there was one bed-room candlestick—there was no double set of mahogany drawers, nor any linen or clothing—I have no linen of his—he has not furnished me with money to purchase my own per<lb></lb>sonal linen—I have bought some dresses with money which he has given me—I was not in need of under linen—there was a piano-forte—he once ad<lb></lb>vanced a small sum to my husband before his death, to help to pay the rent; and I think once after that he advanced about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is all I know was ad<lb></lb>vanced, and that was paid again—I am quite sure that I never knew Mr. Newenham had any affection for my daughter—I wish I had known it—I have never said that he appeared to like my daughter better than me, no<lb></lb>thing of the kind—my daughter was a child—I had no servant in Octo<lb></lb>ber last—there was the servant belonging to the landlady of the house—I left my daughter alone with Mr. Newenham on the 13th of Octo<lb></lb>ber, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, and returned between seven and eight—I certainly expected to find them there on my return—he had been there with me nearly all that day—he was in the habit of being with me almost the whole of every day—he was generally in the sitting-room—I had only been three days in Gerard-street, and he was putting the place to rights, putting the pictures up—there were pictures in the bed-room—he might have put some up in my bed-room—I never saw him in my bed-room, either in Gerard-street or any other bed-room, except he went in by himself—he was not there when I was—we were all in and out of the bed-room during the few days we were in Gerard-street—he was not in the habit of sitting with me in my bed-room there, or at other lodgings—I never saw him in my bed-room, except he asked to walk in there—he never sat in my bed-room—my daughter and I had no quarrel on the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say to Mr. Newenham, on putting on your bonnet and shawl, "I see all your attentions are directed to Fanny, I shall quit this house, and will not return to it again?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, no; he knew I was coming back to my house—I never said any such thing; nor did I add, "I know that your intention is to marry Fanny, therefore only act honourably by her"—no such thing happened—I left the house, and said I would return to tea—the child followed me down stairs, and asked me, and I said I was coming back to tea—I was not very angry when I went out; I was hurt at the manner in which my child had acted towards me, and I knew who had made her act so—Mr. Newenham took her part, and therefore I suppose he had induced her to act in that manner, for she had never said she would run away from any place—he said I was harsh to her—I did not suppose then that he had induced her to act so, but I now know it was him—I did not know whether or not he would be there on my return; that would have been a matter of no consequence, so that my child was perfectly safe—I could not expect to find him there—he had his hat on when I left, and said he was going out again—I never had any conversation with my daughter, or Mr. Newenham, about any sum of money to be allowed to me—I never heard before my daughter left me, of a sum of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year to be allowed to me—I never expected it, or had any conversa<lb></lb>tion with anybody about it—my husband was in difficulties before he died—I remember Mr. Newenham leaving for a time before he died—he used to</p>

               <p>take his meals with us then—I did not say we should be obliged to him to return, for we had not the means of keeping the house without his assistance—we said we should be very happy if he would return, but we could have kept the house, by letting it to others—I am quite sure the prisoner did not pay my husband's funeral expenses, or advance the money for them—it was paid after Mr. Newenham sold my furniture—he came and rendered me an account, and I then told him to go and pay the funeral expenses—they were paid a fortnight after the funeral—before my marriage I had lived with Mrs. Shirley, a milliner in Fleet-street, as an assistant, and also with a Mrs. Smith—I was a milliner's assistant at the time of my marriage—I was assistant to Mr. Wortham, who was a linen-draper at Leamington—I was not one of his shopwomen, I was in the show-room.</p>

It was not my inten<lb></lb>tion to have addressed you again until all matters were settled by the attorneys engaged in our affairs; but the uncalled for insult you have offered me by your scandalous advertisement, demands the remarks I make. What feeling can you have to proclaim (as you wish and intend) my supposed shame and dishonour to the world, as if I were a harlot? Am I not now a married woman? Our union took place within 40 hours after I left the house, where I spent the last few previous days in real wretchedness and misery. My mar<lb></lb>riage certificate I have in my possession. Have you no shame left, no regard for the virtuous character of an only daughter? My poor dear father, alas! now no more, often said your heart was one of adamant. I was then too young to know how truly he spoke—time has shown me his sentence was right—the deep and lasting disgrace you have put upon me shall never be effaced from my memory, but am willing to attribute your conduct to your ungovernable temper, goaded on by an unprincipled low-bred attorney, of the name of Hammond, who has no other object in view than to rob either you or my</p>

               <p>property, Mr. Pemberton declares he was an unfit person for him to commu<lb></lb>nicate with; all the man's business lies among a set of Hampstead omnibus drivers, stage-coach proprietors, and butchers. Had you employed Mr. J. Hawkins there would have been respectability on your solicitor's side as well as a friendly feeling. Your obtaining an order to prevent the cohabitation of my husband and myself was perfectly ridiculous, also illegal; and you may rest assured, though the Vice-Chancellor has heard your story, mine, accom<lb></lb>panied by affidavits, stating many particulars of your private conduct (your cruelty to me shall not be forgotten,) will most materially alter his judgment; it is not necessary for me to allude more circumstantially to what I mean. Every inducement which I could hold out to you has been tried in vain to prevent your bringing ruin on yourself as well as misery to me. You were always deaf to every argument which was founded on reason; the narrowness of your education shows itself. Had my friends been consulted by you they would have told you no good could possibly result from your proceedings. My husband, thank God, is quite independent of my property—(you have experienced his bounty and generosity too freely; this is the return he meets with from an ungrateful woman;) we shall, therefore, let mine accumulate until I am of age, and then, in spite of you and your dishonest cunning attorney, we shall come into quiet possession of Connington. I trust you are not carrying on the intrigue my dear father had such cause to complain of; and so satisfied was he of your guilt, that he threatened to leave you, and most certainly would have kicked that fellow (for whom you professed such love) down stairs; he went by the name of M'Donald. In a few days I shall be far distant from you, quite out of the reach of those myrmidons as well as yours. You may probably hear from me after the birth of my child, which event I expect in about four months. One of my sisters-in-law, I am happy to say, will be with me during my confinement. In again alluding to your advertisement,—the morning it appeared it was placed in our hands; we smiled contemptuously at the puny efforts of you and your treacherous abettor, the snake in the grass. Our secret is in the hands of a friend who will not, betray us for so small a sum. He tells us we were worth at least 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In<lb></lb>crease your reward to that sum, we may then talk to that devil incarnate your attorney; the reward of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said, bespeaks the littleness of his mind. I was not aware my nose was aquiline until the public papers told me of the fact; a phrenologist says (to whom I have shown it in order to satisfy you) it does not even approach such a designation. In your next public announcement state some more decidedly conspicuous or hidden features by which so young a wife as I am may be known. You are well versed in English history, and can easily call to mind what raised What Tyler's rebellion in the reign of Richard. It will not be difficult for you to understand the difference between a chesnut horse and a horse chesnut. My husband at present walks with his hands behind him, wears gloves, and no neckcloth. You said his hands were in his pockets (why not in that of other people? but that would be libellous, your hands have been rather deep in those pockets of my dear William,) "no gloves," Scotch blunder! how could people tell whether he had gloves or not, if his hands were always concealed? What a heartless mother, to use her best and well-directed endeavours to have her daughter's husband immured within the walls of a prison, the very man who saved you from the fate my poor dear father said you wished him to meet with. There is no doubt your desire was to see me there also; you would have had your wishes, for had he gone there I never would have forsaken him; gratitude, (you do not understand the term,) if no other feeling influenced me, would have prompted me to follow him to the miserable abode you wished to consign him to. In the</p>

               <p>name of God what injury have either of us done you. In a few years I would have been my own mistress, and, beyond all doubt, would then have taken the step I did on the 15th Oct. I have the same natural rights to choose a husband for myself as you had; you were four or five years older at that period than I am now; there is all the difference. Jealousy prompts you on. It is true you begged of my dear William to marry you, but it is not usual for such a question to proceed from the lady. You have taken a step you can never recall. The time may come when I can call you as you ought to have been to me—a dear mother.</p>

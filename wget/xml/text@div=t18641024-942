I am a clerk in the prosecutors' service—on the afternoon of 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> September, the prisoners came to the counting-house window—they were close together; each could hear what the other said—, Flatman came and desired that an entry should be made for two cast-iron traps, weighing 9 lbs., for which he desired an invoice to be made for Looker to pay—I made out the invoice, and took the value, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., from Looker—they then went down the warehouse, and I saw no more of them—it is the practice for the warehouseman to bring the customer to me, state the amount, and I take the money, and he puts his initials to the transaction—he did not on that occasion give me any account of registered-stove metal, elliptic-stove metal, or kitchen-range metal—the value of the metal depends upon the weight and size—the smallest register-stove metal is from about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—the kitchen-range metal that he had would be worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—altogether it would be worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have the book here—there is no entry of any transaction, but the traps.</p>

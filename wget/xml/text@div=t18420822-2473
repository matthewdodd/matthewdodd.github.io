                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Taylor Foster, and live in St. George's-in-the-East. On the 11th of August, I heard a knock at the door—I opened it, and Rosen Brock appeared—she asked for herself and Cantillow to go into the yard—I said they could not, because my landlady was at breakfast, and they would have to go through her room—I told them to come to my room, which they did—while they were there my little boy brought in change for a sovereign, and gave it to me—I had the silver and half-sovereign in my hand—a five-shilling paper of halfpence laid on the table—I removed it from the front of the table to the back part—Cantillow</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220198"></xptr>
               <p>then wished me to have something to drink, for my kindness in allowing them to come in—I refused, but she insisted on it, and my little boy got a quartern of gin—Rosen Brock took one glass and gave me one—Cantillow had none—I very soon became insensible, and when J came to my senses my five-shilling paper of halfpence was gone, and the prisoners too—I could drink a quartern of gin without being drunk.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I remember my brother bringing in the gin—I was sent on another errand, and Rosen Brock told me to make haste, and they would stop till I came back—I returned in a quarter of an hour—the prisoners were then gone, and my mother was stupefied.</p>

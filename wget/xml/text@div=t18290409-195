The prisoner, (Lady Barrymore,) came to our shop last Tuesday morning, about half-past ten o'clock, and asked for a pair of gloves; I knew her, and was frightened at her, and told her we had not any that would suit her; she said she must have a pair - she was rather tipsy; she stood some minutes, and did not say any thing - she then said again she must have a pair; I told her she had better wait till Mr. Simpson came home, and perhaps he would give her a pair; she said she would not, but she would take these - she took a pair off the counter, and walked away; I had not dealt with her before, but she came to the shop during the very cold weather - I did not know where she lived; she had had a pair the night before, and paid for them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in James-street, Covent-garden, and found these gloves on her; she appeared very drunk, but she makes herself so sometimes, and you cannot tell whether she is or is not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went in there the evening before, and purchased a pair of gloves; to the best of my recollection I paid 1s. 4d. for them, and he told me any time I wanted a pair, I was welcome to them - I do not know what made me do it; I am not in the habit of going in there - I have no recollection of being in the office till I was before the Magistrate.</p>

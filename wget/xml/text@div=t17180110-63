             corroborated Mr. Power's Evidence as to the meeting at the Gaming-House; adding, that he did propose to the Prisoner next Day the Meeting to pay the Guinea he borrowed of the Prosecutor, hoping to engage him to play; that thinking themselves not a Match for Mr. Powers, they proposed one Dr. Wright, who consented; that having not Money enough to make a Share, they went to Cranborn Alley , where the Prisoner pawn'd his Watch for 6 Guineas, afterwards went to the Treasury to the said Powers, and from thence to the Kings-Arms to Dinner; that a Dispute arising about a Bet, the Prosecutor snatch'd it up, tho' the Prisoner said that he had won it; that high Word grew , and the Prosecutor drew his Sword, and said the Prisoner should fight him who saying he would, and going to his Sword, that then he laid hold of Mr. Powers, who flung his Sword on the Table, and the Prisoner put his down; that they paid the Reckoning, and Wright went down, he following him; that hearing the Prosecutor cry out, he went back and found the Prisoner had almost throttled him, having got him under his Arm, and saw him pull his Hand out of his pocket. The Prisoner in his Defence said, That having been drinking, he went to Howell's Gaming-House, where the Prisoner did (on Bradshaw's Request) lend him a Guinea; that next Morning Bradshaw came to him, and asked him to go go pay the Guinea to Powers; that he excused it, saying he had Business ; and besides, having lost his Money the Night before, did not care to ask his Wife for any; that Bradshaw went away, and soon after came again, telling him that one Dr. Wright would meet him. in order to employ him in some Business of Concern; that he did promise to meet at the Kings-Arms Tavern, but having not Money enough to pay the Prosecutor, Wright told him he would carry him to a Goldsmith of his Acquaintance in Cranborn Alley , where he might have Money at an easy Rate; that there he pawn'd his Watch for 6 Guineas in Wright's Name, and afterwards went to the Treasury, and would have Powers to the Kings-Arms, where he paid him his Guinea; that after Dinner Bradshaw and Wright promoted Play, on which the Prosecutor call'd for Box and Dice; that they did all Play; that Powers having lost his Money, would have him pay him the Guinea again, which he told him he had; the Prosecutor insisted on it, that to be easy he did, on promise that Bradshaw and Wright would see him paid again; and that as they were playing there was a Bet of a Guinea which he won, and the Prosecutor snatch'd it up, but he put it up at the desire of Wright and Bradshaw; but the Prosecutor serving him so a second time, it provoked him, that he went to Mr. Powers, and demanded his Money be ow'd him, who, swearing and cursing in a most violent manner, calling him Rogue, Villain and Rascal, drew his Sword, saying, if he would have it, he should fight for it; that he likewise run his Fist in his Face; that then he seiz'd him, and had him down: The Prosecutor told him, that if he would let him rise, he would give him his 3 Guineas; which he did with his own Hand out of his Pocket, and then immediately said, that he would swear he had pick'd his Pocket. The Prisoner alledg'd, that the Prosecution was malicious, because the Prosecutor was apprehensive of being taken up by a Warrant which the Prisoner had obtain'd for that End; that the Prosecutor had said, that he would not have done it, but to save his Place, Bread and Reputation, and for that the Prisoner would have an Information against him. The Prisoner brought abundance to his Reputation; The Jury consider'd the whole, and <rs id="t17180110-63-verdict311" type="verdictDescription">

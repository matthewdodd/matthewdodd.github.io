               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you know that he had been a sailor twenty or thirty years, and had been fractured in the skull, and in consequence of that was out of his mind at times? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The pawnbroker was in the shop? - A. Yes, his man was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here to-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he had got the wrong bundle? - A. Yes; but hesitated sometime; there was nothing taken out of it; he said, it was a mere mistake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was blown up in the Cormbrant sloop of war, and was fractured in the skull, so that when I drink a little drop of spirits, or any thing of that kind, I don't know what I do.</p>

             sworn - I am a widow, and employed the prisoner to fetch some ear-rings, and a bundle, from two different pawnbrokers; he returned between twelve and two, and threw down a bundle that was not mine; I would not open it; he said, all was right; I desired him to take it back, as it did not belong to me; he said, all was well, and that he was happy if I was, and he would be d-d if he would take it back; then that man came and demanded it; the prisoner is at times deranged; he was blown up in the same ship that my brother was, who was killed; I have seen various proofs of it, such as buying a string of rings of sixpence or a shilling value, to the amount of twelve or fourteen shillings, and telling me, he bought them to make me a present of, and that he had made a fortune for me; he passed them to me as gold rings; people have begged me to take care of him, as he is infane, but I know his heart is good.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time did you send him out? - A. About a quarter past twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to send a man perfectly out of his senses for your things? - A. I did not wish to let the people of the house know I pledged things, and he seemed collected that day; he returned about two o'clock, or after; I think the bundle was at Sowerby's, and the ear-rings at Windsor's; I took the bundle in a passion from him, and threw it on the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wilkins). Q. Was this lady present? - A. The prisoner and she lives together; he called her his wife, and she called him her husband; I am sure the bundle was taken from behind a curtain.</p>

I saw some pieces of a copper pipe, and one things and another, I examined the things, two copper screw bolts, seven copper, screws, ten pounds weight of copper, the officer produced them to me at the office, I don't know his name, the officer has got them now; they were all such things as we use there, there are two of these copper bolts, that I could say belonged to Mr. Harford and Taylor; the seven copper screws, I could not speak to positively. They were particular bolts that we could not finish in the shop before we took them there, because they were to be screwed at both ends, and they were never finished.</p>

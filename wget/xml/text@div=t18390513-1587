                  </hi>. I am nephew to Mr. Aldous, who keeps the Steam-boat Dining and Coffee-rooms at St. Mary-at-Hill. On the 25th of April the prisoner came in and asked for half a pint of porter—he laid down a shilling, and I took it to my aunt—she gave me the keys to unlock the till—I gave him a sixpence and five-pence in change—he went away—about ten minutes after, I told my aunt I wanted some lump sugar—she said, "Take the shilling off the table"—I took it to Ann Bowdler, who gave it me, and said it was bad—I took it back—my aunt laid it on the shelf—I saw the prisoner again on the 27th—he asked for half a pint of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale—I went and asked my aunt to come out—she went and served him—I made a communication to her—I knew him to be the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. James Aldous, and Penn's aunt. On the 25th of April I received from him a shilling—I put it on the table—I told him to take it off the table again—he brought it back, I laid it on the shelf in the bar, and gave it to the policeman—it was bent when my nephew brought it back—I am sure the one I gave the policeman was the one I gave my nephew—the one he took away was the one he gave me—on the 27th I was in the back room—my nephew spoke to me—I went to the bar, and the prisoner called for half a pint of ale, which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him—he put me down a counterfeit shil<lb></lb>ling—I took it up—I said it was bad—I would not be satisfied, but I took it to a second person, who said it was very bad—I never lost sight of it—it was put back to me directly—I came back—the prisoner gave me a good shilling, and wanted to change it—I said no—I sent to fetch a po<lb></lb>liceman, and gave him both the bad shillings and the good one.</p>

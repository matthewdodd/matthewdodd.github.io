I was in Clayton Road on 8th January about midnight, and saw the prisoner catch hold of a man—her back was to me, and I thought she was tugging at his waistcoat—I saw her snatch twice with her hand, and immediately after she ran, and as she passed me I caught sight of her face—I immediately ran up to the man and asked him if he had lost anything—I saw this cross-bar (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) sticking through the button-hole of his waistcoat—I ran after her and called "Stop thief!"—she went down to the Great Northern Railway, and I was unable to find her until I got a lamp, and I then found her concealed in a shed where the cattle stand—I told her I should take her in custody for stealing a chain from a man—she said that she knew nothing about the b—chain—I took her to the police-station and she was charged—nothing was found on her—there is a lot of mud about there where the cattle come, and it would be easy to dispose of anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blind-maker, and live in Margaret-street, spa<lb></lb>fields. The prisoner had been in my service eight or nine days—on the 3rd of December I missed three blinds—he had left me a week when he was taken—he came to watch me home to dinner, and the police<lb></lb>man took him—I saw him on the 7th, and spoke to him, and he ran away directly—I found three of my blinds at a broker's shop in Old-street—I asked him how he came to take them—he said poverty drove him to it, and he would take care I should have them back again if I would not appear against him—I said I would not if he would tell me</p>

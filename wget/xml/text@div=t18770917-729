I am fifteen years old, and live with my father and mother, at 12, Seward Place, St. Luke's—the prisoner has lodged there three years—Elizabeth Sarah Devereux lived with him as Mrs. Chapman—on Saturday night, 28th July, they came in together about 11.20—I saw them in the street before they came quite to the door, and at No. 11 I saw kick her in the door on her back, as she was standing up—she then went into the yard at No. 12, and the prisoner followed her at once—when they were into her room I heard her hallooing and fetched my brother John—I saw him go into the room, and shortly afterwards Devereux and the prisoner came out to the foot of the stairs, and I saw him kick her in the back—they then went upstairs together to their own room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Ambling, of 12, Seward Street—the prisoner and deceased have lived with me about three years—on 28th July, about 10 p.m., they paid me their week's rent—they seemed pretty comfortable together, and did not seem as if they had been drinking—they left the house together and returned a little after 12 o'clock—my son then spoke to me—I went up to their room and saw her lying on the floor quite naked, except a jacket across her shoulders—her arms were through the jacket—the prisoner was standing by her feet with only his shirt on—I asked him what he had been doing of—he said that she had lost her money and he had been beating her—I told him he ought to be ashamed of him<lb></lb>self and said "Don't beat her again"—he said he would not—I told him to go to bed, and he got into bed while I was in the room—the deceased was bleeding from her nose and mouth—I pulled the bolster off <hi rend="italic">the sofa</hi> and put it under her head—I spoke to her so that, the prisoner could hear me, and shook her by the chin—I called her and she raised herself up on her elbow, but she did not speak out loud—she said "oon"—I said "Sally, get up"—she was able to see where the prisoner was, and after she saw him she cuddled herself down all in a lump—I then put her head on the pillow, covered her shoulders over with a piece of a table cover which was on the sofa, and went downstairs—about ten minutes after I had been downstairs the prisoner called out "Mrs. Ambling," twice, and when I got on to the stairs he said "Sally is dead"—I went into the room and found her where I had left her, but not as I had left her—the things I put on her had been pulled off again—she was lying in the same place but not in the same position—I had left her on her side and I found her on her back—I put my hand on her heart—I called out and my husband came up—it was the best part of an hour before a doctor came; very nearly 1 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 83, Central Street—on Sun<lb></lb>day morning, 29th July, I was called to Seward Street at 1.10, and found a woman lying on the floor on her back—Mrs. Ambling was with me—the woman was dead and had been so about an hour—on the same evening, by the Coroner's directions, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—her age was about forty—the body was well nourished—I found a bruise on the left eye, the right eye had been blackened from a blow, and was contused, and the nose was recently fractured, within a few hours or a day—I think the nose bad been fractured quite recently, because it was bleeding when I first examined the body—there was a bruise on the right hand, arm, and shoulder, and on the right shin bone—the cause of death was rupture of the spleen and effusion of about two pints of blood into the abdominal cavity—that, in my judgment, would cause death—the rupture of the spleen had been caused by violence; a blow, a kick, or a fall" on a sharp instrument—I found no external wound corresponding with the rupture of the spleen—I found no external mark to indicate a fall upon any sharp instrument, therefore I exclude that from consideration—a kick on the ribs would be likely to cause the rupture of the spleen, and I found the four ribs on the left side and. the filth rib on the right side fractured; those ribs were too high in the chest to cause the rupture of the spleen—that had nothing to do with the death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On the rupture of the spleen death would be rapid, because in this case the effusion was so great; ten minutes would be the outside—the spleen was very distended, owing to her recently having had a meal—either food or drink would increase its distention.</p>

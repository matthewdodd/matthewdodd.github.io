               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose a remnant of cotton, a shawl, and a tea spoon - A. Yes on the 20th of September; they were in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your house on the 20th of September - A. Yes, as a customer; I never saw him but once before; he came in while I was absent.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you return while he was in the house - A. Yes, I served him with two pots of half and half.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge him with stealing these things - A. I found them on him; he was in the parlour some time; he borrowed two shillings, under pretence of changing a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce a ten pound note - A. He pulled out a purse with something in it, I do not know what; he said he was an oyster meter and lived in the parish; when I saw him going out of the house without paying me, I followed him; he said he lived at 41, Wardour street; I went up to him after some distance, under pretence of seeing him home; he asked me if I wanted the money, I said no, if he was a neighbour, it was of no consequence, I could wait till tomorrow; I laid hold of his arm to take him home, he stopped several times, and asked me if I wanted the money, he asked me to go in and drink with him; I looked in his pockets; I told him I would, as he asked me; as soon as I got him into the house I turned his pockets out, and said this is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw your property - A. At the City of Hereford public house in Litchfield street.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the cotton in his coat pocket - A. Yes, and the shawl; a constable was sent for. I took the three remnants of cotton out of his pocket and the shawl. After he was taken to the watchhouse the constable found the tea spoon.</p>

The prisoner was quite drunk, he could not tell where he lived that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him give any description where he lived - A. I do not recollect hearing any description until the next day at Marlborough street, he described himself to live at New street, Mint square; he said he kept a sheep's head shop and sold greens.</p>

I went directly with the boy to the coach-master, who, he said, lived in Portpool-lane. After knocking some time at the door, he looked out of the one pair of stairs window. I told him my business. He said he could do nothing in it, I must come to-morrow, perhaps the man would be come home. After some trouble, and receiving some abuse, I was obliged to apply to Sir

I got some of Sir John's men to go with me, about one o'clock in the morning, and on my return we found the coach standing in the yard; the coachmaster continued obstinately to deny knowing the coachman's name, or place of residence, nor would he give us any assistance to find out the prisoner; there was another coachman in the yard, and partly by threatening, and partly by soothing him, we got him to go with us to the prisoner's house, in Cold-Bath-Fields; we got admittance, and found my trunks in his lodgings, with the locks wrenched off, and the things contained in them were lying about on the chairs and tables in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you find all your things again? - I believe I did. I informed the people when I went into the room, that there was a bank note in a book in the trunk. The prisoner's wife said she had seen no note. I went to the trunk, and found the book and the note in it.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday morning, about half an hour after twelve, I went with the prosecutor to the coach-master's, the coach was in the yard. I begged of the master to get up and assist us to take the prisoner; he would not; he said he did not know him, nor his name, and behaved very abusive; there was another coachman in the yard; I asked him if he knew him; he said yes. I asked him if he knew where he lived; he said if he did he would not tell us, or to that purpose. I told him then I would take him into custody, and he should go to the round house till he would tell; he being frightened, went with us to the prisoner's lodgings; we found the prisoner in bed; he pretended to be asleep, or dead drunk, or something. I believe he was not drunk. The trunks were both in his lodging, broke open, and all the things lying about the room.</p>

About ten minutes after eleven o'clock, he sent me out to call a coach; I called No. 253. I knew the coachman very well before, he stood at Fullwood's Rents .</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you positively to say, that the prisoner drove No. 253? - Yes. I called the coach, and drove down to the court myself, and bid him follow me; we went up stairs for the trunks, he brought one down, and I put the other in. I saw them both in the coach; then I went to tell Mr. M'Sween .</p>
               <p>When the coach was gone, you told Mr. M'Sween the number, and where the master lived? - Yes.</p>

I said they were not mine; he then asked Brown, who said they were not his. On being taken to the station-house, I said I was innocent of the crime; the things were given me by Brown to sell, who said that he would give me a shilling or two; that night I was in bed asleep at my place, and I have a witness in Court to prove it.</p>

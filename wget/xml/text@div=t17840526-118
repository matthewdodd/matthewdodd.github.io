               <p>- YOUNG sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 30th of April about ten at night, I was going up Bridge's-street, and I saw a great mob, and heard a noise in <placeName id="t17840526-118-crimeloc526">White Hart-yard</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17840526-118-crimeloc526" type="placeName" value="White Hart-yard"></interp>

               <p>Mr. Peat Counsel for the Prisoners. At what hour did you see the prisoner? - It was then about ten.</p>
               <p>Was you there before you saw him? - No.</p>
               <p>- ROBERTS sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw Seckery with several others, knocking with a bar, be it iron or wood, against the door and windows, the one pair of stairs windows were totally demolished, the furniture was broke.</p>
               <p>Court. You were with the last witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to see so much more than he did? - The mob assembled, and they were crying out Fox for ever, and we drew our cutlasses and took him to Covent Garden watch-house, and they would not let us in; I saw the furniture broke, the parlour windows, frames and glass totally demolished.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260137"></xptr> Was that done before you brought the prisoner away or after? - It appeared to be done before.</p>
               <p>All your companion saw, was beating against the door and the fanlight; relate particularly what you saw? - I saw the windows totally broke, and boys picking up the glass to throw against the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you see that before you took the prisoner into custody? - Yes, and the windows were totally out, and the street door open.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath Sir, are you sure that at that time you saw any part of the window totally out? - Upon my oath, it was all entirely out.</p>
               <p>What when you took that prisoner? - Yes, and the street door was broke to pieces, and the fanlight was broke to pieces, I rather suspected it was an iron bar.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the cause of this? - I heard a gentleman met with a young girl, and went to have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Was that told you as the cause of this, the common course of a gentleman taking a girl there? - Yes, as I understood, and that she was either a relation of the gentleman, or of some friend of his; I went into the house, there were some Covent Garden constables there, and I enquired the cause.</p>
               <p>I once more ask you upon your oath, whether you saw any part of the window frame broke to pieces? - I saw the window entirely broke to pieces, and the door likewise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You belong to the office too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the owner of the house, this Mr. Adlum? - I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Have you and he had frequent conversations since upon this business? - I do not know whether I have seen the man once or twice before the bill was preferred.</p>
               <p>Do you say it was the prisoner Seckery that beat out the window? - He was assisting with several others, he was breaking the window, he was one that assisted in breaking the window and the door; I did not see Seckery in the house.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, how often have you seen the prosecutor since this accident happened? - I believe about two or three times before we found the bill.</p>
               <p>Has any promise been made you relative to this business? - I never received a farthing, nor no proposal, nor any promise made to me; I never spoke to the prisoner to the best of my knowledge in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Young. You gave an account of all you saw? - I gave an account of all I saw Seckery do.</p>
               <p>You know you are upon your oath; did you see any part of the window frame beat out? - I saw a deal of wood that was laying on the ground at the time.</p>
               <p>Did you observe where that wood could have come from? - The window at the front of the parlour I did observe at the time.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell us that? - I only related what I saw the prisoner do.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the cause of this? - Only what I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat to Prosecutor. You are the master of this convenient house in White Hart-yard? - I was then.</p>
               <p>What money have you received at any time as a compensation for the damage that was supposed to be done by that young man, or some other person, to your house? - None, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself; I have a croud of witnesses that can prove the fact. - I received money for my consent to admit them to bail, I did not receive it on any other account.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Seckery called five witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. In point of law, the mere breaking open a door, or breaking a glass window, is certainly not within the meaning of this statute; God forbid that that which is punishable in another way, by civil action for breach of the peace, should be construed into a felony: in order to come within the meaning of this act of Parliament, it is necessary there should be something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260138"></xptr> which manifests a serious intention to demolish and pull down the house; the words of the act are,</p>
               <p>"demolish and pull</p>
               <p>"down, or begin to demolish and pull</p>
               <p>"down, any dwelling house," and as to the meaning of the latter words, if the house was half pulled down, it would be a doubt if these words had reference to the other half: and it must be such an act as clearly manifests, that this is a damage to the house itself, to the freehold of the house, and not the breaking of the door or window; but it has been held, that the breaking of the window frames is that kind of beginning of the demolition of the house within the statute, and of that there was not a single syllable said at first. If you are clearly satisfied, that before this boy was taken away the house was began to be pulled down, you will find him guilty; if you think it went no farther than Young first described, you will acquit him.</p>

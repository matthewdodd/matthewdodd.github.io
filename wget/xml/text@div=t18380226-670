                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Basinghall-street, and am ware-house man to Mr. John Newell—he rents the house of Mr. Dawson—Mr. Thomas Hitchings's warehouseman and his family sleep in the house—he is not here—Mr. Newell rents a room and the warehouse of Mr. Hitchings—it is part of the dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Michael, Bassishaw—Mr. Dawson does not live in the house. On the afternoon of the 9th of February the prisoner Robinson came into the warehouse on tiptoe, about two o'clock—I was at the other end of the warehouse—he went to a shelf, took four pieces of striped coloured lasting, which is made of worsted cloth, put them on his shoulder, and walked out with it—I immediately ran out after him—when I got to the door, he turned round, and saw me, and threw the goods on the pave<lb></lb>ment, ten or twelve yards from the door—he ran across the street, up Guildhall-buildings, between the two chains—as I followed him, the pri<lb></lb>soner Jones interrupted me, and stopped me a little past the corner to pre<lb></lb>vent my following Robinson, who was in sight at the time—this was between thirty and forty yards from the warehouse—not in sight of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you in the habit of giving strangers your basket to carry? A. No - I did not promise to give them any thing to drink at the Hop Pole - I had not been there often before - I did not tell the prisoner I was going in there - I have not seen my husband for fifteen or eighteen months.</p>

             (police-constable T 123). I was on duty in the Edgeware-road - I saw the prosecutrix and the prisoner - she asked him for her things - I asked him if he had stolen her things - he said he had taken them, but she was willing to forgive him, and he would restore the things - she gave him into custody.</p>

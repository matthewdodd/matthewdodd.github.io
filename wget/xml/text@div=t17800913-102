               <p>I was at Chelsea on the 12th of this month; coming home, I heard some man, towards the King's road, cry out Stop thief! which proved afterwards to be Collins. I saw three men running down the field, and heard Collins cry out Stop thief! Stop thief! Stop thief! The prisoner jumped over the hedge, five or six feet behind me; as soon as he jumped over the hedge, he cried out Stop thief! then he jumped over the hedge into the other field; I pursued him, and cried out Stop thief! he jumped over two hedges; I hallooed out to the patroles to stop him; the prisoner went to the hedge by the road, seeing them all in arms, he saw he could not go that way, but must be taken; he turned on his left hand in the field where I was; I turned immediately, and kept him to my right; I hallooed to the first sentry-box for them to stop him; he jumped over a paling about four feet high, which brought him into a field of plowed ground; he made a push towards the farther part of the field, then he made towards Mr. Shakespear's timber-yard; I was not ten yards behind him when he jumped over that paling; then I said, you are as safe as a bird in a cage; for I knew he could not get from thence. I stopped to see that he should not come out of that place again; I never lost fight of him till he got over that paling. When he was taken, my master, the constable, searched him in my presence; there was nothing as I saw found upon him.</p>

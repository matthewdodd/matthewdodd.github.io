On the 26th of January I was going down into the yard, and through a window on the staircase I saw the prisoner come out of the privy—he went to his room, and I went into the privy, and saw on the seat some pieces of letters, and down the privy I saw a great number of pieces—I took them up, and took them into my own room, and was able to make out these two addresses—one of them is from Liphook, and the other is to Mr. Barclay—these are them—I went the same day to Cam<lb></lb>bridge-mews, and found Mrs. Southan lived there—I showed her the letter—I then went to Mrs. Barclay's, in Cambridge-street, and showed her this letter, and left her part of her letter—while I was putting the pieces toge<lb></lb>ther Miss Rouse was in my room, and assisted me in putting them toge<lb></lb>ther and making out the directions.</p>

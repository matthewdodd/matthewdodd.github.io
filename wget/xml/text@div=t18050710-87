             sworn. - I am an officer; on the 4th of June, the prosecutor came to me, he was intoxicated in liquor but he had recollection enough to bring me to the place where he had been; I saw the prisoner there and there was a woman in bed below stairs; I asked her what she had done with the man's watch; she said, she knew nothing about it; I searched her, and in her pocket I found a shilling; and he instantly claimed it to be part of the money he had lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I knew this man several different times; I never knew him to have a watch all the time; I have known him better than a dozen times; he told me that he belonged to Woolwich-college; when I met him I was going to buy a mackerel; he asked me to have something to drink; I told him I would not, I was in a hurry to go home; he came home with me, and then he sent for half a pint of gin; he followed me up stairs and said, I have got no more money than a shilling; I accepted the shilling; he laid down on the bed as long as he liked; he stepped out of doors for for fourteen minutes, he came in and said, young woman, I have lost a watch; I said, you are very welcome to look; I have not seen it; he went out again, and came in again and said, I have lost it but I do not know whether you are the woman that I was in company with, with that he went out; I sat on my landlady's bed and never had any notion of that man coming any more; she and I were there with the fish when Mr. Rogers came in with him; he said, search the woman; and he searched me in a most scandalous manner, and found only the one shilling that he gave me in my pocket; Mr. Rogers said, is this the bed that you have laid upon; I said no; I took Mr. Rogers up stairs; when he first came in he made an apology and said, I have only got one shilling; I will go to where I will get more money, and I will stop all night with you.</p>

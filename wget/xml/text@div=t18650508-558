                  </hi>. I live at 14, Lamb's-gardens and was a carman's driver—about 1863 I was carman to Mr. John Coles a carman, of 22, John-street, Crutched-friars—I was about two years in his service—I don't re<lb></lb>member exactly when I left—it was part of my duty to deliver goods, I have occasionally delivered sugars at Ivermee's; he keeps a grocer's shop in the Caledonian-road, Islington—they were loaves of sugar, I brought them from Brewere'-quay—I saw Phillips there when I went, and told him I wanted some loaves for Mr. Ivermee, he said, "We will attend on you directly"—he sent me upstairs and I gave the order into a little window, at least I went up to a little window where they give the orders in, I had no order, I received a cart-note with the loaves, they always send the cart-note down with the loaves, from Brewers'-quay I went to Mr. Cole's office and he wrote me out one of our cart-notes to take with me to Mr. Ivermee's, it was a similar one to this—I can't read it myself, I can't remember the quantity</p>

               <p>I took, it was a good lot, somewhere about 20 cwt.

               <p>Pentonville—I purchased sugar from Ivermee down to September, 1864; it was in loaves—I paid him 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. in August and September—that is rather above what I have been paying; I bought some at 49<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—it was the best sugar that I generally have—I was only subpoened yesterday.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the George the Fourth public-house, Montpelier-square, Brompton. On the 21st of Nov., about twelve o'clock, I closed the doors of my house, went round the skittle-ground, put out the gas, went into the cellars, and saw everything safe—I was the last who went to bed—about seven in the morning, in consequence of what my niece said, I went down stairs, and found all my spoons and things strewed about the bar-parlour—the skylight over the kitchen had the glass taken out—there was space enough to admit a man—the skittle-ground door was broken open—I missed from a cupboard, among other things, silver tea-spoons, table-spoons, some knives and forks, and eleven German metal tea-spoons—these knives and forks produced are mine, and were stolen from my house that night—I will not swear to the metal tea-spoons—I believe them to be mine.</p>

               <p>and a policeman, if he had given any money to his brother John, on Wednes<lb></lb>day last—he said he had given him none for six weeks—I found five table-knives, four forks, and eleven German silver tea-spoons, in a cupboard—he said he had had them about twelve months—I took him to the station, and there he said that he bought the knives and forks about six weeks ago, of a hawking-cutler, and the spoons he had had some time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, of 10, George Street, Com<lb></lb>mercial Road—last Thursday evening, about 7 o'clock, I had just come to shore in my boat from the other side of the water, but had not landed—the prisoner came to the shore in his boat a minute or two afterwards—he got out of his boat first—I was first sculler, and I had plied the prisoner as a fare, but he took another man—we were not <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi>, but I said, "Mr. Start, what is the reason you refused to take me, when I am first sculler? I have never done you harm, you have put many a shilling out of my pocket by refusing to take me"—he has not got a boat, he was a passenger, and was bound by Act of Parliament to take the first sculler—on my complaining to him he stabbed me in my side, near my hip—I saw something shining in his hand, which I supposed to be a knife—I said to Alexander Hughes, who was with me, "<hi rend="italic">Sandy</hi>, I am stabbed, pick me up"—I had fallen in the mud, to avoid the blow—Hughes pulled me up—the prisoner had an umbrella in his hand, which he poked at me, and told me not to follow him—I went to the lamp at the top of the street, and found that the knife had gone right through my clothes, and there was a mark on my skin—I went with a con<lb></lb>stable to the prisoner's house and locked him up—I had not applied any abuse to him coming over—I had passengers in my boat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you conversing with him in a friendly way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was on the other side of the river previous to the act being committed, but I did not see him there, because it was dark—I did not hear his voice, or speak to him, for I was not ashore—I did not call out anything—I was lying twenty or thirty feet up—a man named Biggs brought the prisoner over—I did not address Biggs on the other side—I said nothing to the prisoner till I got to this side of the water—I could not see him, and did not know he was coming over till he landed—he goes over and back every day—I do not know whether he is foreman at the place where he works—I said that he would not go over himself in my boat, and would not allow his men to go; that has been the case for about a month—I have never been fined for assaults—I was imprisoned once for seven days, for being drunk and disorderly—we watermen sometimes have altercations between ourselves—when a person comes to take a boat, we ore not all anxious to get him, we all go in our turn, the first sculler takes the first fare—you will find it in the Act—I did not say to Biggs, when he was rowing the prisoner, "You have got the start, and when I have done with this old b—I will have nothing more to do with the old sod"—there was</p>

               <p>not a saw on board my boat—I did not say to the prisoner, "I will break your jaw"—I said nothing to him—I was standing on the shore, and I went up the stairs after the assault was committed—I do not remember rowing a fare after I was stabbed—my clothes were penetrated through, and the skin was penetrated—a doctor has not seen it, but the jailor saw it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am <hi rend="italic">Jack in the Water</hi> at Ratcliff Cross Stairs—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor come over the water last Friday evening, at 7 o'clock—the prisoner landed first, and then said to Jackson, the waterman, "Now come out and punch my head"—Jackson said, "If you were a young man I would not mind doing it, but as you are an old man I will have nothing to do with it"—with that Jackson got into conversation with him, why he would not employ him to take his people over the water, and I saw Start with a knife—he opened it, and made a strike at Jackson, who fell in the mud, saying, "Sandy, I am stabbed"—it was a shut-up knife, I saw the blade—I picked Jackson up, he examined himself to see that he was stabbed, and gave the prisoner into custody, who threatened to poke Jackson's eyes out with his umbrella if he followed him—I did not hear the prosecutor threaten the prisoner, or see him hit him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were you standing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At low water mark, alongside both of them—when the prisoner called, "Now will you come and punch my head," Jackson was in his boat, but he went to him directly, close up to him, near enough to strike him, but I am confident he did not strike him—it was dark—they were talking in a very loud tone—Start is foreman of the works, and has a number of men, who go over every day—I have not heard Jackson find fault with him before for not taking his boat—I had not heard them talking on the water before Start said, "Now will you come and punch my head"—those are the first words that were spoken—Jackson's nick-name is <hi rend="italic">The Russian</hi>—I have been in trouble, but I have not been in prison for the last fifteen months—I have been in for a good many months, but it was on a false accusation.</p>

I am gaoler at the Thames Police Court—I examined Jackson's coat, waistcoat, trowsers, and shirt, and found a clean cut through the whole of them—his trowsers were cut through a little over the hip bone in front—I saw his hip, there was a slight wound, which was bleeding a little—it ran in the form of a nail, rather round—it scarcely penetrated the skin—it was rather a round wound, about a quarter of an inch in the round—there was some blood on his shirt, where the wound was—from the cuts in the clothes, I should say it was done with a very sharp instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I am going on for fourteen years old. On Tues<lb></lb>day evening, the 17th of Dec., I was returning from Hoxton Old Town, and met the prisoner at the Wool pack, in Kingsland-road Not I had not known him before, but am sure he is the person Not he said, "My lad, if you will take this note to Mr. Barker's, in the Hackney-road, I will give you a penny" Not I took the note to Mr. Barker's—the prisoner followed me—I went into Mr. Barker's shop—he walked up and down while I went</p>

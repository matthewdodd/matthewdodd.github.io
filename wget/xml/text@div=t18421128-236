                  </hi>. I am cashier to Alexander Hatfield and Co., who carry on the business of Taddy and others, in the Minories—a person who I believe to be the prisoner called on me, and produced this card—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—from receiving it, I believed he was carrying on business under the firm of Lee and Gold, in Cooper'8-row, it being in the neighbourhood of many respectable wine merchants—he ordered some cheroots and cigars about the 5th of Oct. he was supplied—the prisoner afterwards came and paid for them—on the 15th of Oct., be called as the representative still of Lee and Gold—he said he had just received an order for wine for the country by the post, and wanted 20lbs. weight of che<lb></lb>roots, and 7lbs. of tobacco—I said, "7lbs. is a quantity we cannot send out; I suppose you want it for a sample"—he said, "Yes, I do"—we were busy that evening, and did not send them—about eleven o'clock the next day the prisoner came again, and said, "You did not send those goods I ordered, but I made a mistake; it is not 7lbs., it is 14lbs. of tobacco; I will take it with me, the cheroots will do in two hours"—one of the men gave him the tobacco in my presence, believing it was for Lee and Gold, wine-merchants, Cooper row, Tower-hill—the 20lbs. of cheroots were sent, by my direction, about two hours after, with a written request that they should be paid for, having no account—in consequence of something I heard afterwards, I went to the place about twenty minutes past one o'clock—I found the 20lbs. of cheroots in the hands of a broker—the prisoner had come, on sundry occasions, as from Lee and Gold—on the 15th he came, to my certain knowdge—he said he wanted 20lbs. of cheroots for Lee and Gold—he did not say" wine-merchants"—he said the goods were to be sent to No. 14, Cooper's-row, the same as the sample—I paid the broker 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the cheroots—I believed that Lee and Gold lived in Cooper's-row—I only knew they lived there merely from the repre<lb></lb>sentation they had given with the card—I connected the prisoner with the card by his saying he wanted those cheroots and tobacco for Lee and Gold, to inclose with wine to be sent that night,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, in the service of Messrs. Hatfield and Co.—I was desired to take 20lbs. of cheroots to Lee and Gold, No. 14, Cooper's row, wine-merchants—I took them there—when I got there the counting-house was locked, and a paper in it, "Return on half on hour"—I did not find the prisoner there—I waited some time, and then a young man came—he said be bad just been and had some dinner—I showed him the goods—he said, You had no occasion to wait, you might have left them in the house"—I said, "I did not know that"—he went into the counting-house—I left the invoice—he read it, and said, "It is all right"—I said yet, but I wanted the money—he said, "Mr. Lee is out, but if you call at four o'clock he will be in, and very likely pay you"—I went again at a quarter past four, and found a broker in the house, and the cheroots in his possession.</p>

I attended with a bro<lb></lb>ker, to distrain at No. 14, Cooper's row—there was no wine in the cellars, only two empty bottles, but I found a parcel of letters from where they had been writing, to all parts of the country—I found a packet of cheroots, which the broker immediately pounced upon—the prisoner came in about four o'clock—I showed him the packets of cheroots, and said. "What about these cheroots?"</p>

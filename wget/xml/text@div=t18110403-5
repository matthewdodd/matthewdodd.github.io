            . I am a labourer. On the 28th of February, in the morning, I and Neale were employed to watch Mr. Holmes's premises; we placed ourselves in the little shop, about half after five in the morning a person came past in a direction from Mr. Fletcher's premises. There is a tree by a wall that a person could get over; I saw him go to the great barn, it was light enough, I knew him directly. I have known him between five and six years, and when he passed me I was sure it was him. When he got to the barn I saw a light in the barn. I heard him rattle the deals about as if he was picking them out. I saw him come from the barn with a light, and go to the mahogany house. I saw him come from the mahogany house to the barn; when he got to the barn the light was put out; he then took up his load, and when he passed by where I was waiting for him I opened the door and seized him by the collar; he throwed the deals and mahogany at me, and broke two or three squares of glass; the prisoner struggled very hard; I threw him down, and one of his shoes came off. He arose, collared me, and struck me; I told him I would take him, do whatever he would; he said he would lose his life before he would be taken, and I replied, I would lose my life before I would leave him. I dragged him about ten yards, he got from me and ran five or ten yards. I called out, if he did not stop I would fire; he did not stop, I fired the pistol at him, I hit him; he fell. He arose and came to me, and catched hold of the pistol. We had a struggle; I got it from him. He said, d - n your blood, I have got you, and tried to get at his right hand pocket; I said, Neale, mind, he is going to get a knife, he will stab you; I knocked him down with the pistol; he said, I did not think you would have served me so; I said, is not my life as sweet as yours. After that he was delivered to the constable. From the time that he passed me, to the time that he had the deals on his shoulder, he was never out of my sight. From his person and voice I knew him.</p>

            . On this morning, about half after five, I was along with the other witness in the little shop, for the purpose of watching.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, ever since he worked for Mr. Holmes, after he lived at Twickenham. I saw nothing till I saw the light in the barn. I heard the boards moving; I saw a person come along with the boards, and my partner seized him; it was the prisoner. As soon as he was seized he threw the deals down; they struggled; he got away, and my partner fired at him. He was afterwards delivered to my master.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The deals and mahogany are mine.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS. The prisoner was put into my custody. I found upon him a tinder box, a knife, and skeleton keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was on Mr. Holmes's premises till that morning. I never stole any thing from him in all my life. I am very sorry for being there then. That man shot me in the side and broke one of my ribs. I have suffered a great deal.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 14th of June, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was in my bed-room, which is in the pantry, and saw the prisoner come into the pantry and take my watch off the table - he walked out with it; he must have come down the area, the gate of which was open. I immediately followed him out of the pantry and collared him at the door, he immediately pulled his hand out of his right-side trowsers' pocket, with the watch in it; he began to cry, and begged to be let go - his Lordship's house is in <placeName id="t18270712-7-crimeloc48">Hanover-square</placeName>

I gave ten guineas for it; he could not see me, as my bed-room is dark - I left the pantry door open to give light. I know nothing of him, but have been informed that he is a <rs id="t18270712-7-deflabel49" type="occupation">sweep's boy</rs>

            . I am in the service of his lordship. I came down stairs and saw Walker holding the prisoner and the watch, he acknowledged to the Earl that he had taken it, and said it was his first offence, and if he would forgive him he would never do so again. I saw the watch in his possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A young woman asked me to go down the area and enquire for Mr. Johnson. I found the gate and the door open. I knocked at two rooms beside the pantry several times, but nobody answered. I did not take the watch - the gentleman said there were two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120008"></xptr>robberies done there before, and he should make me a thief, and he put it into my breast - it was not found on me, he had it in his own hand.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WALKER. He did not knock at the pantry door, but came in quite softly - I have only had the watch two months.</p>

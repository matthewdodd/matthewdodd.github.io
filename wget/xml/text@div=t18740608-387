                  </hi>. I live at 19, Sidney Street, York Road, King's Cross, and am a carman, in the employ of Mr. Frederick Roots, who is a potatoe salesman—on the 4th of May, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner stopped me at the Holborn end of Hatton Garden—I was driving a horse and van laden with bags of potatoes to the Borough Market—the prisoner asked me whether my name was Charley—I said yes—he said Mr. Roots wanted me at Farringdon Station—I pulled on one side, and put the chain on the wheel—he said he would stop and mind it if I was not too long—I went to Farringdon Station, leaving him at St. Andrew's Street with <hi rend="italic">'</hi>, the horse and van—I did not see Mr. Roots when I got to the station, and in about ten minutes I returned to the place where I had left the van—I found it gone and the prisoner too—I spoke to the police, and afterwards I saw the prisoner coming out of Fetter Lane into Holborn, leading the horse by the reins—the constable took him into custody—I did not know the prisoner at all, he was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I saw the prisoner I took the van and the horse against St. Andrew's Church, and I put the chain on the wheel there—the place I met him afterwards was not fifty yards from where I had left him—I had left him near the Holborn end of Shoe Lane, and I met him afterwards coming out of Fetter Lane into Holborn.</p>

               <p>shortly after that Hemming spoke to me, and I went with him to Fetter Lane, where we saw the prisoner going towards Holborn with the same horse and van—I went after him and stopped him in Holborn Circus—I asked him where he was <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to—he said he was going to take it back to Shoe Lane—Hemming charged him with stealing it from Shoe Lane—he said he only took it round, he was going to bring it to the same place again—I took the prisoner to the station—he was quite sober.</p>

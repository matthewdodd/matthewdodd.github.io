            . On the 21st of February, as I was returning from Chelsea, I met with two young fellows I was acquainted with; we came to the Red Lion, Piccadilly, where we staid drinking till past twelve o'clock; I was rather disguised in liquor; I went to see one of them home; he would have some liquor; that made me worse; about two o'clock I left him, and coming by Monmouth-street, I met the prisoner; she laid hold of my arm, and insisted on my going with her to a private house, but I would not consent to that; I agreed to go to any alehouse, and we accordingly went to the Two Brewers, as the watchman told me it was; I do not know; there I called for a pint of beer; I fell asleep;

             came in and waked me; I found my breeches tore a-cross the thigh, and my watch and money were gone, and the other things mentioned in the indictment; I am certain I had them when the prisoner came to me first; I had my hand in my pocket at the time, and had just looked at my watch, and it was then past two to the best of my knowledge.</p>

The prosecutor said he was robbed, his breeches were cut all to pieces; she had left the chain and seal in his pocket. The cotton handkerchief was found upon her when she was in custody; we found none of the other things.</p>

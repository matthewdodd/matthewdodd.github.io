On the 17th of February, about eight o'clock in the morning, this plane was on the work-bench; I was at breakfast in the kitchen of the house, and having lost tools twice before, I set Dugin, the labourer, to watch - I came up in about twenty minutes; the plane was then gone, and the prisoner taken to the watch-house - he had been there on the Tuesday previous, inquiring for a person who was not there; I afterwards saw the plane, and knew it; it has a brand mark on it.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was desired to watch, and about ten minutes past eight o'clock I was in a room, which commands the view of the room the plane was in; the prisoner was not employed at the house - I saw him come in, take the plane off the bench, and put it under his jacket; he went out, I followed, and saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170088"></xptr>drop it at the corner of the court - I never lost sight of him, but did not stop him till he got to Clifford's Inn; he was secured - I gave him to Lightfoot; then went and told Thomas - a young man, who was in the court, took up the plane; it was shown to Thomas, who claimed it -I saw it given to Lightfoot.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What means had you of seeing into the room? A. There are windows to the room - I was in the opposite room, and could see him perfectly well; it is an open room - there was neither door nor window between us; I have seen him before, coming to ask for a job - I cannot say how far Cranecourt is from Clifford's Inn, nor how far I was behind him - I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched from my own door, and received the prisoner in charge from Dugin, for stealing tools - the plane was brought to the watch-house - Thomas claimed it, also a scraper.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was looking for employ, and met a plasterer, who told me of a job in Crane-court; I went, saw the door wide open, and seeing nobody there, I did not wish to enter; I staid at the end of the court, and saw a boy run out with a plane under his jacket; that man followed him, he dropped it, and I dropped my tool; this man followed, and accused me of stealing the plane; at Guildhall Thomas said the tool belonged to another man.</p>

            . I am coachman to Mr. Barker, No. 15, Golden square. On the 14th of January I put the box coat inside of the carriage, and the carriage in the coach house at Mr. Bush's yard in <placeName id="t18090215-42-crimeloc227">Swallow street</placeName>

On the evening of the same day I took the prisoner on suspicion; he lodged at the public house the corner of the gateway; there is a door from the public house into the yard; he was seen in the yard that evening at eight o'clock. When I charged the constable with him, I wanted to know how he came by them good clothes he had on. The next morning we asked him to confess if he knew any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him any favour - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we cannot hear what he said - A. We found the coat at Mr. Levi's, Hemming's row, according to his direction.</p>

            . I live at No. 14, Hemming's row, I am a shop keeper. On Saturday evening the 14th of January, between seven and eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop and told me that he had got a second coachman's place, he would sell his box coat what he brought from Yorkshire; the clothes he had of me came to three pounds five shillings; I took the box coat for three pounds five shillings; the same coat I received of the prisoner was claimed by the coachman on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was distressed for want of money to buy these clothes; I asked one of the men in the yard if he would lend me two pounds; he said he had not got the money; he would lend me the coat if I would sell it, I might pay him when I liked.</p>

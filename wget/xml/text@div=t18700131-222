                  </hi>. I am a retired Custom House officer, and live at Bow—on 4th January, about 4 p.m, I was passing under a railway arch, in Addington Road, and met the prisoner; when I stepped to the left he went to the right, and struck me a blow, tore my coat open, and tried for my watch—we went up and down in the mud, struggling—I got up again and I fell on my knees—he tore my waistcoat open, and I said, "You shan't have it"—he got away, and ray gold chain was broken from the swivel, and my watch was down at my knees—a little boy picked it up and gave it to me—my nose bled, and my lips were cut by a blow on my mouth—he struck me twice.</p>

I am a foreman in the West India Docks, and live in Eagleton Road, Bow—on 4th January I saw the prisoner running towards the railway arch—he said, "Don't stop me, governor; I have not done anything"—I saw the prosecutor on the ground and the prisoner leaving him—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I work in a brick-field; the prisoner is my father. On the 8th of August, between eight and nine o'clock at night, in consequence of what my wife told me, I directly went to his house, and asked him why he called her a <hi rend="italic">bricky</hi> bl—y wh—e—he said, "You b—b—, if you <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> off I will do for you"—he directly walked into the wash-house, fetched the reaping-hook, and said, "You bl—y b—, I will cut your b—head off"—I was at his door, and still stood there, not expecting he meant such a thing—I did not</p>

               <p>notice the hook in his hand till he came to the door—I could see the wash-house door, and if I had been looking, might have seen him with the hook—when he came up to me he brought the hook, and said he would cut my head off—I put up my left arm to save the blow, and it cut my arm—I dropped my arm, and said "I am a <hi rend="italic">done</hi> man"—my mother was outside the door—I had said nothing more to him than I have mentioned—I said at the begin<lb></lb>ning of the disturbance, "Why the b—h—don't you let my old woman go along without interrupting her"—my arm bled, and I was taken to a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a neighbour of the prisoner, and was in sight of his door—he was just inside his own door—his son came up after his wife, and his mother-in-law had a few words opposite the father's door—the prosecutor's wife went away to fetch her husband, as she said, and in less than ten minutes he came up alone to his father's door—(he lives about five minutes' walk off)—the prisoner stood inside his own door, which was open—the prosecutor asked what he called his wife a * * * for—the father said, if he did not go away from his door, he would chop off his b—head—the son did not leave directly, and the father turned round, went through the house into the wash-house, and brought the reaping-hook—the son stood outside, where he was at first—he said, if he did not turn from his door, he would chop off his b—head—the son said nothing nor did anything, but put up his arm, as he was going to chop him down the face, to receive the blow, and it fell on his arm—the son said, "I am a <hi rend="italic">doner</hi> "—he bled a great deal—I went with him to the doctor's, saw his arm dressed, came home with him, and put him to bed—I stopped with him till three o'clock in the morning—he was very bad indeed—he nearly fainted at the doctor's—I was close by when the blow was struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prosecutor was brought to me about nine o'clock in the evening of the 8th of August, bleeding very ex<lb></lb>cessively—he had an extensive flesh wound in the arm, dividing all the muscles of the fore-arm, four and a half or five inches long, and cut to the bone—he felt faint from the loss of blood—I gave him something which pre<lb></lb>vented his fainting—the reaping-hook now produced would produce the wound—the point of it is broken—it was not a dangerous wound, with a healthy constitution like his.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 117, Tredegar Road, Bow, and am out of business—on the night of the 29th August, about 11.45, I was near the Royal Exchange with my wife, waiting for the Bow omnibus, I assisted my wife into the omnibus—there was a crowd trying to get in, and in order to enable my wife to get in; I held her hand, and with the other hand I held the conductor's strap, and presently I felt something resting on my arm—I looked down and saw the prisoner's hand with my watch in it—I never let go of him, and I called "Police!" and gave him into custody—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when he was going to the station he said "You have got your watch; what more do you want with me? What's the use of locking up a poor devil?"—I said "It's no thanks to you, I have got my watch," or something to that effect.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The silver watch was attached to this gold chain—the chain was not hanging down—he had the watch in his hand—I did not notice whether the prisoner had been drinking.</p>

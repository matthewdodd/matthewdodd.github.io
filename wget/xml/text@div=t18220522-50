            . I have four plates which I got from the prisoner Gibson, in Dartmouth-street, Westminster. I first saw him on the 19th of April, about half-past seven o'clock at night, standing under an archway in Dartmouth-street, with Flawn and Edwards - I asked what they were doing, they immediately got up - Gibson and Flawn ran away; they had nothing then. I suspected and watched them, and as I came up the street, about eight o'clock that evening, I saw Gibson offering these plates for sale at a shop; I went in and asked what he had in the bag, which stood by his side; he hesitated, and then said it was copper. I found it contained four copper plates of Morland's works; he said his father had sent him to sell them; that his father was a cabinet maker, and lived at No. 9, Great Compton-street - I found he did live there. I asked how his father came by the plates, he said he took them for a bad debt of one Jameson - I asked where Jameson lived; he said it was no use to look for him, he was gone to America. I took him in custody.</p>

            . I belong to the Police Vessel. Gibson was brought there on the 19th of April - I went to his father, and next morning his father came on board. I asked Gibson in his father's presence, whether the story he told the night before of his father's sending him to sell them, was true; he said No, it was not - that his father knew nothing of the transaction - that he would tell the truth; that himself and two boys, (whom he named) had got them out of a house on Thursday, where the father of one of those boys lived; they all three took them to George-street, St. Giles's that night, and next morning all three took them to Westminster, and were waiting for the money when the officer took him. I apprehended Edwards in consequence of information, and told him I took him for stealing a quantity of copper plates; he at first said he knew nothing about them, but afterwards, that he was in company with the boys when the plates were got, but he did not steal them. He was speaking of these four plates; he named Gibson as one of the two boys. He said they were taken on Thursday night to George-street, and they were all waiting at Westminster, when they saw the officer pass.</p>

               <p>MR. MATTHEWS. They are mine. The four would cost 20 l. engraving; they would now sell for 5 l. each. I do not think Gibson was ever in the house, he might have been in with Edwards.</p>

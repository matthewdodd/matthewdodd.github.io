I keep the Lord Nelson at Limehouse—the prisoner came to me on the 13th August last—he brought this advance note (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) and asked would I be kind enough to cash it for him, I said I did not care to cash notes except for people living with me, but I at last did so—I advanced him that day 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he was to call in the morning for the rest—he spoke to me about being a shipper by the <hi rend="italic">Donna Isabel</hi>, and I told him I had shipped on board <hi rend="italic">Donna Isabel</hi>—he called next day and I gave him the balance, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., after a, discount of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he came on the 13th he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> not drunk, but had been drinking, he had a friend with him—I should think he knew what he was about—he was sober on the 14th.</p>

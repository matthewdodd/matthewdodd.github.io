I was in my dining-room—she came in with a shilling, between twelve and one o'clock in the day—she put it on the table—there was no other shilling there—my housemaid afterwards came in—I did not see her do anything with the shilling, but after she had been there I noticed a shilling on the mantel-piece—that was between two and three—there was no other shilling there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother in Bell-court, just opposite the prosecutor's. I remember the night of the 27th of July—the first I saw was Beckwith, I believe—he was putting the prosecutor's arm out—I heard Mr. Meredith say, "For God's sake let the door go, let my fingers go," and I saw that his fingers were confined in with the door—the door was opened, and he was pushed out—I saw his hand drop down, and it was all blood—he said, "They are going to murder me," he ran round, and took down one of his shutters in his little flap-door, and got in—he called, "Murder" twice, and I saw him go into the parlour, and take a chair, and set it between the parlour and the shop—I did not hear Beckwith say any thing then—they were quiet for some time, and then Beckwith came to the door, and asked a man to go and fetch Roper, who came, and Beckwith said to him, "Roper, I want you, drink"—they drank together, and went into the parlour—they were there for some time—about eleven o'clock, I saw Roper and Beckwith dragging out Mr. Mere<lb></lb>dish—Roper had hold of his two shoulders, and Beckwith had hold of his feet—they brought him out quite insensible—there was a high step at the door—Beckwith never came off the step, but he dropped Mr. Meredith's feet at the time that Roper dropped his shoulders—I said to Roper, It is very cruel of you"—he said, "What is that to you? go about your business"—Mr. Foreman came up, and gave them into custody.</p>

I am a commission agent, and live at 33, Peckham Park Road—on Monday, 21st May, about 1.15, I was passing the Duke of Kent public-house, in the Old Kent Road, and saw a three horse van standing outside—some persons were standing at the door, I saw the prisoner come out, he went round by the tail board of the van, and I believe mounted the box on the right hand side, he staggered from the public-house, and I could see that he was drunk and I looked about for a constable—my impression was that two persons mounted the box with him, certainly one did—as he came from the public-house, I heard some man who was standing there say "Let the man go"—the prisoner drove off very quickly, T should say 6 or 7 miles an hour, it was a large furniture van with three horses, they were going at a trot—after passing the Lord Nelson, it slackened the pace a little, because a tram car was coming in an opposite direction—the prisoner appeared to have the command of his horses, he did not go straight along, but first on one side and then on the other, I imagine that was from his unsteadiness of driving, I followed the van as fast as I could, but did not come up till after the occurrence—it happened about one-eighth of a mile from the Duke of York—when I got up the child was being carried away.</p>

On 21st May, about 1.25, I was on duty in the Old Kent Road, there was a drunken woman lying on the footway, a crowd of about a dozen persons round her—some one cried out, and I looked across the roadway and saw the two off wheels of a furniture van go over the head of the deceased child—the prisoner was driving the van—I was standing about 4 yards from the van—it was going about 4 miles an hour, the minimum space, the horses were trotting, I followed the van and called out to the man to stop, he pulled up in about 50 yards, I came up on the near side and said "Pull up, you have killed a boy"—he said nothing, he dismounted and I handed him over to Hampshire—Mr. Haynes, a doctor, was coming along and I call his attention to the body—some of the people cried out that the prisoner was drunk, and I called the doctor's attention to him, the prisoner said nothing—there was another man on the box with him, I don't know what became of him, he was not at the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was too much engaged in attending to the child to notice the prisoner's state, he was haggard looking and very dull and heavy, but I had not sufficient time to pass an opinion whether he was sober or drunk—I told the Magistrate so—I did not see the child before it was under the wheels of the van—there were two horses and a leader in front—</p>

               <p>the driver was on a high seat, there was room for two on it—I could not say whether the van was loaded or not, it was one of those pantechnicon covered vans—where the accident occurred was at the foot of a rise to go over the canal bridge, the road previously was level, the van was just going to ascend the rise.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 535, Old Kent Road, and am in<lb></lb>dependent—I was at my window watching the crowd—I saw the child run from the crowd and when he got to the tramway he stumbled and fell in the middle of the tramway and a van drawn by three horses came up and passed over the child—the wheels of the van must have been on the tram<lb></lb>way—the child's head was cut off on one of the tram rails—the child was some 10 or 12 feet from the foremost horse where it fell—I thought the van could have been pulled up very easily before the wheels reached the child—no attempt was made to pull it up; it went on some little distance before it was stopped—my window is opposite to where the accident occurred—I saw the prisoner when he came down from the box, he looked stupid.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I watched the horses, and there was no attempt to rein them in—the off wheels went over the child—I have never driven a van—I judge that it could have been pulled up from the distance in which I have seen other horses pulled up; I have had no experience in driving horses.</p>

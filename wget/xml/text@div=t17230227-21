               Murder of her Male Instant Bastard Child, by suffocating it in a Close-stool-pan

She was indicted a second Time upon the Coroner's Inquest for the same Fact. Mrs. Grey depos'd, That as she was sitting by the Fire, the Prisoner was complaining of what great Pain she had gone through, upon which she answer'd her, that she had a great deal more to go through. To which she reply'd, That as she was sitting upon the Close-stool something stopp'd from her, that thereupon she went and found the Child in the Close-stool-pan, and the Pan was pretty full of Urine, &amp;c. She did believe the Child might be born alive; and, that the Head of it being under what was in the Pan was sufficient to suffocate it. Mrs. Glede depos'd, That she went up with Mrs. Grey, and did see the Child in the Close-stool-pan. She believes it was at its full Time; it was a fine Child, the Hands were shut when its was taken out, and there appear'd no Marks of Violence. The Child's Head lay downwards, and there was Water sufficient to strangle it. Another Evidence depos'd, She took it out of the Pan, it was at its full Growth, but she did believe it might be Still-Born. These Evidences depos'd, That they perceiving<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172302270004"></xptr> her bigger than ordinary, and often taking Physick, they us'd to tell her, they believ'd she was with Child. That she did not own it, but said, that she wore a thick Coat. The Midwife depos'd, That she being sent for, was present at the taking the Child out of the Pan, and she laid it out, and she did believe it was born alive. That there was a great deal of Soil, and enough to suffocate the Child; and it had lain there, she supposes, an Hour, and believ'd she might have taken it out. That the second Birth was with it, and she separated it from it. The Prisoner pleaded, That she was ill, and was in a Fit when she was deliver'd, and had not her Senses; and, that she had made Provision for the Child; and call'd one of the Evidences for the King to prove it; who did depose, That she had five or six Months before, seen several Things proper for a Child. That she had several Fits but a few Days before, and she was not able to help her self in an Hour's Time after.

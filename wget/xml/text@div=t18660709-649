                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. PURVIS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I am the family physician of Mr. Buchan—the morning after deceased received the injury I was called in, and I found him in a most peculiar condition, in a half conscious state—I could not rouse him or get any answers from him that day—the impression I had was that he had been drinking apparently some beer that had been drugged, and I gave a certificate to that effect—he continued under my care till the 1st of June, when he died—he did not remain unconscious the whole of that time—he became conscious the latter part of Thursday or Friday morning, and then gave me some little account of what he supposed was the state he was in—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on 2nd June—the abdominal thoracic viscera were healthy—we first of all laid open the spine, throughout the whole canal, and across the back and throat—throughout the whole of the track of the spinal marrow there was considerable effusion of blood—I should have mentioned that there were some few bruises externally, but not of any marked character—there was no injury to the bone of the skull—on taking off the skull-cap, the whole of the vessels of the brain were highly congested—on the top of the brain there was a deposit of lymph, showing that inflammatory action had set up—the vessels of the brain generally were in a congested state—the brain itself showed red spots in the substance of the brain, there was blood in the ventricles, and at the base of the brain; all the vessels were considerably congested with blood—we found a clot of blood on the right side of the neck, two of the muscles of the neck were lacerated, one completely, and the other two-thirds or three-quarters of the substance—they were muscles pro<lb></lb>ceeding from the breast-bone to the throat—they were torn—one was torn completely across—the jaw-bone was fractured completely through, to the left of the chin-bone—very great violence indeed must have been used to fracture the jaw and lacerate the muscles—I have been in court, and saw one of the witnesses describe the position in which the deceased was when he was struck an up-blow in the jaw—I should expect such a blow would produce the injuries that I saw, especially if there was a resistance at the back of the head, so as to prevent the head from going back—I think the same cause of violence would also produce the effect on the brain that I found—the cause of death was inflammation of the brain, and an effusion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186607090095"></xptr>
               <p>into the ventricles—the fracture of the jaw and the laceration of the muscles had nothing to do with the cause of death—the mischief at the brain was the cause of death—I attribute it to the inflammatory action set up, and the effusion into the ventricles—I think the blow which fractured the jaw would produce such a bruise at the brain, that as a result there would be inflammatory action set up there, which would terminate in effu<lb></lb>sion and death—I found no other cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long did you consider the effusion had been going on when you were called in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I do not think it was going on for the whole period up to the 31st May—if it had taken place immediately after the blow I should have thought he would have died long before—when I said there was effusion into the ventricles I meant an effusion of serum, not blood—there was no decided clot of blood, there was a coagulated state of the vessels—he died from in<lb></lb>flammation, inflammation of the brain, decidedly—it was very difficult for me to say how long the effusion had been going on—it had not come on until within two or three days of his death—I do not consider the in<lb></lb>flammation of the brain set up until about the Monday before he died—there were no indications of it—Monday would be the 28th—he died on 1st of June—when I was first called in I did not observe any indications of inflammatory action of the brain—the first apprehensions of it were on the Monday as he died on the Friday—I do not think inflam<lb></lb>mation of the brain consistent with a strong drinking fit, accompanied by a shaking of the body—I have frequently read of drunken people being found dead in police-cells next morning, not after an interval of days—I should not attribute that to inflammation of the brain—it is not so rapid in its course as that—I don't think that would have produced the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> appear<lb></lb>ances I saw—it might be injurious to a drunken man to be kept for two hours in a cell—I don't think it would be likely to bring on inflammation—before I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> I considered that he died from injury to the brain, followed by inflammatory action—I was aware then of the fracture of the jaw, but not that he had been hit—I assumed that he must have been hit, by the jaw being fractured—I knew the jaw was fractured on the Mon-day as he died on the Friday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first see him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The day after the alleged injury, Wednesday morning—he was then unconscious, but he became conscious on the Thursday and Friday, and on Friday he gave me an account of what he had done on the Tuesday, from the time he left home at nine in the morning up to one or two o'clock, but from that time it was a perfect blank to him—I am very much at a loss to account for the un<lb></lb>conscious state—I thought at first it was the effects of drink—I have not had much experience in drunken cases—I examined him very minutely indeed on the Wednesday, the very day I saw him; there was something in his appearance different to what I had ever seen in drunkenness, and I could not account for it—there was a greater amount of stupor than I had ever seen in drunkenness.</p>

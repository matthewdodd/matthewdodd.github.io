                  </hi>. I am a tailor. About one o'clock in the morning of 1st July I was in the New Kent-road—I met Emma Smith and two females—she came and spoke to me—I went home with her, in a turning out of the Kent-road—I remained about a quarter of an hour—I had a handkerchief in my right coat-pocket when I went in—I saw nobody but her in the house—when I came out I missed my handkerchief—no one was near me after I left her before I missed it—I went back, saw her and two other females—I asked her whether she had got my handkerchief—she denied it—I gave her into custody—I afterwards saw James Smith in custody—either he or the officer took his hat off, and I saw my handkerchief in the officer's hand—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the 50th Regiment, quartered at Parkhurst in the Isle of Wight, the regiment had recently come from New Zealand—in consequence of seeing some advertisements, or some books, I went up to London to consult Dr. Henery, at 52, Dorset-street—I saw Wray there—I asked him whether he was Dr. Henery, he said, "I am"—this was in August last year, I think about the 17th—I consulted him about some disease that I was troubled with—he gave me very little advice indeed upon the subject—he said he would forward a box of medicine to me—I asked what his charge was—he said a guinea for the advice he had given me, and ten guineas for the medicine—I asked him to send me the medicine in town to the hotel where I was staying—he said it would be much better to forward it to my address where I was living habitually, or something of. that sort—I don't recollect whether I had given him my address at that time, I think not, but I am not quite sure—I gave it him on that, and the medicine was subsequently forwarded, a day or two afterwards—I paid him in cash, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think it was—I took the medicine and sent for a further supply, I don't exactly know how often—I sent up a cheque each time—I sent six cheques—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one occa<lb></lb>sion; altogether I paid 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 85 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these cheques are drawn in the name of A. F. Henery; and they are all endorsed except one, which was made payable to bearer—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the acknowledgments I received—they are generally, "Received your enclosure with thanks, A. F. Henery," one is signed, "Pro A. F. Henery, J. Wright"—after receiving this medicine and paying this money I consulted another medical man; I ceased to have anything further from Dr. Henery—I think I sent him a cheque afterwards for some money that I owed him, but I gave no further orders—I think that was about February, it may have been January or February—I neither saw or heard anything more of the parties till July this year—this letter was then put into my hands, professedly coming from Dr. Henery—I pre<lb></lb>sume it is in his handwriting, it is signed "A. F. Henery."</p>

No. 3, private room, Bugle Hotel, Newport Dear Sir,—Experience has proved that in cases similar to what you are suffering from, a personal interview invariably leads to the advantage of the patient, I therefore have requested the bearer, a gentleman of great experience and skill, to see you as he happens to be in your neighbourhood on a profess<lb></lb>sional visit Yours truly, A. F. Henery, M. D. W. Anderson.")—I did not reply to that letter, or take any notice of it, neither did I see the man—about two months afterwards the prisoner Anderson came to the barracks—I was informed that a person wanted to see me, and I went out and found it was Anderson—he said, "I come on the part of Dr. Henery," or words to the effect—I said, "I don't wish to have anything further to do with Dr. Henery,"—he said, "Oh, but are you aware that Dr. Henery has a very heavy claim against you?"—I said, "No; I am not,"—he said, "Dr. Henery sent me down because he has a claim of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against you"—I said, it was an impossibility, he could not have such a claim—he said that he had come down in a great hurry; that Dr. Henery had only told him of this claim the night before, and asked him to come down, as he had written several letters to me, and could get no answer—I said I had not received any of the letters, if he had written them—he then went with me over to my quarters—we had some conversation on the subject, and he asked me to give him a cheque for the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I declined to do so, and as I declined giving him a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he reduced his demand to 100 guineas—he said, "You had better settle the thing; draw out a cheque for 100 guineas"—I declined that also—he asked me that five or six times at least, and pressed me very much, even when he was leaving, he said, "Oh, you had much better settle the matter; give a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and let it be over"—I said, "Who are you? You make this claim against me, and I don't even know who you are"—he said, "Oh, it does not matter who I am!"—he declined to give me his name—just before he left, he said he had come down in a great hurry, and asked me to give him some money—I think he said, "Give me a sovereign"—I said, "What for?"—he said for his expenses—I said, "Dr. Henery sent you down; I think he is the man to pay your expenses, not me"—he said, "I came away in so much hurry that really I have very little money in my pocket;" in fact, he led me to believe that be could not get out of the island if I did not give him some money—I wanted to get his name, as he had refused to give it me, and I said, "Very well, if I give you a sovereign, you must understand, I shall demand a receipt for it," and to that he consented, and he wrote the receipt in my presence—he dated it wrong although I told him the right date (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "17th November. Received on account of ex<lb></lb>penses the sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi> from Captain Clarke. H.

Sir, I regret exceedingly to have to inform you that your letter did not reach me till Saturday night, other<lb></lb>wise it would have received my immediate attention. Nevertheless, I have to remind you that you promised the gentleman who waited upon you at Park<lb></lb>hurst that you would call in Dorset-street, therefore I do not understand your giving so much trouble in the matter. I have to inform you that my claim for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is for medical advice and medicine, for spermatorrhoea, brought on by self-pollution. If you will satisfy my claim without further trouble I will give you a receipt in full of all demands, or sign any paper that you may choose to draw up, so that you shall not be troubled again by your obedt. servant, A. F. Henery. P. S.—I called at Cox and Co. 's this morning, and found you were there on Saturday, so therefore I hope this will reach you there"—That was the first time that such an insinuation as is contained there was made—I handed that letter to my legal adviser, and took no further notice—on 5th October, another letter was put into my hand by my servant; this is it—it is signed, H. Wilson—I believe it to be in the same handwriting as the receipt which Anderson signed—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Warburton's Hotel, Newport, Private sitting-room, No. 4, Oct 5. Sir. I am here expressly from London to see you, with a view to effect a settle<lb></lb>ment, if possible, of Dr. Henery's claim, and anticipating your refusal to see me in your quarters is the reason I have penned this, and would recommend you to do so at once, for rely upon it I do not intend journeying here for nothing. Your letter from your solicitor has been received, and I have that and some from yourself, with me. Now, supposing I was to inform you application would be made at the War Office, with an explanation of case, and if we were to do so you know what the consequence would be; or sup<lb></lb>posing I was to inform you I expected to be in your neighbourhood in Scot<lb></lb>land next week, and that I do not intend leaving here, in the event of your still persisting in your refusal to pay, without making known in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood for what purpose I am here. I am in no hurry, and will allow you time to reflect whether it will be better to pay Dr. Henery's legal and just claim, or submit to exposure of your filthy case. I have to inform you that I have waited upon one of the oldest solicitors in Plymouth since I saw you, with reference to a claim we had on his son; and, on explaining what we would do in the event of his not paying us, he soon saw the force of what we said, and paid us it. Now the reason I did not tell you what we in<lb></lb>tended doing in the event of your not paying when I was here before, was because you promised to call in Dorset-street, and relying upon your worked as a gentleman was the only reason I did not do so. Yours obediently, H. Wilson. P. S.—It is useless for you to pretend you are not in quarters, for I knew you to be there (and was there last night when I called) before I left London")—Some of my friends live in Scotland; my father does—I had not mentioned Scotland to either of the prisoners, but I wrote from Scotland once or twice to Dr. Henery, and one parcel of medicine was sent down</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, D</hi> 16). On 22d October, I went to 52, Dorset-street—on that day the case was to be heard at the Police-court—Anderson appeared there on that day—Henery did not—in consequence of his not appearing, au officer who accompanied me received a warrant to apprehend him—I went to the second floor front room, and saw the prisoner Henery, or Wray, in bed—I said, "Now, Henery, come, get up; this warrant is for your apprehension. You must attend the Police-court directly"—he had a pocket-handkerchief to his mouth—he said, "I can't get up, I am too ill"—I said, "That is all nonsense; I saw you out yesterday, and you must get up"—he said, "But my name is not Henery, and if the summons had been made out in the name of Wray, I should have attended"—I pulled the clothes off from him, and then saw that he had got his drawers on, and a clean dress-shirt—I said, "Come, get up now; you are well enough to come to the Police-court"—with that he got out of bed—while dressing, he said, "Why don't he pay the money? he knows he owes it"—I said, repeating his words, "He owes it?"—he answered, "Yes, Captain Clarke, and I have his handwriting to prove it"—suiting the action to the word, he went to his coat pocket, and pulled out a packet of letters in an envelope, on the outside of which was written, "Captain Clarke's letters"—he laid the letters down upon a table, and said, "It is among these documents, and I have a complete answer to the charge"—while he was dressing, I was curious</p>

               <p>enough to take up the envelope, and take out some of the papers—Henery came to me, and said, "Don't you touch my papers; put them down"—I went to a desk and opened it, and looked oyer some papers—he requested me to close the desk and not interfere with his private papers—I took him into custody—on leaving the house, Captain Clarke was outside, I then told the prisoner that was Captain Clarke—we walked on some distance, and while walking he pulled this packet of letters from his pocket, with Captain Clarke's name outside, and sorted them, and he said, "Can speak to Captain Clarke?" who-was walking behind—I said, "You may if you like"—by that time he had got a particular letter at the top—he turned short back to Captain Clarke and said, "You are Captain Clarke, I believe?"—he made no answer—Wray put his hand on the paper and said, you choose to go on with this matter you will be very sorry for it, for I have your handwriting here to prove that you acknowledge the debt, and must put up with the exposure, for I have a complete answer to the case"—shortly afterwards he said he would not forego his claim whatever's Captain Clarke might take—I have since seen some letters this morning in court which I handed to Mr. Fry—this one was the one which was nearly at bop of the packet—I believe it to be one of those I saw in that packet when ok Wray into custody—I have seen him write several times—I am tainted with his handwriting from seeing him write—to the best of my? if this document is in his handwriting, and I am almost positive it is one hose documents that he produced on that occasion—to the best of my if this other, dated 19th September, is the letter he placed his hand upon when he spoke to Captain Clarke—I saw September, but no date—I believe it to be the letter—I could not speak to this green paper—I saw a piece of writing paper of the same colour, but I could not speak to this—there was a number of them; I should say fifteen or sixteen—these are apparently copies or drafts of the letters that have been read nearly word for word.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEMP</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known Henery as living at this place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known him for the last eight years; I should say he has lived at No. 52 Dorset-street seven years—the first time I saw Anderson with Henery was somewhere about eight or ten months since—that was not in the shop; outside in Baker-street—I have never seen him in the shop, but I have seen him with Henery more or less for the last three mouths—between those periods I was in the habit of frequently seeing Henery—I have seen Anderson with him more than once, but not so much as the last three months—eight or nine months ago was the first time I saw Anderson with him, but for the last three months I have seen him with him him more frequently than before.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">on the same side</hi>) <hi rend="italic">with respect to the question of venue, urged that even if the Jury should be of opinion that the draft which had been produced was in Wray's writing, that would not bring him within the jurisdiction of this Court; the utmost it would shorn, would be an agreement within the jurisdiction that an offence should be committed by another person out of it; he further urged that a menace must imply a threat of some personal violence.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">I do not think the first letter comes within the Statute; it contains no menace or threat. A case has been shown me which occurred before my brother Talfourd</hi> (<hi rend="italic">see Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Prescott, Sessions Paper, Vol.</hi> 39, <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> 82), <hi rend="italic">in which the objection was taken that a menace must imply a threat of personal violence, and it was ruled that need not be so. "(The learned Judge having retired to consult the Recorder, proceeded), "It is unnecessary for me to express any opinion whether this is a menace within the Statute; I think it is very doubtful. I should, if necessary, rule that it was, because it has been so held before; but I cannot see any evidence here against these prisoners that they have committed any offence within the jurisdiction of this Court; that it, that they have, within this jurisdiction, sent, delivered, and uttered this letter. The important letter that was actually sent, delivered, and uttered, is that of 5th October, which was, in point of fact, sent, delivered, and uttered in Hampshire. If it had been sent by the guilty party through an innocent agent, there might have been a sending within the jurisdiction, if for instance, it had been tent by post from London; but in this case the delivery, in my opinion, was in Hampshire, therefore on this indictment the prisoners must be acquitted.</hi>

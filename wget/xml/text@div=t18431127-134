                  </hi>. On Saturday, the 28th of Oct. I saw a quantity of thrashed barley in my barn, in my farm-yard at Stanwell—one barn-door was locked and one unlocked—about four o'clock on Sunday morning the policeman called me up, and showed me the barley—it was mine—I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

About eleven o'clock on Saturday night, the 28th of Oct., I was on duty at Stanwell, and heard a conversa<lb></lb>tion with the prisoners—I hid myself in a watering-place—Groves came into the place—Wood came to him, and asked whether he was going anywhere that night—Groves said, "Yes, I want to go where we were talking about"—Wood said, "No, not to-night; I have got no tackle that will do for that"—Groves said, with an oath, "I will go and get into <hi rend="italic">old Jackey's</hi> barn; I will lay there all day, and I will get a <hi rend="italic">skin</hi> or two"—Wood said, "Do you mean a sack"—Groves said, "Yes, I will get in by day, and lay all day, and come out at night"—Wood said, "That won't do"—Groves said, "Yes, it will; I will get a sack of barley; that will be 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-piece"—Groves said, "I shall want a bit of candle and a few matches; I can get it at <hi rend="italic">old Jane's</hi> "—they went away—I followed them to Jane Sedgwick's house, watched them, and gave information to the sergeant—we watched till about three o'clock on Sunday morning—I then saw them come out—Groves went round the vil<lb></lb>lage—I followed him, and lost him—I then went with the other officer to Mr. Price's farm—it was all right—we then went to the prosecutor's, and saw the barn-door open—I saw Wood come out of the barn, and go round behind the barn—the sergeant followed him—I heard a noise, and suspected that he had run away—J went into a cart hovel, and found the two prisoners there—I called them by name—neither of them answered me—the sergeant came and took Groves—I found in Wood's pocket a piece of candle and a key—the sergeant then showed me the corn they had dropped.</p>

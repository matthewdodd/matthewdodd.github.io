                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Camberwell.

I attended the prisoner twelve or fourteen days—he had three abcesses on his right arm, attended with with a good deal of inflammation—it was necessary to reduce his system considerably—I applied a quantity of leeches—that did not reduce the abcesses, and it was necessary to reduce his system by purgatives and reduced diet—I saw him early on the morning of the 26th of Dec., and found him in a state of great excitement—he told me he was in a great deal of pain in his arm—the inflammation had then been allayed—it was the nervous</p>

               <p>system that was excited—I sent him eight pills of henbane and opium, which is a sedative, to allay the irritation—there were five grains of opium and ten grains of hyoscyamus in the eight pills—he was to take one pill three times a day—I also sent him a slight aperient saline purgative, a fourth of which he was to take three times a day—there were six ounces of it—he would take four ounces and a half a day—it contained a portion of nitre—I sent that medi<lb></lb>cine between two and three o'clock to the bakehouse where he worked, but he was out at the time—I called to see how he was about half-past four or five o'clock, at the bake-house, and asked how he was getting on—he showed me the pill-box and the empty bottle, and said, 'I have swallowed all your pills, and drunk all your physic"—I laughed at him, and thought he was joking—he showed me the empty pill-box and bottle—so large a does would act as a powerful excitement, and considerably quicken the circulation, and increase the animal vigour—it would act on the brain, I should say, to a very great extent, and produce, in would act in about half an hour after it was taken—the excitement would continue some hours—I should think he would scarcely know what he was about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I have been a chemist ten or eleven year—I have not undergone an examination at the College—it is impossible to say what effect an over-dose of medicine may have—five or six grains of opium very frequently produces great excitement—the large quantity taken would not have a narcotic effect, in my opinion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do people get killed then, by taking a large quantity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Many people can take much larger doses than others—in many instances a large dose does act on the brain.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether the prisoner was in the habit of getting drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—he did not appear to have been drinking when I saw him in the morning, nor in the afternoon—when he said he had swallowed all the pills, I told the men in the bakehouse he had done a very serious thing, and the excitement most likely produced in the system would be likely to do a serious injury to his arm; it would keep it back, increase the inflammation—an over-dose like that, in my opinion, would produce a state of frenzy—some persons who come to my shop will take ten or twelve grains of opium—it will produce a sort of intoxication—it don't produce stupefaction—if they are used to it, it acts as a stimulant—I know one person now who is prohibited taking spirits, and she takes a large quantity of lau<lb></lb>danum, and it is followed by great excitement; that is followed by imbecility, but they repeat the dose to keep it up—henbane would in a measure modify the effect of the opium, no doubt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Cold-Arbour-lane, Cam<lb></lb>berwell—the prisoner lived with me between five and six years—he was a well-conducted, orderly person during the whole time—I remember the day after Christmas-day I saw the pills and medicine in the bakehouse before he came home from the customers—he came home between three and four—I was not present at the time he took the pills, but one of the men came and told me something, in consequence of which I went to the bakehouse—I saw the prisoner there, and the empty pill-box and empty bottle—I spoke to the prisoner about them, but I cannot say he had taken them—he showed me his mouth—he had chewed the pills and the effect of it was all over his teeth and his tongue—I know he had been very ill with abscesses.</p>

               <p>how much there was—he was not working at my place, but merely showing the man the customers, as he could not work—I saw him first about half-past eight that morning—I saw him in my place about half an hour previous to his leaving the shop with bread—I saw him again about half-past eleven or twelve—he was in the shop then—I do not know what he was doing in the meantime—he staid about half an hour, and then went out with more bread—he returned about half-past three—he went out with another man to show him the cus<lb></lb>tomers—he did not take out the bread himself—I saw the pills in the bake-house about four.</p>

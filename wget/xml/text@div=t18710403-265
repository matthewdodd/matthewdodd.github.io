                  </hi>. I am mate of the <hi rend="italic">Juanpore,</hi> and I am now living at 16, York Square, Stepney—I was chief officer of the ship on 20th November—on that morning the captain and myself sent the second officer to call the prisoner into the cabin, in consequence of his showing mutinous conduct—he had been told to haul in the main brace, and he refused to do it—there was a squall—I was in my berth at the time, and I heard a disturbance on deck—the captain gave the prisoner some orders; I did not hear what they were—he repeated the orders, and the prisoner did not take any notice of them—I heard something said about irons—the captain told me, in the morning, the man had been disobedient, and had not obeyed his orders, and he was going to stand it no longer—he told me to put him in irons—the prisoner was sent for—he came down in the cabin, and the captain charged him with being mutinous on deck—the prisoner said he was not mutinous, and he would have to prove the mutiny—the captain said "I am going to put you in irons," and he told me to do so—we threw him on his back, and when he was down, I was trying to put the irons on his wrists, when I felt something sharp in my leg, above the knee—I turned round, and saw a knife in his hand—the second mate got hold of his hand, and tried to get the knife from him—I said "He has cut me above the knee"—the blood was spurting out—the carpenter came down the stairs, and put his foot on the prisoner's face, and said "Give that knife up"—the prisoner said "Don't you do anything, carpenter"—the carpenter said, again, "Give the knife up," and he gave it up—I said "Give me your hand, and put on the irons, and have done with it"—I put the irons on him, and after that he threatened the captain, and said he would have his life, if he lived 100 years, for it—it was a sheath knife, like a dagger.</p>
               <p>

Plummer gave me the knife, The second mate came to me and said 'The captain wants to speak to you in the cabin.' I went down, and he said 'What is the meaning of your giving me abusive language?' I said "I did not do any<lb></lb>thing.' He jumped up, and said 'Put him in irons.' I was determined not to be put in irons. The second mate, third mate, steward, and car<lb></lb>penter, were on the stairs. When I saw the cowardly way I was trapped, I pulled out the knife, for I was afraid it would injure me as it was not in a sheath. They were all round me, and on top of me. I could not let go of the knife, because they held my hand. I did not know any person was cut in the struggle. I did not try to cut any one of them. I was kept in irons night and day till we got to England. I have been at sea seventeen years, and never had anything against me before. I wrote to the captain, to ask him for my wages, for I wanted to procure legal advice, and he would not answer me; and then I wrote to the Sailors' Home to know if he had deposited the wages there; and then I wrote this in my defence; and this is true, just as it happened."</p>

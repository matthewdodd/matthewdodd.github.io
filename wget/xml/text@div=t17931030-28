               <p>I missed a hand saw on Tuesday the 15th of October, I used it in the morning between six and seven o'clock; I was at work at an unfinished house; I went to breakfast at eight o'clock, I came back between eight and nine, and the saw was gone; I saw it again the same morning in another house; in the same house after it was taken from the prisoner; a person asked me if I had lost a hand saw? I said yes, they said they had got the thief; I went up into a house in the same street where there was a matter of twenty carpenters, and the prisoner was with them, and there was the saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be your's? - It has got a particular mark on the side of the handle, a mark, the remains of a knot in the wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in the hands of the prisoner? - No, I did not; the person that took it from the prisoner kept it from that time to this, his name is James Pugh.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at this time? - I never see him before this time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The time that man came in he said the saw belonged to him, and he took up the saw, and beat me for the space of ten minutes and I laid down; and then he took the saw up again and beat me for the space of five minutes; I suppose he beat me for the space of a quarter of an hour in all; after I came out of the house they took and throwed me down to a pit and chucked a large bucket of water over me; then they let me go again, and they took up brick bats and knocked me down again with the brick bats, and this man came and kicked me on the stomach, and they were going to let me go, but a gentleman came up and told them not to ill treat me, and said that they would get money by prosecuting me.</p>
               <p>Court to Hoppy. Did you beat him with the saw? - I did, but not much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the others beat him? - I cannot say, some of them did but I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q Was there any gentlemen desired you not to ill treat him, but to prosecute him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they throw any water on him? - I did not see any person.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I stood at the door of the house where I was at work, and I saw this man going up the street, and I followed him along the road a good way, and I saw him come out of that house where he took the saw from, it was an unfinished house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prosecutor? - I never saw him before; I saw him going along with a bundle under his coat and followed him along the road, we thought he was a thief, we are very often robbed there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300036"></xptr>Q. Where about are these houses? - In a road almost by Mary-le-bone church. I followed him on the road a good way, and I overtook him, and asked him what he had got under his coat? he said nothing to me. I asked him to let me see it, he said no, and I took hold of his coat, and he unbuttoned his coat and takes this saw away from under his coat; I took the saw and him, and carried them into the house where we were at work; I kept him there till the man came from breakfast after eight o'clock, and then we all hallooed out if any body had lost a saw, and this here man said yes; Hoppy came then and he said it was his saw; I shewed him the saw, I have kept the saw ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man beat with the saw? - Very little, I believe not hurt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body jump upon him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he thrown into a pit? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any gentleman come to you and speak to you about him? - Yes, the gentleman for whom I worked came, and we had got the water to throw on him, and he said we had better prosecute him. He said he found this saw in the gravel, when I overtook him in the road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When that man came after me and took me, I never said that the saw was mine, I had the saw under my arm to shew it to any body; I told him I found it down among the gravel; I went and shewed him; this here man was the first that struck me, and that man was the next, after they had beat me for a quarter of an hour, one of them said d - n his eyes don't have patience to beat him with the saw, for I believe if I was you I should run it through his body, and when this gentleman came up and told them not to ill use me, they would get money for prosecuting me, they took me up directly.</p>
               <p>Court to Hoppy. Was you told you should get money for prosecuting him? - We were not.</p>

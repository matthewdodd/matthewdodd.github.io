There were a great many persons round; I understood two women had been fighting; a girl, who they called Scotchey, was laying on the pavement, quite drunk - it was dark. I saw the blow given, and Gray fall; what happened before that I do not know. The prisoner kicked at him three times while he was on the ground, but whether his feet reached him I cannot be certain - he turned over on his left side, on his hands, got up, and walked away, with his two hands on the bottom part of his stomach, in a leaning position. As he passed my window I saw him bleeding from his face - my husband asked if he was hurt; he returned no answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you see any more of him? A. Never. There had been an uproar for a considerable time before I went up; what provocation had been given I cannot tell. The prisoner certainly resembles the man who struck him, but he is a good deal altered - it was on a Sunday.</p>

            . I am house surgeon of St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought in about eleven o'clock on Monday morning, and complained of a stoppage of his urine; he said it was occasioned by a blow he had received the night before - there was every appearance of external violence. I considered him in danger; he was there till Thursday, the 21st, when he died. I opened his body, and found the urinary canal ruptured - mortification had ensued, which caused his death; there was no appearance of previous indisposition; it was certainly a recent complaint. I should suppose great violence must have caused it - there was no external wound; it might arise from a blow or kick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Falling against any very hard substance might occasion it? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was coming by when this row happened - I saw the deceased laying down, and Tutton standing over him, and while he was getting up Tutton hit him, and knocked him down again; he struck him some where about the ribs, with his fist. I saw him get up, and walk away double, and have not seen him since - his name was Thomas Gray.</p>

I was near enough to see all that passed, but not to hear. I did not see him strike or kick him as he got up. I was about three yards from him, and must have seen if he had kicked him. I only saw one blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It happened in consequence of words between the women? A. Yes. Gray spoke to Tutton first, and struck him first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young woman asked me to go and have a glass of gin; we went to the Coach and Horses, public-house - somebody went and told my wife, and she struck her. I said, "We had better go home" -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150043"></xptr>we were going home; the deceased said, "That is right, take her home, and give her a d - d good hiding."

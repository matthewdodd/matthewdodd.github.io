On 11th March I was at the Prussian Eagle—I saw the prisoner there—I went in with my mate and found another comrade, a young lad, who had a girl with him—the prisoner came up to her, and wanted to dance with her, and she would not—I went to him, and said, "If the girl does not want to dance, why don't you leave her alone?"—my mate then went to light his cigar, and the prisoner took a beer glass from the table, and hit my mate on the head with it—he fell half down to the ground—as soon as I saw that, I went home—I was followed by about twenty persons; the prisoner was at the head of them—they followed me to my boarding house, and he gave me a blow—I was then in the lower part of the house, close to the staircase; the blood flowed, and ran down my face—I was taken to the police station, and attended by a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at No. 14, Ship Alley, where Mr. Felix lodges. On the night of 11th March he came home between 10 and 11 o'clock; the prisoner came in after him, with five more, and they were down on him—I went in between them, and got him up—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner strike him a blow with his fist—I cannot say whether there was any<lb></lb>thing in his hand, but immediately he gave him the blow I saw the blood come—this was on the stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of No. 14, Ship Alley, Wellclose Square. The prosecutor lodged at my house—on 11th March I saw him come home, about 11 o'clock—we were in the back parlour, the front door was open—we heard a rush in at the door, and I and Jennings ran out—there were four or five men running in at once; Felix was in the midst of them—I asked them what they wanted in my house; there was about a dozen more coming in, and they were all at Felix—when I saw the men in such a passion about him, I told them to be quiet, and asked what was the matter—I could not get any satisfactory answer from them, and they would not keep off from the man—I tried as much as possible to take him away from them—Jennings dragged him to the stairs, and I got on the stairs to keep the men off—some of the men ran up stairs, and I prevented them from going any higher, but the prisoner jumped up behind me, and ran up the stairs, while Jennings held Felix in her arms—the prisoner gave him a push with his fist on the front part of the head, and the blood rushed out imme<lb></lb>diately—I saw no blood before the blow was struck; the police came in immediately, before the prisoner or any of the others had left—I looked the door till the policeman came; I would not let any one out, there were four<lb></lb>teen or sixteen of them all locked in—I opened the door to let the police<lb></lb>man in, and locked it again—he asked who was the man that did it; we showed him the man, and let the others go—the prisoner was given into custody—I saw the prosecutor struck before this, but I did not see any knives or any blood—I kept them off a dozen times—the last blow was the blow struck by the prisoner, and it was immediately after that blow that the blood came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say that before that blow he had had a dozen blows from others; is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when this last blow was struck he was on his back on the stairs—the men wished to go up after him, but I prevented them; they went up some of the steps, but not so as to reach him—I have seen Esther Bridgman, I saw her standing at the street door, the men were crowding between her and the prosecutor—I first saw her when I went to lock the street door—the blow the prisoner struck was on the front part of the head; he jumped up and knocked him down from the top to the bottom—I could not distinctly see where he gave him the blow, it was on the front part of the head.</p>

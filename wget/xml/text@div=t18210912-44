            . I am a fishmonger, and live in Oxford-street. I once bought some wine of Mr. 
               <persName id="t18210912-44-person415">Gordon</persName>
             I gave the prisoner the order for half a dozen of Bronti Maderia at the beginning of January - I never gave him any other order. I gave him no order in February last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. NORTON. Q. You never dealt but once with him - A. No he called several times, but I only ordered one quantity.</p>
               <p>MR. GORDON re-examined. I gave the prisoner half a dozen of Bronti Madeira - he took it to Mr. Barrett; he afterwards said Barrett wanted one dozen - which I gave him on the 27th of February to take to him, as my customer. I entered it to Mr. Barrett - I never gave him any to sell on his own account; about the 25th of July I discovered they were never delivered - it was worth 2 l. 2 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The first you sent was in January - A. Yes. I always expected him to give me the order before he took the wine. I delivered him the dozen of wine for Barrett - he never took wine out, and accounted for it afterwards. I allowed him one shilling a dozen on what he sold to his friends.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he ever give you an account where this wine was taken to - A. Never; I gave him a bill with it, debiting Mr. Barrett.</p>

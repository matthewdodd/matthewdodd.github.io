On the evening of the 27th of October the prisoner was at my shop; after she left I received information, and followed her - I found her in a street leading from her house towards the docks; I asked her what she had done with the gowns which she took away; she said she did not take any- I went with her to her house, but could not find them; I then gave charge of her - the four gowns were afterwards brought into my shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you known her before? A. Yes; she is married, and has eight children; I did not know that her husband was ill in bed - I found nothing on her, nor in the way, but it was dark, and I could not see it.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Purser's shop on the 27th of October; I heard a noise, as if some hooks were breaking - I turned, and saw the prisoner pull some gowns down behind a sheet; I saw the sleeves of the gowns - she put them into her apron; I gave an alarm; she ran out, and went towards the West India-docks - I went after her with Mr. Purser; I am certain she is the person - I had seen her in the shop two or three times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there other persons in the shop? A. Yes, about a dozen; they were not near where the prisoner was - she was near the door; she did not return into the shop, and some persons said, "That is not the woman."</p>

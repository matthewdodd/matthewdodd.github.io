            . I am in the employ of Mr. Phipps, of Newgate-street. On the 8th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening. I was in Mr. Dunnett's shop, at the corner of <placeName id="t18290611-6-crimeloc28">Paternoster-row</placeName>

I ran out, and saw the prisoner in the custody of a gentleman, charged with stealing two pairs of stockings from Mr. Dew's shop, two doors from Foster-lane; he said nothing, but tried to escape, but could not - he was taken into a shop; he put his right hand under his waistcoat, pulled down the stockings, and dropped them between his legs; I saw that, and took them up - I saw them delivered to the officer; I went into the shop, and he was given in charge.</p>

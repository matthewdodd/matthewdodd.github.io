                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, of 1, Johnson's-court, Fleet-street. I know the prisoner—he was formerly in my service, but was not at this time—I kept a variety of articles in a cash-box, which I kept in my desk in the counting-house—the desk was kept locked generally, but I am not certain that it was locked that evening—if the cash-box was locked, the key was in the lock—I saw it safe about 10 o'clock in the evening of 14th Oct. when I went away—I had a clock hanging up in my bottom workshop—I noticed it particularly that evening when I went away, having had a number of articles stolen—I left the premises, and they were locked up—no one sleeps there—I went the next morning about 9—I first missed the clock—that led me to search, and I missed some other articles—on 22nd Nov. I was going along Broad-street, Bloomsbury, and I saw a clock exposed for sale at a broker's shop—I found it was mine, the one I had lost—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am quite certain of it—I have not seen the other things.</p>

I know this clock—my master bought it on 20th Oct.—I was present—it was first brought by a man who appeared like a bricklayer's labourer—my master stopped it, and the man went away, and came back and brought the prisoner—my master asked him if it was his property—he said it was, and gave his name William Saunders, 17, Baldwin's-gardens, Holborn—my master bought it, and paid the prisoner.</p>

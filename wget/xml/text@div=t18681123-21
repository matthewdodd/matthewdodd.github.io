                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of 20, St John's Road, Shore<lb></lb>ditch—on the night of 12th November I went out, about 11.25, leaving the shop door locked—when I came back in the morning I found the police there, the place in disorder, and everything cleared away that they could lay their hands on—this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine.</p>

On the night of 12th November, about 11.45, I was on duty in St. John's Road, and saw a light over the door of No. 20—I waited a few minutes, and the prisoner came out, carry<lb></lb>ing a bag of tobacco—as soon as he saw me he dropped it, and attempted to run out at the back—I caught hold of him, and struggled some time—another constable came up, and we took him to the station—I found a key on him—there were two other men in the shop; they escaped—I afterwards found this jemmy in the back garden, and in the shop there was a bag of cigars ready to be taken away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was coming along, about 11.30, the shop door was open, I went in and asked for half an ounce of tobacco. They served me, and then asked if I would go and get a cab for them. I said I would. I got to the street door, and the policeman came and took me. I had nothing on me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He had not half an ounce of tobacco on him—there was a candle behind the counter, partly lighted—the entry had been effected by the front door, it was forced open—the key I found on the prisoner did not open it.</p>

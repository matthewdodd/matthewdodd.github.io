               <p>morning, the 17th of April, I met the prisoner at the corner of Gee's-court, Henrietta-street, and told him his mistress wanted to speak to him—he wanted to run away, but I took him by the jacket, and would not let him go—he asked what his mistress wanted—I said I believed to speak to him, and told him to come home—he said he would not, because he knew he should go to the House of Correction—I asked him if he had done any thing wrong—he said "No"—I got him as far as Regent-street, and then sent for master, who came, and X went for a policeman.</p>

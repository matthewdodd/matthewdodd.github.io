On the 27th of February, between seven and eight in the evening, there was the prisoner and one Marathy, who belonged to a boat lying by our house, they were in my house; they quarrelled with one Walker that is since dead, and fought. I received a blow on the side of my head, on which account I could not get up soon in the morning; when I came down stairs, Walker brought in the things mentioned, except the spoon and padlock, which he said he had found; the prisoner and his companion were then gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Jones. He was taken up about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have taken him up if you had not received that blow?</p>
               <p>Jones. I believe I should not.</p>

             out that day to his stand where he went a begging, and then he told me he was going to do it; and I asked him which way he would get into the place, and he said at a pannel that was opened before, which was fastened by four or six small tacks, and if he took them away, he could get in very easy; and after that, I told him he could not get in without somebody or other seeing him, and he desired me to hang a bed-gown across the line, which I did, and he put up a wooden board at the window to prevent any body seeing him that way; and he told me to go out of the place, and lock the garden gate after me, and take the key with me to prevent any body coming to see him.</p>
               <p>Was it the same garden to your house as to Blacklowe's? - Yes, I went out and staid about ten minutes; then I returned, and he was in Blacklowe's room, and he desired me to go back again, and I went away again and staid, I do not know how long exactly; but when I came back he was in our own room; and when I came in, he shewed me the money that he had taken, which was between six and seven pounds, good and bad together, and he gave me some to count, and the remainder he counted; and then we went to the pawn-broker's to release some things of mine that were in pledge.</p>
               <p>When you came back the first time, he was in Blacklowe's room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw him there, who was with him? - Nobody but himself.</p>
               <p>Who was at the window? - I saw nobody at the window but himself.</p>

               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Cox? - No, I know no such person.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Ward? - No, I know no such name; I never saw him there that day, there was nobody with him in the room, he was by himself.</p>
               <p>How came he to be discovered? - I do not know, we were taken up at Coventry, we went to Coventry that evening; he had been out of work, and we were reduced to the greatest distress in the world, and he said he must go to Coventry to get employ; he belonged to Coventry; we went to the Castle and Fleece, but the coach was gone; we went off with the Liverpool coach; the evening following we were both taken up at Coventry; I never knew that any body was privy to it besides himself and me, and he never told me any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Court to Booth. How came you to send to Coventry after these people? - They had made a very precipitate retreat, when the old man came off his post from begging; I told him those people went away in a very hasty manner; then I pursued her to her mother's, and she told me they were going to Coventry.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I lived along with this woman some time, and before my mother died, she left me some money; till I was quite worn down; I had a letter from my father to come to Coventry; and I gave her the money to get the things out of pawn; I am innocent of the robbery.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell this story that two men and you committed this robbery? - After the second examination, these two men took me down to the publick-house, and they gave me a good deal of beer; and they sent for half a sheet of paper, and they asked me if I could write; I said no; they wrote whatever they pleased, and I said I would not sign my hand to any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120131"></xptr>paper; and I believe they both signed it; and they made a mark at the bottom of it.</p>
               <p>Nightingale. I was present; it was read to him word for word.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say so in words? - I did my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My friends are all in Warwickshire; I have not a friend in London.</p>
               <p>Court to Blacklowe. Did you leave any body at home when you went out? - Nobody at all.</p>

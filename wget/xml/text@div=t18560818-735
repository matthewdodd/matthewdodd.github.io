                  </hi>. I live at No. 47, Eastcheap, and am a stationer. On 9th July, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing in front of my own house, within the door way, looking at some soldiers passing—I saw the prisoner and another man—my attention was particularly directed to the soldiers, and the prisoner and another man pushed against me—I felt my watch chain jerk—that was done by the man who got away—at the time of the jerking of the chain the prisoner was standing close by me, in front of me—I looked round and saw the other man pass something to the prisoner—I immediately collared them both—it was done so instantaneously that I was tripped up and dragged into the gutter—it appeared to me that the prisoner and the other man came up to me together—the other man placed himself before me and jerked my chain, and I found he passed some<lb></lb>thing to the prisoner—I took hold of both of them—my chain was hanging loose without my watch—I saw the other man pass the watch to the pri<lb></lb>soner, and I thought he passed it to his pocket—they tripped me up and I got in the gutter—I got assistance, and the prisoner was taken into the shop, and as he was taken into the shop he threw my watch into the path, I heard it fall—two of my assistants were taking the prisoner into the shop—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the ring was off—a ring was found in my presence next morning in the gutter, directly lacing the door—I believe it to be the ring belonging to my watch, which is worth about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a City policeman, I am not now—on 27th July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a hansom cab, No. 2320—I could not swear to the prisoner being the driver—it came out of Eastcheap into King William Street—as I was turning the corner of Fish Street Hill I saw the off shaft strike an elderly gentleman in the shoulder and knock him down, and the off wheel of a London, Brighton, and South Coast van passed over his legs—the van was coming in an opposite direction from King William Street into Eastcheap—the old gentleman was crossing from the opposite side of King William Street towards Eastcheap, coming from the boot shop in King William Street to the hat shop at the corner of Fish Street Hill—he was within about two yards of the kerb that he was coming to, when the cab caught him—it was the right-hand shaft of the cab that caught him—the cab was coming at the rate of about six miles an hour—when I saw him run over I held up my hand for the carman who was driving the van to stop—he did so—the cab drove off—I ran after it, but could not catch it, but I caught the number—the street was clear on the near side of King William Street at the time, as the traffic coming down Gracechurch Street leaves a space there for the traffic to come out of East-cheap on the near side—the cab had about thirty or forty yards clear in front of it—the deceased had passed in front of the van—the van was coming towards him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you did not see the cab until it reached the corner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till it reached the corner of Fish Street Hill—the van was not coming down hill.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 59, Richmond Road, Hackney—I have retired from business—on 27th July I was near the corner of King William Street—I saw the accident happen—a cab was driving round the corner, certainly at the rate of nearly eight miles an hour; I am quite sure of that—the accident might have been avoided if the driver had been going at a moderate pace round the corner—it is a very sharp corner, one of the most dangerous corners in the city for rapid driving—I have driven con<lb></lb>stantly on the town for seventeen years—I should not have driven round that corner at such a pace—the cab caught the deceased just below the shoulder in front.</p>

Q.</hi> Which way were you coming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From Fish Street Hill towards Gracechurch Street—I saw the cab before it came round the corner—it was in full view before it came to the corner—it was the rapid pace at which it was going that attracted my attention—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on 27th August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the deceased was brought there by the constable—he was a man aged fifty-seven, he told me, but he looked considerably older—he had a compound fracture of the left leg, for which he was treated—he subsequently died from it—he was in no imme-diate danger at first, but bad symptoms came on afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Earl Street, Old Kent Road—I was the driver of the van belonging to the Brighton and South Coast Company—I saw the shaft of the cab catch the deceased in the right shoulder—he had not passed in front of my van—he came down the side, as near as I could judge—he must have been walking at the side of my van in the street, the same way as the horses were going, not on the pavement—I thought he was trying to get in front of my horses—I was going towards Eastcheap—the cab was meeting me, and when I turned my head I saw the shaft of the cab knock him down, and before I had time to pull up my horses my near wheel went over him—I do not think he had time to get out of the way on the pavement—my van was on one side of him, and the cab on the other—I thought he was going to cross in front of my horses; he was going straight ahead—the cab caught him before he got by and knocked him down, and I had not time to pull up—I could not swear as to how the cabman was driving.</p>

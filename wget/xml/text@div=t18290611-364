On the 5th of May, about four o'clock, or a little after four in the afternoon, (I think it was on a Tuesday,) I put seven dozen pairs of shoes into a trunk; they were worth 17l. 10s.; the trunk was two feet six inches long - it was a common wooden trunk, covered with leather, such as goods are exported in, and at the bottom was printed W. A. P. and Co. No. 1, that was printed with a brush - I left that trunk in my passage about four o'clock; my outer door was open; I saw it safe after the clock struck five, missed it a few minutes before six, and a little after seven I went with the officers, Duke and Waddington, to the prisoner's house, in a place called the Hole-in-the-Wall, which is a passage near Brooke's-market, Baldwin's-gardens - he was not at home; we found there fifteen pairs of shoes, which were mine, and part of the shoes which I had lost, and which had been in that trunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Of course you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110158"></xptr>have a private mark on them? A. I have - I did not see the prisoner at home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see him, did he not tell you they had been left by a person named Burgess, for him to sell? A. He said he did not know any thing about it; that he was not there - I have no partner.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BURGESS. I am a bookbinder, and work at present with Mr. List, No. 4, Prujean-square. On Tuesday evening, the 5th of May, I saw the prisoner - I knew him before; I was sitting in the house of call, the Swan and Sugar Loaf public-house, Fetter-lane - a person came in and asked me whether I would carry a box; that person went by the name of Rushlight Tom, but I have since found his name is Thomas Gall; he asked me at first if I would earn a shilling, and said it was to carry a box for a gentleman - I immediately went out with him down to the bottom of Bartlett's-buildings, and saw Jones standing with the box; it was the best part of a quarter of a mile from Greville-street - the box was as Bird has described it; his is an accurate description, according to the best of my memory, both as to the size, appearance, and every thing: I asked Tom if that was the box, and the prisoner said Yes; I asked Jones whether it was all right, he said Yes. and told me to take it into Chancery-lane; he preceded me - I went into Cursitor-street; he was a few paces before, and went up White's-alley; I took the box to a house in Kingsbury-place, White's-alley - it was Tom's house: I suppose Tom had been walking behind me, as I did not see him till I got to the house: I took the box to the foot of the stairs, and was helped up by one of them up to the second floor - they were both there; when I got up to the second floor, the prisoner Jones paid me 5d., and stated that he would send me the remainder, which was sent; I ought to have had 7d., but 6d. came down in the course of the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the box particularly? A. I was not many minutes with it, so that I did not particularly notice it; I do not know what has become of Tom - I knew him by his frequenting a house I was obliged to wait at while out of employ, as it is a house of call; I did not know his house, but I saw him go into it, and heard afterwards that it it was his - I did not know it before; I cannot say he had not placed the trunk in the prisoner's care while he fetched me.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Hole-in-the-Wallpassage; the prisoner Jones lived at No. 1 - he occupied the house. On the Tuesday evening in question, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming through the court as I was waiting at my door - he passed close to me, and had a bundle in his arm on his hip; it was a large bundle tied up very tight, but I could see the soles of shoes through the cloth, it being tied so tight - I am in the habit of binding shoes; at seven o'clock I heard of the robbery, and gave information to Mr. Bird - I have seen Rushlight Tom at Jones' frequently; they were well acquainted - I saw Rushlight Tom at Mrs. Jones' house next morning, but the prisoner was then in custody; they were conversing together - I saw them at the window, but did not overhear any thing then; Sophia Hawkins was there: I have since seen her, and Jones' wife together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you quarrelled with Mrs. Jones? A. She brought a parcel of low game to kill me nearly - the day after the robbery; I did not strike her - I went and fetched an officer; I did not swear at the first examination that I could not form an opinion what was in the bundle.</p>

               <p>Court. How long did you stay there? - About ten or twelve minutes.</p>
               <p>Was you in bed? - No.</p>
               <p>Both the girls were with you? - Sometime; then the other girl said she would go; we were not on the bed together; after the other girl went down, this girl and I stopped about six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you lose your money before the first girl went down or after? - After, the prisoner said she found I was rather cautious of my money, and she would have me take it out and tell it; I did so, and I had two half crowns and five shillings, I put it into my hat, and I had a silver watch, which I also put into my hat; she took the watch out of the hat to see what it was o'clock, she likewise put the hat and the money behind the bed; then she flung herself back on the bed and catched the money in her hand.</p>
               <p>You had your watch again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you agree she should have the money for her good services? - No, your Honour.</p>
               <p>Did you give her any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take this money? - Yes, and catched hold of her hand, she said murder! the other girl who stood at the door came in.</p>
               <p>I suppose you was not a match for them both? - No; I let go her hand, and I saved my watch; I did not stay a great while, the girls went down first; there were a couple more people that lived in the house came up stairs and shut the door against me till they thought the two girls were got away; I got away at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was you concerned at being robbed? - No, your Honour: I am sure that girl took my money out of my hat.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never saw the man till he came into the public house, and bid a man take me; he said if I did not go he would use me ill; he could not swear to me before the Justice till he was persuaded; he said he did not know the consequence of an oath; he offered to make it up for a guinea: the prosecutor came to the bail-dock to me yesterday.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that so? - I went there and she beckoned me, I made her no offer.</p>

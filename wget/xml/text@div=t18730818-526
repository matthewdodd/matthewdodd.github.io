                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, of Flint Street, Poplar—on 5th August I was out with a young woman to whom I was engaged to be married, named Purdy—I took her home to 53, Upper Wilson Street, Poplar, about 10 o'clock—the prisoner, who was sitting on the door-step called her an improper name, and said that she stopped out till 2 o'clock in the morning—he is not related to her—I asked him what he meant by it—he rushed at me and I struck him—the young woman went into her room and on returning I got a blow from the prisoner, on my head—I can't say what with—I went to a doctor and had it dressed.</p>

               <p>—I said I had as much right to enter as he had, as I paid my rent—he called me names—my young man stood at a distance, but came forward and asked him what he meant; the prisoner rushed at him, and my young man in self-defence, struck him first—he saw me safe to my room door, which is on the ground-floor back, and as he went away the prisoner came out and struck him on the side of the head—I did not see anything in his hand—I was taking him to the doctor's, and saw Charles Little being led along by the landlady.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was pretty dark, but the lights in the street showed a light in the passage—I did not see Little there, but I heard the landlady call him—I was very much agitated and confused—a man named Sadler was not there—I can't say that the prisoner had any instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house where the prisoner lives—on 5th August, about 10 o'clook p. m., I heard scuffling at the street-door, and saw the prisoner sitting on the step—the young woman asked him to allow her to pass, but he would not—he called her a very bad name, and I called out to him to allow her to pass, as she had as much right there as he had—Sumner came in sideways and there was a scuffle—the prisoner then went into his room—Sumner went up the passage with the young woman to her door, and as he came back, the prisoner came out with this iron bolt (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) in his hand, and struck Sumner over the head with it—the young woman took him away to have his head dressed, and I called to Mr. Little, who occupied the first floor, "For God's sake, come down, Lewis is murder<lb></lb>ing a man"—Little came down—the prisoner then returned to his room<lb></lb>Little went into the street, and was returning—he had only put his foot on the door-mat, when the prisoner rushed out and struck him on the head with the bolt—Little staggered; I ran to his assistance, put my hand to his head, and it was smothered with blood—he was quite insensible—I took him to the doctor, and found Sumner there having his head dressed—Little went to Arbour Square and gave his evidence next morning—that was Tuesday—he remained in my house till Friday at 7.30, when he got worse, and I took him to the London Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—on 8th August the deceased was admitted, he had a wound on his left temple, a little larger than a shilling—he was sensible, but he could not speak, and could not use his right side so well as his left—he had compound fracture of the skull, and I complained that his friends had not brought him earlier—several pieces of bone were removed that night, next day he was much worse, and had several fits, and on Sunday, at 3 o'clock, he died from the effects of the blow—he had a hole in his brain, corresponding with the injury—this instrument would be very likely to cause the injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't think the buckle of an ordinary leather strap would do it, it would depend entirely on the weight of the metal—the walls of the temple are not exceedingly thin there—a fall against a door-post might injure the membranes of the brain—the inflammation of the braid might have been increased by his knocking about—he died of inflammation of the membranes of the brain, consequent on the injuries—if a man were to fall on this bolt, it would depend upon the part of the skull which came upon it whether it would be likely to make a jagged wound or cause splin<lb></lb>ters—if the bolt was standing up in the ground it would not matter whether the head went to it, or it to the head.</p>

I took the prisoner in his own parlour—he had barricaded the door—I asked him to open it, and he came to the door with a large poker in his hand—I told him if he struck me with the poker I should give him my staff, which I had in my hand—he then threw the poker under the bed, and put his right hand to reach a knife from the table—I said "If you take one of them I shall break your arm"—I took hold of his hand, and never let go of him—I took him to the station, went back, and found this bolt on the sideboard—Mrs. Cassleden identified it as the one the blow was struck with.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Argyle—square. On the evening of the 12th of Sept. I had been dining at home with some friends, and taken too much wine—in the course of that evening I met the prisoner, and went with her to a house of accommodation—I had my gold watch with me—I laid it on the table—after being there some time I made her a compliment—we came out together, and soon after separated—I observed her return to the house where we had been, and when I got home I recollected that I had left ray watch—I went back to the house—the prisoner and my watch were gone—this is my watch.</p>

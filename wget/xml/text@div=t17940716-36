            What was in the basket? - Abushel of wheaten flour, or better. I then went down to Mr. Hale and Mr. Findley, and Mr. Findley said he would have nothing to do with it. Mr. Hale is here; it was Mr. Hale's basket, he had called on him that afternoon for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the flour to be your's? - I only know it by the circumstance, he could not give me any satisfactory account how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that you have lost such flour? - Yes, I have lost a great deal, and I have very great reason to believe that I lost a sack one night.</p>

             passed my door, and he asked me how I did? I said I am very well in health, but I am vexed in mind; he asked me what was the matter? I told him I had bought some flour and it was not come home, and I wanted to set my spunge for bread; he said, he had got a little by him, and if it would be of any service to me I was welcome to it; I said, I did not want but little, he asked me to lend him a basket, and I lent him the basket to bring me the flour; this was between seven and eight o'clock I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. What time did you see him? - It was nine when I took him.</p>

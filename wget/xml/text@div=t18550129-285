                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of High-street, Kensington. On Satur<lb></lb>day night, 13th Jan., I went to bed between 12 and 1 o'clock—I had not got into a firm sleep when I heard a noise below, and awoke up, and saw a light coming from my door, which I had closed before; and by that light I saw a man standing at my glass—he stooped down when I rose in bed—I said, "Who are you?" and he turned his face towards me—it was the pri<lb></lb>soner, Savage—I am quite positive of him; I shall never forget him—I said, "You thief!" and rose up from my bed—he sprang out of the room, and I followed him down stairs, and heard him escape by the staircase window before I could reach him—this lantern (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was just outride my door—I went into the parlour—the window had been tried to be forced open, but they had not succeeded; they had afterwards opened it from the inside, and I found it wide open—I found both my tills open, and all the copper extracted—I missed an orange, which was in the parlour cupboard the night before—I found two pairs of boots of mine outside the parlour window—the windows were all fastened when I went to bed, except the staircase window, which had no fastening, but it was closed—I called the police—next morning I found this pair of strange boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the table—I found some green wax on a chair in the parlour, and the policeman afterwards showed me some green wax which corresponded with it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 231). At a quarter past 3 o'clock on this night, I was on duty in High-street, Kensington—I heard a call, and went to, the rear of Mr. Eltein's house—I saw another constable who I left in the rear, and I went to the front door and knocked—as soon as I got in, I saw that the back parlour window was open—I went out at the window, and saw marks of somebody sliding over the roof of one of the outhouses; the mortar was removed from the tiles—the marks went from the roof towards the Wheat Sheaf—my attention was called to a pair of Blucher boots—I afterwards saw a ladder in Mr. Jones's yard, placed in such a way as a person could get up from the Wheat Sheaf yard—I descended by it and got into the Wheat Sheaf yard, and found the prisoner Good away in a water closet there—one of his feet was covered at the bottom with black mud, and slightly scratched, as if by glass, and bleeding a little—there was glass under the window in the yard—I asked him what he did there; he said that he went there to sleep—I said, "Where are your boots?" he said, "They are over</p>

               <p>the wall in the street"—on going to the station, I said that I supposed he took his boots off that he should go up stairs the quieter—he said, "No"; and that he did not go up stairs, it was the other man—I found on him an orange, a small wax taper, and some lucifer matches (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); this taper does not correspond with the wax marks; this is a white one—here is some wax on his cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which corresponds with that found at Mr. Eltein's house—I searched the water closet, but previous to that the potman had been there and found this screwdriver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I compared with the shutters, and it corresponded—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), is a piece of the shutter which was wrenched off—there was mud on the roof and tiles cor<lb></lb>responding with the mud on Good away's feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Jones, who keeps the Wheat Sheaf. The prisoners are strangers to me—I was disturbed on this Sunday morning by a violent ringing at the bell, and came down and let the police in, who had the prisoners in custody—the house had been closed at 12 o'clock the night before—I found this screwdriver in the water closet, and gave it to my master—the ladder was removed before I saw it—a piece of glass in the kitchen window was broken.</p>

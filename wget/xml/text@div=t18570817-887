                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 428). On 30th March, I was on duty at Church End, Kingsland Road—about 4 o'clock in the afternoon I was called by a gentleman to take a man into custody for assaulting a female—I went up to the place, I found a man there, and took him—I do not know who he was—he was standing—there were a great many people round—Waggett came up to me, and said, "You have no charge against the man, and I will see you d—before you shall take him"—he then grasped hold of my stock, and stuck his knuckles into my neck with one hand, and with the other he struck me a violent blow in the stomach, and he cried out, "Rescue him!"—I had at that time hold of the man who had been given me in charge—he struck me several times, and I was not able to keep hold of the man—I have no recollection of any one striking me at the time besides Waggett—there was no other officer there at the time—Waggett made me let the man go, and he escaped—I waited till assistance came, as I was quite exhausted—three constables came, Alexander, Griswood, and Haseman—we then went to Pear Tree Court, which is about 100 yards from where I first took the man—I went there because I saw the man that had been rescued go towards Pear Tree Court—I saw Waggett there, and took him into custody for rescuing the prisoner from me—he struck me several times violently on the sides, stomach, chest, and eyes, and threw me down—I succeeded in getting him out of the court into the street, and I saw Cohen in High Street, Shoreditch—Pear Tree Court opens into High Street—there were a great many people round at that time—Cohen was standing a very short distance from the court, and I heard him cry out, "Rescue him! I never saw a man knocked about in that way; rescue him! rescue him! they are like a lot of pigs upon him"—I saw Morgan, he assisted Waggett in rescuing the first prisoner—Morgan laid hold of the man's waist, and was dragging him away—I have no recollection of seeing any other of the prisoners at Church End before that man was got away—I saw Morgan afterwards in the court, but I did not see him do anything in the court—I saw Lepine in High Street, Shoreditch, after we got out of the court—he was assisting in rescuing Waggett, whom we then had in custody—he and others came up together and rushed upon us, and tried all they could to pull him, and get him away—after we got to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> rank, Lepine took some water, and threw it over one of the constables—the cab rank is nearly 100 yards from Pear Tree Court; it is facing the Church—other constables came up and assisted me in taking Waggett to the station—Mor<lb></lb>gan, and Cohen, and Lepine, and Wright, and Ballard, and Dane were taken—I received a mark on my neck, a black eye—I was unfit for duty for nine days.</p>

I was sent for to Pear Tree Court on the afternoon of 30th March, about 4 o'clock; I went with Holtham, Griswood, and Haseman, into the court—I saw Waggett there—there was a mob outside the court, and a great many more in the court—I saw Holtham take Waggett into custody; he took hold of Waggett's collar, and Waggett resisted very much, and threw himself down—after we had got Waggett into custody, I saw the people in the court throw bricks, and tiles, and flower pots, at me and at the other officers—we succeeded in getting Waggett out of the court into High Street; I there saw Lepine, and Cohen, and Ballard—we had got Waggetts out of the court, and were taking him towards the station—I think we had got him twenty yards, it might be a little more, when I saw Cohen—I heard him say, "Come, take him away, the dogs are murdering the man; take him away from them, don't let them take him into custody"—Cohen got hold of my collar, and tried to pull me away—I tried to pull myself away from Cohen, and the mob collected, and rushed on, and I hardly know what was done—the mob was a great deal more violent after that—I used my staff several times in High Street, Shoreditch, near the Church—I found I must either let the prisoner go or use my staff—I struck Waggett with my staff—I do not know that I struck any one else—the people had hold of Waggett, and I struck them to make them let him go—I should think there were pretty well a thousand people round—I saw Lepine; he had hold of Waggett a long time—I had a great deal of trouble with him; he wanted Waggett to go away with him, and said he would take him home—Lepine threw a pail of water, and the pail and all, over me—he struck one constable in the face, and he had a black eye—much injury was done to me: I have not been able to attend to business since, I feel the blows now—I had hold of Waggett, and was in a stooping position—some</p>

               <p>one struck me behind on the small of my back—I have been in the doctor's hands ever since—I took Cohen into custody, in Old Street Road—as soon as I got assistance I put Waggett into the custody of another constable, and went and took Cohen—I should think that was 150 yards from Pear Tree Court—Cohen said he would report me if I handled him—I said that he must consider himself in my custody, and if he would walk quietly I did not wish to handle him, that I took him for inciting the mob to rescue the prisoner, and for assaulting me—he had not made any charge against me before that.</p>

About 4 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon of 30th March, some one came to the station for assistance, and in consequence I went to Pear Tree Court, Shoreditch—I helped Holtham to take a man into custody—the prisoner Morgan came up, and took hold of me by the collar, and said, "You vagabond, you shall not take him"—in consequence of that I turned, and took Morgan into custody, and handed him over to another constable, who is not here—when Waggett was taken out of the court, Wright came up; he had a stick in his hand, which he threw at me—it caught me across the face, and made my mouth bleed very much—I went to assist to get Waggett to the station, and Lepine came up—he took hold of Waggett as he was lying on the ground, and said we should not take him—I took him away from Waggett, and Lepine struck me a very violent blow on the nose with his fist, which caused me to have a black eye—he then rushed through the mob, and went to where they keep the pails to water the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> rank—he took up a pail, and threw the pail and the water—nearly all the contents went over Alexander—I stooped down, and the pail caught my hat, and knocked it off, and while I was stooping down Waggett kicked me under the jaw—it hurt me at the time, but I did not feel any effects from it afterwards—I saw Cohen there before Lepine struck me over the eye—Cohen was calling the police vagabonds</p>

I went on 30th March to Pear Tree Court—I saw Waggett taken, he was very violent—there were bricks thrown—I was hit on the head in the court—we brought Waggett by main force into the High Street—I then saw Lepine; he got hold of Waggett's legs—I told him to let him go—he said, "I sha'n't; you are not going to take him"—Waggett appeared to me almost dead by our pulling him, and the mob trying to get him. away—I was forced down towards his feet, and he kicked me twice in the groin, and once in the side—I am satisfied that they were intentional kicks—I was struck in the back—I tried to use my truncheon to get the mob away, but could not—I saw Ballard; she got hold of Waggett; she was struck by No. 230 with his truncheon on the arm—she struck me on the neck two or three times with her fist—there were two pails of water thrown almost momentarily—I did not see who threw them—I saw Cohen—I heard him say, "You vagabonds, why don't you let the man go quietly?"—I told him he would not go quietly—he said, "You scoundrels, you vagabonds!"—he told the mob to stick to him; he said, "If you will stick to me, I will stick to you"—I cannot say that I saw him do anything, for we were all knocked about in all directions—I was in the doctor's hands eleven weeks, and he recommended me to go to the hospital—I was there six weeks and one day, and I am still an out, patient—I have not been able to do duty—I am still suffering.</p>

On the afternoon of 30th March I was passing from Shore<lb></lb>ditch in the direction of the City—I was near Pear Tree Court, and saw Waggett brought out by two policemen—I should think there were from 300 to 500 people—two constables had Waggett in custody, and two more were behind, endeavouring to keep the people back that were assailing them with sticks and stones—I endeavoured to render some assistance to the police, taking hold of Waggett's arms, and I was assailed myself—I saw Dane, I believe, throw a stone, and he was taken by a constable—at Shore<lb></lb>ditch Church the mob became more violent, and increased in numbers there, and I saw the police more violently assailed with oyster shells, and one likewise took up a pail with water, and threw the pail and water at the police—at that moment I saw Cohen—he had a piece of paper in his hand, which much resembled an official envelope—it was in the shape of a long letter—he was telling the people that he would see them righted, and stand by them, and the police were butchers and cowards, and it was rascally on their part to drag a man in the way they were doing—I told him that no unnecessary violence was used by the police—I am of opinion that if they had used more they would have fared better—after that language was used by Cohen, the mob was more violent—he seemed to move his hand amongst the people—he might have said a great many more words, but not that I recollect; such as calling the police great vagabonds, and so on.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Old Street Road. On that day I was at the gateway of the King's Arms Yard—I saw the man taken by the policeman; he let him go again, and he walked away—he had two com<lb></lb>panions, and the policeman followed them behind—a gentleman pressed the policeman to go and take the man again—I saw Mr. Cohen there; I was close to him—I saw a man on the ground, and five policemen were holding him—before I got up to them I saw the staves go up and down; I was not close enough to see whether they hit him—I saw Mr. Cohen per<lb></lb>suading the police not to ill use the man; he said, "My good men, use the man gently; don't use any violence, take him along steadily"—I did not see him do anything else, no further than calling to the policemen that he would report them for striking the woman over the arm with the staff—he did not make use of the words, "Rescue! rescue!"—he did not call them rogues or vagabonds—he did not say to the mob, "If you will stick to me, I will stick to you"—I did not see him flourish a roll of paper—I was then called into the yard of the King's Arms—I came out again with Mr. War<lb></lb>den's coachman, and the mob had just passed the yard—a woman came running into the yard; it appears it was the man's wife, and the policeman knocked her backwards—Mr. Cohen said to the boys, "Stand back, boys and girls and good people, and get the woman away"—he did not say anything more.</p>

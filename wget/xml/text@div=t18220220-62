            . I live with the prosecutors. On the 15th of November, the prisoner came to the shop; I believe him to be the man - Mr. Williams and Mr. Homyer were there; he produced me a brown paper parcel, which appeared to be directed to us; he said, he was not quite clear that it was directed to the right place. I opened it, and found it contained a letter, directed to Stock, Cooper, and Watson. I opened it, and said, there was no doubt but the order was for us, and if he was going further, and would call in a short time, the parcel would be ready for him. He said, Bartlett's waggon went about twelve o'clock at night, that he was going further, and would call - I made up the order; there was thirty six yards of double twilled black sarsenet, at 7 s. 9 d. per yard, seven yards and a half of French cambric, at 14 s. per yard. I went to Mr. Taylor, and satisfied myself before I made it up - he called again that evening, and I gave him the parcel, which he took away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What day of the month was it - A. On the 15th of November, about five o'clock; he returned in three quarters of an hour. He was dressed in a dark coat - I parted with the goods, believing the order to be from Mrs. Holloway.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—on 19th May last I was living at the Criterion public-house, in Shakespeare Road, Brixton—I was the nominal landlady of the house—the prisoner and his wife lived and slept there—I have known him for years—I had lived under the same roof with him and his wife at the Victoria public-house, Hyde Park Gardens, and also at a private house at Peckham Rye—I went to the Criterion on 17th March last—up to Saturday, 19th May, there had not been any quarrel or ill feeling between us—he came down from his bedroom that day about 12.30, his wife</p>

               <p>bad come down earlier—we dined about 1 o'clock—Mrs. Henson left before dinner and went to another house that the prisoner had in the City, where she attended two or three time a week—on this Saturday morning she went out about 10 o'clock—Miss Rose, the barmaid, was present at the dinner, and the prisoner and his two children—after dinner I and Miss Rose went upstairs to attend to some household arrangements, leaving the prisoner standing in the bar—I believe there were two or three customers in the bar, but 1 did not notice—we had been upstairs about half an hour when heard the prisoner call from downstairs, I think it was for Miss Rose, I won't be sure whether it was to her or myself, I sent her down—she occupied the same bedroom with me, but we were both in the prisoner's room when he called—the prisoner then came up to his room—he said "Emma, what a time you have been"—he always called me Emma—I said something about not being long if Miss Rose had been allowed to stop—he complained of not being well, I suggested that he should lie down as I knew he was not well—he said that he had his work to do in the cellar—I advised him to put it off until after tea—I then went to my room to dress, and I believe he went downstairs—I was in my room about three-quarters of an hour, I was leaving to go downstairs and was on the landing, I had an empty jug and a candlestick in my hand—I saw the prisoner coming from his bedroom door—I said "Have you done your cellar work?"—he said "Yes," and I said "I will go down and see about the tea"—he then said he wanted to speak to me, walked into my room, and I followed him—my keys were on the dressing table, he asked me whether they were mine, I said yes—he asked if they were the keys of my cash-box—I laughed and said "I have not any money to put in a cash-box"—I took up the keys and put them in my pocket and was about to go downstairs when he took hold of me and said "I am going to kill you"—I said "Oh, no"—I did not believe that he meant what he said, I could not think it—Miss Rose came up, the door must have been dosed, because I tried to open it and could not—I found that I had received some injury, my finger was cut; I don't know that I had felt any wound, but at the same moment that I found my finger was cut, I felt something trickling from my neck—Miss Rose opened the door; I believe I was then in a stooping position, but I was able to run downstairs—I don't think he was holding me—I don't know what became of the jug and candlestick—when I got downstairs I heard the prisoner call me once or twice—I was then sitting in the bar, he was at the door at the foot of the stairs—I did not see him again until he was in custody, that was about two hours after—when he came up into his room I asked him for a holiday, as I felt tired and wearied—he said no, he could not spare me—I saw that he did not wish me to have one, and I did not press him—this was before I went into my room—I do not think I used any other words that were likely to offend him—no razor was kept in my room—this paper is the prisoner's writing—I have read it, it is true. (<hi rend="italic">The paper was as follow</hi>: "Emma Pearson and myself have been like man and wife for years; she never knew another man. I love her dearly. She is now with child by me and nearly four months gone, and I cannot face the disgrace, so have killed her and myself. J. Henson.")</p>

               <p>morning, he appeared to be vacant and strange, he had been drinking very hard for some time—he had had some trouble—on this very occasion I had been remonstrating with him about the drink—when I asked him for a holiday I said "You worry me with this drinking"—he had always shown himself very much attached to me; I am sure he never meant to hurt me, had he been in his right mind at the time he would never have hurt a hair of my head—he sometimes shaved in the middle of the day—I can't say whether he had been shaving that morning—I saw him downstairs after this occurrence, when be called out my name—I don't believe he knew what had happened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had been with him to a Special Session of the magistrates on the Wednesday, about the transfer of the license from Charlas Hoare to myself—the prisoner was sober then, but very unwell—I did not walk out with him on the Thursday—I believe he went to his house in the City—he did not go out on the Friday—he attended very little to the customers at the Criterion, he attended to the cellarwork on the Friday, there was not much to do—he was very unwell indeed on Friday; he went to bed between 7 and 8 o'clock and remained in his room till 11 or 12 o'clock on Saturday—I think he had some spirits the last thing at night—Mrs. Hen<lb></lb>son did not pass the night in the same room, because she had promised the little ones to sleep with them in the adjoining room—it was very unusual for him to go to bed at that hour, he had only done so once before since I knew him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was barmaid at the Criterion—on Saturday, 19th May, I dined with Mr. Henson, the children, and Miss Pearson—I did not notice anything particular with regard to Mr. Henson at dinner-time—he ate that meal as usual—that was about 1 o'clock—after dinner I went upstairs, leaving him in the bar—I think he served customers that day—I remained upstairs with Miss Pearson for some time—Mr. Henson called me down; he called me by my name, <hi rend="italic">Polly</hi>—at that time this paper was not on Miss Pearson's dressing-table, I can say that positively—about an hour afterwards, in consequence of what one of the children said to me, I went. upstairs; as I went up I heard screams from Miss Pearson; I had heard screams before the child spoke to me, but I thought it was the children playing—I don't remember whether Miss Pearson's bed-room door was open or shut when I got up—I saw Mr. Henson and Miss Pearson in the bedroom, near the door; she was stooping and he was standing close by her—he said "I have killed her"—she was bleeding from the neck—she went downstairs—I asked him for the razor; he had it open in his hand—he gave it to me; I afterwards gave it to Mr. Palmer, who happened to be in the house—on coming downstairs I found Miss Pearson in the parlour, sitting down—I assisted her by wrapping the wound with a hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and sent for her mother—the doctor came before the policeman Miss Pearson was taken up to her room and attended to—I afterwards found this paper in her room on the dressing-table, folded as it is now and not addressed to any one—I gave it to Mr. Price and he gave it to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Laugh borough Road, Brixton—I was called to the Criterion on Saturday, 19th May—I got there between 5 o'clock and 5.30—I noticed blood on the stairs and on the floor in the parlour—before I saw Miss Pearson I saw the prisoner lying on the stairs with a man support<lb></lb>ing him; he seemed excited and bewildered—I said "What is the matter?"—he said "Who are you, what do you want?"—I thought at the time that it was he who was wounded; I had not been told who it was—I could see by the way in which he spoke that he did not know what he was up to, or what he was doing at all—I judged that he was either drunk or stupid from some reason or other—I was then called down into the parlour, where I found Miss Pearson with her neck bleeding, and a handkerchief tied round her neck; Miss Rose was supporting her—there was a great deal of blood on her clothes and hands—I bad her taken upstairs and laid on the bed and I then examined her—I found a out on the left side of the neck, be<lb></lb>ginning near the middle line of the neck, extending forwards to about 1 1/2 inches below the ear, forward along the edge of the lower jaw near to the centre of the chin—the depth of it at the back was from) inch to 1 inch; towards the front it became gradually more superficial and was skin deep—there was another cut on the cheek extending from about the middle of the long cut—that was not, perhaps, 1/4 inch deep at the beginning, and that also became superficial just at the end—there was a very small out just over the right eyebrow; that was quite superficial; it was a clean out through the skin—the deep wound in the neck must have been inflicted with a very sharp instrument, such as a razor—it would not necessarily have been a violent cut—I don't think the two wounds could have been done by the same action of the razor—the fore and middle fingers of the right hand were cut; that might have happened in the struggle, from grasping the razor; she has the marks of the wounds now—I did not pay any atten<lb></lb>tion to the prisoner, he was in charge of the police—I saw the razor at the police-court; such wounds might be produced by it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon at Horsemonger Lane Gaol—I saw the prisoner on 22nd May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was then suffering from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens;</hi> it was a violent attack, he was very excited, talking great nonsense; he complained of loss of sleep and loss of appetite—he did not appear to me to be in a rational state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> These attacks of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> do not always result from leaving off drinking, sometimes they do—I can't say whether the excite<lb></lb>ment of such a charge as this would increase or diminish the force of the attack—if he had been in the same state on the 19th, as he was on the 22nd, I think he could have written as intelligibly as the writing on this paper; it does not look like a clear writing, what his writing may have been before I don't know, but I think it possible—it depends on the extent of the mischief, whether he had been continuing for a very long time or not.</p>

The brain would be likely to be first affected—it had not affected the body when I saw him—I should certainly think he bad not the power of self-control—<hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> is generally permanent, it is not like some cases of insanity where a man has lucid intervals—he has not lucid intervals, he is constantly insane, if you take it as such—I think he might be able to go before a bench of Magistrates and get his licence transferred, and yet be subject to <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, I do not think it incompatible—the acute symptoms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> are not always present, I think he may be competent to do a thing of that kind, which is his general business routine, and yet he may be insane on other points, that is to say the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> may affect him on other points, although not on that one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 3rd of August I was on duty, in Down-street, Piccadilly, about twenty minutes before one o'clock in the night—I was called by my brother constable for assistance—I went up, and he was ordering some prostitutes away—there were four or five in the street—the prisoner was in company with them, and said be wanted to know what the b——h—bad to do with the girls, to order them away—the constable said he Was not alluding to him, he was ordering the girls away—he then turned round and kicked him about the side of the head, and kicked him and knocked him down—I then immediately seized hold of the prisoner, and he kicked me in a brutish manner about my thighs very much, and about my legs, and afterwards knocked me down into the road—I got up as soon as I could, and pursued after him, and about three yards before I got to him I saw his hand against his breast-plate, and he said, "You b——b——, I will do for you," and no sooner was the word out of his mouth than he cut me in the eye with his breast-plate, and I became insensible—when I recovered I found myself in St. George's Hospital, with a cut over my eye—I came out of the hospital on the 18th.</p>

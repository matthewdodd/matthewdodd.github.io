                  </hi> I keep a coffee-shop at 5, Woolton Road—on 13th June, a little after one in the day, the prisoner and another man came in—one had tea and bread and butter, and the other tea, meat, greens, and potatoes—one gave me a florin, which I put in my apron pocket, and asked him whether I was to take for the two—he said, "No," and the prisoner gave me another florin—I saw it was bad, but gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change because I was alone, and put the florin in my pocket—he re<lb></lb>mained in the shop five minutes, while I went up to get my bonnet—I then looked at the other florin and found it was bad—I went to the station and gave information, and the prisoner was taken on the 15th—I had no other florins in my pocket—I marked the florins and gave them to the inspector.</p>

                  </hi> I am twelve years older and live with my mother at 13, George Street—on 15th June I was in Eleanor Road, and saw two boys sitting on the steps of the Queen Eleanor—they both called me; I took no notice, and they called me again—I went to them and the prisoner pulled some money out of his pocket and gave it to the other boy—they gave me a florin, and. told me to go to the public-house at the bottom of the street and get half an ounce of tobacco, and they would give me a halfpenny—I did so, and the young lady said that the florin was bad—Mr. Browning, who was in the shop, took me to Hackney to see if we could find the prisoner, but could not, and as we went along he met a policeman and gave me in custody—when we got to the Queen Eleanor I pointed out the prisoner and the other boy—the other boy ran away—the policeman took the prisoner and let me go.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 366.) I was on duty in Shoe-lane on the afternoon of the 14th of Jan. about half-past one, and saw the prisoner in a marine-store shop, 92, Shoe-lane, kept by one Horn—he was taking brass out of his pocket, and putting it into a scale—it was being weighed—I stopped a minute or two, thinking I should catch the receiver—after I heard the brass done rattling, I walked into the shop, and saw the prisoner there, the brass in the scale, and a man near the scale—I asked him where he brought the brass from—he said it was his own property, that he was in business for himself in Westminster—I think he said either James-street or Charles-street, No. 6—I said, "What, come all the way from Westminster, to this marine-store shop, to sell this brass!"—I took it out of the scale, and put it into a handkerchief—it weighed about 12lbs.—I took him to the station—he gave the name of Smith at the station—he said he bought the brass of Mr. Whitfield, in Fleet, street—I went up to Mr. Whitfield, and asked him if the name of Smith dealt with them, and he said, "No"—when put into the cell he said, "Here, policeman, I want to speak to you; I do work for Toy and Anson, and so does my wife, and the property is all stolen"—I then went and got the fore<lb></lb>man—I left the brass at the station—it is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Alfred Toy and Edward An<lb></lb>son—there is no other partner—they are engineers and brass-founders, at No. 28, Leicester-square—the prisoner was in their employ for about two years and a half—these things are the goods of Messrs. Toy and Anson—I saw three of them, in particular, safe on the 14th, at eleven o'clock, on the bench by my desk, at the top of the factory, in the shop where they work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you identify every one of the articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and this in particular (<hi rend="italic">a bit of brass tubing</hi>)—I saw this safe on that morning—I can swear positively all these articles belong to my masters' stock—this has no mark at all—I know it by the size—this is a 3/8 brass-tube—this is a different size—it is a 3/8 larger size—there are different sizes—I can swear to it by the quality of the metal—such articles as these might be found in any engineer's establishment—I identify these by the peculiarity of their size—they are various diameters and various thicknesses—they are diminishing sizes—some of them are marked, that is to say, they are country cast, not London manufacture—no other engineer in London gets this casting—this pattern was made by my own hands, and I know it by the peculiarity of the make—these things were in that part of the workshop nearest to the shop where the prisoner was—there were not many men working there—there might be two and himself going there occasionally—these things are given out in the bottom warehouse, and some are kept in the shop—I cannot say whether these were taken from the shop or warehouse—I had charge of them</p>

               <p>as foreman—we have, perhaps, twenty men in the shop, they had equal access to these articles in the shop, not in the warehouse—I can identify three of these articles as having been in the warehouse—I gave out two dozen articles similar to these for the men to work on—if these are not similar, they are the same—they may be the same, but I am sure these three were on the bench that morning—they were not given out.</p>

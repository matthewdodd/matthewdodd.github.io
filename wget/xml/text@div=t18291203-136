On the 7th of September the prisoner was in my service, and I sent him to receive thirteen great coats from Aaron Simmons - he did not return; I did not see him again for seventeen or eighteen days - he was then in custody: I have not been able to find the coats. The prisoner was remanded for a fortnight, and was discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to swear that from the time you sent him, you did not see him again for seventeen or eighteen days? A. I am not sure to a day: I will say fourteen days - he never came to me on the same day with a letter in his hand, crying, and stating that he had been robbed: I do not know Richard Baker - I never saw him, nor heard of him, to my knowledge; no person came with him to me that day, who found him crying in the street - I never heard of it; there was no letter produced to me - I did not see him till he was in custody; I did not try to get any money from his father to settle this - I do not know Samuel Pope; I do not really know that I was ever in a public-house called the Fountain; I have been in a public-house in Little Catherine-street, Strand, which the prisoner's father and several of his acquaintance frequent - I have seen them there; I do not think it is called the Darkee - there are a great many houses of ill-fame about it; I go there to dine sometimes, when I have been at sales - I saw the prisoner's father there - I never met him to talk on this business; I never said if he would pay me 10l. I would not prosecute - it is about three years since I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act; I was remanded for three months, but not for a fraud, I will swear- but when I was arrested and sent to prison, my friends offered what little property I had to my creditors, and they would not accept of it; my effects had produced 30l. or 40l., and as I was arrested for a mere trifle, and did not owe above 200l., my attorney advised me to take the proceeds, and support myself and family in prison; the Commissioners did not state that it was for a fraud - it was merely for appropriating this money to my own use; my attorney was Mr. Watkins - I do not know where he lives, nor where he did live; when I went into the prison I was beset by prisoners and attornies; I employed Mr. Watkins, and by his advice I appropriated the money - I never asked where Watkins lived; he was in the prison every day - I do not know his Christian name; the prisoner was eight years in my service - he will be out of his time in March: he was discharged after three examinations, and has surrendered to-day - I afterwards went before the Grand Jury, and got the bill, because the Magistrate had not investigated the case; all the examinations did not last more than three minutes, I will warrant - the first time I merely stated I sent him to receive some work, and he never returned: the Magistrate said, "Have you found it?" I said No - he said "Step down," and remanded him for a week; on the second occasion he said, "Have you found your property?" I said No - he said, "I will remand him for a fortnight;" on the third time I had not found them; he said, "I don't think you use due diligence - I must discharge the prisoner;" he was hurried out, and before I could explain he was gone - I believe he came to my house the day after he was discharged, but I was not at home; the Magistrate did not mention any thing about my taking him back; I believe I did see him the next day, in Holborn, and a person who was with him, told me he had been to my house.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What did the prisoner come to you for? A. To ask if I would take him back, or give up his indentures.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you were sent to prison for a mere trifle? A. Yes, I was arrested for 12l. 10s. - I owed about 220l.; I did not pay my creditors any thing.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live in Middlesex-street, Whitechapel - I deal in clothes; I had a shop in Monmouth-street. The prisoner came to me on the 7th of September, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, for thirteen great coats, which I delivered to him myself; they were put into a bag - I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.Have you any interest in the house the prosecutor lives in? A. Yes - it is in my name; I pay rent and taxes - he is in partnership with me; he conducts the business, and I have the profits, but his renovating business is his own - I have no connection with that; I pay him for that - I have known the prisoner from a child; I never heard any thing against him, except some nonsensical things of his master.</p>
               <p>HENRY LEVY. I live in Petticoat-lane. I know the prisoner; I met him on the 7th of September, near Pickett-street, St. Clement's, with a bag on his shoulder, which was a little broken, and I saw the appearance of part of a coat - this was between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that as he was going through Sun-street he stopped to rest his bag, when a gentleman, in appearance, offered him a shilling to take a note to Mr. Brooks, Peter-street, Sun-street; he left the bag with him, and on finding Brooks did not live there, he returned, and the bag and man were gone - that he met one Baker, who accom<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030051"></xptr>panied him to his master, and informed him of his less - that he replied if he did not produce the bag he should give him in charge; he was alarmed, and went to Birmingham to enlist as a soldier, but was advised there to surrender to his master; which he did, and was apprehended.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner two years; I saw him on the Monday of Bartholomew-fair, about half-past eleven o'clock - he appeared in great distress, and was crying very much; in consequence of what he told me, I went to a clothes shop in St. John-street, which he said was his master's - I saw the prosecutor there; the prisoner said that was his master - he told him, in my presence, that he had lost his clothes, bag and all; that he had gone somewhere with a letter for a gentleman, and left the things with him - his master said he would stand no such nonsense, and that if he did not go back and fetch the clothes or the man, he would send him to Newgate, and have him tried for his life; I went back with the poor boy, down Sun-street, Bishopsgate, and down a long court, where the women sit with fish - we inquired about every where; he gave me a description of the man, but we could find no such person, nor the things - he had a letter directed to Mr. Brooks, which he gave into his master's hands before my face, saying that was the letter the gentleman had given him.</p>

             Angel-court, Strand; I have been in his service rather better than nine years. On the 7th of September, I was going to Goulston-street, Whitechapel, for him to draw a bill; I know it was on a Monday, in Bartholomew-fair - it was about half-past eleven o'clock, or it might be rather latter; I did not know about the prisoner being taken up - I heard he had been before a Magistrate; I dare say that is five weeks ago - I heard it in the tap-room of the Fountain; the prisoner's father was not the person who told me - I never heard it from his mouth, for he and I are not friends; I never speak to him - he subpoenaed me three days ago to come here; I never went before the Magistrate - I did not hear of this before the end of September; it might be a month or five weeks ago - upon my oath I saw the prosecutor before I served him with this notice to produce the letter (looking at it) I do not know who served this other notice - I cannot say but what I might serve it; I served only one, which I received from the prisoner's father.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean you do not know whether it was this notice or the other? A. I think it was the other; I cannot read or write very well - I wrote my name on a copy of it, which I kept.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Have you got the copy? A. No; I received the notice from the prisoner's father, in Russell-street, near Bow-street - he said, "I want you to go and serve this notice;" I said, "What notice;" he said "A notice of trial;" we had not been very bad friends, but were not good friends - I was at the Fountain this morning with Mr. Pope; I do not know that I know Sergeant's-inn, in Chancery-lane - I never was bail for any body in my life; I do not know when I was at the prisoner's father's last - it may be a month or six weeks ago; I swear I have not been fifty times, nor twenty times, nor three times within the last two months - I am not regularly in Mr. Tucker's employ; I sit to be employed - he puts me in possession, and to do other jobs; no person was with me when I saw the prisoner - I was coming along Sun-street, and I met him; I saw no one but the prosecutor when I went to the shop, in St. John-street - it is two doors from the corner of a street there; I never went to him to complain of his having prosecuted the boy - he was a stranger to me; I do not know that I ever saw him twice before - I did not know before that the prisoner was in his service; when he had explained this to his master, we went away together, to where old Bethlehem was; I went on with him, till I told him I could not wait any longer - I did not see a person that day of the name of

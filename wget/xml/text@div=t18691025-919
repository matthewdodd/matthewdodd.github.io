On the 18th October I and other women were at work in a field on the Cold Harbour Farm, occupied by Mr. Newman—between I and 2 o'clock I saw the prisoner Holden come into the field, from a lane—we spoke to him, when he said, "Don't you women hurt yourselves"—we told him that we thought a day's work would do him good, to which he made no reply—he was close to the stacks of wheat—he went to take some potatoes from a basket, and we told him to put them down, and he did so, and passed on towards the ricks—about three minutes after we lost sight of him—I looked round, and saw a man running, without his hat—it was one of Mr. Newman's men, who was going to give an alarm—I saw that the first of the wheat ricks was in flames, and was blazing up—the wind was blowing the flames towards the other ricks—three wheat ricks were destroyed—Holden was brought back to the fire, in custody, when he said he would rather be in prison than not, walking about with nothing to eat—I never saw the other prisoner there at all.</p>

I was in a meadow, alongside some water, on Mr. Newman's farm, on the afternoon of the 8th October, and about 200 yards from the ricks—I saw the prisoner Holden run across the meadow, and make towards the water, in a direction away from the ricks—he passed on to the side of the water, and after running a little further he slipped in—I did not see him again till the policeman brought him back to the ricks—when the man was by the side of the water, I turned towards the ricks, and saw they were in a blaze—I did not see Whitehead at all that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse-boy to Charles Thomp<lb></lb>son, a pawnbroker, of Bath-street, Clerkenwell; he has one partner; he has a warehouse in Eyre-court; that is not a thoroughfare, but there are some houses in it—I know Green; he lives with his father, next door to the warehouse. On Sunday night, 2nd March, I was going to the warehouse about five minutes past ten o'clock—at the end of the court I saw Green's little brother; he called out—the prisoner could hear him—he said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Fred!</hi>" and then whistled—when I got up the court I saw Sharp getting out of the ware-house window; Green was helping him out—Sharp jumped over the wall leading to the next court—Green went behind a door—I took hold of him, he said, "Don't, <hi rend="italic">Torn,</hi> it is not me"—his father came out, took him from me, and said, "It was not him; it was another boy, who has just run away"—the policeman came up, and he looked all over Green's father's house, but could not find anything—we then went into the warehouse, and found the iron bar had been moved, which was against the window—I had seen it safe on Saturday night—no one could have got in while the bar was there without forcing it—it was necessary to open the window to move the bar—no one goes there on Sunday—some merinos, some Orleans cloth, a pair of boots, and a piece of cotton, of my master's, had been removed—they were found in a water-butt in the court—they were safe in the warehouse on Saturday night—these are them—some images on a shelf just before the window had been turned on one side, and knocked down.</p>

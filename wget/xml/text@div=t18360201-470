                  </hi>. I was servant to Mrs. Smith, of Crutchett-place, New North-road, Islington. When I am out of place I go to an apart<lb></lb>ment, in Whitmore-building. On the 15th of January, I desired Bolton to take my boxes there—I found them in the apartment—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in the kitchen there—I knew he before—she went to a situation the same evening—about an hour after she was gone I examined my boxes, and missed these articles from my bonnet-box—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to the policeman—on the Monday morning I found she had got into service, No. 23, Crutchett-place—the officer went there—he told her I had lost some things—I do not recollect what he said—her box was searched in the kitchen, and the roll of riband was found in it—she said it did not belong to me—the officer looked into the bedstead in the kitchen and found this collar there—she said did not bring it there—she was taken to the station—I had seen these things on the same day—they were gone in the evening—I never lent any of them to her—I only knew her a week at a time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hoxton Old Town. I took the trunk and two bonnet-boxes to the prosecutrix's lodging—when I arrived I saw the prisoner, and gave her the two bonnet-boxes, which she deposited in the front parlour; the trunk I placed there myself—it was just six o'clock in the evening on Friday, the 15th—I went to the station-house with the prosecutrix and officer.</p>

We were in the habit of lending each other things—she lent me this collar—I lent her two pocket-handkerchiefs—she gave me two yards and a quarter of riband, for a cap string; and she said, when she could pay me the two shillings and sixpence I lent her, she would take one shilling for the riband—on the Monday morning she brought the officer and took me.</p>

I slept in the same room with her—she complain<lb></lb>ed that she had lost half-a-crown; but she did not lend it me—I never lent her this collar, or any thing; but my umbrella—I found my boxes opened when she was gone, and I thought the she had got my things—I never said any thing about letting her have the riband—I knew her a week at a time in the lodging that I lodged at.</p>

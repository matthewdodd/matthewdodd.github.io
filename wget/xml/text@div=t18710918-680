                  </hi>. I am a stationer, in Carey Street, Chancery Lane—on the evening of 4th August, I locked the shop up as usual—I left the stamp-drawer locked in the usual way, leaving a quantity of stamps in it—I went to the shop about 9.55 the next morning, and found it had been broken into—every lock in the place had been broken or forced, and a quantity of stamps were stolen—I have not seen any of the property since, except some stamps which were shown to me at the Police Court, three or four days afterwards—they are Common Law stamps, and I identify them by being kept in twos and ones—there are nine one shilling Common Law stamp here, which I can swear to positively—they were kept in twos and ones in a small division—this I identify by being stuck to another one—there are four ten shilling stamps—I identify them by being kept in threes and twos, and also by the colour—the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. are very much in use; the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. are not so common, and they have been much longer in stock, and I recognize them by the colour—I identify these two five shilling stamps by being together, and the general appearance, and being turned down at the corner—I turned them down myself—I have examined them all before—these are shilling Chancery Fee Fund stamps—I also identified them by being turned down at the corner—noone else touches the stamps but me—I identify these eighteen penny Common Law stamps by the colour, and general appearance—I saw them all safe on the night of Friday, 4th August—they were stolen between 7 o'clock in the evening and 9.55 on the morning of the 5th—I lost between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, besides some knives and purses—I have not the slightest doubt that these are my stamps.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sell a great many stamps in the course of the day—sometimes I sell 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth in a week—there are four others who sell the same kind of stamps—I said, before the Magistrate, "You might purchase two stamps similar to these in Chancery Lane, and they might be together"—they are generally kept singly—there are not above four shops where they sell these stamps—I have made inquiries, and they have not lost any—have recovered about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, and I lost between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I had not sold many the week previous, because it was verging on the vacation—I have not seen any of the knives or purses since—they were worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the value of the property stolen was between 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Common Law Stamps, two for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., two for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and four for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "Is that all you have got?—he said "On my honour, it is"—I asked him where he got them from—he said that they were sent to him by the son of a miller, in Norfolk, in part payment of a debt of 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him it was very unsatisfactory, and he would have to go with me to Bow Street police-station—I took him, along with another constable, named Partridge—in Vinegar Yard, on the way to the station, I saw him withdraw his left hand from his trowsers pocket, and he rushed away from us, towards the urinal—I said "Tom, he has thrown something away, in my opinion; he has nothing in his hand now, and he had something"—we ran after him—he ran nothing Old Jewry public-house—I caught him, and took him to the station—I saw Hines at the station, and told him I had reason to believe that the prisoner had thrown something away, "Run back, and see what it is"—he went back—I searched the prisoner's house, and found some skeleton keys.</p>

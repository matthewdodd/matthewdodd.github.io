                  </hi>. I live at 6, North-street, Whitechapel, and am a carman—on Monday, 4th April, I went to bed between 11 and 12, I bolted the doors as usual—the back door was closed and bolted, but the window I am not cer<lb></lb>tain about—it was closed, but it may not have been fastened—my property was all safe—at 4 o'clock on the next morning the policeman called me and told me the door was open—I went down and found the street door open, came up again and found the first floor back window also open—I came down again, called the policeman, and we both went up stairs together, looked out at the window, and found a ladder outside on the wall—we then went down into the shop and I missed the clock and several pounds of tea and sweet, a pair of small scales, and a weight—they had all been safe the night before—I next saw some of them at the station on the same morning—I knew the prisoner</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 231). On Tuesday morning, 5th April, I was on duty in Little North-street, Whitechapel, about a quarter to 2—I saw the prisoner and another man, not in custody—the prisoner was carry<lb></lb>ing a bundle—I stood at the corner of a court—the prisoner dropped back against the wall, the other man passed me—I went after the prisoner; he went down a very dark court which leads into the Whitechapel-road—I went through the court and saw a bundle lying close to a public-house door—I then saw the prisoner creeping along by the shops—I went after him, and brought him back to the bundle—I asked him what he had in his bundle—he said, "A clock"—I asked him where he got it from—he said a man had given it him to carry through the court—he was eating something, and I asked him what he had there—he said a few sweets the man had given him who gave him the clock—I found a lot more sweets on him at the station—on the way there he dropped some tea for about 100 yards—I also found a pair of scales, a weight, and a knife on him, where I first saw him was about fifty yards from the prosecutor's house, I suppose.</p>

He said, "Will you carry this clock for me?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Will you have a few sweets?" I said, "I don't mind," and he gave me some. He said, "Put the clock down at the bottom of the court, and I will come down and fetch it" I did so, and the policeman took me into custody.</p>

               <p>Mr. Disney thus depos'd. On Saturday the 13th of August, I was sent for to visit the Deceas'd. He was lying upon his Bed, and complaining of a Cold that he got by crossing the Water, in his Return from Dr. Lloyd's Feast, that he had had a Pain in his Head, Back, and Limbs, and had since been taken with a Purging two or three Times a Day, which had partly remov'd his Pains. I advis'd him to Rhubarh to take off the Purging; and on Monday following I saw him again, and he was them pretty easy, and she Purging gone. - He sent for me again about 10 the same Night, and ask'd me if he might venture to go to Knights-Bridge next Morning, I advis'd him to stay a little longer, for I found him in a breathing Sweat, and a declining Feaver, which I thought would prove intermiring. I administred a proper Draught, and he was easier next Day, being Tuesday; but about 4 in the Afternoon his Feaver return'd, which left him in a breathing Sweat as before. About 10 at Night his Servant came to me, with a Vial of Liquid, which he said was sent to his Master by Mr. Godfrey, the Chymist, with Orders to take about half a Pint at Night, and as much in the Morning. I took it to be an Emulsion made with Orange-Flower Water, &amp;c. and told the Servant that if Mr. Godfrey sent it, his Master might take it safely. - I went to visit the Deceas'd next Morning, and understood that he had taken thrice of that Emulsion, about a quarter of a Pint each Time. I found him very faint, and he told me that he had above 40Sou the preceeding Night, and was extreamly grip'd and crampt. I went to Mr.

             to know what it was that he had sent to the Deceas'd, Mr. Godfrey appear'd very much surpriz'd, and assur'd me that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172608310006"></xptr> had not sent any Thing. - I gave the Deceas'd Rhubarb, Diascordium, and a Cordial I Draught, he sometimes grew worse, and sometimes mended a little, till the Sunday following, and then he voided Blood, and dyed on the succeeding Wednesday Morning. I saw him when he was open'd. I could discover no Symptom of Poison in his Stomach, it was indeed a little enflamed, but no more than what commonly happens from a violent Dysentery or Diarrhaea. The Guts were lined with Blood, I did not observe an Excoriation, for I did not see the Blood taken out; But However that Emulsion, might possibly be the cause of his Death, for though I am satisfied that there was nothing Poisonous put into it, yet there might be something which might throw him into that violent Laxity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Belcher the Apothecary thus depos'd. I open'd the Stomach of the Deceas'd, and found no Inflamation till I came to the Duodenum, which was a little enflam'd. The great Guts were fill'd with Blood and Excrement, and bylous Juices, as is usual in Dysentries which ensue Diarrheas. I saw not the least Sympton of Poison, and verily believe that he dy'd a natural Death; I tasted some of the Emulsion that was left, it was grown a little Acid with keeping. I could not discover, that there was any thing Poisonous, or Hurtful, but I took it to be a Cooling Innocent Draught, made of Almonds, Barly-water, Orange Flower-water, Sugar, and some other harmless Ingredients. - I advis'd them to make some tryal of its Effect, upon a Puppy, or a Kitling, but they said, there was not enough left, to make the Experiment. - I cannot think that it was the Cause of the Deceaseds Death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Godfrey the Chymist depos'd. That he knew nothing of sending that Emulsion to the Deceas'd, but he had try'd several Chymical Experiments upon what was left of it, and could not find, that it was in the least Poisonous, Purgative, or any way Hurtfull.</p>
               <p>Dr. Hollings depos'd. That he believ'd the Potion was not Poisonous, and it might be a natural violent Looseness, that put an End to the Life of the Deceas'd.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith thus depos'd. I live at the Bedford Coffee-House, on Monday Evening, the Prisoner with an elderly Gentlewoman and a Girl, came thither. and had a Pint of Attack made into Punch, after which, they desir'd something Cool, I brought her a Drink, which we call Oziat, which they drank, and the Prisoner liked it so well, that she took a Pint away with her, for which she paid a Shilling.</p>

             the Prisoners Cook maid thus depos'd. On Tuesday Night, as I was sitting by the Fire, my Mistress call'd me to her, and said, Mary, I'll trust no body but you, I was last Night at the Bedford Coffee house, where I drank some pleasant Cool Liquor, and I brought this Pint home with me. Mr. Shovat at next Door. is ill of a Feaver, and I believe it will do him good, and therefore I'd have you carry it to him, - hold the Bottle by the Neck, that your Hands may heat it, as little as possible. - I was going with it, when bethinking my self, Pray Madam says I, if they should ask who sent it, what shall I say - Why tell them says my Mistress, that you brought it from Mr. Godfrey, and that Mr. Shovat must drink half a Pint to Night, and the rest in the Morning. So I carried it, and the next Day Mr. Godfrey came to our House very angry, and asked who it was, that carried any thing in his Name, to Mr. Shovat's, I told him that I had, and (as my Mistress had Instructed me;) that I had it from a Gentleman in Black, who came to our House, and whom I have seen several times is Mr. Shovats Company, Mr. Godfrey was in a great Pasion; and said that such a thing was enough to ruin his Credit, for Mr. Shovat was dangerously ill after it. He threatn'd me hard, and had me before a Justice, to make me discover who the Gentleman in black was, my Master Bail'd me. The Deceas'd grew worse, I was sadly frighten'd, and my Mistress appear'd very much concern'd, who would have thought, says she, that that Innocent Emulsion, should have done the poor Gentleman any hurt. But don't you be afraid, you can come to no harm, and I beg of you, not to tell who you had it of, for if it should be known, I shall be ruin'd, and that's what my Neighbours want. Now I knew as how that some of the Neighbours had been saying, as if my Master had been Jealous of Mr. Shovat, and therefore thought, if I told that my Mistress had sent him any thing, it might make them talk but the more, and bring her into a great deal of trouble, and so when I was carried before the Justice again, I still stood it out, that a Gentleman in black gave the Bottle; I was sent to the Round-house. Mr. Shovat dy'd, and at last it all came out. - I never knew that there had ever been a Quarrel, or Malice between the Deceas'd, and my mistress, he frequented our House, till the Day that he was taken ill.</p>

             the Deceas'd Servant thus depos'd. The Prisoner's maid brought the Emulsion, told me that it came from Mr. Godfrey, and that he order'd her, to see it carry'd up to my Master, but she being in haste, she went away before my Mistress came down.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Shovat thus depos'd - I had been Married to the Deceas'd, about 10 Months. - I was call'd down to receive this Emulsion, which my Man told me, was left by Mr. Sherman's Cook. I sent for her, she told me it was given her, by a tall Man in black, who order'd her to say, it came from Mr. Godfrey; I ask'd her if Mr. Godfrey knew Mr. Shovat had a Feavor, she said yes, I ask'd if there was no strong Waters in it, she said it was an innocent Cool thing, and I might taste if I pleas'd. - I told her I had. She went away; I came in to my Husband, who being willing to have Mr. Disneys Opinion of it, he sent it to him. - Mr. Disney sent word, that he believ'd it was innocent, and if it came from Mr. Godfrey, he might venture to take it. So I set it by the Bed-side, and at three several times, I gave my Spouse a Quarter of a Pint of it - He was taken very ill about; in the Morning, he had a violent purging, the Gripes, Cramps, and Fainting Fits, and so he continued till Saturday, and then he voided several Ounces of Blood, and dy'd the Wednesday Morning following.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence. I acknowledge that I sent that Liquor to the Deceas'd, but as I had drank of it my self, and found it very harmeless, Cooling, and Pleasant, I thought it might do good, or at least no hurt to the Deceas'd in his illness, to whom I bore a respect as he was a Neighbour, a Customer, and a very Civil Gentleman. His free and familiar Carriage, had indeed created some uneasiness in my Husband, and from thence a few spitefull Neighbours, had taken occasion to be very liberal of their Censures, and therefore I was Cautious, in sending him that small present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shaw the Surgeon thus depos'd. I open'd the Deceas'd Body, the Day after his Death, and found not the least Symptom of Poison, nor any thing but what is common, and the natural Effect of Diarrhea and Dysentries. I have seen many in the like Case. - I drank half a mouthfull of the Emulsion that was left, and it did me no hurt, and I would have drank it all if desir'd, for I have frequently drank the same sort at the Coffee-house, and can depend upon my taste, that there was nothing mixt with it; Half a Pint of small Beer, or any other cool Liquid, would have had the same Effect, in the like distemper.

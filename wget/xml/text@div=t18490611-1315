I knew the deceased William Drakeford—on Saturday night, 26th May, at half-past nine o'clock, he was at my shop, and was quite well when he left—I saw him again in less than five minutes, being carried or led towards my shop—his head was cut, and bleeding very much—I sent for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and had him taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a costermonger, and live at 3, Bedford-street On the night of 26th May I was standing opposite a butter-shop, in Liquor-pond-street, and saw a cart coming, at the rate of eleven and a half or twelve miles an hour—the prisoner was driving—he had the reins in his hand, and a whip, which he used twice after he passed me—I did not see the accident, but, in consequence of what Louisa Steel said to me, I ran after the cart, and kept it in sight till it was stopped by a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live in Mount-place, Pool's-place. On the night of 26th May I was in Liquorpond-street, and saw two men in a cart—the prisoner is one—he was driving—I do not know how fast he was going, but I have seen carts go just as fast—I saw the deceased apparently going down Liquorpond-street in the road, meeting the cart—he was about half a yard from the kerb-stone—the pavement and road are very narrow there—I did not see the cart until the accident happened—it happened not far from the corner—the street is not straight there—I cannot say whether the persons in the cart could see the deceased; I do not think they could when I saw him, for he was close to the side of the wheel—the wheel struck him at the side of the head, and he fell down on the back of his head—the cart went on—I do not know whether the persons in it were aware of what had happened—the prisoner appeared to be in liquor.</p>

               <p>in a cart—in my opinion, the horse was going from twelve to fourteen miles an hour, on full gallop—I stopped it, and asked the prisoner what was amiss that made him drive along so fast—they said, nothing at all was the matter that they knew of—it was stated, in the prisoner's hearing, that he had run over a man—he said he did not know anything about it—I took him into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

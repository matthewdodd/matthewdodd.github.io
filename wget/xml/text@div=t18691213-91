                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live at 7, Barnsbury Street, Bethnal Green—on Saturday afternoon, 28th November, between 5 and 5.30, I was in Wood Street, and was attacked from behind by several men—the prisoner is one of them—he is one of two that held me, while another snatched my watch and broke my chain—I sprang away and endeavoured to catch the thief, but I was thrown down with great violence in the road, and my hand was cut—I got up and ran after the parties shouting "Police!" but they escaped—I then returned to Wood Street, went to the station, and gave a description of the men—I afterwards saw the prisoner on 1st December, in Old Street Station, about 12 o'clock at night—there were twelve others in the room, and I identified him without the least hesitation.</p>

I am now living at 397, New North Road—I went there on 24th May last—previous to that I resided at 6, Formosa Street, Maida Vale—I was formerly proprietor of the Upper Welsh Harp, at Hendon; I left there on 31st August, 1875—from there I went to 6, For<lb></lb>mosa Street, the residence of Miss Crew, to whom I was engaged to be married, and whom I married, on 5th October, 1875—between the time of leaving the Welsh Harp and being married I always resided at Formosa Street—after my marriage I went to Dover; I stayed there about five weeks—I then went to France—I returned to London about 5th or 6th November—I then went to reside at 6, Formosa Street, and have always resided there up to the time of going to New North Road—when I left the Welsh Harp my father and mother, who lived there'with me, went to live at Buckingham Villas, Willesden, one of two semi-detached villas—Mr. and Mrs. Green lived in the other—I have never at any time resided at Buckingham Villas; I have been there several times, but never to stay—I slept there about three nights before I was married; that was between the time of my leaving the Welsh Harp and my marriage—between 5th November, when I returned to town, and 20th November I never slept there; I never went there between those times—on the evening of 20th November I was at 6, Formosa Street—I had never been at Buckingham Villas at all on that day—I did not have any conversation with either of the defendants—on the 20th November I—did not see either of them—the first I heard of the writ being issued against me on these bills of exchange was when my father told me of it—I believe an action had been commenced against me by Mr. Rawlins in January, 1875, and I had given bills of exchange for the amount—I forget the dates when those bills became due; I have not the bills with me. (Mr. Sleigh <hi rend="italic">said that there were four bills at three, five, six, and eight months, the first three for</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">each, the last for</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">odd</hi>.)

I never said that my son never re<lb></lb>sided at Dover, but that when he was married he went into the country, and stopped at Dover on the way; nothing of the kind—I know that he did live at Dover—very likely I Bigned an affidavit in an action of Rawlins against my son—I swore that he never lived in the music-hall at Dover—I did not swear that he never lived at Dover—I can't swear what were the contents of the affidavit; I did not draw it, I read it—what I swore to I am sure was correct—I know he was at Dover for a month; I visited him there—I knew that he made two applications for the London Packet—rl did not swear at the police-court that I never gave evidence on his behalf with regard to the London Packet; I did give evidence—I know a gentleman named Har<lb></lb>rington; he was in my employment; he merely came to live with us because he was out of business; ha was living with my son at the Upper Welsh Harp; he had no money—the creditors got him made a trustee in my bank<lb></lb>ruptcy—there was some arrangement made for him to be the trustee, and that he was to prove for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or something of that kind—I never swore that he was made trustee for the purpose of my getting through my liqui<lb></lb>dation; I swear that—it was a fictitious debt arranged between me and Harrington—Harrington was turned out, and Mrl White was made trustee—I don't believe Mr. White moved the Court to set aside the claim of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I believe I did it myself; I really could not say now whether Mr. White did it—he is a builder; he is not living rent-free at the semi-detached villas; I swear that—he is living at 26, Palmerston Road, and pays 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it is not my house; it is a house I built, and I have been robbed of it—White was not in my employment; he has taken contract work for me—I have paid him thousands of pounds—he has not been in my employ<lb></lb>ment since 1864—he was employed at the Welsh Harp when it was being rebuilt—I think I employed him in 1864 on some contract work, making stairs—he has never been a witness on my behalf, that I am aware of, only at the Bankruptcy Court; I swear that—he is my trustee under my pre<lb></lb>sent bankruptcy; he was not under the former, I paid all my creditors in full—I can't tell you the name of the former trustee; he was a public accountant in the City—in 1862, I think, I settled a public-house on my wife—I remember being examined in April, 1872, by Mr. Snell in the Bank<lb></lb>ruptcy Court—I did not then say "I assigned it away in 1865, or there<lb></lb>abouts, to Matilda Stockdale;" I never said anything of the kind—I don't remember saying "She paid no money for it"—I assigned it to my wife; I swear that—I was married in 1848—I said "I assigned it to a person of the name of Matilda Stockdale; she lives at the Upper Welsh Harp; she is known there in the name of Mrs. Bannister"—allow me to explain: when I had been married to my wife about twelve months I heard that her husband was alive—to satisfy myself I went to Australia, and found he had been dead about ten years—I came back to England, and have been living with her ever since—the lawyer who drew up the deed said it was better to put in the two names to save any dispute in my family affairs if anything should happen to me, and that was why the name of Matilda Stockdale was put in—I said I had always received the interest for Mrs. Stockdale, but gave the receipts in my own name—I did" not say "I married her in 1865, when I transferred the mortgage"—I said I was married in 1848—my son had a charge on the Rifle Volunteer, and has now—I did not go to the back door at once on 20th November when I heard the knock because it was nailed up—there were no fastenings to the house, it was not finished; it was nailed</p>

               <p>up so that nobody could get in—I went round to the side door; there was a lock on it—I had a light in the kitchen, and I had on a sealskin cap, and was chopping wood—my son's grandmother left him some money; she gave it to me before she died, for him; I swear that—I had several sums; I had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at one time; altogether I dare say it might be 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I could not say exactly—she gave it me at my own house shortly before she died—I had the use of it, being in the building trade, and I gave it to him—I laid it out for him—I did not say at the Bankruptcy Court that the grand<lb></lb>mother left no will and no property—I said she made no property; I never said she left no property, because my wife had received money after her death—I was married in 1848, and I went to Australia towards the latter end of the same year—I went to the husband's relations, and they told me ha bad been dead about ten years—I do not know that my wife had only been married to him four years—I said at the Bankruptcy Court that I could not say when he died—I did not say I did not know that he was supposed to be dead—Mr. Crew claimed some of the goods at the Welsh Harp previous to my son leaving there, under a bill of sale; I don't know the amount—I do not keep any books; I never kept any, only a banking account—I used to bank at the London and County Bank at Paddington—I banked there for several years—my son has had scores of cheques from me on the London and County Bank—I "really could not say in what years I banked there; I know I banked there in 1870, and previous to 1870—in 1864,1 think, I opened the account there; I won't be-confident—I did not say at the police-court that I never kept a banking aocount at all; if I said anything about Jit I said I had no banking account now, but I don't remember mentioning it at the police-court—the pony, trap, and harness was on the premises when the Sheriff seized; I don't know whether it was sold by the Sheriff—it was not on the premises—when, the sale took place—I was paid for the keep of it previous to its being taken away, by Miss Crew—I don't know who took it away, I was not at home; I think the Sheriffs people took it away themselves; that is my candid opinion about it—I think the Sheriff stole it, or the man in charge of it—I lived at the Uppsr Welsh Harp with my son, and managed it at times when I had nothing else to do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Green, and live at 1, Bucking<lb></lb>ham Villas, Willesden—I have a little boy twelve years old—my husband is a plasterer by trade, he takes small contracts, and works occasionally for masters—on Saturday evening, 20th November, my husband and I and the child were in our sitting-room at the side of the house—we have a bow window in the front—at the back of the premises there are two stables at the end of the garden—our sitting-room is in front; our house is the nearest to London, and Mr. Elisha Bannister is next door—he and his wife came to live there about 31st August; they had no child there—I used to go in their house frequently, perhaps two or three times a day, as she was all alone and not very well—I would go in and bit with her and take my needle-work—between the time of their coming to live there and 20th of November Charles Edward Bannister never slept there, to my knowledge; he has never lived there—I knew him by sight perfectly well—it is a very lonely road; the nearest house is about 250 or 300 yards off—I remember the evening of 20th November—my husband had come home between 2 and 3 o'clock, and we had tea in the sitting-room—we had a lamp burning in the evening; our attention was called by some voices—we went to the back door, and the moment we got the door open I heard someone say "Will you take this and give to your son?"—Mr. Bannister said "My son does not live here, therefore I cannot give it to him,' and he said "You are trespassing, will you get off?" and by that they either got over the fence or through it, I could not tell which, and after they got over I saw a piece of paper held up by Nutt, and he said "Will you give this to your son f—Mr. Bannister said "I tell you my son does not live here, and therefore I can't give it to him," and by that they went away—at the time Mr. Ban<lb></lb>nister spoke about trespassing he was only about a yard, or from that to a yard and a half, from Nutt, but it was impossible for me to see him, because we have a little brick building which just hid him from me—I saw both the strangers, and I knew Mr. Bannister's voiee—he was not near enough to them to take them by the neck; on my oath he never did, because I could see them so distinctly; he never put his hands upon them at all, not while we stood at the door, and they went away before we left the door—about ten days or a fortnight after, Nutt came to our house; it was on a Monday, about the 5th of December, but I will not say to a day, it was about 12 o'clock, or between 12 and 1 o'clock—some man was with him, who I did not know at the time; he has since been pointed out to me,</p>

I live at 15, Little Queen Street, Holborn—in 1875, I was staying at the Upper Welsh Harp, at Hendon—I was there in January and February, I recollect Nutt coming there, I" don't know the date, I believe I saw him serve a writ on Mr. Elisha Bannister—Charles Edward Bannister was not present at the time, he was at the Welsh Harp, but was not present—I had a slight knowledge of Nutt—I saw him in the passage at Bow Street, and asked what he was there for—he said in Bannister's matter, I looked round and saw Charles Bannister, and a friend or two with him, and I said "That is <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> Bannister"—he said "Oh, which is Charles," and I pointed him out to him—I was in the Court during the examination of the witnesses, and Nutt handed me a little bit of paper—this is it—I had handed a piece of paper to him, and this was his answer. (<hi rend="italic">Read;</hi> "I have shown your answer to my note to Mr. Williams, and probably he may call you to prove that you never knew Bannister, and that you did not point him out to me; why should I ask you to point him to me when I knew him personally.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I met Nutt, who had some one with him, but I do not know who it was—there was a conversation, then we parted, I went on my way and they on theirs, to London—I did not know Mr. Nutt before—I knew the Bannisters—my sister and I were occupying a portion of the premises, the same as Elisha Bannister, in Palmerston Road No. 29—we bad the kitchen, the basement—we were the tenants of Mr. Elisha Bannister—he was living in the house—we kept pigs there; the parish objected and we had to leave—it was in the year 1871—my sister removed some slates belonging to Mr. Ferguson, the solicitor employed to build Buckingham Villas—they were brought to her to remove, she took them to Mr. Ferguson's wharf—they were taken away on a Saturday—I did not know the police were spoken to; they were restored to Mr. Fergusons wharf on the Monday morning—Mr. Ferguson did not complain that we bad taken them away—the foreman came down; he was not very rude—he did not say we had stolen the slates—he did not say he had spoken to the police—I said at the police-court that I had been that afternoon in Mr. Bannister's, in Great Marylebone Street, and Bannister's shop was on the right hand side, three or four doors down—I did not say I. was in the habit of going there three or four times a week—I said I served the shop three or four times a week—I said I had been to Bannister's with eggs</p>

               <p>that afternoon—it is not true I had been there before—I was there on that day; I took some eggs there, the 20th November—I did say "I keep no account of any of the shops I served; Bannister's shop is three or four shops up Marylebone, on the right coming from my place"—Nutt recognized me at the Bow Street police-court—that was the first time I spoke to him since the 20th November—I did not offer money to any one to come up and be witnesses against Mr. Bannister—I knew a person of the name of William Campion—I did not say he could get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by swearing that Charles Bannister lived there, and point to the villas; nor that he would only be swearing the truth—I did not say further that I would give Campion and Piper a few days to consider whether they would not come up and swear they knew Charles Bannister lived at Buckingham Villas—I did ask Campion on the 23rd February, "Did I offer you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I asked him how he could say such a thing—he told me he had been offered ten <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> to come and swear; it would be very handy, but he should only make a mess of it if he came and swore that Charles did not live there—I never spoke to Piper—he was not present—I did not say at the police-court "I know all about this case from a man who keeps a garden, his name is William Campion"—I said I had heard about the case from a man who keeps a garden, and then I afterwards saw it in the paper—I am quite sure after speaking to Nutt I went on and he came on towards London with his com<lb></lb>panion—I did say Charles Edward Bannister lived at Buckingham Villas all the time from the time he left the Welsh Harp to the day he was married, and I say so now—and after he was married he came back there and lived there all the time up to when I met Nutt in the road—I did not say I was not going to come (as <hi rend="italic">a witness</hi>) without my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I mentioned nothing about money when Nutt's solicitor was subpoenaing me—I did come, but my sister was not well enough—she is here to-day—my deposition was read over to me before I signed it, but I do not believe some of the words were put down right when read over to me, not put in the form I said it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not object to it, it being substantially true—I did not say "I went to the shop three or four times a week"—I said "I served them"—I did not say "I knew all about the case from a man who keeps a garden up there, whose name is William Campion"—I said I knew about the case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister of the last witness—I live in Buckingham Road; I was living there on the 6th November—I know Charles Edward Bannister—I saw him on that day when I came home, about 6 o'clock, ho was mowing grass—on the 20th he was putting a post up in the yard—I was in the habit of passing the house in the morning—I have seen him in the morning—I have seen his wife in the morning—in November she was adjusting a timepiece or something at about 7.45 in the morning—I know Mrs. Charles Edward Bannister—I have also seen her in the back yard in the morning about 8 o'clock—it was about 12 o'clock in the day that I saw Charles Edward Bannister putting up a post on the 20th November—I saw him every day in November.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined at the police-court—I did not hear my sister's evidence—my sister had never seen Mrs. Davis until the 20th November in Great Marylebone Street, High Street, Marylebone—my sister serves the shop, but she never went there—I said at the police-court she served Mrs. Davis, but she did not go there—I took the eggs—I was asked</p>

               <p>the question if she went to Mrs. Davis three or four times a week—she never went there only upon that day that I sent the eggs—I said she went away upon the 20th, between 2 o'clock and 2.30, and came back again from 5 to 6 o'clock, as near as I can remember—I did not say I was not coming upon the subpoena, I was not going to lose 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not received a farthing, no offer of money has been made—my sister did not say in my presence she was not going to be done out of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did say at the police-court I had not been on good terms with Mr. Charles Edward Bannister; his society was too hateful, and I say it again—I know something about ten <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> being mentioned—Campion told me he said "If I come to swear any<lb></lb>thing but the truth I shall only make a mess of it"—ten <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> would be very handy, but still I shall not come"—my sister did not say in my pre<lb></lb>sence that Campion and Piper could have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a piece if they would come and swear Bannister lived at Buckingham Villas—from time to time I had. seen Charles Bannister in the company of Green, the plasterer, after the return from the marriage up to the time when I was examined at the police-court—Charles Bannister was living there from the time he left the Welsh Harp, up to his marriage and regularly afterwards with his wife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have not been able to be up before, because of illness—I had a blow in the chest from Charles Bannister and I do not think I shall ever get over it—I do not know a railway porter of. the name of Barker—some one came to my house upon the Saturday night before the last Sessions at 20 o'clock—my sister went to the door and I told her to go in, I do not thank anybody to come to my place at 10 o'clock at night whoever they are, and I think if a note had been written by Mr. Nutt or anybody else it would have been better, as our slander has been too much—I heard something about a subpoena outside and I told them to be off about their, business, and they told me they should throw it in the garden, and they threw it there—I was very angry with their coming—there was no other reason than my illness for. not attending on the Monday—I gave no other reason.</p>

I am a printer—I know Charles Bannister—I was at Willesden in the month of December last year—I know Nutt—I took a piece of paper on the 6th to Buckingham Villas; Nutt gave it to me—I took it to Mr. Charles Bannister; I was not able to deliver it—I saw Nutt again directly; we accompanied each other for a short distance, and went back to the house again—we went to Mr. Green's house, and saw Mrs. Green and her boy—we asked about Mr. Charles Bannister; we went in again to Mr. Bannister's house—Mr. Nutt said "Here, Charlie, I want you; I have got something for you," but he did not stay to hear what he had to say to him, and went indoors again—I went to the house after he had gone in—I did not see him after he went in—someone answered me; it was something like a woman's voice—the door was not opened to me—as I was going away from the house a little boy ran after us with the writ that had been put under the door, and threw it down, saying "Here is something for you"—we said we should not take it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Did you pull down this old building for yourself, or some other person? - A. For myself, the ground is my own.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to say you had seen this timber before? - A. I had seen them many times; I ordered my men to deposit it in a particular place; I superintend all the business myself.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: On Sunday, the 30th of January, I was with Kennedy, I saw the prisoner and another man, with three pieces of timber each, in Wentworth-street; I crossed the way, it was dark; I asked him what he had got carrying, he answered me, some timber; Kennedy stopped the other man, they put the timber against the wall; I asked the prisoner where he got the timber from, he said, Mr. Barnes's yard, Mr. Barnes was his master; I asked him where Mr. Barnes lived, he said, by Mile-end Turnpike; I said, it was an odd thing to be removing them on a Sunday night, he said, he was taking them by his master's order, and going to carry them to Castle-yard, Whitechapel; I told him, we would go and see that they were deposited there, and then we should be satisfied; they went on with them, and we followed them; they went into a yard, in Castle-street, there the other man threw his load on the ground, and the prisoner put his against a pair of gates; the prisoner said, I will go and get the key, and put it in; I said to Kennedy, go with him, and fetch the key; there was another avenue into the yard, out of which the other man went, and ran away; I then called to Kennedy to take care of the prisoner, for the other man was gone; we told the prisoner we would take him to Mr. Barnes's; he then said, it was of no use to go to Mr. Barnes, for he had given him no orders about it; we moved the timber to the office, and locked it up, (produces one of the pieces;) I put a mark on it that night, with my knife.</p>

               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - I heard the last witness give his evidence, it was exactly as he stated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barnes. I have no doubt it is one of mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barnes. I beg to recommend the prisoner, he was at work for me, and was one of the last men I should have suspected.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you given him any orders to remove them? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any connection with Castle-street?- A. I have a shed there.</p>

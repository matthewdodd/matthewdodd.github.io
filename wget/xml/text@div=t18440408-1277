                  </hi>. I am clerk to Thomas Baring and others, of Bishopsgate-street. About half-past three or four o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of April, I had been for my masters to Drummonda' at Charing-cross, I then went up Pall Mall to the London Joint Stock Bank, and came back to Bouverie's in the Haymarket—any one passing might see me go into these bankers'—as I passed the front of the National Gallery, I felt something at my pocket behind, where I bad my pocket-book, containing, among other things, two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and bills of exchange to the amount of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put my hand behind, and found my pocket-book was gone—I turned sharply round, and saw the prisoner by the side of me, a few paces off—I saw my pocket-book drop from the bottom of his frock coat down his legs—I immediately seized him and the book, and accused him of picking my pocket—he denied it—I said, "You have "—he said, "I did not; I am a respectable roan "—I still kept hold of him—he said, "I am a respectable man; don't lay hold of me in this way, to be gazed at by the public; I keep my account at the London and Westminster Bank, in Oxford-street"—he proposed to have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, to go up there with me—I declined that—he said, "If you will not go, let me go in some shop, and I will give you my address, and I demand your card"—he said, "Do you know the consequence of collaring a respectable man in the</p>

               <p>street?"—I said, "Yes"—we went into a bootmaker's shop at the end of the National Gallery—I told the prisoner I had no objection to go into a shop—my only object was to gain time—a man, having the appearance of a respect<lb></lb>able man, remonstrated with me, and said I ought to go with him to the London and Westminster Bank—the prisoner and another man offered to give their address—I had no objection—the prisoner gave the name of Mr. Brown, Sherbourne-street, Alpha-road—it was written down by the person who went in with him—I came to the door to see if there was a policeman coming, and left the prisoner writing this address with his friend—a policeman came up, and I gave the prisoner into custody—I kept the book back till I got to the station, and then gave it to the officer—some bills of exchange were returned to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the Right Hon. Mr. Grenville, of Hamilton-place, Piccadilly; I have been so eight years. At a quarter to four o'clock, on the 6th of April, I was walking near the National Gallery—I saw a pocket-book falling from the prisoner's person—he had a frock coat on—his coat was open, and the pocket-book fell from inside—the prosecutor picked it up, and accused him of picking his pocket—he said he had done no such thing, he was mistaken; that he was a respectable man, and referred to his bankers—he said it was impossible for him to do it—his hands were in his pockets—I had not seen him before.</p>

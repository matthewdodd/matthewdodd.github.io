               <p>—I saw the prisoner and another man in Herod's-place, Well-street—when they saw me, they went away in a hurried manner—seeing they had some<lb></lb>thing bulky, I overtook them in Wellclose-square—I stopped the prisoner, his companion ran away—I asked the prisoner what he had got—he said, "A pair of boots"—I took one boot from the left side of the breast of his coat—I said, "Here is only one, you said you had a pair; where is the other?"—he said, "That man has got it," but I saw him fumbling about the right side of his dress, and I said, "What have you there?"—he said, "Nothing"—I put my hand, and said, "Here is the other boot"—he said, "Yes, that is the fellow to the other one"—I said, "Where did you get them?"—he said; "I bought them in the Commercial-road on Saturday"—I said, "Whereabouts in the Commercial-road?"—he said he did not know—I said it was a strange story, it did not satisfy me, he must go with me—he then said he gave half a crown for them to the man who had run away—these boots are not fellows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and outfitter, and live in Well-street. These boots are mine—they were safe on Sunday night, between 11 and 12 o'clock, when I went to bed on the 6th Jan.—in the morning, in consequence of what my servant told me, I went down and found the fan-light very much broken, sufficiently to draw these boots through—there were two odd boots gone, and one pair; the pair the other man has run away with I suppose—the fanlight was all safe the night before—it was very stout glass—it could not be broken with the hand.</p>

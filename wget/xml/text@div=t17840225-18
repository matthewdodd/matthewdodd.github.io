               <p>I am shopman to the last witness, we lost part of the lace that was in the box, and two cards of lace, between four and five on Monday the 9th in the afternoon; I know the prisoners; Davis and the other prisoner came about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, and said they wanted to look at some lace, for they sold it again, and ought to have an allowance; they were at our shop in the morning before, and I shewed them some lace, and I missed a length of lace then, but could not be sure they had taken it then, therefore we concluded if they came again to be very cautious in serving them; Davis bought three yards at nine-pence; she paid me a part and Talbot paid the rest, they said, they would buy some more if I would shew them any thing of bargains, I shewed them several afterwards; and they made a hesitation about the price. Davis took one card in her hand, she undid it till she came to the joining where it was pinned: she unpinned, and took the lace.</p>
               <p>Court. All this in your view? - Yes, but she did not know I took any notice; she took the lace and put it between her body and the other, and dropped it on the ground, she then took another card up.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make any objection to this? - No, I saw her put the card into the box, and I was convinced she had dropped the rest on the ground; but she had done the lace up so as if there was the whole on the card; I did not see them take the other two cards, nor I did not miss them at all; at last they went out of the shop, and said no more would suit them; I went out about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250050"></xptr> a minute after, and went into Mr. Agar the confectioner's two doors off, who was constable, and gave him charge of the prisoners, they were taken into Mr. Robert's, an ironmonger.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure of the prisoners? - Yes; their hands were tied together, and we took them to the watch-house, just as we were going to take them out, Mr. Roberts's young man said, here is a card of lace, that was about two feet from Talbot, and immediately after, he said, here is another card, that was about four feet from Talbot, the prisoners were still in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the prisoners been in that part of the shop where the cards were found, or were their hands so much at liberty, that they could have thrown the cards there? - They had been moving about, and I suppose they dropped them there; I then saw the two loose lengths on the ground, underneath where Davis stood; I know the lace, it was the same pattern and quality, and every thing with that which remained.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure those two lengths of lace were on that card when these two women came into your shop? - Yes, I saw them do the fact, and I strongly thought, I was sure Davis had the property about her, I did not see the other two cards in the box, and I cannot swear either of them had these two cards in their possession, but these two cards were my master's property, there is my own private mark on them.</p>
               <p>Court. Had Mr. Roberts's family purchased any lace of you that day? - No.</p>
               <p>Where were those two cards of lace, when they came into your shop? - If they stole them at that time, it must be out of that box, but I will not swear they were in that box; the prisoners were taken to the watch-house, I had the lace in my possession till the constable came, he searched them and found nothing on them, but a bit of lace in Talbot's bonnet, which was not ours.</p>
               <p>Court. You found the three yards of lace that you sold them? - Yes,

               <p>Jury. I received a letter from Mr. Agar, and sent to him, to tell him, the necessity of his attending.</p>
               <p>Court. I have mentioned it to my brother Gould, and he thinks it would be too much to estreat his recognizance, therefore let it be discharged.</p>
               <p>(The lace opened and deposed to by Barnes)</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, it appears the shopman observed every thing that was going forwards, therefore this is certainly not the case, that the act of Parliament provides against, which is privately taking from the shop, for it was an open taking in the view of the person: I have mentioned it to my learned brother here, and he concurs with me in opinion, that notwithstanding the two cards were not observed to be taken, yet he observed the first taken, that was the first act, and the other will not vary the case at all: your verdict will therefore in my apprehension be, that they are guilty of stealing, but not privily out of the shop.</p>

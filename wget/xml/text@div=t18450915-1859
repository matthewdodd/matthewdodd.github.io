In consequence of what Mr. Wescoe stated, I stopped the prisoner after she came out of the house—when I took her inside she dropped a pot of pomatum on a chair—I asked her if she had anything else, and she said she wanted to go into the back yard—I told her no—Miss Wescoe searched her, and I left the room—these things were delivered to me—this key opens three parts of the drawers in the house—the prisoner said she found it in the child's drawer—she gave me her mother's address—I went there, and found some black. silk, a pair of stockings, a handkerchief, lace, a gold pin, a locket, five books, and some other things—the prisoner did not tell me anything about those things.</p>

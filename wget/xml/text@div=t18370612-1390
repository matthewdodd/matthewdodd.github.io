                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and keep a tobacconist's shop in Church-street, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. On Sunday night, the 4th of June, at a quarter to ten o'clock, I was in the shop and heard a scuffle outside—I went out, and found the prisoner scuffling with a gentle<lb></lb>man, who had hold of him, and three tobacco boxes were on pavement under his feet—I immediately asked the prisoner whether he had got say—he said no, he had not, but that a boy had run down the street—I pulled his coat open, and saw two projecting from his pocket—I did not take them out but sent for a policeman, and detained him—I examined my window, and found a piece of glass had been taken out, large enough to admit a man's hand—I missed seven tobacco boxes, which I had seen ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before, when I left that part of the window—they were quite close to the pane—it was not broken then—it was a piece that had been broken and puttied in three weeks before—the putty was quite hard—it was quite safe ten minutes before—there was no hole whatever I am sure—the piece of glass was taken entirely away, but not the whole piece—I could find no pieces—a person could put his hand through the hole and reach the boxes—the policeman took two boxes from the prisoner in my presence—they are all mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>).</p>

I was passing by at the time, and the prisoner was given into my charge—I took these two tobacco boxes from him—one fell from the left leg of his trowsers, and the other he took but of his left pocket himself—I have them here—it was dark at the time ✗ parish is St., Matthew, Bethnal-green—I examined the window and ✗ a piece glass taken out of the middle of the square sufficient to get a box of cigars out—I found no glass anywhere.</p>

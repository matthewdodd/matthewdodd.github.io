               <p>ANN CRUTCHLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an apprentice to Mrs. Short: On Thursday morning last, the tallest of these two boys, Purcell, came into the shop and asked for some ribbon to tie on his hat; I shewed him some galoon; he said, that would not do, he must have broader; these two coloured ribbons were lying upon the counter at the time; I shewed him some broader ribbon; he said, he wanted eight yards, would I give him a pattern; while I turned round to reach the box down, he took the ribbons that laid on the counter; I did not see him take them; I did not know that they were gone till the boy was brought back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those ribbons; are you sure those are the ribbons that laid upon your counter? - A Yes; they are our's.</p>
               <p>JOHN STAPLETON sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 31st of March, a little after ten, I was going to Covent-garden, about my own business; as I was going along Holywell-street, in the Strand, I met a man that I knew, and he told me there were two suspicious characters about; that there was one standing at the corner of the alley; I left him, and went past the alley, and saw him, that was the little one, Bailey; I passed him again, and stood at a few doors distance, and saw the tall one come out of Mrs. Short's shop, facing where the little one was standing; when he came out of the shop he walked slowly into the alley facing the shop, and then ran into the Strand; I pursued him, and he turned his head back and saw me coming; and I called out stop thief; I did not see him take any thing out of the shop; the moment I called stop thief he dropped the ribbons; those are the same ribbons; I picked them up; I pursued him, and he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Purcell's defence. When I was first taken they took me to that gentlewoman's shop; this boy I know nothing of; I never saw him till I saw him in the shop when I was taken; they charged me with taking the ribbon; he took me to a public-house, there were two gentlemen, said, had I got any money; if I had any, or friends, they would soon settle it; I told them, I had no money, and very few friends, and they were very poor; "we will let you go if you can get as much money as five guineas;" these two men went to my friends, and could not get five guineas; they came back and took me to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Stapleton). Q. Did any thing of this kind pass? - A. The man that gave me the information begged somebody to stop at Bow-street, while he sent for his friends; and out of curiosity went to one Mrs. Gibbons, she said, she did not know him, and she could not come down; I stopped a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about compounding it for felony? - A. Not a word.</p>

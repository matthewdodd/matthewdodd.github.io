               <p>Q. The prisoner worked with you? - A. Yes, after the prisoner went out of the house we had suspicion that he had a pot about him; Batho the constable followed him by Mr. Hewitt's directions, he was brought back to Mr. Baker's counting house, he was searched, there was nothing found upon him. I went into the shop where he worked, and under the bench where he worked, I found one pot of Mr. Knight's, and one belonging to Mr. Hewitt, they were both bent quite flat.</p>

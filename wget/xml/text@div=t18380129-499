                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Harvey, and live at No. 11, Ireland-yard, Blackfriars. I attended the prisoner, Mrs. Hodges, in her confinement, which took place on the 4th of December—she lives at No. 21, Ivy-lane, Newgate-street—she was delivered of a girl—the child name was Sarah—the prisoner's husband is a butcher—his name is Richard John Hodges—the prisoner did not get through her confinement well—she never was well—on Sunday, the 31st of December, I went to the home I at ten minutes after seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any thing particular occur after you had been there some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a quarter past eight o'clock Mr. Hodges came into the adjoining! room to the bed-room, and asked me to come in—the bed-room is the back room—I came from another room into the bed-room, and found Mrs. Hodges standing with her hand on the drawers—Mr. Hodges was walking about with his hands folded, in a very melancholy way, and his expresion was, "Oh God, what will become of me? what shall I do, Mrs. Harvey?" I instantly looked round, and saw Mrs. Hodges standing, perfectly coflect<lb></lb>ed, by the drawers—I saw the bed clothes were put down, and inquired where the child was—I got no answer—I ran to Mrs. Hodges, took hold of her hand, and said to her, "My dear girl, what have you done with the child?—she said, "It is dead"—she did not answer me the first time I spoke to her—I asked her two or three times before she gave me any answer—when she did answer, she said, "It is dead"—I said, "Dead! my dear girl, where?" and asked her what she had done with it—she said, "In the copper"—I flew instantly into the other room where the copper was, and there I saw the baby—I did not say any thing further to her before that—I went back into the room, and said to Mr. Hodges, "What are we to do?—he instantly said, "Run for her father and mother"—they live opposite—I then took hold of Mrs. Hodges' hand, and asked her how she could do such a deed—she gave me no answer, but looked in a most wild, distracted state—I went into the other room after that, and took the baby out of the copper—the lid of the copper was on, part over it and part not there was some water in the copper, which exactly covered the child—I wrap had the child up in a blanket.</p>

               <p>said the devil had tempted her very frequently—I said, "My dear girl you should not let such thoughts run in your head"—she said, "I cannot help it, Mrs. Harvey"—I have asked her if her husband was unkind to her—she said, "By no means whatever."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe any thing particular on the Wednesday or Thurs<lb></lb>day before this Sunday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Wednesday before, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, I found an open razor on the table—I asked her how it came there—she said it was one of Mr. Hodges'—I said, "Mr. Hodges does not shave himself, what do you do with this razor?"—she said, "I don't know, I merely took it out of the drawer"—I said to her, You will never see it any more, for I shall take it away from you"—she laid," That is right, take it away, for fear I should do any accident or mis<lb></lb>chief"—I do not exactly recollect which—she behaved very kind and fond to the child before this.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How old is she? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty-one—this was her second child—the first was a boy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Except at the period of her confinement, and immediately after, did her mind appear to be rational and proper, and as it ought to be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Per<lb></lb>fectly so—the first child is alive now, and. her conduct towards it has al<lb></lb>ways been that of a fond and indulgent mother—she has always expressed herself as being happy with her husband at home, and circumstances ap<lb></lb>peared to warrant that conclusion in every respect.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Probably you know it is not unusual when milk so soon leaves the breast for it to fly to the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I think it is a very reasonable things—I have had several children, and am the mother of a family—the I prisoner did not tell me the time she had smothered the child—I heard her tell Mr. Hayes that—I was in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time did she appear to feel what a person in her senses ought to feel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she appeared quite unconscious—she told me on one oc<lb></lb>casion, during her confinement, that she was continually haunted by the devil to make away with herself—she did not say with the child—I had I not left the room on this occasion above a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes when Mr. Hodges came to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Ivy-lane, exactly opposite Mr. Hodges' house. I have known Mrs. Hodges for the last eighteen years, and was in the habit of visiting her once or twice a week—I remember her being confined with her last child—I visited her on the Sunday after she was confined, and drank tea with her—when I entered the room, she wai sit ting with her baby—I asked her how she found herself, she said, "As well as I can expect"—I asked to see the baby, and nursed it for a short time—she entered into conversation with me on different occasions, but when the nurse left the room, she said, "I have had a very terrible dream"—(I noticed that she allowed the nurse to leave the room before she repealed the dream to me)—I said, "What have you dreamt, tell me?" she said, "I dreamt that the devil came to me and told me to kill my child"—the nurse came in again, and I took no further notice, but in a few minutes the nurse left the room again, she looked round to see that the nurse was gone, and then said, "I fell asleep again, and the devil came to me again, and said, 'You must, and you shall kill your child' "—I felt terrified, and said to her, "But you could not do that?" she answered, "Oh no!" and that was all that passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Newgate-street I have been in the habit of attending Mrs. Hodges, and attended he in her last confinement—the child was born previous to my getting there—it was born about a month before she expected—I remember being called in on. Sunday morning, the last day of December, and saw the child—it was lying on the table, wrapped up in a blanket, dead—I observed a dark livid appearance on the face of the child, as if it had been smothered—then was no appearance round the neck of any compression, but merely on the fcce—I went into the room where Mrs. Hodges was, and said to her, "This is a shocking business, Mrs. Hodges: how could you do this; how was it?"—she was not at all communicative to me, but at last she said she had smothered the child, by placing a pillow over its face—I asked her if the child struggled at all—she said it. struggled a little—she said she afterwards took it into the other room, and put it into the copper, having previously put some water into the copper—I asked her what time she did it-her answer was, before her husband came to bed—I asked her how she could do it—she gave no answer to that—I fanned the greatest difficulty to getting answer from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you observed any thing with respect to her milk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She had no milk for about a fortnight previous to that—I understood so from inquiries—that would very likely have an effect on the head of a person to circumstanstanced.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your opinion of the state of her mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At that time I consider she was not at all aware of any thing she did—she was not conscious—she was very ill for some time afterwards, so much so, that her life was despaired of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

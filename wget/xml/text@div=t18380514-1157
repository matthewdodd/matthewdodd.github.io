                  <hi rend="largeCaps">CHARLES HANKINSON</hi>. I live in Tottenham-road, Kingsland, and a gardener. On the evening of the 10th of April I was about leaving a piece of garden-ground at the back of the houses in Maberley-place, and saw the prisoner crossing the grounds, and proceed to the premises—he went over the wall—he had no basket or any thing with him—I lost him for about two minutes, and then saw him return—he ran to leap over a ditch, but missed his leap, and fell in—I seized him by the collar and called for the police—he did not resist—he fumbled in his pockets, but I did not see him drop any thing—the policeman searched him, and found a quantity of keys on him—he had a basket when I stopped him, which I gave to the policeman.</p>

I was on duty in Totten<lb></lb>ham-road, and heard a noise from Maberley-place—I went forward, and Mr. Hankinson had the prisoner by the collar—he gave him into my cus<lb></lb>tody with this basket of linen—I was proceeding to the station-house with him, and he put his hand in his right-hand coat-pocket, and took from it a key which I took from his hand, as he was going to throw it away—I then took three large skeleton-keys and a screw-driver, three small trunk keys, and one door-key from him—the linen appeared rather damp, as if it had not been long washed—it was rough dried—I afterwards went back to the ditch, and found a screw-driver.</p>

On Tuesday, the 10th, I went to our back garden, adjoining Mr. Hankinson's—a man called to me, and asked if I missed any thing, and I missed these things—they all belong to me, except two towels and a duster, which belong to my mistress—the things were hanging out to dry.</p>

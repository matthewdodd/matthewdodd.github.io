                  </hi>. I live in Phoenix-court, West Smithfield. About half-past two o'clock in the morning, on the 12th of Feb., I was in a coffee-shop in Long-lane—the prisoner was there—I had a pair of trowsers with me—I fell asleep, and when I awoke the trowsers and the prisoner were gone—I informed the policeman, and he took me to the prisoner's lodging—she was in my company when I fell asleep—she was there when I went in, and sat in the same box—these trowsers were found out of the window where she lodges, about five minutes before three o'clock.</p>

I received information about a quarter to three o'clock—I went to her place and knocked at the door—the prisoner said, "Who is there?"—I said, "The police"—she went away to the window—I broke open the door, and saw her at the window with the property in her hand, and she threw them out—I went down and got them—this shawl was with them.</p>

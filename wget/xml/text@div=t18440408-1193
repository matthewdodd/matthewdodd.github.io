                  </hi>. I am in partnership with William Seymour. About the 25th of March the prisoner was in our employ—from information, I had reason to believe I had been robbed of some gold—a person applied to him, and got from him twenty-seven grains of gold—I have every reason to believe it was the same that was lost from our premises, and it is exactly the same quantity that Lane had missed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What was the weight he complained he had lost? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 1 dwt. or 1 dwt. and a half—your work always came in correctly—about two months ago there was a great panic in the shop about a man purchasing gold of three of the apprentices—at that time 1 had no suspicion of you—a boy worked on one side of you, and a man on the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the prosecutor's employ. At four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 25th of March, I left the cuttings of twelve books—when I went next morning I saw they were diminished, and there was from about 1 dwt. to 1 dwt. and a half missing—I informed my master—he told me to go to Mr. Scardefield, who produced the gold before me—I took it to my master—I went back, and brought Mr. Scardefield, who identified the prisoner.</p>

My watch-ribbon and seals were hanging out. I was standing in the crowd, and perceiving my seals moving, I justanily felt for my watch, and found it was gone. I had not observed the prisoner near me. I immediately looked on my right hand side, and saw the prisoner, with my watch in his hand. I immediately seized him, and grasped his hand in which were the watch and seals, and delivered him to an officer.</p>

            . I happened to be near Mr. Fox, on the 13th. I had observed the prisoner in the morning at about ten o'clock, standing at the end of Cheapside and Paternoster-row; there were two more boys with him at the same time. I saw the prisoner attempt a great number of gentlemen's pockets. He tried the prosecutor's watch once without success; the second time he drew it, and I look him with the watch.</p>

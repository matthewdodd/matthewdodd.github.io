I am a shorthand writer at this Court I was present at the trial of Charles Mallett, and took down the evidence of Louisa Harrison; I do not remember the person of the defendant—I have here the evidence she gave—it is contained in the Sessions Paper; I have my original notes here—I corrected the press from them; it is correct—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "I am the wife of Edward Harrisson, a carpenter; we live at No. 2, Bull Inn yard, Aldgate, right opposite the tap, which shows a light upon our door, and the gas light lights ail over our kitchen; the house consists of a kitchen below, and three rooms over it I occupy all but the middle room, which is occupied by a lodger, Mrs. Blower, a laundress—I have two chil<lb></lb>dren, one is fourteen months old, and the other four years—there are two long muslin curtains and a blind to the kitchen window, which looks into the yard, but they are quite thin; anybody can see through them—I assist my husband by taking in dress and mantle making—last Monday week, about half past 6, or a quarter to 7 o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the parlour, the ground floor room; I had a lamp, and there was also a</p>

                  </hi>. I am office porter at the Bull Inn, Aldgate. On Monday evening, 11th Dec, I was in the tap room which is in Bull Inn-yard, nearly opposite the prisoners house; with about two steps across, you can get from one door to the other—the Barking omnibus has gone from that office for some years—on this evening, "Barking" was hallooed out, but whether it was the omnibus or the Barking cart I cannot tell—at the time "Barking" was hallooed out, the prisoner's little girl was in the taproom; it was then about half-past 6 o'clock, but I cannot say exactly because the coaches and omnibuses do not start exactly to a moment, but half-past 6 o'clock is the time; it never goes before the time—after the little girl came in, I went over and found Mrs. Harrisson lying on the floor between two chairs, with her wrists tied together, on her back, but not quite flat—she could not assist herself in getting up, but her head was not on the ground—her legs were straight out, and she was on her back, but the chair on the off side could not separate from the other because there was a table there, and she could not get right down on her back—I did not observe whether her back was against anything—I picked her up imme<lb></lb>diately, and sat her on my lap—I called directly for help, and Harvey came in with a candle; there was a fire in the room—her wrists were tied; I did not observe how far they were apart—Harvey untied them—they were not touching—the knots were on top of the cord to the best of my belief, but I had quite enough to do to take care of her without looking after the cord—I saw blood on the right side of her head, as she lay on my left arm—as soon as I got relieved from her, I went for her husband, Mr. Cook, the surgeon, was there when I went.</p>

On Monday evening, 11th Dec, I was in an upstairs room there, which is opposite Har<lb></lb>risson's house—there were a great many people in the yard, outside Harris<lb></lb>son's house, and I heard a great talking—I ran down directly, and as I went down it was 20 minutes to 7 o'clock by the clock on the stairs—I went over to Harrisson's house, went in directly and found in the parlour, Coster, the porter, from the office, Harvey, and Mrs. Harrisson, who was lying in Cos<lb></lb>ter's arms—she appeared to be not quite conscious at the time I went in—Harvey was beginning to untie her hands, and I helped to untie them—I asked her where her husband was, and after a little time she said that he was at the Garrick Theatre, and I sent for him—this was at the time we were untying her hands—she was bleeding from her nose and the side of her face, and she had a scratch on her forehead—her hands were tied about four or five inches apart—Harvey had loosened the knot when I went in, but it was tied in the middle—that might have loosened it—shortly after this a policeman named Little came, and I heard him ask her what had happened—I heard what she told him, she was sensible then—after a time her husband came; he seemed very much excited, and said, "Oh dear, the man could not tell me;" that was the man that went for him—I told him what she had said; she had told Little that a man had come to the door and knocked, and asked if Mrs. Harrisson was at home, as he had some work from his sister; that she said that she was Mrs. Harrisson, and he asked her for her money; that she said that she had none, and he cut her pocket, and took the money—I repeated all that to her husband, and he said, "She told me at tea time she was sure something would happen be<lb></lb>fore night, for she had had a dreadful dream"—she must have heard that—and I heard her say the same, she repeated it after her husband said so—after Mr. Cook, the surgeon, came, I stayed some time with her, and assisted in getting her on to the sofa, and sent Coster for her husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of No. 140, Minories. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 11th Dec, in consequence of information, I went to No. 2, Bull Inn yard, between half past 6 and 7 o'clock, I found Mrs. Harrisson sitting on a man's lap, insensible and unable to speak—there was no candle, the room was lighted by the fire—a candle was brought, and she was then removed to the sofa—she was bleeding from the nose, and there were two abrasions on her right temple, and a contused wound on the back of her head—it was as if the temple had been rubbed against something rough—I bathed her face with vinegar and water, and as soon as she came to herself I gave her a little brandy and water, washed the blood from her nose, and sponged the abrasions and the wound on the back of the head with warm water—the wounds might have been made by herself.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you the gentleman who was examined on the part of the prosecution on the former occasion, when this young woman was a witness and the person was convicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am—I did not on that occasion say that the wounds might have been made by herself—the question was not asked me—I have been asked the question now for the first time—I was asked it at the Mansion House; when I say the first time, I mean since this case has been investigated—I think it is quite competent for anybody to strike the head against any hard substance—it was a contused wound—there was blood from it—there was an abrasion of the skin, and a contusion all around it—I might myself knock my head against a desk, and it might produce a contused wound; I think it might have been done in that way—I have never met with such an instance—the idea of her doing it herself, never occurred to me till the second case—I now say that such a thing is possible—I have been out of Court to-day but I have heard of the mode in which the prisoner's hands were supposed to have been tied—assuming all those facts to be true, it would have been impossible for her to have inflicted that blow; if she did, she must have done it first and tied her hands afterwards—no place was pointed out against which she could have knocked her head—a stick was produced on the last trial with some blood on it—it was also produced on the same night at the house—it is possible that she could have inflicted the wound herself with the stick at the back of her head, but I should think it improbable—I attended her during the evening up till 12 o'clock—she was in the family way, about</p>

               <p>three months gone, she told me—she had a convulsive fit which lasted about five minutes—a doctor cannot be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> by a sham convulsive fit, if he knows his business, and I know mine—it was some time after I came in before she became sensible—she recovered gradually—she gave those evidences of confusion which always attend fits—she looked round—a practised surgeon cannot be <hi rend="italic">taken in.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The pulse is the best indication, is not it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and she was almost pulseless for half an hour, from the time I came in and found her in a fainting state—I got there about a quarter to 7 o'clock, and five minutes after I arrived I had her removed to the sofa.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The blood was actually flowing from the back of her head when you saw her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not flowing, but it was a contused wound, and had a small quantity of blood on the surface—blood was flowing profusely from her nose—I observed no blood in any part of the room—her nose must have been struck before her hands were tied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any other mode of making the nose bleed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I perceived a bruise next rooming between the top of the nose and the bridge—if she did it herself she must have done it previous to her hands being tied, I should consider—I saw no blood elsewhere—it does not follow that the blood would have spirted—I saw no blood on her hands—I can only tell from what she told me, whether the child had quickened or not—some quicken at four months, and some at four months and a half—taking her condition into consideration, an attack of this kind would be likely to produce a great effect upon her system—I should consider that she is not a person of an hysterical temperament—I never saw her before—supposing an attack of this kind occurred it would most probably affect the nervous system.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Taking that in connection with the action of pregnancy going on, might it have been very likely to produce hallucination? <hi rend="italic">A. I</hi> never had a case of that kind occur in my practice—it is sometimes the case under the ordinary circumstances of pregnancy that we find a woman excited, and not under that mental control which she is under when perfectly well, but it is not necessarily so—when you once get a diseased action on the nervous system it is very difficult to know what it will lead to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were called into this house were your suspicions excited in any way as to whether it was a true case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—by the second case I mean the occurrence which took place on 8th Jan., about a month afterwards—I heard that case investigated at the Mansion House—I first formed the opinion that it might have been done by herself on 8th Jan., the evening I was called to her at the Bull Inn yard the second time—she could not have inflicted that injury to the back of her head with her hands, if they were tied, but she could have done it by striking her head against something, the edge of any place—the corner of a mantel piece would have occasioned it, and if she had struck her nose against a place of that sort that would have occasioned the injury I saw on her nose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it be easy for a woman voluntarily to do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it would require considerable force; but sometimes the nose bleeds violently with small blows—there was a small circular bruise on her nose sufficient to indicate a blow which would produce bleeding—I think it possible for the nose to bleed from an external blow which leaves no mark or bruise, for instance, a side blow—it is quite possible to produce bleeding by scratching some small vessel on the inside, but the whole mucous membrane was very</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110008"></xptr>
               <p>much congested with blood, just as it would have been if the nose externally had received a blow, and that, together with the small bruise, led me to the conclusion that it was the effect of a blow—she was in a fainting state when I first entered, and almost pulseless.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw a stick on the trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was asked whether that sort of instrument might have inflicted the blow at the back of the head, and I expressed my undoubted opinion that it would—it was a blow of considerable severity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a person had been in convulsions, and had fallen among furniture, would that account for the blow and the wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not for the whole of them—the state of fainting and convulsions might, in the con<lb></lb>dition she was in, have been occasioned, if she had made these injuries on herself—they were serious injuries; violent injuries—sometimes a blow on the head will have a great effect on the constitution, and would be more likely to have the effect if inflicted against the will than by the party, be<lb></lb>cause of the circumstance of terror.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it have been immediate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she could not have tied her hands afterwards while in convulsions—the injuries could not have been inflicted with her hands fastened, but she could have given herself a blow on the head with her hands tied.</p>

The prisoner came into our shop on the 21st of January, between five and six in the evening; she asked for a ball of cotton and a halfpenny worth of needles; she paid for them. She then asked to look at some blue ribbon. I took out the ribbon drawer, and shewed it her; she fixed upon one; I measured it for her; she said that was not enough, and when I shewed her another she objected to its colour; she asked me if I would change it if it was not the right colour. I said I could not change it after I had cut it off the piece. She then asked me to give her a pattern, which I did, and then she went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing when she was gone - A. No, I had not missed them until they were brought in. The ribbon was brought in by the officers. It was about eight o'clock when they were brought in.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner came to my shop to buy a piece of meat. I suspected her of having something in her apron; I examined her; I found three or four bits of ribbon and a bit of meat. These are the bits of ribbon.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. When the ribbon was brought in, I took out the drawer; it is a large drawer; I could not miss any number. I cannot say how many were in it. This ribbon I can swear to; it is about three yards. I cannot exactly say when I had seen it before the prisoner came in the shop.</p>

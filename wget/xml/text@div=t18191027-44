On the 15th of October, after dinner, I heard a noise in the kitchen, as if something had fallen down. I went down and found all the dishes and things broken and thrown about, and the prisoner in a state of intoxication. She kept her bed-room door locked, which created my suspicion; I asked her for the key, which she refused. I sent for one of the Marshal's men, who came and found a number of duplicates on her - next day, the articles stated in the indictment were produced at the Mansion House. We went to her bedroom, and in the bed, between the sheets and blankets, were five bottles of wine. We went down to the cellar to see how she could get it, and found the brick-work had been taken away - an iron heater laid by. The lock had been forced back. I had heard her come from the cellar and go to her bed-room three or four times that morning. She came into my service on the 2d of August, without a character.</p>

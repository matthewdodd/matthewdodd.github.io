               <p>Q. Were they such as you would take for the current coin of this realm? - A. No.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290012"></xptr>(John Armstrong produced the paper of counterfeit money).</p>

               <p>Q.(To Lillywhite.) Look at that paper; what are the number of sixpences which appear to be of the current coin of this realm? - A. Twenty-five; the other sixpence is a bad French one; and here are four shillings of the French coin bad, and thirteen other shillings; making seventeen in all.</p>

               <p>The Court were of opinion that the indictment could not be maintained, in as much as it was necessary that the contract should be charged exactly as it was made between the parties.</p>

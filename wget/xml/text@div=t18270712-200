Never; I often sold them brushes; the prisoner used to make pattern brushes; I do not know that he worked for himself; I once had a porter named Robert; I do not know his sirname - I dismissed him for spoiling some goods - the prisoner was never discharged, but he was not at work about the time the duplicate is dated.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 23d of June I went into the public-house, next door to the prisoner's house; he came and asked if I wanted him; Mr. Kent gave him in charge - he was quite intoxicated; he wished me to make away with the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not so drunk that he did not know what he was about? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. KENT. I will swear to these clothes-brushes - some of them are not finished; the tooth-brushes are finished - I never sold them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the tooth-brushes of Mr. Goodlad, of Hatton-garden - some of the others were booked by Mr. Kent, to one of his men - the others I bought of Mr. Roberts in January.</p>
               <p>MR. KENT. I sold Roberts some brushes four, five, or six years ago, but we were not then in the habit of selling brushes of this description to working people - I do not know how long ago it was, as I do not sell them myself.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did you leave Mr. Kent? A. The latter end of January - I left of my own accord; I have had some thousands from him at different times; I have sold the prisoner some previous to January; I sold him at different times fifty or sixty within twelve months, of the very same pattern and make as these.</p>

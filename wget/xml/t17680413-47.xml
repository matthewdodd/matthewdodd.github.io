            . I am servant to Mr. Field; I saw something upon the child's linen when I put her to bed, it seemed to be fresh corruption; after that, on the 7th of March, I was by when Mr. Breeches the surgeon examined her; she looked red, and there was a running.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live with Mr. Breeches in Tooley-street; my master saw the child before I did; it was some time after the contraction of the disease that I saw her, she had the foul disease; there was a running matter, the parts were rather inflamed, but no laceration.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that any body had entered her body?</p>
               <p>Hoare. I think the disease was given by a man, whose private parts were small; I take it a man might enter her.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not an infected man communicate the disease, without entering her?</p>
               <p>Hoare. I think he might.</p>
               <p>The child was examined, but not upon oath, who said she carried a pot down into the cellar, the prisoner there took her and set her on a box and kissed her, and put his private parts to her's, but did not put it into her.</p>

On 25th August, about half-past 5 in the morning, I was on duty in High-street, St Giles's, and saw the prisoner carrying a basket—I stopped him in Endell-street, and asked him what he had got in the basket—he said, "Some things of my own"—I asked him whom he had got them from—he said, "From out of George-street"—I asked him where he was going to take them to—he mentioned some court in Wild-street—I directly said, "There is no such court there; I do not feel satisfied of the things; you must go to the station"—he then said, "I do not mean that, it is Orange-court"—I looked over the things—there were a great number of articles—I said I should take him to the station, and he said, "Give me a lift with the things," I did so—he walked by my Bide forty or fifty yards, then threw the basket down between me and him, and ran away—I pursued him some distance, leaving the basket with two other constables—I could not overtake him—I did not see him again till 6th April—that was at the corner of Charles-street, Drury-lane—I then told him that I took him for that little job in High-street—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "It is relative to the basket that I stopped you with about seven months back"—he said, "I am not the man"—this half-pint pewter measure (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and towel were in the basket which he was carrying.</p>

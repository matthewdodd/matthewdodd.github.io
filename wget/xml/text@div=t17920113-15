               <p>I am a watchman in Cornhill ward: on the morning of the 31st of December I observed something at the warehouse of Messrs. Fenn and Rothwell; as I came to Newman's-court, I looked down the place, and saw three men at the pannel of the door, at the window, very busy; I saw one of them stretch his arms up, and take the pannel of the door, and lay it on one side of him; the glass of the door was covered with this pannel; I saw another man stoop his back, and stretch his arms in, and take something, the glass having been cut; I did not see it cut; I saw a hackney-coach on the rank, in Cornhill, fronting the place that was broke; I saw a man go to the coach immediately; I did not see him open the coach, but he went and immediately returned to the house again; I made up as fast as I could, and when I was within a few yards of them they made off, and I close to them; I was about as near as I am to you, about five yards distance, going cross Cornhill; two of them slipt on one side, on my left-hand side; I kept my eye on the one, I did not offer to turn after these two, but kept my eye on the third, and kept pursuing, and struck my rattle, and laid hold of him, and brought him to the watch-house; that is the man, in the blue coat, the prisoner; he was never more than five yards distance; he got on the flag-stones before I did, and then he walked.</p>
               <p>Was the man you took by the collar ever out of your sight from the time those three ran from the house? - No: I have not the least doubt but he is one that ran from the house; I took him to the watch-house, and told them to take care of him; Mr. Williams is the constable; I told one of the watchmen to give the alarm to the house, and went and rung.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him, or do you only believe? - I only suppose he did: I have got the crow; Rhodes gave it to me. (Produced.) It has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was you the same side of the way, or the opposite? - On the same side.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130020"></xptr>You saw nothing taken away? - I saw something in a man's hand, but could not tell what it was.</p>
               <p>The coach was not open, nor you did not see any body open the coach? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you search this man? - I did not, nor was I present when he was searched.</p>
               <p>You paid no attention to the persons who went down to the left side? - No, none at all, I only minded the person that was before me.</p>
               <p>How far was you from your watch-box? - There are no boxes in the ward.</p>
               <p>Court. Which side of Cornhill was this warehouse? - On the North side, opposite the stand of coaches.</p>
               <p>Did you try the fastenings that night? - It was not my beat; there are twelve watchmen, and they all go round the ward.</p>
               <p>I think you said this was not your beat; what brought you to this spot? - I did not try the pins in that part, but it is all my beat, I go all round the whole ward; there are twelve watchmen, and they go round five minutes after each other, but I have but one part of the ward to try the fastenings, and where I try them I call my own beat; this part happens not to be in my beat, therefore I do not try the fastenings.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor came to me, and I went to the Compter to look at the young man at the bar; I dare say I have known the young man eight or nine months.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - In Half-moon alley, Aldersgate-street: on the 31st of December I went to that house along with Mr. Fenn, and I saw two gentlemen there.</p>
               <p>Do you know from Williams the prisoner whether he was or was not, on the 31st of December, master of the Half-moon, Half-moon alley, Aldersgate-street? - I do not, for he denied it; he said he had let it; I never saw him in the house in my life.</p>

               <p>Where did he live on the 31st of December? - I believe he lived at the Half-moon; for the maid was there that is now on the outside of the door with his wife.</p>

               <p>Do you know that he was the master of it? - I believe he was.</p>

Mr. Williams and another came and searched me; accordingly, after that, they took me to the Compter; that evening they asked me how I came to be out so late; I related the story as before;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130022"></xptr>I told you he asked me what trade I was; I told him I was brought up a cabinet-maker, but having an asthma I was obliged to leave off business, and I took a chandler's shop in the Borough, and from that I took this public-house in Half-moon alley, always endeavouring to maintain the character of an honest man; and even since I have been in this calamitous affair, I have reduced myself to the last shilling to pay every thing that I owed. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am entirely innocent of the thing laid to my charge: I will call a few friends, who will speak what they know in my behalf; and I leave myself at your mercy.</p>

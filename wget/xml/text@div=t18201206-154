I awoke about two o'clock, and missed the prisoner and my watch. Four soldiers were there. I saw it on Monday at the office.</p>

            . I saw Pratt with the prisoner; he went to sleep. After the prisoner left him, she enquired of me about her husband, I refused to talk with her - she said she had something of her husband's, which she would keep all her life, and shewed me a silver watch and an old key. I advised her to take care of it. In a few minutes she left, and two soldiers who were in the box left with her. About an hour after, Pratt awoke and missed his watch; he charged me with stealing it. I told him what I had seen. I found her in a quarter of an hour, and saw the constable take it from her.</p>

She was talking about her husband being killed at Waterloo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060055"></xptr>and produced a watch, which she said was his. She went out, returned in about twenty minutes with a soldier, and called for some gin, which was refused. She awoke a soldier, and he wished to awake Pratt, she objected to it, and gave the soldier two half-crowns.</p>

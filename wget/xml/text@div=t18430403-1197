                  </hi>. I live in London-street, Fitzroy-square. I was at my brother-in-law's house, Mr. Samuel Fenn's, in Robert-street, on the 4th of March—I was in the back parlour that evening, and heard the till drawn out—I looked into the shop, and saw a boy on his hands and knees, with the till—he ran out—I followed him—the prisoner joined him directly, and they ran up the street together—I did not see the prisoner with the till, but I heard it drop in Doughty-street, which is just round the corner, and I picked up this wooden bowl, which had been in the till—it was then empty—there was silver in it when it was taken, and copper in the till—I had been to it about a quarter of an hour before—there was then a half-crown in the till, and some shillings—the till was given me by the policeman—these are the till and the bowl.</p>

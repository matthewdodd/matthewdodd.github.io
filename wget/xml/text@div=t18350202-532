                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and live at Enfield. I had two wheels in my yard on the 6th of January—I missed them on the 7th—these are them—I made the wood-work—this one has had the iron put on since—I went in search of them, and found this one in the town, fixed to a barrow which Thomas Norton had—I asked who made his barrow—he said a man named Hyat—I said the wheel was mine—he said, "You are wrong, I saw the man making it"—I called him a liar—he went on his business round the town with greens, and his brother was with him—I then got Mead, the constable, who went with me to Baker-street, and he went into the prisoner's house—he called me in—I saw the barrow at the back door, and said that was the barrow and wheel which I had seen in the town—this was on the 21st of January—Mead then asked them to take the wheel out of the barrow, which they did, and he brought it out of the house; but he first asked if they had not got another wheel—William Norton said he had no other, but there was an<lb></lb>other barrow there, and I might look at that—I did, but that wheel was not mine—we came out together—the officer took them to the cage, and in about twenty minutes he brought me this second wheel.</p>

Kitchens, of Leeds, or Messrs. Bevington &amp; Morris—I afterwards received from him this memo<lb></lb>randum, claiming for short weight; it is on a billhead "Bought of Arthur Cooper, Manufacturer"—I knew him as a manufacturer of goods—I did not know that he was selling unmanufactured leather—this is my invoice—the goods remain unpaid for—I had another transaction with him on 29th January, 1873—he called on me in London and examined my stock; no one was with him as far as I can remember—he came next day and gave an order for thirty-three dozen patent calf, amounting to 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was not quite ready to offer him the same terms, and he was quick enough to see that, and said "It does not matter, I don't want the same terms, I, have not done sufficient business with you and you don't know me sufficiently; I will pay you for this transaction cash on 1st March," and I agreed to that, with the usual discount of 2 1/2 per cent.—this is the invoice of those goods—I believed that he required the goods for his own trade; if I had known they were going to Brown &amp; Rintoul I would not have parted with them—they remain unpaid for—the total amount of my claim is 397<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Brown &amp; Rintoul were occasionally customers of mine—they would not have bought these goods any cheaper—I am a creditor for the whole of the re-opened account—in the beginning of March, 1873, I was at Leeds, and called at the warehouse of Mr. William Hall—I have sold goods to Mr. Hall at some time, I don't remember whether I did at that time—I can't say exactly that I saw a case of my goods there—I spoke to Mr. Hall about the prisoner's affairs—the prisoner was a good buyer, and an acute judge of the value of articles.</p>

Cooper, Leicester, to George Chamberlain: "Sell certain, I depend on you for what I said"—on 31st January: "Price must be no consideration whatever; wire me at once what you are doing, you know I entirely depend"—that is from Arthur Cooper, Leicester, to George Chamberlain"—there is one more which seems to be without date, from Thomas Jones, Leicester, to George Chamberlain, Glasgow: "Send to-night all oil possible, or the machinery will be completely stopped, depend on for Monday, and can't take any refusal"—there are three or four others which I am not certain about.</p>

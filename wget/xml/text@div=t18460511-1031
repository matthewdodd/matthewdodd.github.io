                  </hi>. I am proprietor of an omnibus running from Islington to Chelsea. There are other omnibus proprietors on that road—the foreman receives the receipt of each omnibus from the conductor, daily, and sends it to the proprietor of that omnibus—in July last the prisoner was conductor of my omnibus—it was his duty to pay what he received to the foreman, Midwinter, daily—he is foreman to all the proprietors who run on that road—we generally reckon five journies each way daily, but it depends on the business of the day—on the 6th of July he performed six journies—Jones is the driver—it was the prisoner's duty to receive money from the passengers—at the end of each journey he takes a ticket, with the number of passengers inside and out, with the money received, and places the ticket in a box, and next morning he accounts for the money received—it was his duty to fill up the ticket and sign it—on that day he made no ticket of any journey, but at the end of the day filled up one, and inserted the whole day's journies—his duty in the morning, was to pay the total ticket with the money to the foreman, who should send it to me: and once a week the foreman makes up an account of each omnibus's earnings, and we meet and divide the money—if my omnibus earned more than another, I should have to hand a portion over <hi rend="italic">to</hi> another to make the amount equal—that arrangement is on purpose to prevent racing, and give better accommodation to the public—we do not divide the gross profits, but the earnings—each man works his own omnibus at his own expense—the conductor pays over the receipt of the day, short of his own wages—the prisoner did not come to work on the morning of the 7lh, which he ought to have done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the foreman, and live in Black Horse-yard, Islington—I am appointed by each of the masters. On the 6th of July the prisoner was conductor of Mr. Trevett's omnibus—there is a box kept at the Peacock, in which each conductor ought to leave a ticket at the end of each journey, to show what he has received, and on the following morning he pays the money to me for all the journies performed the previous day—he should give me with the money, the last ticket, which is an account of all the journies—I should forward the total money received to Mr. Trevett, in a bag marked</p>

               <p>with his name—on the 6th of July his omnibus ran six journies—no tickets were put into the box, nor on the morning of the 7th did he account to me for any of them, but quitted his employ—I did not see him again till last Monday week, when he was in custody—when the weather is very fine an omnibus may earn from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I was driver of Trevett's omnibus on the 6th of July—the prisoner was conductor—I accompanied him that day—we made six journies each way, and had inside passengers each journey—it was full at times—I should say the lowest sum it would earn that day was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we carry thirteen inside—I received the fares from nine outside passangers—that was the last journey out at night—that amounted to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I gave to the prisoner—I received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but one passenger belonged to me each way, and I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am paid wages besides when I am at work—I have one outside passenger each way, if I get them—that would be 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if I got them each way—I got 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that day—I paid the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the last journey, which was about twelve o'clock—I have nothing to do with the master—the conductor is responsible for all the money—I merely received it for the con<lb></lb>ductor for the convenience of the passengers—I did not see the prisoner again till he was apprehended—he had not given me any notice that he was about to leave—the tickets ought to be put into the box at each journey, but the last one is left with the money in the morning—that ticket comprehends the total journies.</p>

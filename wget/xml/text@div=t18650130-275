                  </hi>. I am a smith living at 4, Perry's-place, Cornwall-road, Borough—on Saturday, the 21st, the evening of the fog, I was walking near the Victoria Theatre—it was very foggy—I asked the prisoner the way to Cornwall-road; I am positive it was him—I saw him by the lamps of a public-house, as plainly as I see you; I was close to him—he told me I was in the right direction—he directed me along and then followed me perhaps twenty rods—he then stopped me in the road, pulled me by the arm, turned round before me, pulled open my coat, and put something in my face—this was against the railway-bridge in the Cornwall-road; not under the bridge—I saw him perfectly, and knew him again; it was the same man that had directed me—he put his hand in my pocket and took out 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I had there—I could not swear whether it was a handkerchief that he put in my face; something was put, a handkerchief was found and a knife by the side of my money that was dropped—I don't know whether I went down or not, for I was in a hurry to get hold of him to get my money—I expect I did go down, for my side was hurt—I felt stupefied for the moment and helpless, I could not do anything—I had not the power to follow him for the moment—I saw him turn round and run away—I saw 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a half-crown, and some halfpence picked up—25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was taken out of my pocket, all in silver—I gave a description of the prisoner to a police-constable, and he went after him directly and took him—the policeman came to my house the same night and took me to identify him—he was with some policemen dis<lb></lb>guised—I pointed him out and was positive he was the man.</p>

On the Saturday night in question be<lb></lb>tween 10 and 11, I was in the New Cut, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner—they walked past me down the Cornwall-road—I noticed the prisoner and can swear he is the man—I knew him previously, by sight and by name—he had hold of the prosecutor by the left arm—about twenty minutes afterwards the prosecutor gave me a description of the man who had robbed him—in pur<lb></lb>suance of that description I searched for the prisoner, and took him into custody about half an hour or three-quarters of an hour afterwards—he had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 159). On the Saturday night in question, I was standing in the Cornwall-road—I heard a fall—I went across the road, and saw the prosecutor standing—he gave me some information of being robbed, and said the man had just gone towards the Waterloo Station—I ran up the street to see if I could find him—I afterwards received a description from my brother-constable, in consequence of which I went after the prisoner—I found him at home, at his own house—I told him he was wanted for a robbery on the prosecutor—he said he knew nothing about it, it must be a mistake—he was asked at the station how much money he had got—he said, "About 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he was searched by Phelan, and a two-shilling piece, half-crown, and six-pennyworth of halfpence was found upon him—this cloth I received from the prosecutor on the Monday morning following—it was very dirty—I would not say it had any stuff upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been to St. Bartholomew's Hospital on this evening, to visit a man who had been injured by the falling of the cornice at Alderman Waterlow's; at the same time Alderman Lawrence was there visiting the sufferers. I had only just returned from there; it was very foggy indeed; it took me some time to get home. I went to meet the suffering man's wife, and saw her part of the way home, and came down the Cut into the Waterloo-road. I had not returned very long before the constable came and apprehended me for this offence. I am as innocent of it as any one of you.</p>

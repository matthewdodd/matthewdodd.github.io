               <p>Q. What do you accuse this man of - A. Of taking my coat, waistcoat, handkerchief and shirt on the 15th of March; on the 27th of February he came to my house to lodge, he said he had just come out of Newgate, he was destitute of money and clothes, he had been arrested for debt just as he arrived from the West Indies; my waistcoat, coat, and handkerchief, were hanging on the line to dry in the room; I left the room for any thing he might want in the night; I locked my outer door at half after ten at night; in the morning I sent my boy in to light the fire, he informed me Dunn was not there. I got up and found my things gone. I went to a house in Wapping, I found the prisoner there sitting by the fire side; he had my waistcoat and shirt on, he denied having my coat and handkerchief. The woman of the house said she would tell the truth and shame the devil - she said he came to her house the evening before, and said he came out of Newgate; he had a great coat on, she sent it out that morning to pawn for ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not you the man that gave me the shirt the first time that I came to your house - A. No, I lent you a flannel shirt, I did not lend you the cotton shirt, the coat, nor the waistcoat.</p>

            . I belong to the Thames police. In consequence of information from the prosecutor I went to Mrs. Callam's, King street, Wapping; I saw the prisoner sitting by the fire side; the prosecutor told me that was the man he was in search of. I asked him what he had done with the great coat and the other articles belonging to this man; he at first denied all knowledge of the things. Mrs. Callam knowing me, she told me she would tell the truth - she told me she had sent the great coat by Mrs. Hayes to pawn in Anchor and Hope alley, Wapping. I took the prisoner in custody. On searching him at the office I found three shirts on him, a red flannel one and two check cotton shirts, and a waistcoat; one of these shirts and waistcoat the prosecutor said were his; the landlady gave me the duplicate of the coat. The pawnbroker produced the coat at the office.</p>

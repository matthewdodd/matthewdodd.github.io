Another Evidence deposed, That afterwards he took up a Person that was in grey Cloaths, who he believed was the Prisoner, but could not say he was the Person, and that they were carrying him away Pick-a-pack, and he heard some of them say, Damn him, they have him; and that the whole Mob came running with their Swords drawn, and rescued him, crying out, One and all, upon which he was forced to leap down a great Ditch to make his escape. Another Evidence deposed, That she saw a Man run over the Field, with his Sword drawn, and did believe that it was the Prisoner.

Other Evidences deposed, That they came and saw a great many in the Riot, which still continued till the Constable was killed, which was about 8 a clock, and that the Prisoner was in a grey Coat with black Buttons.

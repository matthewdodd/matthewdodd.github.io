             sworn.</p>
               <p>Upon the 8th or 9th of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, as I was going to the masquerade, just coming out of my chair, between the chair and the house I felt a pull at my watch; there was a large croud there to look at the masques; I put my left hand to my watch, and turned round and seized the prisoner by the collar; the watch was not pulled out, for I got hold of it just as he gave the pull; he still kept pulling, though I spoke to him and desired him to desist; at last I felt his hand break from my watch; I had hold of him: the rings were broke directly from the watch; it was a very handsome gold enamelled chain, with a large red cornelian seal set in gold; I brought him into the Opera House, and then he abused me, and said, I was a pretty gentleman to accuse an innocent man like him, that got his bread in a decent way, and did not stand in need of any such thing; I then felt and found my chain was gone; I said, notwithstanding that, you have got my chain and must deliver it me directly: he was ready to be searched, but I did not find it on him; I turned his pockets out, but found nothing: the constable made him strip afterwards in the watch-house, but found nothing upon him.</p>

               <p>Court. Was you perfectly sober? - Yes; I hinted to him if he would produce my property I would not transport him; he said, travelling might tell for him in the long run, and I should have nothing of him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the Southwark district of the Metro—I politic Fire Brigade—about 2.30, on the morning of the 2nd August, I was called to a fire at the Dolphin public-house, in Red Cross Street, Borough—upon entering the house I noticed a strong smell of spirits pervading the house—I went over the house—in the cellar I found casks piled up in four different points, one on the top of the other, reaching nearly to the joisting—some wine laths were nailed to the joisting over the casks—they were charred—on the top of the top cask, in each place, I found some spirit, a kind of paraffin—that was also on the top of the casks—there had been fire at each of the four points—there were four of those pillars in the front cellar and two in the back, probably from 6 to 8 ft. apart—they could not have caught one from the other—there were four different fires—I went into the bar, and there saw two pie-dishes containing the same kind of side—there were two tubs with them—they appeared to be nine-gallon casks sawn asunder—the pie-dishes were on the floor, and the tubs along-side—there were marks of fire in both places—one was on the under<lb></lb>neath part of the shelves under the counter, and the other at the back of the bar—there was a cupboard under the stairs, which had been burnt out—I found an earthenware pan in that cupboard—it was broken, but a portion of it contained a spirit like paraffin, or benzoline—the stairs to the</p>

               <p>five or six Irishmen would attempt to roast him iii bio bed some day—I naked him if he had the letter, and he did not produce it—that conversation was in the front room, second-floor—when we came out on the landing I said, "You see there are some more of these tubs, Mr. Cusack"—he said, "Oh, I can plainly see somebody has set this place on fire; it was not me; I don't want any insurance money"—he was quite sober—I found altogether fourteen distinct fires in the house—I mean fourteen actually prepared for fire, and some had been on fire—it is a twelve-roomed house, reckoning the basement as two.</p>

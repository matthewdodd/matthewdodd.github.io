            , who lodged in the next room to me; about three months ago she worked at plain work for me. She told me she had sheets, laced ruffles, sattin, paduasoy, and other things, in pawn; and, as she was likely never to get them out, she said, if I could raise about 4 l. to get them out, I should have the preference in buying them. I, by borrowing, got that money; there were two guineas, one half guinea, and a 4 s. and 6 d. piece in gold, and the rest in silver. She saw me put it into an unlocked drawer; we were to go at half an hour after three o'clock to fetch the things. I went down stairs, and left my child with a friend: When I returned, which was in about two minutes, I found her standing with a shirt in her hand, which she was about. Then she desired me to go and borrow a basket, in order to bring a haunch of venison home with us, that she pretended was sent her out of the country. When I returned, which was in about five or six minutes, she and my money were gone, all but one shilling. She then went by the name of Morgan; this was on the 2d of September, before she married Mr. Errington.</p>

Mrs. Hardy went down stairs, and I do not remember any-body coming into her room the time she was gone, which was about four or five minutes; my door faces hers, and stood open; but I being busy in putting my child into the cradle, did not see the prisoner go away. Mrs. Hardy missed her money immediately upon her coming home again.</p>

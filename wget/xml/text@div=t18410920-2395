                  </hi>. I am in the service of George Twait, a carrier, at Chel<lb></lb>sea. I used to call day by day at the prosecutor's warehouse for parcels—I called on the 8th of July, and received four trusses directed to Mr. Rooper, of Chelsea, and one to Mr. Harvey, of Knightsbridge—I received 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the four trusses and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the one—I signed it, and entered the 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is my signature in the book, "E.

This sum of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. has been allowed to the prisoner—the additional 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being put in before the 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in consequence of a com<lb></lb>munication made to my partner by Evans, one of our porters, we had the prisoner apprehended.</p>
               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">EVANS</hi>. I am an under porter in the prosecutor's employ. I made a communication to one of the prosecutor's young men about the prisoner's book—about twelve months ago I told the prisoner there were some things in his book which were not right—I told him what it was, but it is so long ago I forget now—something more was charged than ought to have been, and I said he ought to be careful with his books, or he would get himself out of place—the prisoner said I ought to think of his family—I said, "If you thought of your family you would not do such things"—that was all that passed then.</p>

                  </hi>. Here is a column headed "called for by," and the name "E. Lee," appears in the next column—the prisoner has been in the habit of writing the word "by"—this "Rooper, Chelsea cart, (called for by) four trusses, B. Harvey, Knightsbridge, one truss," is in the prisoner's handwriting—I cannot speak to the figures—we never, in any instance, pay more than 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for each truss—the entry imports that it will be called for by the carrier—the carriage would not be paid—the carriage is never paid in any case to those parties.</p>

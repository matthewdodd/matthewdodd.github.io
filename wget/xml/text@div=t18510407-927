In Jan. last I lived in Queen-street, Golden-square—the prisoner had been my servant about three weeks and two days—she came to me from the workhouse—I had no apartment for her in the house, and she used to come at nine o'clock every morning—on 10th Jan. she came to my room at eight in the morning, to fetch my boots and dress, to brush them—I was in bed—I said I thought she was early; she said, "No"—I took up my watch, and said she was an hour earlier, and laid it down on the table again—she took the dress and boots, came back with a duster, and began cleaning the room—I was still in bed—she began to dust the table, and took my watch up—I told her to lay it down, as she might break it; she said, "I am going to put it in a little box in the dressing-room, where you keep it" and immediately went out of the room, shut the door, and locked me in, according to my orders—I got up in about an hour—I had not slept afterwards—I went to the little box, and my watch was not there—I rang the bell very loudly three times, and called out of the window, but the prisoner did not answer—the landlady's servant came up, and opened the door—I missed a blue silk dress, a mantle, a pair of boots, my watch and chain, some <hi rend="italic">charms,</hi> and a petticoat; they were worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I was servant to Mr. Forster, of Queen-street, Golden-square. I left last Monday—on 10th Jan. I was coming down-stairs, and saw the prisoner go into Mrs. Lester's room—I saw her go in twice, and she said her mistress wanted her to go out directly with a parcel—I saw her leave with a bundle, about a quarter to nine—she told me once that if she got a little money, she would go to Ireland first, and then to America.</p>

            . I am a salesman in Spittalfields Markets. On the 7th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, I saw the Norfolk waggon going through <placeName id="t18120115-83-crimeloc490">Paternoster Row, leading to Union Street</placeName>

When the trunk was out they all three went away, I followed them, the waggon went up Church Street, and they went down Red Lion Street, quite a different direction, I seized the prisoner, one of the other men was carrying the box on his shoulder, and the moment that I seized the prisoner the man that had the box threw it down and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw two men get into the waggon, and the box handed out to the third, I suppose you could not say the third man was the prisoner. - A. No, I took the prisoner and the box to a place of safety, the prisoner made no resistance, he was close to the man that was carrying the box. I have hardly a doubt that he was one of the three persons.</p>

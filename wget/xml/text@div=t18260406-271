On the 15th of March the prisoner Jones came to my shop, with another man, and while they were looking at some ribbed worsted stockings, Barry came in; they did not seem to know one another. Barry asked to look at some caps, gloves, and stockings, which were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060106"></xptr>shown him - he took his hat off, and put it on the counter to try a cap on, I believe - my wife was serving him; Jones and the other were looking at a variety of things. I kept my eye closely upon them; I afterwards saw Barry put his hat upon his head - he had bought one pair of lamb's-wool stockings and a cap, and paid for them; the others agreed for a pair of stockings, paid 6d. on them, and left them - Mr. Davies came in, and told Barry, who was going away, to take off his hat, and two pairs of these stockings were found in it - he first said they must have got in without his knowledge, and then he said one pair was his own, but I knew they were mine; he had what he had bought in his hand. Jones and the other were very near him.</p>

            . I live near Sansom. The prisoners came to my shop to purchase a waistcoat - they gave me a great deal of trouble, and at last Barry offered me money which I would not take; they went away. The other man, who is not here, came in afterwards, and agreed for one - he told me to put it away for him. After they were gone I missed a new waistcoat - I suspected Barry, as he had taken his hat off two or three times. I went and found him in Sansom's shop.</p>

            : On the 17th of September, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner take a pair of trowsers from the door, and put them under his jacket; I was in the room behind the shop; I went into the shop; he brought the trowsers in concealed under his jacket; he was followed by Mr. Hunter, who also saw him take the trowsers; I had him secured, and took him to Marlborough-street; I don't know what he came in for, I suppose he saw he was discovered; he asked me to let him go; they have my mark upon them; the string was broke off.</p>

             sworn. - I keep a shop in Queen-street; I was following the prisoner, and saw him take the trowsers with one hand, and give them a jerk; finding they would not come down, he lifted them higher up; he then took hold of them with both hands, and by force got them from the hook; he rolled them up very carefully, put them under his jacket, and immediately went into the shop; I crossed, and went in after him; I told Mr. Pritchett that that man had just taken a pair of trowsers from the door; the prisoner dropped them upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I asked the price of them twice, and nobody answered, and then I went into the shop, and they said I had stole them.</p>

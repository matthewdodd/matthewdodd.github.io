                  </hi>. I am assistant inspector of the General Post letter carriers. The prisoner was a General Post letter carrier for the Temple division—on the 30th of August, in consequence of suspicion, I obtained the sanction of Mr. Bower, clerk to Mr. Thesiger, to have a letter directed to him, containing coins—I made up a letter, containing a sovereign, half-a-crown, and shilling, directed it to "Mr. Bower, F. Thesiger, Esq., Temple, London"—I marked the coins myself with a broken-pointed penknife, and am quite able to swear to the marks again—I showed the letter to my superior, Mr. Kelly, and showed him the marks I had made on the money—I put a wafer in the letter, and handed it to Mr. Kelly, who affixed a stamp to the wafer—I afterwards had it, kept it in my possession till the following morning, when I gave it to Mr. Clare—Mr. Boyden, another assistant inspector, was with him—I afterwards went to the Temple, and saw Mr. Bower—I got back to the post-office about twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner about one—he was brought to the office by Mr. Boyden in custody, taken into Mr. Kelly's room, and questioned—Mr. Peacock was present—he was told a letter had been missed on his walk that morning, and was asked to account for that letter—he said he had delivered all the let<lb></lb>ters he took out that morning for delivery—he was afterwards searched by Tyrrell, the officer, who took out of his pocket some silver—I saw among it a half-crown piece, which I immediately recognised as the one I put into the letter—he said he had brought it from home that morning—I am quite positive the one now produced is it, by a slight mark at the termination of the hair at the nape of the neck—it was made by pressing the knife on it, and moving the coin round—it is almost a circular hole—I made a si<lb></lb>milar mark on the sovereign and shilling, all in the same place—a shilling and sovereign were afterwards produced to me, which I knew again by the same mark.</p>

Thesiger, Esq., Temp le"—I placed it with the letters which were sorted for the Temple carrier to take out—I saw Charles Page take the letter up with others from the inland office, where I was, and take it towards the letter carriers' office—the letter was in the prisoner's delivery, and in the regular course of the office would come into his hands—he left the office about half-past eight o'clock that morning I think—he was on duty that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Cleveland Arms, Montague-street, Portman<lb></lb>square. On the 1st of September, I received three sovereigns from Mr. Findley—I changed one, and took the other two into the country with me the same day, and remained there one night—Mr. Giblet went with me—we slept in the same room in the country, and previous to going to bed I placed them on the dressing-table—I missed them the same night, and next morning Mr. Giblet gave them to me—I came to town in the evening, and delivered one of the two sovereigns to Tyrrell which I had received from Giblet.</p>

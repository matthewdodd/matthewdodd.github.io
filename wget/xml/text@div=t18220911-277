            . I am acquainted with Mr. Bell. In April last he had nearly eight hundred prints of Buona-parte, in a cupboard in the front room, up two pair of stairs, in his office in <placeName id="t18220911-277-crimeloc1458">Drury-lane</placeName>

I did so; there were between eight and nine hundred. On the 9th of July, he sent for me again - I counted them, and missed two hundred and sixty-three. I saw four or five of them afterwards, in possession of Coombs, and knew them; they were proof impressions. I never saw the prisoner at the house. The heading of the cupboard in which they had been placed was forced off, which enabled persons to open it without unlocking it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You only know them by their being proofs - A. Yes; the print had never been regularly published; nobody but Bell had proofs. I know one in particular, by its being coloured in a particular way - no coloured ones were published.</p>

            . I keep the Pigeons, public-house, in Houndsditch. On the 7th of June, the prisoner called at my brother's house, and said to me,</p>
               <p>"I believe you are going to housekeeping, here is something for you to furnish your house," presenting me with four prints of Buona-parte, and one of Hunt. He said if I should see Mr. Lee at any time, not to tell him of it, as he might be jealous. I gave them to Mr. Hulm, the broker - the prisoner called ten or twelve days after, and I told him I had given them away, as framing was very expensive. He said he had bought above two hundred, and he would give me some more, and he brought a large roll to leave at my house - I asked him to pay me what he owed me; he said I might take them - I refused. He left them, and a few days after I shewed them to Mr. Pass. The prisoner came, and fetched them away three or four days after that.</p>

            . I am a carver and gilder. Greaves shewed me the prints, and on the 6th of July, I saw the prisoner; he said he had some prints for sale. On the 28th he called about them; they were prints of Napoleon. He said he was going to give some to a friend in Somerset House, and I should have the rest cheap - he offered me about twenty for 15 s., I bought them. Mr. Soffe saw them in my window exposed for sale. I valued them at 1 s. each.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 6th of July. I apprehended the prisoner at the Mitre, public-house, in Shoe-lane, after waiting there about two hours. I told him what I took him for - he said he took them out of a cupboard - that the first lot he took he thought was waste paper. I took him to the office. He said he had been in possession at Mr. Bell's under an execution.</p>

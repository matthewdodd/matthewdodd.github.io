            , Bedford-place. On the 9th of this month I was cleaning the drawing-room window, I saw this prisoner come to our area gate, he tried it, and found it was locked; he went to several other area gates, and tried them, untill he came to No. 16, he found the area gate open; he went down the area steps, I watched until he came out; he stood below in the area some time; when he came up the area-steps he made away with something in his side pocket, and buttoned up his coat, and crossed to the other side of the way, and coming up to our house again seemingly; he seemed to be very pleased, and as soon as he got opposite of our door; I halloaed to him, he looked up at me; I said, I want to speak to you; he came into the middle of the street, I came down and opened the street-door, he was running; I ran after him; he ran up Russel-street and turned into Bury-street; I pursued him and took him; I asked him what he had got; he said, nothing belonging to me; I told him I knew he had something in his pocket, and I should see what it was; I opened the front of his coat, and found a silver salt, and a silver spoon; I took them out. Soon after I stopped him I saw a man, he said, deliver him up to me and the goods; I thought he was a constable by his demand, and instead of the man taking the prisoner into Bedford-place he took him up Montague-place; I halloed to the man to bring the prisoner back; I ran after him and stopped him again; a constable came up then, and we took him back to Bedford-place, No. 16.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Sawyer—he lived with me at No. 42, Devonshire Street, New North Road—the prisoners lodged in the same house, in the back room first floor—I was not aware of any one living in the room but themselves—a woman named Perry, and her niece, lodged in the front room on the same floor—a sister of mine lived with me, and slept in the shop—on Thursday evening, 18th Feb., a policeman came to me about dusk—I went to bed about a quarter to 12 o'clock that night, I do not know whether the prisoners were in their room then or not—after I had gone to bed I heard somebody come in at the front door and go up stairs to the prisoner's room; my husband then went and bolted the front door and came to bed again—about ten minutes afterwards we heard foot<lb></lb>steps stealthily come down the stairs again, and some one unbolt the back door leading into the garden—upon hearing that we both got out of bed and went into the passage, and found the female prisoner and a man with<lb></lb>out shoes or hat—I had seen that man before in my shop—my husband asked what he wanted there—he said he lived up stairs; my husband said he was not aware of it, and asked him in what room—he said the back room; my husband turned to me, and asked if I had let the room to that man—I said I had not, but I had let it to that woman (pointing to the female pri<lb></lb>soner), and that on one occasion when I spoke to her about this man, she had called him her brother; she said if I spoke a word she would take my life, and she rushed at me, and seized me by the hair; and she called my hus<lb></lb>band a most awful name—when she caught me by the hair he passed his</p>

               <p>hand between her and me, and she said if he interfered she would kick his inside out, using a very low expression at the same time—she partly pulled me up stairs by my hair, and she commenced kicking my husband in the stomach with her feet—just at that time the male prisoner came down; he said that the man was a lodger of his, and he would have him in the room whether we liked it or not; my husband said he was no lodger of his and he would have him out of the house, he would send for the police and have him removed if he did not go quietly—the male prisoner said, "I will let you see whether I will have him in the room or not, "and he struck him in the mouth, and raised his knee and drove it right into my husband's side—my husband was then standing about the middle of the stairs, and the male prisoner was above him—he pressed his knee somewhere about the side, under the ribs, and pressed him against the wall—I screamed out, "Murder! don't murder him"—and my husband exclaimed, "Oh!" and stooped down—during all this time the female prisoner had not released her hold of my hair—she released me then, and my husband, when his hand was disengaged, stept down to the bottom of the stairs—I called "Murder!" and my sister came; I do not know at what time she came—I do not know whether the female prisoner kicked my husband after the male prisoner came, for she had my head bent down so that I could only see her feet move kicking into his side—she had pulled my head down, and I kept it down for fear of her striking my face—I saw her kick him in the side and stomach; she was then on the stairs over his head—he had done nothing to her before the male prisoner kicked him; I do not believe he touched her, I did not see him do so—apoliceman afterwards came, and the strange man was removed—the prisoners went up to their own room, swearing they would have our lives the first time they laid hands upon us—We went into our room and went to bed—nextday my husband walked with me to the Temple to his solicitors; he was not well, he complained of pain in his side; we went to Worship Street to give information, but they would not hear to it—on the Saturday he was worse—he still complained of pain in his side, and I applied a mustard poultice to it—I then sent for Mr. Simpson who attended him till his death on 9th March; he continued to complain of his side all the time.</p>

On Thursday night, 18th Feb., I was awoke by the screams of my sister—I left the shop and went through the passage, and saw the male prisoner having hold of Mr. Sawyer by the hair of his head—theprisoners were very near the top of the stairs above Mr. Sawyer—he was about the middle of the stairs against the banisters—I saw the male prisoner give him a very violent kick on the side—at that time I went out into the street, and called "Police!" and two policemen came—I saw the female prisoner—she had hold of my sister by the hair of her head, and my sister was rather in a bending position.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in City Terrace, City Road. On Saturday evening, 20th Feb., I was called to Sawyer's house, in Cavendish Street—I examined him, and found his left side very much swollen; he was also complaining of very great pain in that ride just below the left breast—Idirected the usual treatment, medicine for pleurisy, and ordered leeches—I ordered him to remain perfectly quiet, and to abstain from liquor—I saw him again on Sunday; he was much worse then—I continued to see him every day until he died—he got gradually worse, and died on the evening of 9th March, about half-past 8 o'clock—he made a statement to me about half-past 2 o'clock on the Monday—I had before that told his wife, in his presence, that I thought there was no hope of his recovery; that was intended for him to hear—he said he thought he should never get better, and he said so fre<lb></lb>quently during the time I attended him—when I told his wife, in his presence, that I thought there was no hope of his recovery, he made no remark imme<lb></lb>diately, but about two or three minutes afterwards he said he thought he should never get better—I then asked him to tell me exactly how the accident had occurred—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that this evidence was not sufficient to admit the statement as a dying declaration; Mr. Justice Byles was of opinion that it was sufficient, and would admit the statement</hi>)—as near as I can recollect the words, he said, "I was standing on the stairs when Mrs. Hutchins kicked me in the stomach; she did not hurt me, but Mr. Hutchins pressed his knee into my side, and I believe that to be my death-blow"—that was all he said—hedied about four or five hours after wards—he was in a very exhausted state at that time, but perfectly sensible—on the following Friday I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found a bruise on the left side and on the back; corresponding to that, another bruise—I also found the ribs on that side depressed in front—the expression of the face was highly painful, and a little frothy mucous was issuing from the mouth—I afterwards opened the body—Ifound the brain slightly congested, but nothing more than usual—I opened the chest—on the left side I found some slight amount of effusion, on cutting through the covering of the lungs, and on examining the lower lobe of the left lung in the pleura, under the place corresponding with the injury it was in a highly inflammable state, and the lungs also were very much inflamed—I cut through the pleura—I found nothing particular on the external surface; on the internal surface it was very much inflamed and almost in a state of gangrene from the acute inflammation, and also some amount of effusion in that cavity—thelower lobe of the left lung was also in a very inflamed state—in my opinion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050047"></xptr>
               <p>the external injury was the cause of death; I mean the blow or pressure on the left side—I have not the slightest doubt of it—the pressure of a person's knee would be sufficient to cause that injury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you discover any signs of an old injury to the ribs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he had been subject to piles—I saw no marks of any old fracture, nor did I discover any injury; he was about thirty-three years of age—he was not a healthy man—I should imagine he had taken a great amount of stimulant in early life; he was not particularly thin.</p>

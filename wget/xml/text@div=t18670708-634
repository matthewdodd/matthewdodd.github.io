                  </hi> I live at 37, Freeschool Street, Horslydown—on 23rd June I was on a visit at the General Elliott public-house, Queen's Road East—I was serving in the bar in the afternoon—the prisoner came in about half-past four, and called for a pot of beer, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a bad shilling, which I took into the bar parlour to Mr. Clark, the landlord—I went back to the prisoner, took the beer from him, which he had commenced to drink, put it back into the sink, and told him the shilling was bad—he made no answer—the landlord came and asked him how many more he had got—he said that he had not got another farthing—a constable was called in, who searched him, and I saw another bad shilling fall from his pocket on to the floor—I did not bend the shilling uttered to me, nor was it bent when it was uttered.</p>

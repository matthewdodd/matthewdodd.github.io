The prisoner lodged next door to me; she and another woman came in my room, the other woman took the ring and she took the watch; the prisoner came to ask me to mend her a pair of shoes. When she went out she put the hasp of the padlock on, I could not get out; it was a month before I could get the prisoner into custody; I have had twice hold of her but she got away. The other we took out of bed on the Tuesday as this happened on the Sunday. That woman was prosecuted, and I had my watch again.</p>

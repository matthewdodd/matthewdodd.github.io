               <p>Court. I suppose you mean violent? - Yes; I left the woman, and seized hold of him again, and in the struggle he knocked down that cup; that stood withinside the fire place, within about six inches of his knee; it stood atop of the hearth: seeing the cup broke I gathered it up together; there is a composition in it; when the water was thrown down that was in the pitcher, there was a quantity of salt in this paper, and the water fell on the salt, so that I could not gather up the salt; here is the paper; I could not pick it up; I tasted it; on the side of his left foot was this sand; it appears to be common sand, and this stone, and a cork; it is a whetstone, and a common bit of cork, and this sixpence not coloured, and this pair of pliers by his left side, and a file, and this strap, a piece of leather by his feet; we secured the man and tied his hands; and when he got up, I found this small piece of brass which are cuttings; by the side of the woman there was a basket; I asked her if that was her basket; she said, yes, it was her's, there was nothing there but a few pins and a few ballads; I searched it, and found these four sixpences, this bad sixpence, and this brimstone; then I secured her; and Beamish and me took them to the round-house; she desired I would take great care of the things in the basket, for that every thing in the basket was hers, and so I did.</p>
               <p>Did she say this after she had seen you take out the things? - Yes; and the man likewise desired I would take care of them, for they were all his; I took him before the Magistrate, and he told the Magistrate the things were all his, before Mr. Clarke.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. It is a room in which other people lodge.</p>

               <p>I have been employed for these fourteen or fifteen years in his Majesty's mint, for these prosecutions; I have attended this Court near upon twenty years.</p>
               <p>Look at all these things, and explain to the Court and Jury the process that has been carried on by people having these things in their custody? - If this composition is discovered in Court, every man will be his own coiner for sixpence; this is a sheet of brass, from which apparently such blanks as these have been cut.</p>
               <p>Is that a piece of brass of a size fit to cut blanks to resemble a sixpence? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>These square pieces are cut from that larger one? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Having made them square, what do they do next? - Cut them round with a pair of scissars, and after having cut them round, they generally use a file in order to take the roughness of the scissars from it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210071"></xptr>the file which is produced, had been made use of apparently from the brass upon it; these are squares they afterwards cut round; these round ones have been so cut; then they are filed round the edge; after this, to take off the grease, they rub them either with scowering paper, or with such a rubber as this, which is a piece of leather nailed on wood; this rubber has been used by somebody; the next thing is the colouring, there is one there which has been coloured, but has not been finished; this was the one that was found in the man's hand.</p>
               <p>How does that appear, has it been kept separate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at these four? - These four have been finished.</p>
               <p>When they are in that state is it compleat? - It is compleat for putting off; they were a great deal better when I saw them before, but they lose their whiteness by keeping, and the reason why they lose their whiteness, is on account of the want of silver being mixed with the brass.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing produced to you now which will produce the colour of silver upon brass? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is every thing there that has been produced to you, sufficient to transact such business, sufficient to colour blanks to resemble sixpences, or shillings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say then, that among these things found in the prisoner's lodgings, there all were materials, and tools necessary for making counterfeit sixpences and shillings, so as to give it a probable chance of passing for true money? - Not a doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Have you any witnesses? - That woman, I asked her before the Justice if ever she knew that I made any such in my life; God knows who left them there, I know nothing of them; as for the woman's moving the basket when that drunken woman's bed was down, there was only a passage to the fire place.</p>

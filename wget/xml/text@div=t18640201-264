                  </hi>. I live in the same house as the prisoner, and sleep with his daughters—on 27th December, about 7 in the morning, I was in his room dressing myself—there was no light there—he was beating his wife in bed—he jumped out of bed in his shirt, caught hold of me, put one hand on my hair, and drew something across my throat which cut me—I said, "Mr. Ford, it is me, "and then he let me go—I put my hand up, and found blood coming—I hallooed out, "Sister," and my brother-in-law came instead of her, and took me down stairs—I was taken to the hospital, and was there four weeks—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner; he is blind with one eye—he was sober, but had been drinking the night before.</p>

On 27th December, about half-past 7, I was called to 5, Burton-entry, Stepney, and found Catherine Mahoney bleeding from a cut in her throat—she said, in the prisoner's presence, that he had stabbed her with a knife—he was quite sober—I asked him where the knife was; he was then sitting on the side of the bed, and said, "It was not done with a knife at all"—I searched the room, and con<lb></lb>cealed at the bottom of a box containing a small bag of flour, a small bag of meal, and some wearing apparel, I found this razor covered with blood—I asked him if it belonged to him, and he said, "Yes"—his wife was taken out of the room by the brother-in-law of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the London Hospital—on 27th December Catherine Mahoney was brought there, and I found an incised wound on the left side of her neck three or four inches long, penetrating through the skin, which was quite loose from the tissues, but it was not a deep wound—she was in the hospital about a month, and is now quite recovered—it will not inflict any permanent injury—there was not much loss of blood, but it was some time before it healed—some small vessels were cut; it was behind the larger vessels.</p>

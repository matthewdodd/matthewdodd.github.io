             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, Sir; I was coming out of Spitalfields about twelve at night, on the <rs id="t17820109-43-cd226" type="crimeDate">26th of December</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t17820109-43-off224 t17820109-43-cd226"></join>, and going up to Islington, I saw the prisoner and his companion, they crossed me in Old-street first, I went to go up the city road, about one hundred yards from the lying-in hospital; they meant to stop me, and I ran away from them, they gave one another the whistle; I went into <placeName id="t17820109-43-crimeloc227">Old-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at the time he presented the pistol? - I did, Sir; it was a moonlight night, the moon was rather cloudy, but it was light enough; he was so near, I felt the chop of a cutlass over my shoulder, at the time the pistol cracked; he lodged seven slugs in my back, they were within a yard of me when they fired; I ran then to the turnpike house; I had seen them twice before; here is the coat they shot through, the muzzle of the pistol split the coat here all to pieces. (The coat shewn in Court.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My life is taken away for want of my friends coming to speak for me; I cannot send for my witnesses, because I am confined, I can get nobody to fetch them; I have been in the cells, and I have not a friend to send for them; my landlord knows I was at home in Cow Cross, I spent the afternoon there, and was with my friends till eleven o'clock at night. It is very hard my life must be taken away, because I cannot send for my friends.</p>
               <p>To Ellingham. Did you know the prisoner immediately, as soon as you saw him after he was taken up? - Yes; as soon as I saw him go into the coach at New Prison, when I first saw him after the fact.</p>

Between six and seven o'clock the next morning, I heard the prisoner unlock the street - door and shut it again; I got up in about half an hour, missed the box, and had him apprehended about nine o'clock that morning - He was discharged on the 17th. After he was discharged I watched him all the next day, and saw him go into a pawnbroker's, in Long-acre; I followed him in, and saw him offer two strings of beads and a broach, in pledge; he could not see me, but I could see him - I went round to the private boxes, where he was, secured him, and took him to Bow-street. I went to Cherry's house, where I had seen him go in and come out, and found the box which I had lost.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HUMPHRIES. I am an officer. I found the box at Cherry's house, in the Almonry, Westminster. I took the prisoner into custody, at the pawnbroker's, and found two rings, a seal, a sovereign, and a half-sovereign, on him. I took the beads, broach, and several other things, which the prosecutor claimed.</p>

I live at Cherry's; the prisoner came there with another man, and asked for her, I said she was ill in bed; he went into her room with a box, and covered it over with a handkerchief, and put it in the cupboard. They staid there about an hour, and then came down - They opened the box up stairs, it was fastened when they carried it up, but open when they came down; Cherry keeps a lodging-house.</p>

I live near Guanneri's in Old Brentford—on a Monday morning, I think the 20th December, we had been drinking in a public-house—I asked Guanneri what he had been fighting with my cousin for—he hit me with a knife, and I threw him on the ground—I saw the knife—some blood came on my trousers—we were in the garden—I called the prisoner out—he came out and then went back—I called him again—he refused to come—I stopped some time; then a customer came and took me away—I did not strike the prisoner.</p>

I live at the Fox and Hounds, Old Brentford—on Saturday, 27th December, followed Christof up the yard leading to my House—he was not sober—he met the prisoner and spoke to him in Italian—the prisoner had a knife in his hand—he caught hold of Christof's collar, but Christof was quick and got the prisoner on the ground—I did not see the knife used.</p>

About 10.15 on December 27th I went with Policeman T 484 to this yard in Old Brentford—I saw Christof with a wooden pole in his hand, and he was drunk and very excited—he was bleeding from a wound on the face—I went into the house and saw Guanneri, who was also drunk and bleeding from a wound over the nose—Guanneri gave Christof into custody, and Christof com<lb></lb>plained of being stabbed—I afterwards went back to the yard and found this white-handled table knife—there was no blood on it—a woman handed me this knife in the house, and I found this knife on Christof. (<hi rend="italic">Three knives were produced</hi>)—I found a knife on Guanneri at the station—Guanneri said to Christof at the station "You have stabbed me"—Christof said, pointing to his left side, "You have stabbed me here"—I saw the wound on his left side.</p>

I am a surgeon at Brentford—on the 27th December I was called to the police-station at Brentford—I examined Christof and found under the seventh rib a small punctured wound—these Knives were produced to me before the Magistrate—neither of them is Narrow enough to have caused the wound—the wound penetrated under The skin, and must have glanced off the rib to the extent of a little more than 2 or 3 inches—I measured it by a probe—he also had a slight wound beneath the left eyelid—the wound under the rib would have been very dangerous if it had penetrated farther—I should say it was inflicted with considerable force.</p>

               <p>Q. Does the prisoner live in the house - A. She is there of a day, but not in the night. On the 18th of April, in the morning, I missed my bonnet and found the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>MR. FRIEND. I am an officer, I apprehended the prisoner on the 12th of May, at night, I asked the prisoner what she had done with the property that she had robbed this woman of, she at first denied any knowledge of it, but afterwards told me that she could produce some of the property, the greatest part she had disposed of. She said that she was shut out of her lodgings, that she went to Mrs. Peacock's house and shoved back the bolt of the door and took these articles, stated in the indictment; she said it was between twelve and one in the morning. On the next day, when the prosecutrix came to the office, she identified a gown, cap, petticoat, and shift; they were all upon the prisoner's back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was a lodger in the house, that woman there was a lodger there likewise. The door was left open at all hours of the night, and the things that she has said of me is wrong. She sent to me that she would make it up for six pounds. I am not guilty of every thing than I am accused of.</p>

On the 23rd of March, at ten minutes before seven o'clock in the evening, I went out, I locked my room door, and left the key in the landlord's room down stairs - I was absent about twenty-five minutes; when I came home I took the wrong key up by mistake, and could not open the door; and as I went down to change the key I heard a noise, and looked round and saw two men come out of my room. I called out, "Hallo, what do you want there?" they said they were only going to inquire for a friend, and at the same time they were rushing past me; I caught one by the coat, and followed them down stairs, calling thieves - Mrs. Green opened the door of her room, with a light in her hand - she alarmed the men in the shop, who ran into the street - she came to my assistance, and we stopped both the men in the passage, by the door, but they got out - I followed one to the corner of the house, where I saw my husband take hold of one of them - he had ran out on hearing the alarm - he took Connolly; the other was followed as far as Blenheim-steps, and was not taken that night. I have no doubt about Connolly, for he was taken in my sight. Cooke was the other man, I swear positively - I knew him to be the same man when I saw him, and I swore positively to him; I was present when Connolly was searched - nothing was found on him, but in a pitcher of water, which stood in the shop under where he stood, a purse was found containing three sovereigns, a silk handkerchief, and three skeleton-keys - I lost nothing from the room but the purse, handkerchief and three sovereigns - it was my purse, and contained that money - it was left in a drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long after the transaction was Cooke taken? A.More than a fortnight - I never said I did not think he was the man - it was dark when I came home - I was rather confused - I kept hold of the skirt of one of their coats till I got to the bottom of the stairs, but I saw them both plainly when they stopped in the passage - the struggle lasted not more than ten minutes - we had a candle in the passage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far is your house from Blenheim-steps, where Connolly was taken? A. It is not more than ten houses from our house - I only took hold of one of their coats - Connolly was brought into the shop after he was taken - there was only one person in the shop, whom my husband was shaving - there was a crowd round the door, and a man came in before he went out - nobody else came into the shop - other people stood by the door - there might be four or five persons altogether in the shop when the pitcher was searched, but there was no more at that end of the shop; they had not been round the prisoner - I cannot say who might have gone near the pitcher - when I came down there was not more than five persons in the shop - he denied all knowledge of the things in the pitcher, but I saw him put something down - I told the Magistrate so - I never said, that when I went out I found the street door open.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure your door was locked? A.Quite sure.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far are the steps from your house? A.About ten houses.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You was not frightened? A. I was rather alarmed - the passage is about ten yards long - the prisoners rushed by me as quick as they could - I instantly followed them, and saw their faces - they could not get out of the door so quick as they wished - they stood sideways, and looked me in the face, both of them - the candle was not above a yard from the door - I had it in my hand, and my child in my arms - I was rather alarmed - the child is four years and a half old - I did not see Cooke again for more than a fortnight - I cannot tell the colour of his coat or cravat, I took most notice of his face - he had a black hat on - I saw his face and his hat too.</p>

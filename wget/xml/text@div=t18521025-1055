                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 135). On 13th September last I was on duty at Camberwell station—about 7 o'clock in the evening, I was sent for to the house of Mr. Stevens, a victualler, who keeps the Bricklayers' Arms, Camberwell—when I got there, I saw the prisoner outside the house—there were about one hundred and fifty people collected about the house—my attention was drawn to a cut on the back part of the prisoner's head, and the clothes he had on seemed to be bathed in his blood—I spoke to him, and asked him to accompany me to a doctor, to have his wound dressed—he con<lb></lb>sented, and walked along with me about a dozen yards—when he had got</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250078"></xptr>
               <p>that distance, he stooped down and caught hold of me my the small of my legs, and threw me on my back—he then jumped on my chest and bowels three different times—he then threw himself down on my body, put his hand in between my neck and my stock, and would have choked me if it had not been for the clasp of my stock giving way—he then said, "You b—b—, I shall do for you now"—I struggled with him, and got on the top of him—I caught hold of his hands, and he made an effort to bite me—he tried to bite me more than once—I was not able to keep hold of him—I was obliged to let his hands go in consequence, and let him get up; and I got up on my legs—the prisoner was then about four yards from me—he had his hands clenched, and I thought he was coming towards me to strike me in the face or body with his hands—I prepared to defend myself from his blows, when he ran at me with his head—his head was lowered quite low, and he ran his head right in against my privates—he then caught hold of my legs, and pitched me on my back—I fell to the ground, three yards or more from him—when he got hold of me, he rose me right up, and I fell on my back three yards from the place where he stood—while I was upon my back he came towards me, and kicked me in the privates, and in the body; he said, at the same time, "You b—b—, I will do for you now"—I was lying on the ground for several moments before I was able to get up; the prisoner stood just over me while I was lying there—I got on my legs again, and the prisoner knocked me down again with his head, in the same manner as before, but he did not pitch me right away from him as he did before—he struck me again in the same part with his head; and while I was on the ground he kicked me on the right hip—I had a watch in my pocket, and the next kick he gave me (he meant to kick me in the privates, I have no doubt) broke the watch that was in my pocket—at the time he was kicking me he said, "You b—b—, I shall give you another <hi rend="italic">downer</hi>, and you will never rise"—I got on my legs again after some moments—I then drew my truncheon—I heard some party in the crowd say, "Well done, Cannon, give it the b—"—the prisoner on that, strove to get my truncheon away from me several times—I was able to defend myself with my truncheon until other assistance came—another constable, named Thorn, soon afterwards came up the prisoner knocked Thorn down directly—Thorn managed to get on the top of him, and I also got on the top of him, thinking to keep him down, and he kicked me off, and kicked me in the body, and on the right shin—several other constables soon after came up to my assistance—it required six constables and three civilians to hold him, and convey him to the station house—directly I got to the station house I was taken to Mr. Flower, the surgeon of the division—I was confined to my bed for three weeks; I am still under his care; I am suffering pain now—none of the persons who were standing round the public house offered me the least assistance—I asked several of them to do so, but none of them would.</p>

On the evening in question, in consequence of a disturbance at my house, I had occasion to send to the police station for assistance—it was in the dusk of the evening—I cannot exactly say what time it was; it may have been a quarter or 20 minutes-past 6 o'clock—there was a very great crowd outside my house—when I first saw the prisoner he was standing by my door—I went and wished him to move on, and no sooner did I say that than he struck at me, but did not strike me—I was then very unwell, and under medical treatment, and I went indoors and sent for the police—I noticed that the prisoner had a wound on his head at that time, from which blood had been flowing.</p>

I was near the Bricklayers' Arms, Camberwell—I saw the prisoner there—I did not see Dwyer come up—I was there before he came up, and saw the prisoner in a very turbulent way; no one dare pass on the path—he was drunk—I saw a wound on his head, and blood about his person—I did not hear Dwyer say anything to the prisoner when he first came up—he wished him to allow him to take him to the doctor—the prisoner went with him about two or three yards, so that I thought he would have gone—he then turned round in a fighting attitude, and then stooping suddenly down; he caught Dwyer by the legs, and threw him, I may say, a couple of yards, or probably more, right on his back, and then immediately fell on him with his knees—I did not see him fall with his knees more than once, but I saw him at the same time <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his foot and kick Dwyer in his private parts—the crowd closed in round Dwyer and the prisoner, and many of them called out and taxed Dwyer with having struck the prisoner with his staff—I had enough to do to persuade the mob that he had never lifted his staff at all.</p>

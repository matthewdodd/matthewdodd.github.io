               <p>prisoners—I was in want of a rug—I called at Messrs. Easton's premises, and saw Brough—I asked him if he would ask Mr. Buckley to bring me down a rug to match a certain pattern of carpet, which I tried to describe as near as I could—some few days afterwards he brought the rug down—it was about the last week in February or the first in March—it was brought for the approbation of another person—they did not approve of the pattern, and I agreed to buy it myself—I asked him the price, and he said it would be 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I would have it myself, and asked him to bring or send another more suitable for the carpet—another one was brought down by Buckley about a fortnight or a little more afterwards—I did not take particular notice of dates—that rug was not approved of by the lady it was intended for—I took it home and left it there—I told Buckley at the time that, rather than it should go back, I would sell it for him if I could meet with a customer, but I did not sell it, and it remained there waiting to go back—a third rug was brought by Buckley a fortnight or three weeks afterwards; that was approved of by the lady, and would have been kept had not the officers taken it away—these are the rugs—they were all given up to the police—I have never been applied to for the money for the rugs—the police came two or three weeks afterwards, or it might be a month—I do not know the price of the other two rugs—I have some faint idea that something was said about the price of them, but I cannot state—if the prisoners had not been arrested I dare say the money would have been applied for and paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the arrest had not taken place in all probability application would have been made for the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the name of Messrs. Easton, and would have been paid—in the ordinary course of business, it ought to have been entered in an approbation book—I have known Brough since 1853 I think—I have never known anything wrong of him prior to this—he was a man I would have placed implicit trust in; I thought him altogether beyond suspicion—when I went to see Brough I asked for Buckley, that was simply because Brough did not live in the neighbourhood I did, but Buckley did, and I was not sure at the time I went there first that Brough was in the employment of the firm—I knew Buckley was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known Buckley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twelve or thirteen years, ever since he has been in the employ of the firm—I introduced him to it—I considered the money to be due to Messrs. Easton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because when I was in the position that Buckley filled I could have taken a rug out at any time to show on approbation without being compelled to pay for it—I of course expected that the rugs came from Messrs. Easton's—I called and ordered them there—I did not say anything about where they were to come from—Brough said nothing to me about where he could get the rugs—I was not aware but that they were coming out on approbation—I expected an entry would be made in the approbation book.</p>

                  </hi> I have not received payment for these three rugs—I have looked through the book to see—neither Buckley nor Brough were permitted to take out rugs on approbation, they would be obliged to have an entry—they would then be debited to him, and credited to him when they were returned—I have looked to see whether Mr. Nutt is made a customer—I have looked through the books and find no entry with respect to him.</p>

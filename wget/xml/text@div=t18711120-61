I am a hawker, of King's Alley, Red Hill, Surrey—on 21st October I went into the White Swan, at Charlton, at 9.30 p.m.—the prisoner was there—I had a half-pint of beer, and had just drank it, and put the pot on the table, and immediately received a blow on the mouth which made me insensible—the prisoner did it—we had had no conversation before that—he was standing at a table not a yard from me, and I put the pot on another table—he has lost a hand, the left, I think, and he has got a hook screwed on, which struck me on my lower jaw, and it went through, and tore my upper lip completely through—I have had three doctors—I had had no conversation with him—he said nothing, to my knowledge, before he did it.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 3, Park Place, Old Charlton—on 21st October, a little after 10 o'clock, I was called to the prosecutor, and found him exceedingly faint from loss of blood—I examined his mouth, and found it was entirely cut on the left side of the upper lip, extending from the side of his nostril down to his teeth—the lower part was rent through—on the lower jaw there was a large hole externally, which appeared to have been inflicted from the inside, it was right through—I sewed up the wounds, and since then there were signs of an abscess coming, which has not healed yet—he</p>

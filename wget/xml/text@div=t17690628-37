             is my husband. On Monday the 22d of May, near one o'clock in the night, I was going for a pint of beer to the Angel at Islington, when the prisoner and another man took hold on me, one of one arm the other the other, and dragged me along by the wall. I struggled with them some time, and cried out. I said, I am a married woman, and have three children. The prisoner put his hand in my pocket, and took out my snuff-box, an iron one; then he took my pocket with my handkerchief, and 5 d. 1/4 in copper and 6 d. in silver: the other held me the while he took the things. The watchman who came to assist me, they took his staff out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Cook. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Cook. No; they gave ill language, and kicked and beat me: after this I went home without any beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of May this woman came to me, and told me she had seen one of the men that robbed her two or three nights before. I asked her if she was sure it was the same person; she said she was. I told her to go and look again; she went, and, in about a quarter of an hour, sent her little boy to tell me she was sure, and desired me to come directly. I went: they were walking along by the New River side, by the King of Pruffia's Head: she pointed to the prisoner, and said, Mr. Wilson, I give you charge of that man; that is the man that robbed me. I took and carried him before Justice Girdler. The prisoner said he had never seen the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutrix. Did you tell the justice the prisoner took the watchman's staff away?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Wilson. I searched the prisoner's bag, that hung over his shoulder; there I found this old pocket, a handkerchief, and snuff-box. ( Produced in Court.)</p>

               <p>I never saw the woman. Another man and I were going to work at the New River, and that man put these things into my bag. He was with me when the constable took me up. I never went away. I lay in Mr. Pullen's barn, and worked for him.</p>
               <p>Constable. There was an old fellow with the prisoner when I took him; he seemed to be an Irishman; but he did not seem to me to belong to him.</p>

It was taken out of the kitchen last Tuesday, I saw it just before; I had been looking up the linen for washing; it is here; I went into the room adjoining the shop, and I thought I heard the door go; I went to the head of the stairs, and saw the prisoner with these things in her apron, I saw her at the kitchen-door; she came out, and shut the door after her, but had not taken her hand from the door; I went down and asked her what business she had there, and what she had in her lap; she said, why; what business had she? I told her I did not know she had any; I asked her what she had in her lap; she said, why; what had she? I said, I supposed she had something of mine; she said, she had nothing of mine; I insisted upon seeing; I took hold of her, and called out for a person who lodges in the first floor. She was apprehended; I took the things from her, they are my property, they are the same things, I had seen them before; my house is a lodging-house. She told me they were not mine; but afterwards she did not say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have several times been at the house to see a lodger, but as to the property I know nothing about it.</p>

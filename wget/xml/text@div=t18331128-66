On the 7th of November, I left my stall at a quarter-past one o'clock, to get ready for parade; there was in my stall a small box inside a large one, which had 7s. worth of copper in it - I returned at a quarter-past two o'clock - the large box was broken open, and the small box and money were taken out - I went through Westminster, and found the prisoner in a public-house, on the other side of Westminster-bridge - I got an officer, and took him; we found 2 1/2d. on him, a knife, and a tobacco-box; the inspector asked him if ever he had been about there; he said, yes; but he had never taken any thing before.</p>

            . On the 7th of November, I was standing against the stall taking shelter, while my husband brought me some linen - I saw the prisoner in the stall - he stooped down and took out the small box which contained the money, and put it into his apron - I left to go to my husband, and when I returned the prisoner was gone- the large box had been broken before I went there - I had been in conversation with the prisoner, and said, I hoped I should not have to wait long in the wet - I thought he had been left in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went away and left you there. Witness. No - I went first; and when I returned in ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, you were gone.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The female witness swore at the examination, that she saw me break open the box, and steal the half-pence, amounting to 7s. 6d. I ask you, my Lord, why she did not have me secured by the sentry, who was close by; for she must have had great opportunity of doing so, as it must have occupied me a little time in gathering them up. I was not apprehended till one hour after, and then there was not a single thing found on me, to criminate me.</p>

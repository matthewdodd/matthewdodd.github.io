On the 5th of this month he was repairing a door of No. 4 warehouse. I saw him putting away a piece of linen between some mats which contained barilla; I asked him what he was doing there, he answered he was doing of nothing; I put my hand to the cloth that I saw him stuffing away; I said, do you call that nothing. He then asked me to forgive him, it was the first time I brought him forward to the front warehouse, and left him in charge of Pickering. There were chests of linen in the same warehouse about three yards from him, and there was one of them opened when he was there; they were all safe about half an hour after two. About three o'clock one of them seemed to have been wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Q. When that cask was warehoused what quantity did it contain - A. One hundred and twenty-four pieces on the 6th of this month, and on the 6th of this month I counted it, it was one piece deficient; the piece that the prisoner was stowing away answered in size mark and length to the piece taken out of the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. This cask was in the London Dock - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a constable in the London docks. I was sent for to No. 4, warehouse on the 5th of July the prisoner was standing where the linen was stowed away; I saw the linen stowed between two packages of barilla; I went to the chest and saw that the chest had been broken open, there were six nails drawn out of a clamp; I asked him whether it was done with a hammer; he said, no. I took the linen in custody and took charge of the man, On the next day I counted the linens in that chest, I found there were one deficient, that piece corres- with the number in the chest. This is the linen, it is six yards.</p>

I went to St. Giles's watchhouse on the morning of the 9th of November last: I saw the prisoner there: he was brought in there upon a charge of beating a woman the over night. I went and informed Mr. Bond of it (I knew the prisoner very well). Mr. Bond gave me a letter, and I went and brought him and the woman who was at the watchhouse down to Mr. Bond.</p>

On the 2d December last, my shop was robbed of arms to the amount of 1000l.; among the rest which were stolen, was a gun belonging to Benjamin Aplin; it had been at my house for a year and a half, for sale.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM SAMUEL. I am a City officer, and was at Mr. Rae's house on the 2d of December, the mob broke it open, and took guns and other arms out, and went away with them; it was between two and three clock; the mob threw down their arms about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am police-officer; I apprehended the prisoner on the 2d of December, which was the day that Mr. Rae's house was robbed. I took him in Great Aliff-street, he was coming in the direction from Mr. Rae's house, walking very fast, with a gun in his hand(I produce it). I stopped him, and asked him how he came by it; he said he had picked it up in the Minories. It was a dirty day, but there was no appearance whatever of mud on it. It could not have lain in the Minories, and have been in that state, the streets were very dirty. I took him about half-past two, just after the soldiers came.</p>
               <p>RAE. The gun produced is the one which I spoke of; it is Mr. Aplin's property, and worth 10l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to look for work. The gun lay in the Minories; a man pulled out two pistols, and told me to pick it up, and I did.</p>

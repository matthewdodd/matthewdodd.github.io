I went again on Tuesday afternoon, and there were two missing; they were two red sided ones with white backs; one was rather heavier than the other; the heaviest was rather the darkest red; the horns of the lightest stood straight from her head, and the other's stood rather wider; there had been a mark of C.M. but I am not sure whether that was not worn out; we had had them the greatest part of the summer; one came in the summer, and we had had the other the greatest part of the year. I had frequent opportunities of seeing them; they were both heiffers; they were missing in the afternoon; I went directly after dinner, and got there at about two or three o'clock, as near as I can guess, and then I missed them. I have seen the hydes doubled up, but have not seen them opened. Mr. Burrell has no partner.</p>

            . The prisoner said,he had a conple of beasts to drive to Town; he said that to me and Wright, and asked us if we could help him to drive them to Town. I and Wright told him we had nothing to do, and we would. He said,he must go and see the man, to know which two to take, and get a note from the man. It was agreed between us, that we were to meet again; we did so, both I and Wright. The prisoner said he had been, and had seen the man, and had got a note, and knew which two to take. We were to go the next morning early with him, and drive them to London; this was about five or six o'clock in the evening. We went into the field where they were,into Mr. Hawley's field, a Monkton; it was near one or two o'clock in the morning; he shewed us which two we were to take, and we took them; we took two heiffers; I don't know rightly what colour they were; there was one rather bigger than the other; they were of a brownish colour, with a white mark down the back. We selected these two, and we drove them along the road to London; we came the Lee-bridge-road. When we got to London, we took them down to the slaughter-house. The prisoner came very near to the place, which was near Smithfield; I can't say what direction he gave us, but he shewed us the street we were to go down, and he stopped until we came back; he gave us the note too; he told us we were to receive six shillings from the man; I don't know the name of the street. I and Wright went together. We got to London at about six o'clock. We delivered the note to a man in the yard; we did not receive any thing from him. The money was thrown out of the window, two three-shilling pieces. We left the brasts there. We met the prisoner in the street again, very near the place where we left him. Wright and I had the six shillings. The prisoner returned with us as far as the Spread Eagle, at Sharebrook. He was in company with me and the beasts the whole way from Lee-bridge to London; he was with us at Hackney.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bacon. I had known the prisoner before; I had seen him once; I had killed a heiffer for him before, on the 27th of September; when I paid him for the other heiffer, he promissed me a hair. I saw no marks on these two heiffers; they were red sided and white backed ones, and one was considerably heavier than the other. I can't tell about the difference of the horns. When I received that note, I chuched six shillings out of the window. I sent a a message to Mr. Lloyd. by Mr. Poole. I killed one of these heiffers on Tuesday, and not receiving any orders, I killed the other on the Wednesday; the hydes went with my own bydes to Leadenhall-market, on the Tuesday, to Mr. Warmington, who is a hyde-salesman, in Leadenhall-market. All commission beasts that I kill, I put a mark on the nose of the letters of the owner's name, and the hydes of my own beasts, I mark with three cuts. I was directed to stop the sale of the hydes, until the Friday following, which would be about the 2nd of December, and then if there was no word sent up, to sell them. I saw Mr. Barrell on Friday, the 1st of December; he came to my house, and enquired of me about two heiffers. In consequence of the conversation that passed between us, he and I went to Mr. Warmington's at Leadenhall-market; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100007"></xptr>was a lot of hydes produced, consisting of two or three and twenty. Mr. Burrell and I turned the hydes over one at a time, and I asked him if he could tell his hydes if he saw them, and he said, he could. In the course of the turning over, he selected one, and Mr. Warmington's foreman picked the other out. On Friday, the 24th of November, I saw the prisoner at the bar; it was the very next day after I received the heiffers; I saw him at my own house; he came to know about the heiffers; he asked how I got on with them? I told him very badly. I said there hangs one, and the other is at market, not sold; the one I pointed out to him, was one of those brought by the young men to whom I threw six shillings out of the window. He said there was a considerable deal of fat; I told him, I did not think so. Then I asked him if he had seen

            . I am a beast-salesman, and live at 10, Chappel-place, Pentonville. I attend Smithfield-market. I know the prisoner at the bar very well, and have known him many years. I saw the prisoner in November last, about the 24th; I saw him about some beasts. He said to me, where have you been. I have not seen you; I said your beef is not sold; he said, I know that; I have seen one in the slaughter-house; but you can let me have a little money on them, though they are not sold. I told him I had got another person to be answerable; where was that person I had received a note on the Thursday night or Friday morning; I won't be certain which. I told him I would not give him the money until got an order from the person. He said, I can't get an order, for the man is gone into Yorkshire. He said you will let me have a pound note. I told him that Charles Bacon had got the beef, and I did not mind letting him have a pound on Charles Bacon's account I was to receive the money for the beasts, for the same party as before. The prisoner can't write himself, and the former note is different. Bacon was to slaughter the beasts, and I was to sell them. I had transactions with the prisoner before, one bullock. Bacon slaughtered the bullock, and accounted to me for the produce of it, and I settled with the prisoner for the amount of that bullock. The conversation I had with the prisoner at the bar when he asked for a pound note, was relating to the two heiffers at Bacon'.</p>

            . I offered a reward for the apprehension of the thief, and I described them to the best of my knowledge. One of them, the biggest, was the darkest colour; her horns stood rather up, and wide. The smallest of the two was lighter, and her horns stood rather straight from her head. I had had the large one the greater part of the summer, and the other near two years; they were heiffers, and I was well acquainted with the marks of both. I went to Mr. Bacon's on the 1st of December; I described to Mr. Bacon the heiffers I had lost; it was the same description I have now given. In consequence of that description, he and I went to Leadenhall-market, to Warmington's; there was a lot of hydes produced there, in which these two skins were. I selected one. Mr. Bacon turned the skins over, one by one, and he made a stop at some of the skins which appeared something like, saying, is that yours; I told him to keep on, and when I saw it, I would tell him the skin. He turned over one or two more, and then I said pull out that, I can swear to that; the one I fixed upon was pulled out, and I knew it belonged to the smallest of the two heiffers of which I have been speaking. One of the horns of that had been broken, and I knew it by that circumstance. When I came to the largest, I did not exactly know it at the first moment, it was very dirty, and I was not positive at the moment; I have since known it to the hyde of the biggest beast; I knew it from the colour, and part of the old pitch mark, C.M. and from the horn which stood in; the pitch mark was quite visible The two heiffers had the mark of C.M. on the off side; it was rather worn out on the larger heiffer, but quite plain on the first. From all these marks, I had not the least doubt of their being my hydes, and the hydes of the two heiffers which I lost.</p>

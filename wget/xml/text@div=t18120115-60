The prisoner came to my shop on the 11th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I was behind the counter going in at the street and while the prisoner was being served at the right hand counter I observed that she had a piece of white cloth or muslin in her hand, and I saw her put it into the drawer. I saw her take it out again as if she had something concealed in the handkerchief, to put it into her pocket, I waited till she had gone out of the shop. She had bought three yards of galloon. I went to the drawer, there were five pieces of galloon missing, I went out and overtook the prisoner in Bedford Row, I brought her back, I told her that I suspected that she had been stealing something out of the drawer, she took these five pieces out of her pocket and begged for mercy.</p>

There were two or three of them knew me very well. They asked me to treat them; which I did. I did not drink any thing myself. The prisoner, seeing me in liquor, followed me, and asked me to give her something to drink. I said, I was going home, and could not stop: I had just treated her before. She came before me, asking me to give her something to drink, and took my watch and handkerchief out of my pocket. I missed them both in less than a minute afterwards. I did not see her doing it, nor feel her doing it, but missed them directly. Then I went home. I felt it in my pocket, after I left the others, when I came out of the public-house, before the prisoner overtook me. It was a silver watch. I heard of it next morning.</p>
               <p>You was in liquor? - Yes; but I was sober enough to know that was the girl.</p>

               <p>I am watch-house-keeper of Covent-garden. On the 30th of July, about one in the morning, the watchmen going their rounds, met with this woman making a noise. They brought her to the watch-house as disorderly. Endeavouring to get away, she fell; and this watch fell from her bosom.</p>
               <p>Did you see it fall? - No: it was given to me. The inside case was brought in first: I said, Where is the outside case? They said, they could not tell. I desired them to look for the other case about the place where she was. They did; and found it in an area.</p>
               <p>NORTHEN BOBBETT sworn.</p>
               <p>About a quarter after one o'clock, this woman and two more were making a noise and disturbance in Tavistock-street. I said, if they did not make less noise, I would take them to the watch-house. Going to take hold of the prisoner, she fell down, and the watch fell out of her bosom. I went to take her up, and found the watch on the pavement. I took it up, and delivered it to the last witness, in the watch-house. There was nobody within twenty or thirty yards of her, when the watch dropped.</p>
               <p>Was the whole watch there, or the outside case wanting? - The body of the watch only: we found the outside case in an area in York-street, about ten yards from the place where she fell.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>When I was taken up by the watchman, I was going home. I never saw the prosecutor before. I saw three girls quarrelling in Tavistock-street: there was a girl dropped a watch: they were in pursuit of her. The watchman came to me, and said, What did I do there? I said, I was doing no hurt. He said, he supposed I was the person that took the man's watch. He struck me, and cut me on the head. I know nothing at all of the watch.</p>

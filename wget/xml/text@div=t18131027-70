               <p>Q. You were possessed of a mould of the Centaur, were not you - A. Yes, I missed it from my premises; I bought it in November; I missed it last February. I gave a great deal of money for it. There is not a mould in the trade that will make the figure of the Centaur like it. I gave information to Bruchani; I told him that I had lost the mould. On the 13th of October I got a warrant, and went to Bruchani. The officer, in searching, found the mould. The prisoner was apprehended the same evening. The prisoner said if I would let him go, he would make up every thing to me. This is the mould that was found at Bruchani's; it is mine.</p>

            . I am a figure maker I live at Newington. I bought the mould of the Centaur of the prisoner, I gave him eighteen shillings for it. The prisoner is a mould maker; I think he can make a mould like that.</p>
               <p>MR. WORRALL. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner at the White Hart, in Giltspur-street, on the 13th of September; he acknowledged that he had stolen this mould from Checkeni, and had sold it to Bruchani for eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I emplore mercy of my prosecutor; I was driven to the greatest distress; I was in a state of starvation by my prosecutor not paying me my wages; it is a ionspiracy of Mr. Checkeni to get me out of the way, he having used other tradesmen's moulds; there are many prosecutions coming against him, he knews I am the principal witness. Many times I have been down of a Saturday night when he has owed me three or four pounds, and not got any.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never owed him three or four pounds, nor am I afraid of any prosecution; it is all false what he has said.</p>

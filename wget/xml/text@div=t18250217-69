            . I am the wife of James Page, we live in Wellington-street, Kingsland-road. On the 20th of January, about half-past 5 o'clock, I put two night caps, and two flannel waistcoats into a basket, and gave them to my daughter Sarah, to take to her uncle's in Bishopsgate-street, I pinned a shawl on her shoulders with three pins.</p>
               <p>SARAH PAGE. My mother gave me a basket with these things in, and pinned a shawl on my should. I set out about half-past 5 o'clock. I went straight down Shoreditch, and saw the prisoner with another woman just by <placeName id="t18250217-69-crimeloc409">Hollywell-lane</placeName>

I am sure of the prisoner's person; it was light. I never saw her before. On the next Tuesday morning Smith brought her out to the end of a court to me; I knew her directly. I was quite sure of her, she had a cotton gown on over her red one then. I am certain of her.</p>

            . I was on the other side of the way facing Worship-street. I saw the prisoner and another woman following behind Page, and when she got as far as the pump, the other one held her round the waist while the prisoner snatched a basket out of her hand. I did not see her take the shawl. Both ran up Worship-street. Page ran to her uncle's. I have known the prisoner for twelve months, she used to live in the same court as me. She had a red gown and black straw bonnet on. I am sure it was her.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of a description given to me by Sarah Page, I apprehended the prisoner in a court in Shoreditch. on the 25th - I told Page and Skerratt to stand at the end of the court, by the light, and directly I brought her out they both immediately said she was the woman: they had described her as having a red gown, and a cast in her eye. I have not found the property.</p>

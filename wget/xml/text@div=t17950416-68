He came in, and asked my sister change for a five guinea note, and she had not the change and I gave it; it was about seven o'clock in the evening, there was no name on the back, I sent it after him to put his name on the back, to the butchers, by a little boy, Thomas Matthison, he lived at the butchers in the neighbourhood, and knowing his master, I gave him change. I asked my sister if she knew the man, she said she knew the master. He took the note from the boy into a public house, and there it was signed by another person, and the boy returned it with a name on it. I kept it till the Thursday following, and then I paid it away to Mr. Parkinson, to the brewer's clerk, and he paid it, and then it was returned to me the next week again, not being good; I am sure that is the same note, there is on the back of it the name of

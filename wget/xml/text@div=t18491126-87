                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, in the employment of Messrs, Pontifex, and have been so five or six years, at a lead and chemical factory at Millwall—Joseph Riddell was the manager; I received my directions from him—William Riddell was employed there; I do not know what as—he was in the habit of giving me directions in his brother's absence, which I obeyed, without referring to Joseph—about July or Aug., 1848, the prisoners resided in Birnie-street, Greenwich—they had previously resided at the factory it Millwall—about July or Aug., 1848, I was employed in making and fitting-up a green-house with Harrison and Miller—Joseph Riddell first gave me directions about it; William was not present—in consequence of those directions I prepared a plan and estimate, and about a fortnight after set about making it—I cannot say whether William Riddell spoke to me about it before I set about making it—I made it up of some deals that came in the yard—they were brought in during the time—they were not there previously—I was ordered <hi rend="italic">to</hi> select what I wanted from that sample that came in, and <hi rend="italic">to give</hi> Mr. Joseph an account <hi rend="italic">of</hi> them—those deals were brought in for die general purposes of the factory—I selected about ten twenty-feet deals, and ten twentv-feet battens—the deals were worth about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the battens perhaps 355.—I had to order two sawyers to cut them into the requisite thickness—the deals were about nine inches wide and three inches thick, and the battens seven inches wide and two and a half thick—I then began to work on them, alone in the first instance, in the carpenters' shop in the factory—while I was working on them William Riddell saw them—Harrison commenced working at them; it might have been the following day—William Riddell frequently saw me and Harrison working at them—I received direc<lb></lb>tions from both the prisoners on the subject at different times—some window-sashes were made for the green-house, about nine in front, and fourteen sky-lights; and rafters and doors besides—perhaps I might be occupied about ten or twelve days in preparing those sashes, and Harrison perhaps rather more—during those twelve days William Riddell came frequently—it was their habit <hi rend="italic">to</hi> visit us daily—it is not to be considered as twelve successive days, because there were other things to attend to—when the work was com<lb></lb>pleted we took it over to Greenwich—I believe it was Mr. William who principally directed us to take the things over—Harrison and I took them—we were occupied about fourteen days, or thereabouts, in fitting up the green-house at Greenwich—William Riddell was there every day, and Joseph also—I received directions from William as well as Joseph, in reference to the fittings-up—the value of the green-house, when completed, was between 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received my wages the whole of the time in the usual way in the counting-house, from Mr. Jones—William Riddell was not in the habit of being present when I received my wages; he might have been there at times, but he took no part in it—some iron brackets were necessary for putting up the green-house; that was for the internal fittings—I think Mr. William gave me directions to order Upstill, the smith, to make them—he made them in the</p>

I am partner with my brother in the copper-worki at Shoe-lane, and the factory at Millwall—Joseph Riddell was appointed our manager, about 1843; after that he requested the assistance of his brother William, and we permitted it—William had no particular duties, but was to give general assistance to his brother—he received a salary; he was a kind of joint-manager with his brother—I think William came into the employment very shortly after Joseph—I have given instructions to William in reference to his duties both in the presence of his brother and separately—I have re-peatedly given William instructions as well as Joseph, that not a single thing should go off the premises at any time without express orders from Shoe-Jane—we had generally a stock of timber in use at the factory—I gave no instructions to either of the prisoners in July or Aug. 1848, to use timber for the erection of a green-house at their house at Greenwich, neither of them told me they had done so—I received a letter from Joseph on or about 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi> Aug. last—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had received no information from either of them about the timber before that—I never received any communication</p>

               <p>from William, and, except this letter, I never had any communication from Joseph—I had not given Joseph authority to discharge Hinds—I was con<lb></lb>stantly in the habit of seeing Joseph—about 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Sept. last, in consequence of some information I received, I had an interview with Joseph—William was not present at that interview—I had prior to that given both the pri<lb></lb>soners notice to leave—they had first given me notice—William and Joseph were always one and the same—William did not give me any notice either in writing or by word of mouth; what was done with one was done with the other—my communications were with Joseph, and frequently with William together, constantly, they were together at the works.</p>

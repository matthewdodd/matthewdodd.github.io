                  </hi>. I am barman at the Prince of Wales, Exeter-street—on 13th January, the prisoner came with another female for a quartern of gin, which came to fivepence—her companion paid with a half-crown—I found it was bad after they had left—I had put it in the till, but there was no other half-crown there—on the following Monday, 2d February, about 6 o'clock, the prisoner came alone—I recognised her—she asked for a quartern of gin in a bottle, which came to fivepence—she gave me a half-crown—I bent it, and told her it was bad—she said, "Here is another; is that bad too?" giving me a good one—I sent for a constable—she said she did not know the half-crown was bad—I marked and gave it to the constable with the other.</p>

I was out marketing in the Cut, near where I live, and the butter man told me I tendered him a bad half-crown, I paid for the articles I purchased, and took home the bad half-crown, intending to get it changed if I could find out where it was, as I had changed two half-sovereigns. I had not occasion to change money again till I went into the Prince of Wales in the evening, so I most have taken that half-crown where I took the other. I was not aware I had it in my pocket.")</p>

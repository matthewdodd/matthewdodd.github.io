                  </hi>. I am a livery-stable-keeper at Portman-mews. On the 12th of August the prisoner came to my stable, dressed in a livery suit, top boots, and a cockade in his hat—he said he wanted to engage a pair of horses for two months for his master, Colonel D'Essentieni, who lived at Norman Villa, and was a sort of ambassador or something of that kind—that he was a very respectable gentleman, and every thing of that kind—in consequence of his representation, I agreed that the horses should be taken next day to the Colonel to be looked at—about half-past eight o'clock the next morning, (Sunday,) the horses were put into a carriage of mine, and I accompanied him down to Norman Villa—I was to have 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. month for the horses and harness—the carriage was merely for me and himself going in—he was to pay 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month for two months—I went into the stable-yard there, and a gentleman came to me—he looked at the horses, and it was agreed that they should be hired on those terms—I noticed a green chariot there—the horses were for that—the prisoner came next day to change the harness for some better, and I gave it to him—that was on the Monday—about a week after I saw him again, and I then asked him if I was to have a month's advance—he agreed to endeavour to get it for me, and I was not to come that week, as he was going away for three or four days, but I was to come on the Monday or Tuesday week follow<lb></lb>ing—I went on the Tuesday, and they were all gone from Norman Villa, horses, carriages, and every thing—that was on Tuesday week, about the 21st—the horses went down on Sunday the 13th—the value of them is about 50 guineas—the harness was not in the agreement, but I lent it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my custody, on the 29th of January, at a public-house in Holborn—I told him he was charged with stealing a pair of horses and harness—he said he was all right, they could not hurt him, he was only servant to the colonel, and he had a letter which would prove that he was sent into the country on the Saturday as the colonel left town, and the colonel was to meet him at Leicester—I understood him to mean the same Saturday as the colonel left the cottage at Fulham.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stableman, and live in Great Chesterfield-street I know the prisoner—I saw him on the 4th of August last, and had some conversation with him—I met him by accident, at Knightsbridge—we went into a public-house, and while there he asked me if I was out of a situation—I said I was—he said he thought he could get me a very good situation—I said I should feel very much obliged to him if he could do so—he said he could, and one where I could have a great quantity of clothes—two or three, or three or four suits, at least if I could find tailors to get them from—he said he was in the service of a colonel, but what else I do not know—he afterwards asked me if I knew of anybody that could serve them with horses—I said yes, I knew plenty that could, but not under the circumstances he mentioned—I said I thought it was swindling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On account of the way he expressed himself about the clothes—when I said so he would not give me any answer at that time—after that, we were all the afternoon calling at various places he had to go to—I went with him—I did not have any further conversation with him till the evening—the last place we left was in Oxford-street, and in going across Hyde Park, back to Knightsbridge, where I first met him, he said that the horses would never be paid for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came he to say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By my questioning him over and over again—he did not say why—he said, could Mr. Wilkinson serve them with horses—I said, yes, no doubt, but, as I said before, it was on a swindling system, and I begged of him not to go to Mr. Wilkinson, as I knew him—he made no answer to that—he did not say he would or he would not—I then put him into a Hammersmith omnibus, as he had been drinking, and left him—he appointed to see me next day at seven o'clock in the evening, but he did not come, and I did not see him again till he was in custody at Hatton-garden.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener.

Black and Reading, coachmakers, are my clients—in consequence of a communication they made to me, I accompanied them to Norman Villa, on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 15th of July last, and proceeded to take away two carriages from there, which they claimed—the colonel, the prisoner, the female cook, and another man, interfered to prevent us—the prisoner first had a long pole, and then a pitchfork, and the colonel armed himself with a poker; but we succeeded in getting the carriages away—I had been down there the day before, and requested the prisoner to give up the car<lb></lb>riages, as I told him they had been improperly come by—he made no answer, but turned on his heel, and shut the door in my face—when I went down the next day, I went to the court-yard, and the gates were forced open; but previous to that three of our men had got over the wall, and the colonel had struck one of them on the head with the poker, and hurt him very much—we then ordered the gates to be forced open, and all the men rushed in—we took the carriages, and, after a skirmish and fight, we hired horses, and brought the carriages to London.</p>

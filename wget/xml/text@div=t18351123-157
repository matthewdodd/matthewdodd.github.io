                  </hi>. I am a waterman. I know both the prisoners—on the 29th of October I left London in the <hi rend="italic">Royal Adelaide</hi> steam-ves<lb></lb>sel—the captain, Mr. Allen, had the charge of the vessel—Clarke was on board, acting as pilot—we started from London that morning, between three and four o'clock, I think—from St. Catherine-dock—I had only to go to Grevesend—the vessel was going to Leith.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know Clarke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have known him two years—he is a very old and experienced waterman on the Thames—perfectly acquainted with the navigation of the Thames, and every thing connected with the water—we left Saint Catherine's Wharf, soon after three o'clock I think—this accident happened about a quarter past four—I know we started from the wharf between three and four—It was not between two and three—I did not take exact notice of the time we set off—I saw one man was forward in the fore-castle to keep a look out—the two prisoners were on the bridge which communicates with the paddle-boxes, and there were two men at the wheel—one man was on the break of the quarter-deck for the purpose of communicating orders from the pilot and captain to the man at the wheel—these arrangements were judicious and proper for the navigation of the vessel—I heard orders given several times—I saw no neglect or want of diligence on the part of the captain or pilot—It was a very dark night, and was raining very hard—the steamer had one light at each end of the topsailyard—any body could see the light clear of every thing—they were large lanterns with tins at the back—I saw a boat, called the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi>, which came in collision with the steamer when she was about twice her own length from us—there was no light about her, or anything to make her conspicuous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to see her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw her white mainsail—I do not know whether any body on board saw her before me—I heard them hallooing from the bridge of the vessel, but I was so confused I did not take notice—I do not know what the orders were—I had just come out of the fore-cabin—I came from the fore-cabin which is before the bridge, and is where the passengers of the second class go—If I was at the fore-cabin, and they spoke to a man at the stern, their backs would be towards me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was every care and exertion made to give relief to this poor man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I could see—as soon as I came on deck they stopped the vessel directly the orders were given out—It was stopped on my hearing the balloing—I got into a boat which was put out, and tried all I could to save the people—the boat belonged to Mr. Clarke—they hallooed out before the boat was got out, and the ves<lb></lb>sel was stopped before they struck the smack—one of the ship's company got into the boat with me—I did not see a boy climb on board himself—the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi> was brought up for three-quarters of an hour—all that time I was</p>

               <p>going about to see what I could do to save any body, and putting my scull under water, and doing what I could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the vessel stopped before she struck the smack? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Her engine was stopped—I could hear that—the tide was running up—we were going against tide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had been below, getting refreshment? Yes—I have seen the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi> since at a distance—I cannot say her length, she is an oyster vessel—a deck boat—she was more than thirty fact long—I dare say she was forty—I had heard no hailing from the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi>—I do not know whose voice it was I heard—I saw the prisoners on the bridge—they were plain to be seen by any body—she was stopped when this halloing took place—she was going, as near as I can judge, at about half-speed—not going further than Gravesend I do not know whether she ever put out her full speed—she was going about five knots an hour—I cannot tell how fast the tide runs—the tide was about half-flood—the wind was about west-south-west—the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi> was coming up with a side wind—It was a fine breeze—she had the wind free the same as another vessel—the wind was about across—she had the wind fair, and the tide in her favour—the steam-vessel was more to the southward than northward—but nearly in mid-channel—the river is about three-quarters of a mile wide there—I should say, the steamer draws between twelve and thirteen feet of water—there is a shelf in the river where she was—we were between two shelves, which are a quarter of a mile apart—we could not go on the shelves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, residing at Whitstaple. I knew Thomas Clarkson—he had been to my house a night or two before the day this oc<lb></lb>curred—I saw him on board the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi> on the morning in question, and assisted to take his luggage on boar—he was a passenger—I knew the people on board the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi>—there was Richard Baker, his son Henry and a boy named Holt—those were all the persons on board—she sailed for London when I left her—she set off about nine o'clock in the morning of Wednesday, the 28th—Winstaple is between sixty and seventy miles from London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and live at Whitstaple. I belong to a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Fawn</hi>—I remember leaving Whitstaple, for London, on Wednesday, the 28th of October, the day before the accident—my father was on board, also a passenger named Clarkson, myself, and a boy named Holt—we were coming up the river Thames, on Thursday morning, in the upper part of the Galleons, which is a reach on the Thames—the tide was running up—It was flood tide—I do not know how long it had been flood—I do not know at what rate the tide was running—the wind was about south-south-west—we were tacking, to muke our way—It was necessary from the state of the wind—I saw the light of the steam-boat—when I first saw that, our head was to the northward—I could not tell in what position the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi> was coming—I could not say how far off she was when I saw the lights—I afterwards percieved the bull of the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi>—I cannot say how far off she was then—we did nothing when we saw her hull—the <hi rend="italic">steamer</hi> steered, as if she would come to the northward of us—we then put about, and our head was to the southward—we were in stay in the mean time—we then proceeded to the southward—we hallooed to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183511230149"></xptr>
               <p>steamer to starboard her helm—we all three hallooed—were all three on deck—Clarkson was below, asleep—we hallooed because they were coming right away for us—they had not changed their course—we had—they were coming to the northward of us at first, and afterwards came against us—when I first saw the steamer, it appeared as if going to the northward of us, and we were going tot he northward, and we put about—I did not observe anything done by them, on our hallooing—I cannot tell how far she was off when we put about—we had gone a good way on out tack towards the southward shore—I thin we had passed the mid-stream, but I do not know—we hallooed out more than once the same word—we were well over at the convict ship off Woolwich, when we were struck—I could see the convict ship—the steam-about changed her course when we hallooed out, "Starboard"—she appeared as if she had ported her helm—we hailed them to starboard her helm, her porting it brought her nearer to us—she ran aboard us, and struck us just between the tackle plate on our starboard side—the tackle plate is about three feet and a half at the midhsip—I jumped, and got hold of a cross piece of the steam-boat's figure-head—here bows came over us—I got hold of the cross piece, and got on board her—my father did not get on board, he got up into the figure-head—when I got into the vessel, I found nobody forward—I went tot he foremast, and saw the men sitting in a place on the starboard bow on deck—I did not see what they were doing—that placeis forty-three feet from the figure-head—I saw the pilor (the prisoner Clarke) on the larboard paddle-box—I saw nobody else on the bridge, nor any body on the starboard paddle-box—If there had been, I should have seen them—I knocked at the door of the place—the men there were seamen—three came out, and asked what was the matter—I had seen no man except the one on the larboard paddle-bos, till I came to where I saw these men—there were no other persons on the deck—I did not cry or halloo before I went to the place where the men were sitting—they saw the vessel athwart the bows, and chucked a rope over—Holt was on the deck of the Fawn when the rope was thrown over—eh could not reac it—my father got down off the figure-head on board the Fawn, and put Holt to the rope, and then the steam-boat went astern, and the vessel went down—Holt was pulled up by three men into the steamboat, and my father met his death by going up by three men into the boat—the steamers; bowsprit was entangled with the riggin of the Fawns—that kept her up till the steam-boat went astern—I did not hear my fathe cry out—he made a noise in the water—I saw no more of him afterwards—the pilot's boat went to assist—when I was on board, I asked a man for the captain—he was a passenger, and said he did not know the captain in the dark—I made no inquiry of the seamen—I did not find him till after some considerabole time—when one of the boys showed him to me—that was after the Fawn had gone down—he was then leaning against the paddl-box—I asked him how I should get to London—he told me the pilot's man should row me up—I saw nothing of Clarkson after the Fawn was struck—I did not see any vessel near when we were struck—I do not think there was room for the steamer to pass between usand the bulk—there was plenty of room to the northward—we had done all we could to get to the southward.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which way does the tide set in the Galleons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the northward—the tide sets you off—when you get a little way it is over the the southward.</p>

            . I live in Brick-lane. On the 29th of April I saw the prisoner run past my house; he had a chest of tea on a knot; it was marked C. G. H. Sheerness. He pitched a chest of tea at a public-house on a block. I went after him and asked him if he knew of a situation, that he might not know I was following him; he answered, he did not, and then he said he did, at an ironmonger's. He then took up the chest of tea and carried it as far as Lamb-street. I then asked him whether he was not out of his way with it; he threw it down and ran away. I took him in custody, and gave him in charge of an officer. This is the chest of tea.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SINFIELD. I am a carman to James Cousens, a tea dealer, in Coleman-street. On the 9th of April I went to Davis's wharf to deliver a chest of tea. I had two chests in my cart. I took one of them to deliver at the wharf. I left the other in the cart; it was marked

            Sheerness, and when I came back to the cart the cart was turned round, the tailboard was let down, and the chest was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the chest here - A. Yes, it is; that is the chest; it is marked C. G. H. Sheerness. I took the chest from Mr. Cousens.</p>

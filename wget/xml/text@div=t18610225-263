                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>—I have known the prisoner twelve or fourteen years, and always considered him a man of honesty—I know his relations—I have seen this cheque before, and compared it with other documents of his at the Mansion-house—I believe it is not his writing—I looked at it through a glass—I have a knowledge of his writing, and as far as any man can offer an opinion, I believe it is not his—I am used to examine a great many ancient and modern documents—I am certain that it is not the prisoner's writing.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know the circumstances under which he left the Union Bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I know he got associated with young men above his own station in life, he was led into debt, and told that he must resign, but that does not constitute criminality, that led me to censure him—I do not believe him capable of a dishonest action, a young man may be loose and foolish, but may not be a criminal—the only part of this that bears the slightest resemblance to his writing is the letter "K," but the "R" and the "E" are very different—the "K" is round at the top—I said first that that was not his writing—two other papers were then handed to me, and I said "These are his writing," and that was correct—I said that the "E" in Frederick was not the Greek "E," nor is this "R," it is a running "R," this is like a schoolboy's "R"—I went before the Lord Mayor at the request of the prisoner's mother, having heard that he was in custody on a charge of forgery—I saw this cheque at the Mansion-house for the first time—I had a letter of his in my pocket, which I took out during the examination, and compared with this cheque—I could not tell without, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the papers that was shown to me at the Mansion-house—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>press it—I could not have said that he only slept there sometimes, and that his stopping away accounted for the fact that he had no money, and that he had not anything in the world but what he stood upright in.</p>

               <p>Mr. Harding. I employ'd the Prisoner as a <rs id="t17321011-22-deflabel112" type="occupation">Chairwoman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17321011-22-defend179 t17321011-22-deflabel112"></join> at my Chambers in the Middle Temple ; I miss'd several odd Things, but did not immediately suspect her. It happen'd one Day that I had not a Shirt to put on, tho' I had bought 7 new ones which cost me about 30 s. a-piece but 3 Weeks before. I examin'd her about it, and she told me, some were soul, and others were at Washing. This put me upon a farther Search, not one of these 7 Shirts was to be found. A large Silver Spoon and 2 Tea-spoons, several Neck-cloths, Handkerchiefs, and other Things were missing. Next Morning when she came up to light my Fire, I tax'd her closely; she fell on her Knees, and said, for God Sake don't ruin me! I ask'd her what she had done with my Shirts, my Neckcloths, my Handkerchiefs and Spoons? She said, they were at pawn, and that her Husband had tempted her to carry them, and if I would forgive her, she would confess more Things than I knew of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you deliver me the Shirts to wash?</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. No; I never order'd you either to wash, or to get wash'd any Shirts since those 7 were made.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nelthorp, Constable. By Mr. Harding's Order I went with her to Jarvis's the Pawn-brokers on Newstreet-hill to fetch out 4 Shirts. I carried 2 Guineas for that Purpose, but understanding when I came thither, that there was a Silver Spoon likewise in pawn, and the 2 Guineas not being sufficient to fetch that out too, the Prisoner pawn'd her own Gold Ring to redeem it. These are the 4 Shirts, they were deliver'd to me by Jarvis in the Prisoner's Presence, and by her Direction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. And these 4 Shirts are para of those I lost.</p>
               <p>Nelthorp. She own'd too, that she had pawn'd four of Mr. Harding's Neckcloths and 2 of his Shaving Cloths in Black-Fryars; but she said, she could not remember at what House it was. This white Callico Waistcoat was deliver'd me Yesterday Morning ( without paying for) by Jarvis. The Prisoner said; she did not remember where she had pawn'd it, but he happen'd to find it enter'd in his Books to her Name.</p>

            , the Prosecutor's Servant. The Prisoner own'd to me that she took the Shirts, and 2 or 3 Shaving Cloths, and some Towels, and pawn'd them; and she said, that, her Husband came and beat her, and took a Shirt and a black Suit of my Master's Cloaths, and put them on, and went away with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not Mr. Harding deliver me the Shirts to wash?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173210110011"></xptr>Weller. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did he not give me 1 Shirt to get the Ink out of it?</p>
               <p>Weller. No; there was 1 Shirt indeed that had been ink'd, and my Master gave it me to get the Ink out, and I spoke to you about it, but did not deliver it to you: Besides, you said you knew of several other Things that had not yet been miss'd, but that you would not name them till they were miss'd, and when they were, you said, you would not disown them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He pretends I took a couple of Tea-spoons too, because when I was cleaning the Plate, I said I could not find them.</p>
               <p>Weller. When I ask'd her for the Tea-spoons, she said, she had put them in her Pocket, and carry'd them home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Day before the Spoons were missing we had had Peas for Dinner, and the Spoons were then in Use; and some of his Companions came to see him at Night ( as they often did when my Master was out of the way) and he treated them with a Bottle of my Master's Wine, and they were as likely to take the Spoons as any Body else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. When I ask'd her what was become of the Spoons, I did not name any Spoon in particular, but spoke in general Terms, and she told me they were in pawn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I own that I stole them?</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. You confess'd that you had taken them away and pawn'd them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burker. When Mr. Harding examin'd the Prisoner about his Shirts, Towels, and other Things that he had lost, she said, if you'll have Patience I'll tell you. where they are. I have pawn'd 'em, I am sorry for it, and ask your Pardon, but it was a Rogue of a Husband that persuaded me to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. While I was in the Compter, I was swell'd up with the Poison that my Husband gave me, so that I miscarry'd and was like to dye; and being in this Condition I sent to the Prosecutor, desiring him to let me have my Wages, but he sent me Word back, that he would stop it on Account of the Shirts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. She indeed sent to me for her Wages, which was not then due, and she having wrong'd me so much, I thought I had no Reason to send it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had some Witnesses here Yesterday, but now they are gone.</p>
               <p>Court. You was call'd up to take your Tryal Yesterday, but then you desir'd it might be put off till to Day, because your Witnesses were not come.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No; my Husband and I were called up together, and it was he that desired his Tryal might be put off, because he had not got all the Witnesses that he had hired to swear for him.</p>

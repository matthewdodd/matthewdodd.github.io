            ; we had agreed that morning to rob Mrs. Cole's house - Davis was the first that spoke about it; he told us that Mrs. Cole was out - the prisoner was present, and we agreed to meet at the Queen's Head in the evening, which we did; I was there at five o'clock - the prisoner, I believe, did not come till about six; Davis was there between five and six - Kite did not come then; while we were there we agreed to go and break open Mrs. Cole's house - we sat out for that purpose about ten minutes after twelve o'clock; before that we went to the Two Sawyers, and from there to the Bell - that was the last place we were at before we set out to do the robbery; we went from the Bell to Mrs. Cole's - we met Webb, the watchman, in Bell-lane, after we came from the Bell; when we got to Mrs. Cole's we sat in the summer-house till we heard the watchman cry half-past twelve o'clock - I then gave Seth a short crowbar out of my pocket, and he went and made an attempt to get into the back part of the house; finding he could not easily gain an entrance he went to the front - the house is all enclosed; he wrenched open the front parlour window - he first opened the window, and then burst the inner shutters in; there was no outer shutter - I believe the window was fastened; it is a folding window - I am sure it was closed; the shutters were fastened - Davis, Kite, and Seth then went into the house, and I stood outside; they had no light till they got in - they struck a light when they got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they carry a tinder-box with them? A. Yes; they had been in nearly two hours before I saw any thing of them - they then brought me three or four bundles tied up; I carried them, and put them into the summer-house - they all three went back into the house, and had not been there long before their light went out; Kite and I went across the road, to a gentleman's house opposite, where there is a lamp, and got another light - after they had been in some time they brought me out some wine in a jug; they then went back, and stopped some time - I went to see if they were not coming; they made me stop and drink some more wipe in the house, and we all came away together - we took the bundles from the summer-house, and went straight to the Queen's Head stables - Webb came there two or three minutes after we got there; he saw Kite and Davis, and asked them what they were doing there - they said they had been out having some beer; Webb went away, and then one of them either let or kicked down a jug which they had brought some wine in - Webb then came up and made an alarm; Kite and Davis were the first two who ran away - I followed them; Seth was left behind in Queen's Head yard- I took with me two bundles, which contained the knives and forks and two tea-pots, and a bundle containing plate.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050014"></xptr>Q. Then had you seen what was in the bundles? A. No - I saw what the two I had contained; I went up the lane leading from Whitton, and concealed them in a garden there - I saw a weather-glass at the Queen's Head, also a tea - caddy and two paintings; they were loose, not in bundles - I saw them all at the stable; they had all been brought from Mrs. Cole's - I never returned to the garden; part of the things have been found - I went with the officer to show him where to find them; I was taken up on suspicion on the Tuesday week following, and told what I knew the second time they had me at the office -Seth was taken before me; I took the officer to the garden - the knives, forks, and tea-pots were found, but not the plate; I was committed to give evidence, and have been a prisoner ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You come to give evidence to save yourself? A. Yes - nobody was present when I buried the things; I did not fetch the plate away afterwards - the hedge I concealed it in has since been cut down; I concealed it behind the bedge, between that and the paling - Davis told us to meet in the evening to concert the plan; I agreed at once to meet him - I had no spite against Mrs. Cole; I had no intention of any thing of the kind till Davis proposed it -I should not have gone if he had not said the lady was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Seth discharged, after you gave evidence against him? A. Not to my knowledge - I know William Croft, and was at the Queen's Head with him after the robbery; I had no quarrel with the prisoner there, nor did I threaten to do for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, in the presence of Croft, when the prisoner charged you with charging him wrongfully, say you would not have done so if you had been sober? A. No; I was not in his company at the Queen's Head after the robbery - I was never in his company; I helped to carry his brother's sedan chair - I never had notice that I should not carry it any more; the crow-bar belonged to Smith, the landlord of the house where I lodge - I took it without his leave; I did not furnish the fire-box - the summer house is about fifteen yards from the house; they had not got into the house before I left the summer-house - I went up to the house to see if they had got in; they had opened the window before I got up to them - I was not tipsy, I was sober; I had very little to drink - I will not swear I was sober; I was never taken up before for any thing - I repented very soon after committing the robbery; I did not go away - I was backwards and forwards; I did not give information through fear.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from repentance and the love of justice? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have been asked if you had any malice against Mrs. Cole, did you at all consider about robbing any other house? A. No - I have not been at liberty since I was taken up, to be at any public-house- I said nothing about the robbery to any soul alive till I was before the Justice; I had no quarrel with the prisoner - no promise of forgiveness was made to me to make a confession; I have not seen or heard of the plate since it was buried.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Twickenham. On the night Mrs. Cole's house was broken open I met Bunce, Kite, and Davis in Bell-lane; I went four, five, or six yards further on, and met Seth - I knew them all before from children; they were going towards town -Mrs. Cole's house lies that way; about half-past four o'clock in the morning I was going by the Queen's Head, and heard a footstep; I went up in the yard, and saw Kite and Davis - I asked what they were at there; Kite said he had drank a good deal of beer, and was full of piddle - I saw two metal tea-pots on the ground close to Kite's feet; I asked if they were going to be there the rest of the night - they said Yes; I saw nobody but them then - I went away through the yard to my own yard, which is close by; I heard Kite come and call Jem three times - I thought it was his voice; he was calling me -I made no answer; I found he came very near my yard, and I crept into my wash-house - Kite appeared to come close to my yard; he came round, and then went back to the stable where I first saw him; I thought I would see what they were up to, and as I went along I heard something fall down, which made a smash like galss - I then ran into the yard, and hallooed Robbers! Thieves! and sprang my rattle; four men rushed out of the stable directly - I told Kite and Davis, as they passed me, that I could swear to them both; I saw Bunce run, and then saw Seth - I am certain I saw Seth; I went into the stable, and saw all the property scattered about - I saw a barometer, tea-caddy, a pair of pictures, a good many sheets, and table-cloths, some loose, and some things in a large dark shawl; I staid there till the landlord of the house came down, and delivered it to Neale, while I went and got Begent, a constable - I then delivered all the property up to him. and he took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you hear Cole's house had been robbed? A. About half-past seven o'clock that morning; I saw Seth afterwards, but did not take him, because I could not see his face, as he had his left arm covered over his face when he ran by me out of the stable - I said I could not positively swear to him; I now swear to the best of my belief, not positively - his height, stature, clothes, and every thing corresponded, and I know I had seen him about ten minutes past twelve o'clock; I knew where he lived - he was not missing that I know of; I do not know when he was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Bunce always to be found? A. I do not know; I never knew of his going away - I am sure it was

            . I live at Twickenham, and have lived there twenty-two years - I had been away from my house for a few days before the 11th of December, but I came home every morning and shut the house up every night - there was not a drawer but what was locked, and every part of the house barred and secure; I was at home on Sunday morning the 11th, and left the house about ten o'clock - I did not lock it up myself at night, for I was taken ill, and Mr. Allnut, a friend of mine, locked it up and brought me the keys - he is not here; the windows do not shut very well; when I left in the morning it was shut as well as it would, and the shutters were fastened with two bars, both of which were fast - I was ill and did not return to the house till Wednesday; I observed every drawer broken open - the back door was broken down, and the window bars were bent; I did not see them myself - I found my property gone; all this property is mine - 40l. would not pay for what I have lost; my house is in Twickenham parish, in Middlesex -I pay rates to Twickenham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you no servant? A. No, the servant was gone - Mr. Allunt went to see every thing right; I did not see him, as I was in bed - he put the keys into the drawer of the room I was in, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mean to return to that house to occupy it? A. Yes, I have returned, and intend to occupy it.</p>

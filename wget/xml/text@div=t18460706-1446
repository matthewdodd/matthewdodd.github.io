                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 3, Match-walk. In the month of June, between one and two o'clock at night, I was standing at the bottom of Bluegate-fields, and met Margaret Follon—ihe is a married woman—I saw the prisoners there—Catherine was having a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with Mar<lb></lb>garet Follon—they were both strangers to me—the prisoner Catherine threw a jug of porter over Follon—it went all over her gown and face—Follon turned round to make an attempt, and the prisoner then struck her with the jug over the brow—Follon did not make any blow—she fell down—both the prisoners ran away, and I after them—I did not see the prisoner Thomas do or say any<lb></lb>thing—I examined Follon's head, and saw the cut, when the blood was washed off, at the station-house—she was afterwards taken to the hospital—she was waiting in the highway for her husband, who was gone to Gravesend—she seemed better than usual before she got the cut—I saw her last Friday, and she seemed very weak—I have not seen her since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 18th of June, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prosecutrix and Phillips standing at the prisoner's door, in Cow-lane—I believe the prisoners to be man and wife—Follon was bleeding very much about the head—the door was shut—we knocked to get in fur some time, but could not—we burst the door open, and found the two prisoners up stairs—Phillips said, in their presence, that they were the two who had committed the assault—they were dressed at the time—Phillips asked the female prisoner what she was looking after, and she said, "After the party who committed the assault"—Phillips said, "Oh, you are the party I am looking after"—she said nothing—the male prisoner said he did not see why he should be taken out of his own <hi rend="italic">castle—I</hi> took them both to the station, and afterwards took the prosecutrix to the hospital—the front of her head appeared to be cut very deep—I picked up some pieces of an earthen jug in the highway, opposite the Bull's Head, where Phillips pointed out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hos<lb></lb>pital.

                  </hi>. I am married. I know the prisoner Margaret—on the night in question I sent her out for a pot of porter, which she brought safe to me—it was in a blue jug which I had given her—that was about one hour before the policeman came and took her—I cannot tell where she had been before that—I was at her place—I lived there—I had been there all day in her company—she left at about a quarter to twelve o'clock, and was back be<lb></lb>fore twelve—I do not know anything of her before that time—I cannot say whether she was out at eleven o'clock—I was in the same house, but I cannot answer for where she goes—I am not down stairs to see who is in and who is out—I do not know when I had seen her last before—the policeman took her long after that—I was in bed when she was taken—I had seen her several times between eight and twelve o'clock—I cannot swear whether she was out between eight and twelve—I was never out.</p>

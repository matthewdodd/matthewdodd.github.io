                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at Limehouse. On the Bight of the 21st of July, about eleven o'clock, I was walking towards London, on the high-road between Southall and Hanwell—as I come a little way out of Southall, I was stopped by three men on the road—I never to my knowledge saw them before—they jostled me about, and I made my escape back to Southall—I saw the bone patrol and told him of it, and wished him to see into it—I then set off again, and when I got about three quarters of a mile on the road, the same three men assaulted me again—they beat me, knocked me about, and cut my eye' with a stick' or something hard; and said I might thank God they had not more time as the patrol was in sight, and they ran away—I was all in a gore of blood—, they could not take any thing from me, as the horse patrol was in sight, and they were obliged to go—I was kicked shamefully, but nothing was taken from me—they had hold of me and kicked me about—they did not put their hands into my poeket to my knowledge—I was perfectly sober—they were about ten minutes about me—I believe it was a stick they struck me with, it was something hard—I think they had been drinking—the prisoners are two of the men—Winfield is the one that said 1 might thank God they had not more time—I resisted, and struck Gordon with a stick, and he gave me a blow in the eye which cut my eye open.</p>

               <p>they might have said something without my hearing it—I go about getting orders for shoes from farmer's ladies, and make them—all the goods I carry are bespoke—I sell nothing but shoes and boots—the men were two or three minutes with me the first time, and the next time ten minutes, or it might be nearly a quarter of an hour—there was about half an hour or a little more between the first and second times—the patrol and they were talking together, and he told me to make the best of my way home, and he would see that I was not insulted on the road—I had better than thirty shillings about me, that was all safe in my side-coat pocket, and I bad about a dozen pairs of boots and shoes which were all safe in my basket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-patrol on the Uxbridge road. On the night of the 22nd of July I was near Southall-bridge, which crosses the railroad, and saw two men run towards Norwood-green—I rode after them, and got within twenty yards of them—one of them bolted through a hedge into a corn-field—I secured the other, which was Gordon—I asked what was the matter—he said there was nothing the matter, that they were going home, and the man that went through the hedge knew nothing of it—he appeared sober—I asked where he had been—he said to the White Hart, at Southall—I was taking him towards the White Hart, and saw the prosecutor bleeding very much about the face and head, and he said, "That is one of the men who ill-used me"—Gordon said nothing to that—the prosecutor said he had been attacked by three men and ill-used, and he believed they intended to rob him—I afterwards took the prosecutor to the White Hart, and gave Gordon into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sworn constable, on duty at Nichol<lb></lb>son's-wharf. On Saturday, the 26th of Oct., I was on duty, and in the course of the afternoon I saw a person named James Corney in a state of intoxication, whom I thought it my duty to take into custody for drunk<lb></lb>enness and a disturbance, and causing an obstruction to the business that was going on on the wharf—I proceeded to take him to the station in Tower-street—a mob began to collect at the south side of Thames-street, at the top of the gateway, near Billingsgate—the mob followed us to St. Mary-at-Hill—I saw Vaughan and Clow before we got there—they both said something—Clow said I had no business with the prisoner—I told him that I had—Vaughan was a little further on at that time—Corney was very violent, and tried to get away from me—Lloyd, a policeman, came to my assistance, and he laid hold of Corney on one side, and I on the other—Clow kept saying I had no business with him, I ought to let him go—when we got to a hoard at the bottom of St. Mary-at-Hill, Cor<lb></lb>ney laid hold of the hoard, clung to it, and tried to get out of my custody—the mob then made a rush upon Lloyd and me, but it was not success<lb></lb>ful—there was a truck in the way—Corney clung about the truck—we got him away from it—he said he would go with the officer if I would let go of him—I just let go of him for a minute, to see if he would go, but he would not, and I then took hold of him again—we got on to the upper end of the hoard, and he clung to it again—at that time I had got hold of him by the left arm, and Clow came, jumped on my arm, and broke me away from Corney, who got away from my grasp; at the same time Vaughan passed between me and Corney—I was then quite separated from Corney—the mob then became very violent to me—I was knocked down by some one, I do not know who—I saw Vaughan before I was knocked down—he was not a yard from me—he said I had no business with the prisoner—he likewise said that he would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for me—I was then either pushed or knocked down, and while I was down I was kicked about my body—as I was in the act of rising, Sadd kicked me on the outer part of my right thigh—I knew Sadd by sight, and said to him, "I know your face well, and I will have you as soon as I get out of the mob"—he said, "Go on, go on, kill the b—b"—he then seemed to bear down the hill through the mob, and I saw no more of him—Vaughan still kept exciting the mob on to me—he said, "Kill him"—he shook his hand in my face—I did not see him strike me—he had one of his hands in a sling or handkerchief—I was then knocked or pushed down again by the mob, and kicked all over my body while down—when I got up again I saw Vaughan and Clow—Clow said something, and struck me a violent blow on my face with his fist, I believe—I did not see any instrument—Vaughan was saying something at the same time, but I could not distin<lb></lb>guish what it was—the blow which Clow gave me knocked me down; I was almost senseless, and while down I was kicked again—I had produced my staff before this, when they broke me away from Corney, after Clow jumped on my arm—somebody came to my assistance, and I got into the Blue Anchor public-house by some means; I do not know how I got in—it is very near the spot where I was knocked down the third time—my cheek was cut by the blow Clow gave me, and bled very much—I was blind with my right eye—I afterwards went with Corney to the station, and gave him in charge—I then went, in company with Webb, who is a person employed at the wharf, to Mr. Smith, the doctor's—I afterwards saw Sadd—I went to him, and said, "You are my prisoner; I told you I should have you"—he tried to escape—Webb was with me and he ulti<lb></lb>mately</p>

               <p>secured him—after we had secured him he said, "Don't take me, and I will tell you who it was struck you; it was Clow struck you"—he was taken to the station—he there said it was Clow that struck me, and said he did not, he was not there at the time—I had some more conversation with him afterwards—he said if I did not do anything to him, he would be as a witness for me—the same evening I found Clow at a public-house—he said he knew what we were after, after that job in the City, and pointing to me, he said, "I gave that fellow a slap in the face; I should not have struck him if he had not hit me with that brass ornament"—I had had my staff in my hand—I could not get it into my pocket—I did not hit him with it—I was afterwards attended by a doctor—I spit blood from the injuries I received—I had not known Vaughan before—I did not strike any of the prisoners with my fist or staff.</p>

On Saturday, the 26th of October, about three o'clock or a little after, I was coming down St. Mary-at-Hill, and saw Lock turn the corner out of Thames-street into St. Mary-at-Hill with a pri<lb></lb>soner—he caught hold of a truck wheel which was standing at the corner, and became very violent—I did not see the City policeman at that time—I saw him directly afterwards—there were not more than a dozen people assembled at that time—I then saw Vaughan come up to Lock and call him a b—vagabond and a b—brute, and asked him if he remembered the time he sold lucifer matches—he shook his fist in his face, and told him he had no authority for taking the prisoner—Lock put his hand in his pocket and took out his staff, and said, "I have authority to take the prisoner"—the policeman was there by that time, and they got him a little further, as far as the corner of the hoarding, where the prisoner again caught hold of it, and said he would not go, he would go with the policeman, but not with Lock—the mob then became very numerous, and made a general rush at the prisoner, and Clow threw himself between Lock and the prisoner, and broke off Lock's hold—the policeman went away with the drunken man, and left Lock to the mercy of the crowd—I then saw them surround Lock, and push him about from one side of the way to the other, till some one from behind struck him a blow on the top of his hat, which knocked his hat flat to his head, what is called <hi rend="italic">bonneting</hi>—it was a shiny hat, with "Nicholson's wharf" on it—I then saw Clow strike him a violent blow on the side of the face, which knocked him down to the ground—I then saw Vaughan kick him and step over him—he kicked him first and then stepped over him—he did not touch him when he stepped over him—I should think he was kicked a great many times by the mob from the time he was down, for he scrambled on his hands and feet nearly to the side of the road before he got up again, and at that time I saw he had a violent bruise on the side of his face, which was swollen and bleeding—I then saw him stagger into the Blue Anchor public-house—a man inside shot the bolt, and that shut them out.</p>

I assisted in taking Clow into custody on the 26th—he said he would not go to the station-house, for Lock had no warrant to take him—he refused to go—I told him I did not want a warrant for his apprehension, there was enough said by the consta<lb></lb>ble to justify me in taking him—I did take him—he said that the constable struck him with his brass ornament, and that he struck him in return.</p>

I examined Lock on the Monday after he was injured—my assistant saw him on the Saturday—he had received contusions of the chest and arm, and a wound on the right cheek—he was considerably injured—I considered him in jeopardy—he kept his bed for ten days.</p>

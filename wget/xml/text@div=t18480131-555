                  </hi>. I am a clerk to the Eastern Countries Railway Company. The prisoner was engaged by the Company in the granary department—it was his duty when goods came in, consigned to persons in London, to send them out by the carman—I have the order-book here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are fifteen sacks of peas. mine sacks of potatoes, and sixteen and a half quarters of beans, entered as consigned to Messrs. Noble on 16th Oct., and on 18th, twenty-three and one-eighth sacks of peas—the entries are in the prisoner's writing—he should send a bill of this kind (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it ought to specify the right amount of cartage charged—he should also send out two tickets, one to leave with the consignee, and the other to bring back signed by him, one would also be left in the book as a check—I produce a ticket-book—here is the counterfoil check of the twenty-three and one-eighth sacks of peas on 18th Oct., and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered on it as the amount of cartage payable by Messrs. Noble—that is in the prisoner's writing—these two tickets are what he sends out—it was his duty to write the right amount on the front of the ticket before giving it to the carman—on the back of the ticket there appears to have been 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altered to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner was to pay the amount of the cartage to me—this is his petty cash-book, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is there entered as the cartage received—I received that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him, and no more—on 16th Oct. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the proper charge—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been the amount at the back of the ticket, and it has been altered to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. John and William Noble. On 19th Oct.

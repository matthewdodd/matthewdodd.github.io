               <p>WILLIAM COGGAN BOLTON. I live in Furnival's-inn. On the evening of the 30th of June, about five o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18260914-163-crimeloc948">Chandos-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. You went home with me - you had no money, and left the handkerchief with me. Witness. I had not the slightest conversation with her.</p>

            . The prisoner came to me, and gave me this information; I went into the house with him, and the prisoner was standing in the yard - I took hold of her, and behind her there was a cellar, and I saw the handkerchief down there - I got it up; she said, "For God's sake let the gentleman forgive me."</p>

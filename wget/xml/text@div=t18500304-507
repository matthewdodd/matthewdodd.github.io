                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Stagg and Mantle, linen-drapers, in Leicester-square. The prisoner was in their employment—in consequence of something I had perceived, on 22nd Dec. I made a com<lb></lb>munication to Smith, another shopman, and on 24th, I and Arnold, and Jefferies, watched the conduct of the prisoner—it was the Monday before Christmas-day—we had a customer named Madame Routens—a little boy and girl used to come for things for her—they both came on the 24th, the girl came I think about two o'clock—I then made a communication to Jefferies—while the girl was waiting I saw the prisoner cut off three yards of velvet and put it under the counter, between some boxes—I saw him serve the little girl with a few trifling things—Mr. Mantle was in the shop at the time—after the little girl was gone I and Jefferies went to the place where I had seen him put the velvet, and found it there—that was not the usual and ordinary place to put goods—there was also a silk dress in the same place—Madame Routens' little boy came that day—I cannot say how long after the little girl had left, but I think about an hour—I saw the prisoner serve the boy with two pairs of gloves and a piece of lining—these are them(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when goods are sold to a customer on credit, it is the practice for the shopman to take the goods to the desk and get them entered separately by the entering clerk, and <hi rend="italic">called back</hi> by the shop-walker, or one of the shopmen, to see if the goods correspond with the entry—Mr. Smith was walking the shop at that time, Jefferies was there also—I saw the prisoner go to the entering clerk with the gloves and muslin—that was all he had—he then returned to the counter where the boy was standing, that is close by where I had seen the silk and</p>

                  </hi>. From a communication I had from my brother shopman, I watched the prisoner on 24th Dec—I did not see the velvet cut—from what Jefferies told me I went behind the counter and found the velvet and silk dress, they were not lying in a usual place for articles about to be sold—I saw Madame Routens' little girl come in; she was served by the prisoner with some wires and nets, such as we usually sell her—they are articles of very small value—after she had been served she left the shop—about an hour after that the boy came in—I continued to watch—at the time the boy came in Mr. Stagg was in the shop—I saw the boy served with some gloves and lining, articles of small value—I saw them entered—I was the shop-walker—after the goods had been entered the prisoner had another young man to call them back—I then returned to the place where the silk and velvet was—Mr. Stagg was then walking about the shop—the prisoner then put the lining and gloves, the velvet and silk, in paper, and gave it to the boy immediately—the velvet and silk remained under the counter, where the prisoner had placed them, until I saw them delivered to the boy—I saw the boy leave the shop, I sent Arnold to stop him—I was present when he was stopped on the pavement, and took him back into the shop with Arnold—I found the velvet and other articles with the boy; he was taken to the counting-house, the prisoner was sent for, he came, and Arnold asked him what the silk and velvet was—he said they were for Madame Routens—Arnold asked him if they were entered—he said they were—Arnold asked him who saw them backed—he said, "Jefferies;" Jefferies, who was present at the time, said, "No," he had only seen the lining and the gloves—the prisoner then said that the silk and velvet were going out on approbation—Arnold said they were entered after the boy had left the shop—I am not aware what the prisoner said to that—he said they had been ordered on the Sunday—Mr. Stagg sent for a constable, and gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>and gloves for him—nothing else was called back at that time—when the prisoner was asked in the counting-house for whom the muslin and gloves were, he said they were for Madame Routens; that they were entered, and that I had cried them back—I immediately replied, "No, Bradley, I did not, I only heard the muslin and the gloves"—my attention was particularly called to see what he really did have entered—the entry-clerk called back from the book what he had entered, and I saw that there was nothing but the gloves and muslin on the counter at the same time—I listen to what is called out, and then I see that the articles produced correspond with what is called out—what was called out was merely the gloves and lining, and there was nothing else there, and nothing else was produced—the entering-desk is about from twelve to fifteen yards from where the prisoner put the velvet with the muslin.</p>

I was in the shop on 24th Dec.—I saw the girl in the shop—I afterwards saw the boy come in—I saw the prisoner cut the muslin off, and take it and the gloves to the desk—I did not see him cut the velvet; the silk was a dress length—I did not hear what the prisoner said to Salmon, the entering-clerk, he came back with the gloves and the muslin—he went behind the counter afterwards, and I saw him deliver a parcel—I then went and stopped the boy in the street, and brought him back—when the boy was brought back, the prisoner immediately left the counter, and went to the entering-desk—I did not hear what he did there—I went into the counting-house—I called the prisoner out of the entering-desk and told him I wanted to speak to him, and asked him to go up stairs into the counting-house with me—he did so—I then asked him who those goods were for that were lying open on the desk in the counting-house, pointing to the silk and velvet—he said they were for Madame Routens—I said, "Are they entered, Bradley?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Who called them back?"—he said, "Jefferies"—Jefferies said, "No, Bradley, I beg your pardon, I did not"—up to this time he had not said anything about the goods being sent out on approbation—I asked when he had seen Madame Routens—he said the day previous—I said, "That was Sunday"—he said, "Yes"—I believe I said it was a curious day for doing business—he then said he had previously cut patterns off, and then afterwards he said they were entered on approbation to Madame Routens—I should say three yards of velvet would not be cut off to be sent out on approbation—this is the velvet and dress(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the value of the dress is 57<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the velvet 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—a length of velvet varies from fifty to sixty yards—a policeman was sent for, and the prisoner given into custody—I went to make inquiry of Madame Routens—</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with William Grimwood Mantle, as haberdashers, in Leicester-square. The prisoner has been in our employment four or five years—three yards of velvet would not be cut off to be sent on approbation, no such thing could occur regularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know from Mr. Mantle, that the prisoner had given notice of his intention to leave a fortnight before this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Mr. Mantle is not here—I do not know of Madame Routen's having been introduced to the prisoner by Mr. Mantle—I was not before the Magistrate—I do not know of the prisoner having been in treaty for a shop in Titchbourne-street, I never heard of it—I think it was about three weeks after receiving this letter(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)that I went before the Grand Jury.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you given instructions to proceed against the prisoner, before you received that letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We had, we had employed our solicitor, and given instructions—I never heard until the present moment of the prisoner having given Mr. Mantle notice, or of his being introduced by him to Madame Routens, or about the shop in Titchbourne-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would Madame Routens address herself to the prisoner, as understanding French, in preference to the others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was a per<lb></lb>son to whom foreigners were referred.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The letter produced to Mr. Stagg was from Mr. Humphreys, the prison<lb></lb>er's attorney, and was as follows</hi>:—"Giltspur Chambers, 10th Feb., 1850. Gentlemen, we are instructed by Mr. William Bradley, your late shopman, to apply to you, in consequence of your having apprehended him upon an unfounded charge of stealing your property, and also of your having de<lb></lb>clined to pay him his wages due for the time during which he was in your service. You must be aware that his character has sustained, and must sustain considerable injury by your act; and trusting that a respectable house like yours will have no objection to replace him in as respectable a position as he was before your charge was made against him, we propose that you do, in writing, acknowledge that the charge made was so made from misappre<lb></lb>hension and misconception, and that you are satisfied, as the Magistrate was, that it was unfounded, and that you regret it ever was made; and fur<lb></lb>ther, that you do pay to him the wages due, being, as we are informed, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. If you comply with this suggestion, we shall recommend Mr. Bradley to be satisfied, and not to seek compensation for the injury he has sustained; if not, he has no alternative but to submit the whole matter for the consideration of a Jury."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Routens, and am a milliner and dress-maker, at Charles-street, Soho-square. I have lived there four years, and nearly two years in Lower John-street—I have dealt with Stagg and Mantle five years—I know the prisoner as a shopman there—during the last year I was a credit customer there—prior to that I was a ready-money customer—I became acquainted with the prisoner through Mr. Mantle—he told me, because I could not speak very good English, he would give me a young man to speak French to serve me—I found that the prisoner spoke French very well—at that time I could not speak English so well as I do now—during</p>

               <p>the whole of last year I had an account with Stagg and Mantle—I paid the bill in Dec.—I do not remember exactly the day—I have the receipts—I have known the prisoner ever since he has been there; not before—sometimes he has called on me of an evening to know if I had any orders, and sometimes he has called as a friend—he sometimes called on a Sunday—if we had a party, he was invited—I heard of this the same evening that he was taken up—I had given him an order on the Friday morning before Christmas-day to send me three yards of silk velvet, and also a half-mourning dress for a choice—if the dress suited me I was to keep it, and if it did not I was to send it back—he called in that evening to know if I wanted anything—on the Sunday following he called in the afternoon—I reproached him because he did not send me the goods—Sophia Martelli was present, and a Mrs. Rich; they are in my employment—on the Monday I sent to Stagg and Mantle's twice or three times—I sometimes send five or six times in the day—it depends on what things I want—if a customer came for anything which she wanted immediately I should send there for it if I had not got it—they knew this, and asked me several times if Mr. Bradley served me properly—they were well aware that I was in the habit of sending several times a day—I paid ready money before the account was opened—I should think my dealing with them has been between 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I remember on the Monday evening the prisoner was taken, a gentleman from Stagg and Mantle's and a policeman coming together to me—the policeman asked me if I had sent for any goods—I had not ordered the dress or velvet on the Monday or Friday—I meant to pay for the velvet, and that it should be entered at Stagg and Mantle's—if I had approved of the dress and kept it I should have paid Mr. Mantle for it—I never paid anybody but him in the shop—I was at Stagg and Mantle's myself once or twice a week—I have waited several times, when Bradley was serving other customers, that he might serve me—I never applied to any one else to serve me after Mr. Mantle introduced him to me—sometimes one of the partners served me if he was engaged—they well knew that the prisoner was appointed to serve me.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had he been in the habit of visiting you on these friendly terms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think not more than a year, or a year and a half—when we had a party he joined it some<lb></lb>times—sometimes one of our young ladies were invited—no other of Messrs. Stagg and Mantle's young men were there—the prisoner called sometimes in the evening, but very seldom—Stagg and Mantle knew that he came to get orders, because I had asked Mr. Mantle how it was he never called on me, and he said, "I will call in some day"—he never did come; he looked outside the window, but never came in—I had an order to make bonnets of the velvet—I did not tell the prisoner that I had the order, I told him I wanted the velvet—he perfectly understood it was to be sent to me as a matter of sale—on the Monday I sent my little girl for some goods, and something of a small amount—I did not send her for the dress and velvet—I did not expect her to bring them back—she came back before the boy was sent—I think the boy was sent about seven in the evening—I do not remember that he was there at three—I do not know how he came to go at three, perhaps some of the young ladies sent him; they did so sometimes—I did not know that the boy was stopped till between ten and eleven at night—I sent him for one or two pair of gloves, for a lady who was waiting at the time in the shop to go to a concert—I did not send him, or anybody, that day for velvet or silk—I did not send for any muslin or any lining—when the policeman came, he asked me if I had sent for any goods—he did not say any date—I think the words he used were,</p>

               <p>"Have you sent for any goods to Stagg and Mantle's?"—I said "I had sent for two or three pair of gloves"—he then asked me if I had sent for anything else, and I said "No"—he said "Have you not sent for anything?"—he asked me twice, and I said, "No, I had not"—I do not remember that he asked me when I had seen Mr. Bradley, and that I said I had not seen him that day—I could say that I had not seen him that day—I do not think I told the policeman that I could not say when I had seen Mr. Bradley—I think I told him I had not seen him, because I do not remember having seen him that day—he did ask me if I had seen Bradley—I said, "I had not"—he said, "Because young men are in the habit sometimes of having goods and sending them out, and then calling a day or two afterwards for the parcel, and going and selling them, and keeping the money"—I do not remember the policeman asking when I had seen him—I do not think he did—I did not say, "I can't tell you within a few days or a week"—I did not mention any<lb></lb>thing of the kind—he did not ask whether I had seen him on the Sunday—nothing of the kind—I did not tell Mr. Arnold and the policeman I had seen him the very day before, or that I had seen him the Friday before—I do not remember that I told either of them that I had given an order for any velvet—I recollect the young lady saying, as I came down stairs, "You recollect you gave an order on Friday"—she did not speak to the policeman—she had not seen the policeman—I think I told them that I had ordered certain goods—I told them I had ordered goods in the week—I do not think I told them anything about velvet or silk on the Monday night—I cannot swear it—I I told the policeman that Mr. Bradley was in the habit of calling, and that I was in the habit of giving him orders—I do not know whether I mentioned the day—I have never heard from anybody of any parcels being left at my shop—three young men came to my house on the day the prisoner was before the Magistrate; one of the shopmen, a gentleman whom I do not know, and the prisoner's brother—neither of them spoke to me in French, or any language except English—Mr. Arnold came up-stairs, and asked me to go to Mr. Mantle's—I said, "Very well"—I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> with Mr. Bradley's brother and the other gentleman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and dealer, and live at Kempsey in Worcestershire. I had a gelding pony, which I saw safe about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th of June—I missed it between four and five next morning—I have since seen it, I think on the 20th of Oct., in the possession of Mr. Ludlow, in the Borough—I am sure it was the same pony.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live in Queen's-road, Bayswater. I bought a gelding pony of the prisoner at the latter end of June, at his house at Kensal New<lb></lb>town—I had seen it in his possession some time before I bought it—I cannot exactly say how long, but I should think two or three weeks—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and agreed to give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., provided I sold it again, if he wanted it back—I sold it to Mr. Ludlow in Sept., between the 10th and 20th, as near as I can recollect, for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the prosecutor has since seen the pony in my presence—I pro<lb></lb>duced it to him, and he claimed it—it was on a Sunday morning, in Oct.</p>

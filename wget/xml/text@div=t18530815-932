                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Robert Westwood and Co., chemists, of Newgate-street. The prisoner came to the shop, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, on 5th July—he asked if we sold attar of roses—I said, "Yes; what quantity do you want?"—he said, "About two ounces;" on which he handed me a bottle, and I filled it—it contained an ounce and three quarters—I made him out an invoice, at 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—the amount was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "I have not got sufficient money with me;" on which he said he would go and fetch the money—I did not give him the bill—he went away, and returned in three or four minutes</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185308150110"></xptr>
               <p>—he then asked me whether I had any oil of oranges—I said, "Yes"—he asked for half an ounce of it, which I gave him—he said he would pay for that—he gave me a shilling, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he then disputed the price of the attar, which I had told him was 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce, saying he could get it cheaper at Messrs. Grosmith's, perfumers, in our street—after that contention, I went backwards to the counting-house to inquire whether they would take less than 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—I left the prisoner alone in the shop—I came back, and told him he could have it at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—I put "Settled" to the invoice, and handed it to him—he again said he had not sufficient money, but he would go and fetch it, and return immediately for it—he went out, but never returned—on going to business the next morning I discovered that one of the bottles had been changed, and I made a communication to the firm—that was on the morning of 6th July—the next time I saw the prisoner was on 15th July, in Goswell-street, close by the Three Cups—I went up to him, and told him he was the party that came to Messrs. Westwood's for the attar—he said he did not know the name nor the firm—I told him I was certain he was the man, and I asked him to give me his card; on which he handed me one, with "James Holloway, tailor and draper, 145, Old-street, Gos well-street," on it—I doubted the genuineness of the card, and told him I did not think it was a good one; on which he said that was his address; I should find him there if I went to his lodging—I then said, "Will you <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with me to your lodging?" meaning the address on the card—he said, "No; I have business to go and settle"—I followed him—he went down Westmoreland-buildings, and through Bartholomew-close, into Duke-street—on reaching there, I saw an officer—I told the prisoner I wished him to go with me to this address—he said he would go, and he took me to the top of Long-lane, not to where the card was—when he got there, he said be would go to Mr. Westwood's; and on reaching there, he said if I would let him go he would pay for it—I said I should do no such thing; I should give him in custody of the policeman—I produce the bottle which he left in exchange for the bottle of attar—it contains, I believe, common olive oil—it very much resembles the attar in appearance—I could not tell the difference of the two—I should think this is worth 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the attar was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

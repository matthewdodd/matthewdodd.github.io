               <p>I am servant to Mr. Curtis the glazier, who was employed at the Bank; on the 4th of April between twelve and one at noon, I perceived a kind of hammering, I was cleaning a lamp, I went up to the top of the building, I returned, and afterwards heard the same rummage, and I went into the place they call the Slip in the Bank, and I heard a door open, and I perceived the prisoner open the door; he had a blue coat on, he came down, and I perceived as he came down by one of the doors of the Warrant-office, that he had some copper under his coat, under his arm; I put my hand on it and I felt it; I collared him and I asked him what he had got; he said never mind; is my labourer here? I am going to Petticoat-lane, and we will get something to drink; I then ran into the Bank coffee-house, to see if any gentleman who belonged to the business was there; and from there I went to the White Horse, and got another person to assist me, and we followed him and took him in Throgmorton-street, opposite to Draper's Hall.</p>

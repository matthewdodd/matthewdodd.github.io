On 2nd Nov. I was out with the prisoner, and recollect his going to Dewhurst's shop—I was not present when he received the money, but I recollect his going to Mills's, and was present when he received the money there—we both returned home together in the evening—it was our custom to pay the money as soon as we came in, either to muster or mistress, whoever was there—that evening the prisoner came in to tea, he wished to go down the yard—I said, "Don't be long, the tea is ready"—it was then half-past seven, and I did not see him again till he was in custody three or four days after.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ELIZABETH WOOD</hi>. I am the wife of Edward Wood, and live in John-street, Hackney-fields. The prisoner lived two doors from us—on the night of the 11th of December, I missed, from a line in our back yard, three frocks, a flannel petticoat, and two aprons—I went to a pawnbroker's shop, in Hackney-road, and the prisoner was fetched into the shop, from out of the street, and my things produced to me by the pawnbroker—I asked her who gave them to her—she said, "No one"—I asked her how she came by them—she said she took them off the line herself—there was a policeman at the door, who took her into custody—this was a at half-past seven o'clock—I had missed them at six o'clock—I have not found my apron—these are my things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Kelday, a pawnbroker, in Hackney-road. On the 11th of December, Mrs. Wood came to my shop—the articles now produced were at that time on the counter, produced by the prisoner—they directly before her, and there was nobody else in the same box—the prosecutrix came into the shop, and produced the pat<lb></lb>terns of the things, and then the prisoner immediately ran out of the box—I went out and brought her back—she said nothing in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody at the pawnbroker's—the prosecutrix and her were talking together—I did not distinctly hear what was said—there was a confusion in the shop at the time—I took her to the station-house, and asked her if any body gave her the things to pawn—she said, no; that she took them off the line in the yard herself—Mrs. Wood must have heard that.</p>

            ; last Saturday night I slept in the same room with the prisoner, in a separate bed; it was past twelve o'clock when we went to bed; we were to take a swim the next morning in the river, or pond, or wherever it is; at four o'clock I looked at my watch, I thought it too early to get up; I always kept it under my pillow, for fear my head should hurt the watch; the prisonr's bed-fellow went out at the time I looked at my watch; I had no bedfellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. No; I then settled myself, but did not go to sleep; then the prisoner got up and dressed himself in his working cloaths, with his apron on; it was then about five o'clock; my face was to the wall, and my back to him; he pulled my breeches from under my head; I at first thought he might have been getting something of his own that he had left there the day before, but I turned round, and saw him putting my watch and money in his jacket pocket; he then threw the breeches in my face, slapped to the door, and ran down stairs; I laid without a shirt; I got up and run to the head of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he slept in the room with you? - A.About a month; I was ashamed to run naked after him in the street; I came back and put my cloaths on, and run after him; I pursued up and down, but could not find him, till by and by I met him with two brothers-in-law and his fellow-lodger coming out of the Mews, going out of Duke-street and Orchard-street; it was about two hours afterwards; I demanded my property of him, and he began to make game of me and hum-bug me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you all your property back? - A. Not a halfpenny-worth; I asked him for my watch, and he said if I waited till he gave me one I should go without; I asked him what he took it for, and a pressed him, but it was all in vain; I ran to the watch-house for a constable, and while I was gone for a constable he parted from his company and went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you were going for a constable? - A. I did; then the constable would not wait about looking for him, and I was left alone, having no friend with me, till at last I found him and

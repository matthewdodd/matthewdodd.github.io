               <p>I am smith to Mr. Dagge, I made these bars, and know they are his; I placed these bars in the green-house copper hole, I tried them there, and they fitted, they are the same I placed; and here are two or three of the bars particularly marked, I can swear to them: I saw them there about a fortnight or three weeks before.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went out to look for a day's work, and I thought it too early, and seeing this shed just by the foot-way, I went in to lay down for an hour or two, and in this shed there was some hay, and I thought to lay down in the hay, and this gentleman desired me not to stir, I said no, I shall not stir, I am going to lay down: but I am as innocent of the fact as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this indictment is founded on a statute for stealing a quantity of iron fixed to a dwelling-house, now the fact that is proved is, that it was not fixed to the dwelling-house, but fixed to the cow-house, and afterwards found in the cow-house, and though it is very probable the prisoner was the person who did wrench them: it would have been an offence at common law, but upon this evidence as applied to this indictment you must acquit the prisoner.</p>

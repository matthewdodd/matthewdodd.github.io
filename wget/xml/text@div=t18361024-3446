                  </hi>. I am a pupil at the school of Mr. Orlando Bells, in Greenwich-road. I keep pigeons—I cut the feathers of one wing of three of them, to prevent their flying—I had them safe last Sunday week, the 1st of October, and missed six on Monday—I saw them again after<lb></lb>wards—three of them had their wings cut, and three had not.</p>

I had permission to invite Harriet Woolvett (the prisoner's sister) to tea with me on the Sun<lb></lb>day—I went and fetched her, and asked Sarah Ann Woolvett, the prisoner, and Collins, and Hammond, to tea—I had five persons in all—they staid till half past nine o'clock—I was absent from them twenty minutes, or half an hour, talking to a person—I had frequently seen Master Browne go up to the loft the stable to feed the pigeons—that place had no commu<lb></lb>nication with the place where I was at tea—when my party left, the had no pigeons—the young gentleman were at home that day—I do not know of any means by which the pigeons could have been taken at tea-time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Taylor, of East-lane Greenwich—he is a pensioner. On Monday evening the 16th of October, between seven and eight o'clock the prisoner came to my house and asked if I would take care of these pigeons—he had them in a bag—I said I would take the bag—he took one out in his hand, and was going to let him fly—I said, "Don't"—he said, "Have you got a basket?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I will fetch one"—he was gone about ten minutes—he left the pigeons in the basket—next day I heard he was taken about the pigeons, and I went to the station-house and delivered them up.</p>

            . On the 15th of September, I had been to Clerkenwell; the prisoner (who is my husband) had been discharged that day from Clerkenwell, upon his own recognizance, to keep the peace towards me. I lived in High-street, Portland-town, St. Mary-le-bone - I had not lived with him for three years, but he knew where I lived. I was going home, and at the top of <placeName id="t18231022-1-crimeloc4">Park-street, Regent's-park</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18231022-1-crimeloc4" type="placeName" value="Park-street, Regent's-park"></interp>

I said,</p>
               <p>"Scott, don't come near me, nor trouble me, I don't wish to bring you into any more trouble, go along" - he said,</p>
               <p>"I can follow you as long as I like," and called me a wh - e. I asked the young man for protection, and if he could get me a constable; upon which he pushed Scott by the shoulder, and said,</p>
               <p>"Go along Scott." I then left him, and crossed the top of Park-street, to an apple-stall, where a man, woman, and boy stood, and asked if the watch was set - the boy said it was not set till eight o'clock; (it was then about seven) I said I would stop there till the watch was set, and get a watchman to see me home. The prisoner came to me, put his left arm round my neck, and said something which I could not distinctly hear - he then said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got a knife you know, but I will murder you on the spot;" I thought he was going to cut my throat from the position he was in, and put up my hand, and he began stabbing towards my throat - I received the stab in my hands; he had then got me off the pavement into the road. I screamed out Murder! as loud as I could, and when I got from him, I saw several people about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut your hands - A. Yes, and my left shoulder and arm. I screamed out Murder, and saw several men and women collected. I ran towards a man who stood with his face towards me, stood behind him, and put my arms round his waist, in order to keep him between me and Scott, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! save me, he has stabbed me, and I am a dead woman." The man separated my hands, and pushed me away - I staggered along. Scott caught me again, put his arm round my neck, and again began to stab me over the left side of the temple. I put up my left hand, and caught hold of something in his hand, which felt like the ring part of a key; I held his hand for a minute - he got it away, and stabbed me behind the ear, on the right side, and then I received several stabs on my right hand, and one over my right breast - I got from him and attempted to run, but could not, and said to somebody,</p>
               <p>"Pray take me to Mr. Lucas, the surgeon." I heard a voice say,</p>
               <p>"Oh! stop him, he has stabbed me on the thumb." I was taken to the surgeon's; some of my wounds were slight - I had eight on my left hand, two on the left temple, one on the forehead, one at my right ear, two or three small ones at my right hand, and one over my right breast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How long have you been married to him - A. Nineteen years; I lived sixteen years with him, but not on good terms. I know Sinclair - we never quarrelled on his account. I separated from the prisoner three years ago the middle of next winter, and never lived with him after. I had a child two years ago last September; it is now dead - the hospital books will prove when it was born. I should think the wounds were made with scissars; he is a <rs id="t18231022-1-deflabel5" type="occupation">tailor</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18231022-1-defend53 t18231022-1-deflabel5"></join>, and uses scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been alone when you met him - A. The last person I spoke to was Mr. Hart Davis, coachman; that was in Greek-street, Soho. Nobody was with me when the prisoner came in sight, nobody ran away. I live in a house which belongs to Sinclair; he is my cousin, and does not reside there, but took it in his name for me to live in.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he said,</p>

               <p>"I have not got a knife," did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220004"></xptr>he not say,</p>
               <p>"I have not got a knife, or I would murder you" - A. No, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got a knife you know, but I will murder you on the spot." I felt no pain at first, but felt the blood running down - I did not scuffle with him, except to get away. I put my hand to my throat, and thought I felt the ring part of a key in his hand - it might be scissars.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Sinclair is your cousin - A. Yes; he put me in the house to let it, for his profit, in order that Scott should not turn me out, and take the goods - they are there in his name, that Scott should not seize them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he been in custody upon your charge - A. From the 24th of July; he was discharged on the 15th of September, a little after one o'clock. I had not been home before he attacked me. I am a laundress, and had been collecting my linen. I never said a word to him after he left the Court, till he came and attacked me - I had not seen him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Carlton-place, Regent's-park. The prosecutrix was brought to my house, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 15th of September - she was wounded in the forehead in several places, and had one wound on her temple, one on her left arm, and wounds on her left hand and fingers, and on her other hand. I perceived next day some trifling pricks of an instrument on her breast. I forgot to mention a wound on the side of the lower part of the right ear; it was an incised wound, and appeared to be inflicted by a narrow sharp pointed instrument - the wound on her forehead extended to the scull; that on the temple had divided the artery - one on the left arm had torn part of the muscle, and the others had divided the skin of several of the fingers, nothing more. None of the wounds except that on the temple were at all likely to produce death.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they likely to do any considerable harm - A. One of those on the finger has injured the nerves, so that at this time she is not able to move them. Her wounds are now all healed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The cut on the ear appeared to be inflicted with a narrow sharp instrument, was it such a wound as might be increased by her turning away, supposing a puncture was intended - A. Certainly, it might be; the extension of the wound was a greater injury than the puncture would have been. I think it was done with the violence of the man striking her, and tearing the instrument out, her moving away might extend it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say an artery was divided, you mean it was larcerated - A. I consider it so much divided that she might have bled to death if neglected; it was cut across; I did not examine the exact state of it, for I healed it by pressing it. The wound that penetrated to the scull was a very slight depth. I have ceased to attend her for the last fortnight or three weeks - I very soon healed them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. One of the wounds might have produced death if it had not been stopped - A. Yes, my Lord.</p>

            . I keep livery-stables near Regent's-park. On the 15th of September, about seven o'clock I was in my yard, and heard screams, went out, and in the road saw a man and woman struggling in the foot-path; the woman extricated herself from him, and ran into the middle of the road - I thought her face appeared bloody; he attempted to follow her; I pushed forward, and prevented him, and as I put my hands upon him I received the point of something at the end of my thumb, and received a trifling wound. I collared him, and requested my man (Argust) who was behind, to take a knife from him, as I thought he had one - he took a pair of scissars from him, which were bloody.</p>

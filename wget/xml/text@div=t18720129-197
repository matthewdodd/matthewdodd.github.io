On 2nd January, about 1.20 a.m., I was on duty in High Street, Bromley, and heard a cry of "Murder!" and "Police!"—I found the prisoner at 5, High Street, sitting on the floor just inside the door—I asked him what was the matter—he said "I have done it at last, I have cut my wife's throat"—I went into the shop and saw the prisoner's wife sitting in a chair, with a wound on the right side of her face, and her dress saturated with blood down the front—I asked her in the prisoner's presence how it happened—she said "I don't know"—I followed the track of blood into the back room behind the shop, where there was a bed, and found by the side of the bed this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), open and covered with wet blood—I afterwards showed it to the doctor—I went back into the shop with the knife in my hand, and the prisoner said "That is what I did it with, I have murdered my wife, I shall be hung for it"—I asked her in his presence how it happened—she said "I was helping him into bed when he flung his arm round and struck me, I put my hand up and felt blood"—I took the prisoner to the station on a stretcher—he was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Kent House, Bow Road—on 2nd January I was called and saw the prosecutrix—she was quite sensible but had lost a considerable quantity of blood from an incised wound on the right temple, extending two inches down to the ear—it was not dangerous at first, but subsequently lock-jaw was threatened—the wound might have been caused by this knife.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—on 2nd January I was in bed—the prisoner did not come to bed till between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning—he asked me to assist him into bed—I put my right arm under his left shoulder, and as soon as he put his hand on my shoulder I felt something sharp in the side of my face—I said "What have you done?"—he said "I have done it at last"—I went out into the back-room, and came in again, and said "I feel very bad"—he said "Yes, you are dying"—I said "Yes, I believe I am dying"—he said "Come and sit down by the side of me, and then you will die happy"—I said "No, I shall not do that"—he went to the door and called for assistance loudly, and a policeman came up—we had had no quarrel that evening, but he has a very irritable temper, and I said after 12 o'clock that it was getting very late—he said that he should not come to bed, he wanted to sit up to see the new year in—he has threatened to do for me several times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather-dresser, at 9, King's-place, Bermondsey—on Saturday night, 11th October, about 11 o'clock, I was speaking to Mr. Aldridge at his house, in Angel-place, Southwark; his wife was gone to bed, and I was just bidding him good night; when the prisoner came with a double knock at the door, and asked for her daughter—Mr. Aldridge said he had not seen her for eight or nine months—the prisoner said, "Tell the b——old <hi rend="italic">cow</hi> to come down; I have got something for her"—Aldridge called his wife down—she came down partly dressed, and as soon as she</p>

               <p>came down the prisoner deliberately struck her a blow in the forehead with something; what it was I could not say—as soon as she struck the blow I went to the door and saw the blood flow, and I laid hold of the prisoner by the right hand, and held her till the constable came up—there was a small bag at her feet with a broken image in it—I picked it up—she said at the station it was hers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Had I not my little child with me, two or three years old? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Mrs. Aldridge did not tear your bonnet off your head—she never struck you at all—you struck her as soon as she came downstairs; before she got off the step of the door—I never played cards with your daughter, and had not seen her for three weeks before this—I don't know anything about her, or you either.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Aldridge—I had no acquaintance with the prisoner before this, no further than her girl and mine playing together—on Saturday, 11th October, I was undressing to go to bed—I was called downstairs—I went to the door and saw the prisoner—she said she wanted her daughter—I told her I had not seen her daughter for these eight or nine months—she said she was told by a woman that her daughter was there for two or three days, and she knew that she was there—she said no more, but deliberately struck me with something across the forehead; what I do not know—the blood flowed immediately, and I became insensible—I remember no more till I was attended by the doctor—I am not under the doctor's care now; I am getting better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you tear my bonnet to pieces? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor pull your hair off your head; you were too sudden upon me to put up my hand to save my head—I never struck you—I have not encouraged your daughter at my house—your children are never out of one trouble before they are in another; they are always in prison—my husband did not offer to fight your husband—your husband never was at my place except on the Tuesday after you were committed for trial, and then he said he would give me a sovereign if I did not come against you.</p>

I am a surgeon, in Trinity-square, Borough—on 11th October, I was called to see the prosecutrix at the Southwark police-station—she was in a fainting state from loss of blood—she had an incised wound on the left side of the forehead two inches in length, and cut to the bone—it must have been done with an edged instrument—it could not have been done by this key, or the things in this bag.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on the Saturday night—I told her she was charged with stabbing Mrs. Aldridge—she said she never did it, she never struck her at all—she was very much excited, as if under the influence of liquor—I took this key from her apron string at the station—she said that was what she struck her with—this bag was given me by Yates—I made a very minute search for a knife three or four times that night, but found none—there were a great many persons about, and it is a very narrow court; it might have been taken up—there was no blood on the key, but the prisoner's right hand was covered with blood right up her arm, just as if from a pepper-box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an egg merchant, and live in Ebury-place, Pimlico. Walker was in my service for four or five months—it was his duty to go round with the cart to sell eggs—he took out so many every morning—they were counted out to him—I counted them to him on the morning of Tuesday, the 24th of Jan.—I sent out 2900 eggs, and he returned in the evening with 1900—he gave an account of where he had sold 700, which we do not dispute—I asked where the other 300 were—he could not account for them that day, but at the latter end of the week he wanted his wages, and I said I could not pay him till he accounted for these 300 eggs—he then said, did I not see them in the book?—I said, "No"—he said a person of the name of Grayson bad come and taken them out of the cart—I had a customer named Grayson—the pri<lb></lb>soner had a book which he carried with him, and he has booked the 300 eggs to Grayson on the Friday following—here is the entry, "300 eggs, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—in con<lb></lb>sequence</p>

               <p>of information from the police I went to a house in Windmill-street, New-cut, in company with the policeman—I found the prisoner Gilbert there, and 2411 eggs in baskets—the baskets belonged to me, and I believe the eggs to be mine—there was one basket of mine there which contained 300 eggs, all but three.</p>

On the 1st of Feb. I noticed a cart there, and the two prisoners were with it—I have noticed articles taken out of that cart in White Horse-street, where the cart stood, and they were carried by Gilbert to No. 11, Windmill-street—Walker gave her the articles out of the cart—on Saturday, the 4th of Feb., I went with the prosecutor to No. 18, Windmill-street—there was a hamper found there containing 300 eggs, all but three.</p>

I have seen Walker draw up with a cart in White Horse-street, and have seen Gilbert there at the time—this was done frequently during different weeks in the month of Jan.—I have seen Gilbert talking with Walker at the cart, and I have seen parcels taken out of the cart by Gilbert—the cart was then twenty or thirty yards from No. 18, Windmill-street—it is a mile and a half from the prosecutor's—I afterwards received Gilbert in charge—she was told by another officer what it was for—she said she certainly had fetched things from Walker's cart, and was very sorry for it.</p>

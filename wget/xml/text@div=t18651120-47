                  </hi>. I am a grocer, at 254, High-street, Poplar—on the even<lb></lb>ing of 25th October, about half-past ten o'clock, was in Cheapside—I saw the prisoner and another female—they asked me to stand something to drink—I said, "No"—I was not talking to them two minutes—they then left me in haste and went away down Gutter-lane—I then missed my watch, I was wearing it in my waistcoat pocket with a guard—I had my coat but-<lb></lb>toned—I followed the prisoner and a policeman followed me—I missed my watch the moment they left me—I followed them down Gutter lane, along Carey-lane, to the corner, and when I came up to the prisoner I saw her throw the watch down—I picked it up and gave it to the officer—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, I was not to give her in charge, she never took the watch—I gave her into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were you talking to the two women alto<lb></lb>gether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not two minutes, or about two minutes; there was no other conversation than their asking me to stand something, and I refused—I was sober—I had had something to drink during the day; some beer—I can't say how much—four glasses, perhaps, no spirits or wine—I was perfectly sensible of what I was doing—I was sober; I was not in an unconscious state—I should say I went near upon 200 yards after the women before my watch was thrown down—I did not pick it up and put it in my pocket—I picked it up and said, "That is what I want"—the constable said, "Is that yours?" and I said, "Yes"—I don't remember his asking me what was the matter—he was, perhaps, a yard from the woman when the watch was thrown down—the women walked up to me and stopped me at the corner of the street, and I stood still—my coat was buttoned as it is now.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they go away quickly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not cry, "Stop thief" or anything, because I thought they would pitch the watch away and I should lose it—I ran after them, and when they saw me pursuing them they both ran—the officer joined me at the bottom of Gutter-lane—only one of the women shook me by the shoulders—the other was standing on the right of me—I have my ideas how the watch got out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>, 430). At half-past ten o'clock, on the night of the 25th of October, I was standing at the corner of Huggin-lane, and saw the prisoner and another female running down Gutter-lane, and the prosecutor running behind them—he did not call out, "stop thief, "so I did not know he required them to be stopped—they turned into Carey-lane, the prosecutor followed them, and I followed him—he overtook the prisoner, and said, "You have got my watch,"—she said, "No, I have not"—at that time I got close to them, and as soon as she saw me she threw the watch down on the pavement—the prosecutor picked it up, and said, "This is what I want," and he handed it to me—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the bow is broken—the prosecutor's guard was hanging down—I then took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was the other woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She went off up Foster-lane—I did not see the prosecutor stop her and speak to her—he had had a glass to drink, but he was sufficiently sober to know what he was about—I can't say whether he saw me when the women ran past me—I was a dozen or fifteen yards off—I was in uniform.</p>

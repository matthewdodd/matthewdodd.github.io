                  </hi>. I am in service at Brockley Hall, Lewisham, as head gardener to Mr. Nokes—the prisoner was under gardener—I had known him some two years previous to going there—we were on good terms, and had no quarrel—on 4th September I was in the gardener's house, asleep, on the bed up stairs—I had a straw hat over my face—I heard a report between 2.0 and 2.20, that awoke me, frightened—I thought I felt it over my head that something had struck me—I jumped off the bed to go down stairs, and a second shot was discharged over my shoulders—I was struck in the shoulder—I went down stair into the kitchen—on my return, up stairs, I saw the prisoner in the little room, with the door shut, adjoining the room in which I had been asleep—I pushed the door, and he seemed to hold it slightly—I asked him what he had shot me for—he followed me down stairs into the kitchen—I said "I never have done you any harm"—he said he did not mean to shoot me—he went down on his knees, with his hands together, and begged to be forgiven—he said he had a feeling come over him that he must shoot the gardener, and that he got the gun, and did not remember any more—he was sober—there was only one barrel loaded when I last used the gun, on the Sunday morning—the other had been loaded—he seemed a little sleepy and confused—I have never noticed anything peculiar about him since I have known him—I worked with the prisoner at Sir Joseph Hawley's, and had him under me there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw a letter that he had been writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was lying on the kitchen table—he had commenced that before I went up stairs—we parted quite good friends, and I wished him to call me in half an hour—I knew him to be a quiet, well-conducted young fellow—we always dined together—I made the remark to the coachman what a happy Sunday we had spent together—he wanted to wash my wounds—he worked for a Mr. Williams before I engaged him—(<hi rend="italic">The letter written by prisoner was read; it was a sensible letter, addressed in very affectionate terms, to his grandmother and grandfather</hi>)—I do not know that he was employed in hot houses at Mr. Williams'—the gun was not usually kept loaded.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 26). On Sunday, the 4th, I was fetched by the coachman, to Brockley Hall—I saw the prosecutor and prisoner sitting down together in the house—I told prisoner I should take him to the station for shooting the prosecutor—he said "Really, I don't know any<lb></lb>thing about it"—I cautioned him that anything he said would be used against him—he said he was sitting down, writing a letter, when he felt faint and queer, and at once something told him he must shoot George;</p>

               <p>be got up from the table, took the gun that was standing in the cupboard and went up stairs, and he did not remember anything more until he saw George's head bleeding, and he found he had shot him—he was perfectly sober and rational—he conversed with me to the station as reasonably as I am doing now—this is the gun, and this is the prosecutor's hat that he was wearing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the hat is shattered, and blown right out of the side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons—I live at 11, Park Road, Forest Hill—I was sent for to Brockley Hall on 4th September—I found a gun-shot wound in the right side of the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's head, and also one in the left shoulder; but the wounds were such that it could not have been caused by the full charge—the full charge, I saw in the room, had gone over his head about half an inch—when prosecutor was standing up, the other gun must have been fired from his head about 3 yds.—there were fifteen or twenty shots in his shoulder, altogether—I saw the hat—a very slight alteration in the direction would have been his death, especially the first shot—I dressed his wounds, and have attended to him since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Brecknock Arms public-house, Camdentown; the prisoner was my pot-man. On Saturday, the 11th of December, I was returning home, and met him—I said, "Where are you going?"—he said, "To the Eagle"—I asked what he had got under his arm—he said his things—I said, "Does your mistress know you have taken your things away?"—he said "No"—I said, "I should like to see"—he said, "I have nothing of yours"—I said, "We had better see"—We turned back, met the policeman, and went into the bar-parlour—I asked him to open the—while he did so, in turning over the things, I saw a coat which I knew to be mine—I asked whose it was—he said it was his own—I put it on and said, "Now, so you persist in saying it is your?:—he said, "Yes, I will take my oath of it"—I gave him in charge.</p>

The prisoner was given into my charge—I accompanied him back to Mr. Stone's house—he opened the bundle—Mr. Stone identified this coat—the prisoner said it was his own—Mr. Stone then gave him in charge—he then said there was nothing else belonging to Mr. Stone in the bundle.</p>

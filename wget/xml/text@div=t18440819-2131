                  </hi>. I am the toll-collector of Hammersmith-bridge. I know the prosecutrix. On the evening of the 5th of Aug. she came to the bridge, put her right hand in her bosom, pulled out a purse, or a bag, and paid me with a halfpenny—she was drunk—she did not speak to me—Mrs. Knight came running after her, and asked if there was a young person gone on the bridge—I said yes, and allowed her to go after her—the policeman came, and Knight, and Cook—when they went off the bridge they did not pay any toll, as I thought the policeman had got the prosecutrix in charge—she was in front of him—I saw her go on to the Broadway, which may be about 200 yards from the toll-gate—the Ship may be about 40 yards from the Broad<lb></lb>way—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards, Mrs. Knight came and told me Newman was taken for robbing the prosecutrix, who went on the bridge—I knew Newman, and always knew him to be an honest per<lb></lb>son—he belonged to the Ship formerly—I cannot say how long he has left—he lived at Mr. Chapman's before he went to the Ship.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived as waiter at the Ship at this time—I had been there about seven weeks—I saw Mrs. Hawkins come into the house that night—(I never knew her as Mrs. Lancaster)—she came in between five and six o'clock, and was very drunk—the prisoner came in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and he asked Knight for a bit of tobacco—the prosecutrix said, "Don't have tobacco, have a cigar"—she paid me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one, and I fetched it for him—the prosecutrix was dancing about—she went on her knees, and then danced about again—she went out about half-past eight, and came in again about a quarter to nine—I did not know any of these parties before I went to live at the Ship—I remember some man came in and said, "There is a woman going to drown herself"—the prisoner had not gone out of the house from that time till he was taken, to my knowledge—he was</p>

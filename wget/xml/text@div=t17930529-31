             my niece brought them in; I have had the care of them since; I have brought them now. (Produces the coat waistcoat and the woollen cloth.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You live in Red Lyon-passage; it is a narrow passage? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. The houses are very close to each other, and an alarm very easily communicates of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you heard no alarm till after the thief had got out of the way, clearly from Miss Price? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was at work in the story immediately over that room from whence the robbery was committed? - No, I was at work in the garret, and this was in the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how was the alarm communicated to you at first? - My niece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290057"></xptr>hallooed on the stairs, or at the room door, and called up to me, and said I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she call you by name first, and then tell you, you was robbed? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you you was robbed before you came down stairs to her? - Yes, she called me and told me I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. She called, you came down, and then she informed you, you was robbed? - She said, come down, you are robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not call to the neighbours at all, nor threw up the window at all? - I believe she ran down after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether your niece did not describe to you, that the person who had robbed you had thrown her down in the room, and held a knife over her, and threatened her if she made any alarm? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. You called Mr. Macphaile over, and he came over? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether when you saw that bed, it had any signs of any person being thrown down on it, and whether Mr. Macphaile did not say so in the face of your niece who told this story? - He has represented it so, he has hinted something of that kind.</p>

               <p>Q. Now we come about hints. Has not he said so to you? - He said he should wish to speak what he knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that, that was part of what he knew, that your niece had told a story, because there was no marks of violence on the bed? - He said he should wish to be on the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. For what reason? - He is to give his reasons I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he so hint to you? - Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not he so express to you in the room, in the presence of your niece; you must not shelter your niece, though, she is your niece? - He did not say so at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time? did not you hear him say so? - After that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - He said he should wish to come on the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. That is very different. When was it he told you that he observed there were no marks of violence on the bed, that your niece said she had been thrown down upon? - I cannot exactly recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after your niece's story was it? - It was not long.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we talk about hinting, I believe it is not the first time your niece has hinted that you was robbed? - I never was robbed before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no house in which you have lived in robbed before? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your mother been robbed? - It was not my mother, it was a cousin of mine, who lives in the same house of Mr. Macphaile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she accuse your cousin who was proved before all the world to be innocent? How many times has your niece made accusations of robbery against other persons, which have proved to be unfounded? - I never heard of any but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Never heard of any but that, and there every body was convinced that your niece told a story on the business? - That does not concern me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this man very well known in that neighbourhood? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not he bear a very excellent character in that neighbourhood? - I don't know nothing to his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know he was extremely respected and bears a good character? - He was no acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you not heard a very good character given of him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290058"></xptr>in that neighbourhood? though the answer comes with difficulty I will have it? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that it is matter of recollection? have not you been told by all the neighbours that he bears a good character? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear they did not tell you? why that man that you accuse is as honest a man as any in the neighbourhood? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know one way or the other. You heard no alarm of this till this matter was over? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was about six o'clock in broad day light, in a place where the man was well known.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the niece of Mr. Hatch; I live with him; he was robbed on Tuesday the 7th of May; the prisoner at the bar came and rang the bell at the door below, about six o'clock, and I went down to him, and he asked me if Mrs. Hatch was at home? I told him, no; and then he asked me if Mr. Hatch was within? and I told him yes; and then he went away, and I shut the street door after him and came up stairs, and I was at the fire place when he came in to Mr. Hatch's room, up one pair of stairs; the street door stands on a latch, and then he shut the middle door that goes into the front room, there is a back room and a front room, and the middle door is between the two rooms, and he left the back room wide open, and then I got away from the fire place and got to the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the foot of the bed? - I knew it was the man that had been talking with me at the street door. Then he tosses me on the bed; then I thought to have hallooed when he pushed me down on the bed; but he produced his knife, the knife had two blades, he opened it and he called me an impudent hussey, and said if I dare to halloo he would cut my throat from ear to ear; then I laid still, and heard him go to the drawer, it was the second drawer, he took out a red waistcoat, and piece of cloth, and a green coat, and as for the third drawer I cannot say, because I cannot say I was quite sensible when he went to it; then he went about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with these things? - He took them with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of any table cloth? - Yes, there were three table cloths missing; I did not see him take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a callico gown? - I do; that was mine I did not see him take it.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a wooden box, a check apron and five shillings in money? - I don't know any thing of them; they were missing; they were all in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they missing from the drawers? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about this at the time - I made the alarm when he was gone as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see on that alarm? - I saw a good many people; I saw my uncle, he came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man pursued at all at the time? - No, not then, nobody went after him then; my uncle was undressed, not fit to go after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the other people undressed? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it nobody went after him? - Upon my word I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of these things again? - Yes. On the 10th of May, I let my brother in at the street door at twelve o'clock from school, there came a man by and asked me if I was the person that had swore that innocent young man's life away? I told him I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290059"></xptr>know what he meant; then he said if I would go along with him he would give me some of the property back again; and another man came up, a bricklayer's labourer, and he said that I had no need to be frightened, I will see you safe there and back again; then I went with the man to fetch the clothes, when this bricklayer's labourer came up, I went along with him, and I went to a house in Eagle-street, across Red Lyon-square, and when I went in, this bricklayer's labourer left me to this other man, and the man gave me the green coat, a piece of cloth and a red waistcoat, and there came some bad women up in the room, and they bid him to let me go about my business; then I came home with the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - Fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do you follow? - My uncle keeps me.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the other articles have ever been found, have they? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have told this story several times have you not? So this was about six o'clock? - It was near there.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Macphaile lives very near opposite to you? - He does.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner rang the bell and you went down; how was he dressed? - He was dressed in a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a light coloured coat? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he go when you told him your aunt was not at home? - I cannot say; I shut the door immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What lock has it? - A latch only.</p>
               <p>Q. It was but a very few minutes when you saw him again? - I had but just got up stairs to the fire place, and then I saw him again.</p>
               <p>Q. The door of this back room communicates with the stair case? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the door of this back room would enable you to have gone up to your uncle's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came in, was not you a good deal surprised that he should come in? - Yes, I was, I knew it was him that I had left at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him what he came for? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that happen? - It surprised me to I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You was a good deal alarmed? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray as you was alarmed, why did did not you call out for your uncle? - Why when he shut the middle door I thought I could get out of the middle door.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first came in he shut the middle door; you was by the fire place at this time, the back door was open, but instead of moving to the door you moved to the bed? - The bed faces the stair case.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of going up stairs to your uncle you went to the bed? - I got to the bed post; he would not give me time to get out; when he saw me going out, by that he pushed me on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was going out at the back door; how came it you did not tell us this before? - I was going strait to get out, and he pushed me strait on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say that you went and laid hold of the bed post? - I said I got to the bed post.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have got to the back room door? - Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as you was alarmed and could have got to the back room door, why did not you? why should you stop at the bed? - I made an attempt to go to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not the direct way from the fire place to the back room? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290060"></xptr>Q. There you stopped? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By this attempting to push you you stopped? - I cannot say, I might stop at the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not stop at the bed before he attempted to push you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you? - I don't know upon my word.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sure I cannot guess the reason; this frightened you of course. Did not you scream out as every girl does who is frightened? - No, he said if I dare to halloo out he would cut my throat from ear to ear.</p>
               <p>Q. But before this it takes some time before he can say all these words and produce his knife, you never saw any thing of the knife then? - When he pushed me on the bed, he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out his knife, and opened both blades.</p>
               <p>Q. So here he stood, first of all, having made the threat, he opens both the blades, and there you see him in the operation, opening both the blades, one would not do for the purpose? - I see him open both.</p>
               <p>Q. You was very much alarmed, after this you had hardly your senses about you? - I cannot say I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you say you particularly noticed him taking out a great coat a waistcoat, and the piece of cloth; you particularly observed from what drawer he took it, this coat, waistcoat and piece of cloth from, that it was the second drawer, though you was in this alarm, losing your senses by the fright of two blades he had produced, yet you saw him take those things, particularly as you was laying flat on the bed at this time? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your face thrown on the bed? - I laid flat on my back.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not dare to rise yourself for fear he should cut your throat. Now I ask you by what possible direction your eyes could see that second drawer from the bottom? - But I did see the second drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. I know you did; but we must know how you could do it; the bed was higher than the second drawer at the bottom? - Our bed is very low.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps your bed is not so high from the ground as the first drawer of that pair of drawers? - I don't know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the bed is not higher from the ground than the first drawer of that pair of drawers; is it not higher than the second drawer? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you in what possible manner you could see any thing, laying flat on your back on this bed? - Ours is a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. In what possible direction could your eyes see the second drawer of that chest of drawers. Leaving that to be reconciled in the minds of the jury; where were the rest of the things taken from? - From the third drawer from the top.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that? - I did not, I was down in a sit.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I assure you in your examination at Bow-street you made no more scruple in swearing to what he took from the third drawer than from the second? - (the information read) They did not ask whether I was sensible or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Now my girl he ran down stairs with these things; was the back room door which communicates with the stair case, open all the time this was going on? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So this man had the precaution to shut the middle door, but not the door by which every one must see what was going on who went up stairs? - We have no lodgers except up in the garret. He shut the middle door because he knew the neighbours could see.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290061"></xptr>Q. How long was he gone before you communicated any alarm? - He was not gone long, about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps ten? - I don't think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing you did when you got up? - I hallooed to my uncle.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not run and throw up the window, and call out stop thief in the court? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you stayed somewhere between five and ten minutes, and then went to the back room door and called to your uncle; did he come directly? - He did not come down till the second call; and I was at the street door when he came down; I first of all called uncle, and then ran down and called again uncle; I called out, uncle you are robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your brother all this time? - My brother had that minute gone up with the iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you call to your brother? - I did not; he was not so big as me; he had just gone up before the man had rang at the bell, and my brother was coming down to the bell when I got up stairs, he came out of the garret when the man rung the bell; he had left the iron up in the garret, for I had gone up stairs, and the man was gone, and I sent word up to my uncle, by my brother, that it was somebody wanted my aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any alarm to the people in the street, at this second time, before your uncle came down? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Before your uncle came down you had given an alarm in the street, and there was a great mob came, that you are sure of; I thought you had called out uncle after the mob had come round? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think it was between your calling uncle the first time and the second? - The instant I got off the bed, I called uncle then, then uncle did not hear what I said, then I went straight to the door hallooing out, uncle, thieves! I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came up on this? - There was nobody else to come but those below stairs, Mr. and Mrs. Walden, and they came out at the time my uncle came down, and then the mob came about.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the mob Mr. Macphaile came over? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Macphaile came up in the room, where the robbery had been committed, what did he see? - He see what had been done without my telling of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him that he had thrown you on the bed? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon your oath did not Mr. Macphaile say, there is no mark of any person being on that bed? - This was the remark he made to me at the time, he lifted his hands and said that he never saw such a cruel thing in his life; he did not say till two days afterwards that there was no mark on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nobody else remarked it at all? - No soul.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he say and where, that there was no mark of violence on the bed? - It was below where he lives, at Mr. Johnson's, he is Mr. Johnson's lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that he said so; did you hear him? - I did not. What I heard was that he told his landlord so below.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the neighbours have been cruel enough to intimate some suspicions that the robbery was done by a relation of Mr. Hatch's? - Yes, so they have.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Mr. Macphaile got into a sad scrape for making this expression? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that he has been ill treated, and ill used in consequence of having made use of that expression? - I know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. I am very glad of it. Don't you know he was extremely ill used? - I never knew he was ill used. Mr. Gammon's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290062"></xptr>niece has lost a gown at Mr. Johnson's, and the next morning I see Mr. Macphaile's sister-in-law come out with a bundle in her lap.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not using Mr. Macphaile ill. Don't you know that your uncle has told you that Mr. Macphaile has been ill used because he has thrown out that hint? - I never heard any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard it from your uncle, or from some of your relations that they have treated Macphaile ill for what he said? - I have not heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Now my girl at the time you gave this alarm to the neighbours, was there any pursuit made after the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you seen him out about that neighbourhood before? - No, I had not, only his being such a remarkable man that made me look so much at him; he was in a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Certainly not a blue coat then? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken up when? - Two days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q It was after that, that these things were brought back to you? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Your uncle did not pursue after the man at all at the time the robbery was committed, and the reason was he was undressed and not fit to go after him, that was the only reason? - It was; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. The mob about the place were not undressed? - But they did not attempt to pursue.</p>
               <p>Q. You was very much surprised certainly at these barbarous neighbours, Your uncle, you mean, to say had the knees of his breeches unbuttoned, and his coat and shoes off, but your neighbours were dressed. Did not you think it was cruel, it was a great pity; advise your uncle the next time to have his shoes on. The neighbours have been so unkind as to impute it to some part of your own family? - They have.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had just let your brother in, and a man came up and asked you if you was the girl that had swore that innocent young man's life away? Did you call your brother to hear what the man said? - I told him I did not know what he meant; he said if I would go along with him he would shew me the things; he came alone, he was not in company with any body, there came up a bricklayer's labourer, at the same time, as I took him to be.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - About twelve o'clock at noon.</p>
               <p>Q. He came alone, you wanted somebody to protect you. Did you desire your brother to step up stairs to your uncle? - My brother had gone up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as you did not like to trust yourself alone, did not you call out to your uncle? - This bricklayer's labourer came up and he offered to see me safe.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not come up till the man had done talking and you was afraid to trust yourself along with him. Pray how came the bricklayer's labourer, as the man had done talking to you, to come up and offer to protect you? - He might be a friend of the man's who had been talking to me; I was crying, because I thought it was too much to go by myself, I thought it was something so flattering.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why not call Mr. Walden to go with you? - I did not think any thing about Mr. Walden.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Walden you know could have protected you? - He told me I must go alone with him; he said if I would go along with him alone he would help me to my property.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this bricklayer's labourer to be suffered to go along with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290063"></xptr>you? Have you ever seen that bricklayer's labourer again? - Never have.</p>
               <p>Q. Eagle-street runs at the back of Red Lion-passage? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Eagle-street runs from Red Lion-street to Gate-street? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you are at twelve o'clock at noon. At what house in Eagle-street did you go? Have you ever fixed on that house, or have you ever been able to tell what house that was? - No, I cannot tell what house it was, because when I came out I was so frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not at all frightened going there? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You told your uncle you was there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your uncle then say, shew me the house that we may get the rest of the property? Pray does not your uncle's brother and sister live in Eagle-street? - I have heard a young man say so; my uncle's sister does not speak to me, because she owes me a great spite.</p>
               <p>Q. However this house is in Eagle-street, and you have heard a young man say that your uncle's sister lived in Eagle-street, and at that time. Now your uncle is out, pray tell us where this sister of his lives. Who told you that she lived there? - One Mr. Baker said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your uncle's brother live? - He has no brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he a brother-in-law? - He knows nothing at all of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not he live in Eagle-street? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. He knows where to find your uncle and your uncle's premises? - I do not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that Wood's wife was at your uncle's the other day? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if Mr. Wood's wife knows where your uncle lives, how came you to tell us that Mr. Wood did not know? - They do not live together; my uncle's sister is a very bad girl, and they have not lived together a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you got to the house there were a number of bad women there, perhaps you was so much frightened if she had been there you would not have known her? - I don't know whether I should have known her or no; but I think I had my senses about me just enough to know her and no more.</p>
               <p>Q. So then they gave you these things and you came back. Did you tell any part of this story at Bow-street? - My uncle went back to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you give account of this at Bow-street? - I have not been there since the things were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things brought back before he was taken up or after? - After he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now my girl this is not the first you have accused of a robbery? - I did say that I saw the woman come out with a bundle, and the people said she had not been out all the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You never accused any body else with a robbery? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it that this man was taken up? - I believe the second day after the robbery; the man was in prison when the things were found; I recovered the things on Friday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to insist on it that you never charged any other person with a robbery, except that person that you now mention; remember Mr. Macphaile is here? - I have not.</p>

             standing in the room with her uncle Hatch, and another man; she said that a man came and knocked at the door and asked for her grandmother, he said that he had a message from a gentleman's house-keeper in Lincoln's Inn-fields; she replied that her grandmother was not at home; he enquired if her uncle was; she informed him that he was; that then he went away and she shut the door, and she was surprised to find him follow her up stairs; that he took her immediately and threw her on a bed, a little bed that stood by, and I took particular notice of the bed, the bed was perfectly well made, there was no mark on it; I come here to speak independent; I know nothing of the prisoner not them, before that day; I know nothing of any of them; a drawer was half open; she said the man pulled the drawer open, and she said that was the only drawer that ought to have been locked, and he whipped up the things, wraps them in a check apron and was off in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the magistrate? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the grand jury? - I was not. Mr. Hatch told me that he would be very glad if the prosecution was squashed, for he was urged to it by people that persuaded him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you hear the girl relate that the robbery was done while she was on the bed? - I did; but the bed was perfectly smooth.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you, with your own eyes, observe it, that it was perfectly smooth? - I communicated it to them all, and had an argument with them on the impossibility of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had an argument with them? - I am; and they wished to evade it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you had the argument with them? - The day after.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Then they cannot possibly be ignorant that they had that argument with you? - I communicated every thing to them as I have to the court, on my oath,</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in this neighbourhood? - Since Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least interest in this business, or are you at all related, connected, or any way known to the prisoner? - I am not. About a month prior to this, I heard a person at the door where Mr. Hatch lives, I looked out of window, and a cart was there; after some time a person got up and began to speak, and said they had been tumbled down stairs neck and heels, and she said she was the daughter of Mr. Hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you communicated to them your intention of coming here, to declare the whole truth? - I have; I have been threatened for it by Mr. Johnson; I have been threatened even at this door.</p>
               <p>- CROCKER sworn.</p>
               <p>In consequence of information I apprehended this prisoner; I only produce the knife which the girl swore to at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner? - In Eagle-street near Red Lyon-square.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you apprehend him? - The 9th of May; I believe this day three weeks; I received the information on the 8th; I apprehended him the next day, by the girl's shewing him me in the street, in Eagle-street, at a door; the information I received from Hatch was, that they had been robbed; I was informed that he was at a club at a house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290067"></xptr>in Dean-street near Holborn; I thought it was not prudent to go there that evening, I would not take him without the girl was positive for I had no warrant; therefore the girl and I went and waited for him, the girl was on one side of the way and I was on the other; I took him into a public house and searched him, and I took out of his pocket a pocket book, and this knife, and a mask, and then I took him to Bow-street, before the sitting magistrate there, the magistrate shewed the knife to the girl and she said it was the knife he held in his hand while she was on the bed; she then said that the prisoner had not on the clothes that he had then, he had a light coat; I went back to his lodgings, and I found that light coloured coat, here are some things I found in the lodgings, a ladle, a crucible, and a dark lanthorn, that I thought proper to bring them away; I took the key out of the pocket of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have been an officer a long time at Bow-street? - Near nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you know that you must be consistent in your story, it is your duty certainly; you was examined before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to put the mask in your examination? - I shewed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You swore to your examination? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was read over to you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. But there is not a word in it about the mask? - When the clerk is writing he may omit something.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not your duty to attend to your examination that you are to swear to? why did not you tell the clerk you have forgot to put down the mask? Did you swear to finding that mask before the magistrate? - I did at the examination; when I was before the magistrate I produced every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. So you say, but here is a note in which nothing of that kind is mentioned, and you, of all others, are most bound to attend to your oath; it is not a new thing for you to take an oath or sign an examination? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q Now it does not appear in the examination? - I produced it before the magistrate, and swore to it.</p>
               <p>Court to Hatch. Look at the coat, waistcoat, and piece of woollen cloth and check apron. - The coat I valued at ten shillings, the waistcoat at six shillings, and the piece of woollen cloth at eighteen shillings, the check apron sixpence; the coat waistcoat and cloth is mine; the coat I can swear to, and I believe the other things,</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Crocker. You found nothing else relating to this robbery, nor any property of Mr. Hatch's in this room? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Price. Look at the knife? - It was such a kind of knife as this; the knife had two blades.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean such a kind of knife? - I know it by the blades and handle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You remarked it particularly that you might know it again? - Indeed I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What remark did you make on it? - It looked very bad, having both the blades open.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore because it looked very bad it must be the same knife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at it particularly that you might know it again? - I did look at it particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was so much alarmed, you really had your senses about you to take notice of these blades? - It looked so terribly to have both the blades open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am entirely innocent of the charge laid to me; does it stand to reason, that I should go to commit an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290068"></xptr>outrage on a person I knew very well? Mr. Hatch and I were children together; I was known to the people of the house; I was born in the neighbourhood, and have lived in it twenty eight years; I hope my lord and gentlemen will take my case into consideration, and pronounce me innocent; I have several respectable people who will give me a good character.</p>

Now I ask you were they there before the prisoner took the lodgings or were they not? - Upon the word of a woman, and upon my oath likewise, they were there three years and a half before the prisoner came to lodge there, the prisoner lodged there about six weeks or two months, or thereabouts; as to that mask which Mr. Crocker has produced we have had it up and down the house joking with it about three weeks or thereaway, it commonly lay about the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was your son at that time? - He was not at home; he was out at service; they went out between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, it was about three when he came, and they returned near eight o'clock or half past seven, it was rather dark, he came home with my daughter and stopped in my place some short time, and it was dusk when he went away,</p>

               <p>Q. What was it for? - For abuse and scandal to my daughter.</p>

               <p>Q. You must know? - To be sure it was very scandalous, he said that she had a child by him; and went and exposed her at the public house; it was on that occasion they went for the warrant.</p>

               <p>I am the daughter to the last witness; I know the prisoner at the bar, he went out with me to Guildhall, on Tuesday, the 7th of May; I go to service, but I am at present at home with my mother; he called on me, as near I can guess, between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q How long did he stay at your house before he went out? - Nearly an hour I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go away from your house alone, or did any body go with him? - I went with him,</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go with him? - To Guildhall, to get a warrant for a person that assaulted me,

            .</p>
               <p>Q. What was the nature of your complaint against him? - Nothing particular, he grossly offended me while I was in my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by assault, striking you? - No, it was insulting me in scandalous expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us whether you went to Guildhall together or not, tell the whole story, how far you went together, and the whole of it? - Me and the prisoner, we went straight to Guildhall from my mother's, we went to get a warrant; we then returned home, and in Charter-house-square, on his return, the prisoner met a person whom he knew, he is not here, he was a person I did not know, this was I suppose between five and six o'clock, I suppose so from the length of time and the length of way; from Charter-house-square, we went straight on towards Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other man join you? - No, he only spoke, and after he spoke we parted. At a house near Clerkenwell-green we stopped, at a public house, the prisoner and I we had a pint of ale, he left me and went out to get some ham and bread, I suppose he was gone about a quarter of an hour; I should suppose this was about six o'clock; he returned back with the ham and bread; we set there and eat it, and drank and had another pint of ale to it; from there we went straight across Clerkenwell-green,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290070"></xptr>and in some shop, I believe it is called Mutton-lane, a chandler's shop there he called, and I stopped at the door, he stayed there a few minutes and came out to me, and from there we went straight home to my mother's; at the time I got to my mother's I believe it was between seven and eight o'clock, it began to be dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say what coloured coat the prisoner had on at the time he went with you? - It was a blue coat I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the coat, (which Crocker produces) is it at all like the coat he had on? - Not at all; he had on the coat he has on now, all the time he was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time you was with him, did you see a clock? - At the time we went through Clement's-inn, as we were going to Guildhall there was a clock, and I said it is half past four o'clock; he said, I am afraid we shall be too late; but we proceeded.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to go so round about a way home? - We were not in an immediate hurry to go home, so we took our time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at your desire or his, that you went to these particular places? - It was his desire, not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - I have known him five or six or seven years; he is a shoe maker.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the man's name that scandalized you? -

               <p>Q. What was the scandal? - I cannot say the particulars of it, but I have people that can prove it; he said that I had a child by him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to fix on the prisoner as the man to accompany you on this occasion? - I never went about a warrant before, and I asked him to accompany me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink tea before you went out, or after you came home? - We had no tea at all; we did not stop for it before we went out, and when we came back it was too late.</p>

               <p>Q. How came she to send for you about the prisoner's business? - I had told her before that I was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you tell? - I don't know any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell the sister of it? - Some days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned to her, I suppose, this business of Martin's, and that Martin had scandalized you? - That was all I told her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to desire you to come here? - I did not come on that account of Martin's, I came here on the prisoner's account, he was with me the same day as the robbery was committed.</p>

               <p>Q. Now you failed of you warrant that day, did you take the warrant out the next day? - No, I never have; I never went before nor since about a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. On your return, how long did he stay in the house? - He did not stay long.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he sup with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he eat and drink in the house? - No, not after we came back.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live the corner of Mutton-lane, Clerkenwell; I keep a chandler's shop; I remember the prisoner's calling at my shop the 7th of May between six and seven in the evening, nearer seven than six; he called for to see me and how I did, and how my children did; he is a shoe maker; I asked him in, and he was in the shop, but he said he had a young woman waiting for him, and he could not conveniently stay.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this was on the 7th of May? - I am very sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the young woman? - I did. Says I, my dear Tommy, why did not you bring her in? I knew his mother; no, madam, says he, I cannot, because I cannot stop indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in point of fact, see that he had a young woman with him? - I did; I cannot recollect whether that is the young woman or no, that he had with him.</p>
               <p>Q. This was near seven o'clock? - Nearer seven than six; he always bore the character of an honest, industrious young fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection what coloured coat he had on? - I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. What day of the week was this? - Tuesday; the reason of my being so very particular, I am very correct in my tea book.</p>

               <p>Q. How came this business to get into your tea book? - That made me know the day; I was settling the book when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. When do you settle it? - Sometimes once a week, sometimes every other day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it may be some other day; you don't always do that of a Tuesday? - But that made me particular then as to the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know this man's mother? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give them on this occasion; tea or coffee? - He stopped but a few minutes with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not let them go away dry handed; did you give them any thing to eat or to drink? - I did not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290072"></xptr>Q. Did the young woman come in? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not ask her to tea? - Ask her to tea! I had my tea; she did not come in at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What brought you here to day? - To speak the truth of this young fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Came you here by a subpoena? - Which I was surprised at.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you subpoenaed? - The night before last, I think to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got it with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave it behind you? - I put it on the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. Who served the subpoena on you? - I was not at home; my maid came for me, and I went home and I saw a young man, and he asked me if I recollected seeing one

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 358.) About twenty minutes after eight o'clock on Sunday evening, the 14th Jan., I was at Puddle-dock—I went to Mr. Muggeridge's wharf, and found the prisoner in a place they call the laystall, in the act of putting a full sack on his back—I asked if he was employed by Mr. Gore—he said, "No, I am not employed by any one"—I then asked what he was going to do with the sack—he said he did not know—there was an empty barge close alongside the"wharf, and next to that outside, was the full one—he afterwards said he was going to shoot it into the empty barge—it was near the shoot where they throw things down into these barges—I took him—the sack was full of oats—I left it there and sent another officer for it.</p>

               <p>afterwards saw these sacks unloaded, and I counted them on the Monday following, the 15th Jan.—I found 498 sacks of oats in the Louisa—they were my masters'—about half-past six o'clock on Monday morning I found a full sack about two yards from the shoot at Gore's wharf—it was Messrs. Mug<lb></lb>geridge's sack, and was marked H. and E. Muggeridge—it corresponded with those in the barge—I know the prisoner—he had no business on the wharf on Sunday night—I cannot say whether the wharf was closed—it is a public wharf till ten o'clock on Sunday night, and is open to accommodate the lightermen—the prisoner was not employed by Messrs. Muggeridge.</p>

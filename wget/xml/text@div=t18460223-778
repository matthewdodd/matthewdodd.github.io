                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live at No. 9, Newington-causeway—the prisoner has been in my service about three weeks—on the 13th of Feb., about twelve o'clock at noon, I had occasion to leave my house—I left my daughter in charge of the shop—I had a small bag in the till—I took some money out of the bag and left the remainder there—I saw sovereigns and half-sovereigns in it, as near as I can guess twelve sovereigns and eight half-sovereigns—the prisoner was out on business at that time—he was in the shop when I returned—I went directly into the adjoining place to dinner and my daughter was there—after dinner my wife sent the prisoner out—he came back and then went to his dinner—I went to the till a few minutes after he went to his dinner, and missed the bag—I sent for a constable and charged the prisoner when he returned with taking the bag out of the till—he said he had not got my property, and was never charged with dishonesty in his life, that I had a good character with him and he always bore one—the parlour commands a view of the shop, so that nobody can enter without being in view of the persons in the parlour—nobody came into the shop while I was in, till after the prisoner went to dinner—he went to dinner when the workmen came in, and I saw what part of the shop he went to—I went into the shop to him before he got fairly through the door—the door of the shop was in his hand—I had a looking-glass in the parlour and a glass case</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230143"></xptr>
               <p>also, and when the door opens whoever enters it reflected in both—I had given the prisoner notice to leave, and he was to leave the following day, Saturday—a person in the shop could not go to the till without being seen by two or three of us in the parlour—the till is a long one with three divisions, and the bag was in quite the back department—the prisoner might draw it out without being observed, but he could not stand there without being observed—the glass-case on the top of the counter would conceal his drawing anything out—a person behind the counter could get to that part, but anybody coming in at the door would have been in view of the persons in the parlour—it could not be done by anybody on that side of the counter.</p>

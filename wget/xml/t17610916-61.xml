On the 7th of July, the two prisoners came to my house; they wanted to know if they could have either coffee or tea to breakfast; my wife told them they might have which they pleased. My wife wanted them to go into another room, but the parlour-door standing open; they went directly in there. As soon as breakfast was over, they ordered their horses to be brought to the door; as soon as they had got on horseback, my wife went to look if her money was safe in the bureau, in the parlour where they had breakfasted; we missed two guineas and a half; I got on horse-back, and rode as far as the Gun and Bush, at North-end.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the bureau left open?</p>
               <p>Ward. It was shut, but not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know what money was there before?</p>
               <p>Ward. I had put in that money.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176109160079"></xptr>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>Ward. I had seen it there that morning. I took Conway in Bishopsgate-street, he was standing in the Dolphin-inn gateway, with his horse in his hand. I told him what I came after, he said he knew nothing of the affair; I had him searched, he had only a guinea about him, as we could find. The other was taken in Bread-street, at the Shipalehouse, he was searched, but I was not by. I was informed he had only a little silver upon him; he was brought to Conway, and they were both taken before the sitting alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say for themselves?</p>
               <p>Ward. They said, they knew nothing of the affair; but rather than be brought to shame, by being exposed to the public, they would give me my money again.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before these men came in, had you seen that money?</p>
               <p>Ward. I saw it in the bureau that morning, it may be half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been in that room from that time, to the time the prisoners were there?</p>
               <p>Ward. I cannot pretend to swear as to that, because I was up stairs a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the identity of the money?</p>
               <p>Ward. I cannot. I suspected them on their manner of going off, they rode off at a great rate, I lamed a horse in going after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pay their bill?</p>
               <p>Ward. They did, they had ordered a dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they counterorder that before they went away?</p>
               <p>Ward. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not pursued them, do you think they would have returned again?</p>
               <p>Ward. There was not much likelihood of that, they said they would have come back again.</p>

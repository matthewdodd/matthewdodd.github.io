                  </hi>. I have a partner, we live in Oxford-street, and have another house in Park-lane—the two houses join together. I have been robbed four times—the prisoner Penny had been to ask for a situation two or three times—I suspected him, and on Thursday, the 14th, hearing he was in the neighbourhood, I set a man to watch—Penny then came into the counting-house, and asked me for a situation—I told him I did not know of any thing, but if he would give me his name, and the address of his last master, I would see if I could hear of any thing—he said, William Oflick, Goswell-street, and his last master was Mr. Simmons, of Oxford street—he crossed the shop at a rapid rate—I followed him, but he Went out—when I got into the street I saw Messenter in custody—they brought him into the shop, and two sugar-basins were found on him—he begged for mercy, and said he hoped we would forgive him.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoners in company with another in Park-street, previous to Penny coming into the warehouse, and told master of it—I went down stairs, and looked through the area railing, and saw them in conversation, at the corner of Park-street, and North-row—shortly after I heard the shop bell ring, and the door open—I immediately ran up stairs, and Penny was in conversation with master at the counting-house—I said nothing to him, but went out at a door, round to Park-street, and then neither of the prisoners were to be seen, but Messenter came out of the house—I and my fellow-servant seized him—he struggled to get away, and he broke two basins in the struggle, besides those found—we took him into the hall—he begged to be let go, and said that the other parties had met him in Oxford-street, while he was inquiring of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man for a situation—while we were struggling with him, Penny came out, and made his escape—he walked off at a sharp rate to the corner, and then I lost sight of him.</p>

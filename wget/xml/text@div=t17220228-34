He answer'd, half the Money in his Pocket, and he Pluckt out; half a Guinea. Let me see, says she, 'tis not being but a Sixpence, and snatching it from him, ran down Stairs, and he after her. That he saw her no more till 4 or 5 Days after, her Husband having before arrested him an 100 l. Action. He then took out a Warrant against her. The Prisoner in her Defence said, that when they were alone, the Prosecutor offer'd her Snuff, then a Snuff Box; aftewards to present her with a pair of Damask Pockets, all which the prisoner refus'd. That he solicited her to leave her Husband, and he would give her 5l. and maintain her handsomely. That she inform'd her Husband, who arrested him in an Action of 100l. upon which the Prosecutor brought this Indictment. Mr. Lucan depos'd, that the prisoner had been his Servant 3 quarters of a Year, that hearing the Prosecutor had affronted her, he dismist him his Service, who was afterwards arrested by Breary for assaulting his Wife.

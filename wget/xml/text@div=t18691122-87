I am a butcher, carrying on business at Stookwell Green—I have taken the shop of Mr. Hilsley, and still use his name—I have known the prisoner as a carrier of calves and lambs—on the 30th September I bought a calf at the Cattle Market of Mr. Marrell, the salesman—I instructed the prisoner to bring the calf home in his van—I said, "Here, Bailey, take this money over to the bank, and bring home the calf"—I gave him five sovereigns—the things are paid for at Lacey's Bank—he brought the calf home in the evening—he has not paid for it—I received a letter from Mr. Marrell, and in consequence of that I looked after the prisoner for two or three weeks—I could not find him at the Cattle Market, or his usual haunts—I went and sent continually—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to the police, and next saw him in custody—he said "I confess I had the money, and I suppose if you have it returned that is all you require"—I said, "You are too late now; if you had come and seen me, I could have put up with any conditions rather than had any trouble"—I had to pay Mr. Marrell for the calf—I bought it in the name of Hilsley, and sent the money in that name—he told the officer he had given the money to William Tagg.</p>

I am a detective of the N division—I took the prisoner into custody, at No. 1, St. George's Market, London Road, South wark, where he lives, the 30th October—I had been watching his house for three or four days—I saw him go into his house about 11.20—I told him he was charged with stealing 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the property of Mr. Hilsley, butcher, of Stockwell Green—he said, "Oh, it is right enough, I had the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and instead of paying it into the bank, as I was directed to do, I gave it to a boy, who was working for me, of the name of Tagg, and he stepped it with the money"—he said he had looked for Tagg, but could not find him—I made inquiries at the Cattle Market for him, but could not find him—I found that a lad of the name of William Tagg was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, on the 2nd September—he used to live in the same neighbourhood as the prisoner.</p>

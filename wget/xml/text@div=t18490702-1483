                  </hi>. I am a bottle merchant, of 18, Charles-street, Black<lb></lb>friars-road. The prisoner's master works for me—yesterday morning the prisoner was sent to work at my house—he bad to move some goods from Wellington-place to my house—I went into the parlour about eight o'clock, and missed a frontlet which is used in the Jewish worship, from a box on the table; also a paper containing a ring, which I saw safe an hour before—the prisoner had been in that room, but he had no business there—I gave inform<lb></lb>ation at the station, and on returning saw the prisoner at his master's door with part of the frontlet in his hand—I accused him of the robbery, and said it was my property, and he said he found it in the cart—I gave him in charge of a policeman—he ran away, but I kept sight of him, saw him put his hand into his pocket, take something out, and throw it away; I picked it up, it was this bag, and had the ring and pin in it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave it to the policeman—it is mine, and worth about 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

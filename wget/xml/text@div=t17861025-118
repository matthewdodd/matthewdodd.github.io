               <p>What do they cut them away for, a malicious kind of amusement or what? - They are cut away with intent to go a thieving and plundering on the river; my boat was locked on shore, to go away at high water; the headfast was cut, and she was taken away between twelve and one o'clock; I caught the four prisoners in her, on the 22d of September.</p>
               <p>Where did you catch them? - Between New-crane, and King Edward's Tier; they were rowing; I suppose it was between three and four hundred yards; we had a boat on the lower side of the stairs, and a boat on the upper side of the stairs, with a proviso, that any body should come and take the boats away.</p>
               <p>Did you see this boat taken away? - We saw them come rowing out from the stairs with her; we perceived them, and rowed along side of them, and asked them whose boat it was; and they immediately said it was their's; I looked at the boat, and knew it to be mine by my number; then we immediately took hold of their headfast, and towed them on shore, and sent for the watch, and they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Do you know them? - I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>Did they belong to any vessel that lay in any of the tiers that were round? - One of them told the Justice that he came to go into the Borough, that he lived there, and he said he came down to New-crane, to get over the water to see somebody at Deptford; they all pretended to be going over the water.</p>
               <p>Were there any sculls in your boat when you left it? - No, I could see that they brought sculls with them, for they had a pair in the boat.</p>
               <p>Jury. I believe it is a very common thing to take one another's boats; was there any mark or name on the sculls that you found on the boat, when you came up to it? - There were a pair of scu lls in her, but when we took hold of her, the sculls were thrown overboard, so that we could not see them.</p>

               <p>Were was that ship bound to? - To the South-seas; we all three belong to the same ship.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the watchman when you was taken, that you belonged to that ship? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to the watchman. Did you take these men into custody? - Yes, they gave no account of themselves, only they said, they cried scullers; I never heard any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Did any of the watermen hear them cry scullers? - No, and we lay close too.</p>

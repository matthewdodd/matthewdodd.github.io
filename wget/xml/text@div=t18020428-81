               <p>WILLIAM STOCKS sworn. - I live at No. 145, Wapping-street: On the 23d of March, I think Tuesday, four foreigners came into my shop to buy a hat, the prisoner was not one of them; I sold one of them a three-shilling hat; as soon as they were gone, in consequence of information, I went out, and perceived the prisoner making towards a wharf, where one of the men was that had been in my shop; I saw that the prisoner had something like a bundle under his jacket; I asked him what he had got there; he went away, and I followed him to the Dundee Arms, where I took him with my hat upon him; it hung outside my door; it has my private mark in it; I had put it at the door about three hours before; the prisoner was rather tipsey.(

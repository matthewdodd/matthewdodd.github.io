               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long had you known this woman before you married her? - A. About three months.</p>
               <p>Q. She had visited you, or you her? - A. The first meeting we had was in the street, in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the next interview? - A. She called upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times might she call upon you? - A.Several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever call upon her? - A. No, I never did; I went to her friends; I had called upon her at her first cousin's; she said her husband had been dead a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. You never visited her at her own home? - A. No; and when we came to the point of marriage, she put me to my oath that I should have her, and no other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you know that she was a married woman, and have you not done this in order to prevent a prosecution against yourself? - A. No; she said her husband was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. What gave you any suspicion that she was married? - A. I had no suspicion of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it out in a fortnight after? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you might have found it out before if you had made the same enquiry? - A. Yes; she was with me one week, and then she went away from me to her first husband, and in a fortnight after I found out that she was married.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You met with her first in Long-acre? - A. Yes, after I left work in the evening, she was coming home with some linen, I believe, or something of that sort, she had a bundle in her hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you ever made her an offer since she has been in Newgate, that if she would come back and live with you, you would not prosecute her? - A. No, I have not; it was her first husband that took her up, and he has used me very ill, and would not come to the Court; and then he said, if I would not come forward and prosecute he would prosecute me; and then he said he wished he had not done it, for he wanted to live with her again.</p>

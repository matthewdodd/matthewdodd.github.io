                  </hi> I shall be twelve years old on 1st Aug. I was errand<lb></lb>boy to Mr. Spooner, an oilman, of Bath-street, City-road—I went there from Shoreditch<lb></lb>workhouse, six weeks ago—the prisoner was in his employ—when I went, he said the <hi rend="italic">governor was</hi> a <hi rend="italic">rum one</hi>, and if I did mind my eye, I should get sent back to the workhouse—a few days afterwards, he asked me for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the till—I gave him a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on Monday, 13th march, he asked me for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the till—he said if I did not give it him, he would <hi rend="italic">bunnick</hi> my nose—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the till—he wrapped it up in a bit of paper, and put it under a blacking<lb></lb>botth on the soap<lb></lb>box, in the shop; and next morning he took it, and put it into his pocket—he told me that night he would <hi rend="italic">split</hi> upon me if I did not give him some more money—I was near the till, and he kept making motions to me for me to open the till—he pushed me—my master came and caught me at the till—the prisoner was in the shop—my master was very angry, and discharged him immediately.</p>

                  </hi> I am an oilman, at Bath-street, City-road. Tweed and the prisoner were in my service. On Tuesday, 14th March, I was at breakfast in my parlour, about eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner take some thing off the soap-box, under a bottle of blacking, lift up his apron, and put it into his pocket—I was sitting in my parlour that evening, the prisoner was on one side the counter, and Tweed on the other—I had told the pri<lb></lb>soner not to go behind the counter, Tweed had no right to go to the till—I saw him beckoning with his hand and head to Tweed—I went in and found Tweed's hand in the till—I spoke to him, and then said to the prisoner, "You are a bad fellow, you are at bottom of all this; rake your wages and go about your buisiness"—he came afterwards for a character—I said it would require consideration, and afterwards gave him in charge.</p>

I speak English a little—I am a coffee-house keeper, in partnership with a man named Wiener, at 154, Cannon Street Road, Commercial Road East—on 14th October last two strangers, Poles, came to lodge with me—shortly after they came they gave me a letter, which I took to 171, Church Road, Islington—I went there, but did not find the person to whom the letter was addressed—I went there again by their direction, and I saw an old woman, whom I left it with—the next day Dombrowski came and asked where the two Poles were—I showed him into the room where they were, and he remained some time and then left—on the following morning a box came by the parcels delivery, and the two Poles went away with it—after they had gone a letter came—Dombrowski afterwards took the letter back with him—I have not seen it since—in consequence of that letter I went to him in Church Road, Islington, and met him—he told me that being a coffee-house keeper different people came to my plnce—he spoke in Polish—he also told me that I could get rich by the'affair, and that the others had got plenty of money through it—before this he told me that he had sent the two Poles false rouble notes—I said I should look out for some' customers—I then went away, telling him that if he wanted to write to me I would answer him—he gave me his address, "Taffe, Church Road, Islington"—on 18th October I wrote to him, and received this letter, marked A, the same evening—it stated "I shall wait for you to-morrow, Sunday, and Monday, 11 o'clock in the morning; I say Monday, as I do not know if you will receive this letter to-day"—in consequence of that I and "Wiener went to the Nag's Head, Holloway Road, where we met Dombrowski—I told him that I had a buyer for the rouble notes—he siid</p>

This is the reply to the above: "22, 10, 79.—I have written to you yesterday, and I hope that you have received the things samples or you should receive them either to-day or to-morrow.

Bank of England notes, and I went with my partner to the Nag's Head, Holloway Road—I there met Dombrowski—my partner was at a distance, and did not hear what passed—Dombrowski asked me whether I had received the samples; I said yes—he said "Have you brought some money"—I said yes, and I took out the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and gave him; they were the same that Greenham had given me-Dombrowski said he did not like to take so little—I told him they were only for samples, then I would give him some more—he then said he would send me by post to my house, but not in my own name, three-rouble notes for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he would send me 103 roubles, at 25 per cent, that he would send me three times more than the value of the money I gave him; they were to be sent in the name of Chaim Haipern—he asked me the name of the customer, and I told him Chaim</p>

"November 4th, I shall expect you to-night for the last time, and must finish this business, and you may inform your friend that I shall not take any money if you bring me 500; you may believe me. Take this letter with you." H, "November 5th, You may see me tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock.") On 5th November I met Dombrowski again near the Nag's Head, and while I was speaking to him he was taken into custody by Greenham—I knew his name was Dombrowski, but he wanted me to address him in the name of Taffe.</p>

On 20th October Lowenwurth and Wiener came to Scotland Yard, and made a communication to me and Marshall—I gave them instructions, and from time to time Lowenworth communicated with me—he brought me the envelope marked A on the 20th, and on the same day I saw him meet Dombrowski opposite the Nag's Head, Holloway Road—I was watching in plain clothes—he called at Scot<lb></lb>land Yard on the Wednesday, and brought me the letter and envelope, marked B, containing the three-rouble notes produced—I told him again what to do—on Thursday the 23rd he brought me another letter and envelope marked C, and I went to the Russian Embassy, and saw the Chancellor, M. Bar<lb></lb>tholomei—I received two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes there, Nos. 77132, March 22nd, 1879, and 53921, March 29th, 1879, which I afterwards gave to Lowenworth, and went with him and his partner the same night to Holloway Road—I searched him first to see that he had no other notes—I saw him meet Dombrowski, and have an interview with him—when he came back I</p>

               <p>searched him again, and he had no notes—I had never lost sight of him—on the same day I received from Lowenwurth the paper marked D con<lb></lb>taining two three-rouble notes—on 24th October Lowenwurth and his partner came to Scotland Yard, and I had received from Inspector Marshall a parcel addressed to Chaim Haipern, 155, Commercial Road East, which I opened next day, and it contained 103 rouble notes—I afterwards saw Dombrowski at Holloway—I knew where he lived before, 27, Sussex Road, Seven Sisters Road, Holloway, which is about 150 yards from the Eaglet—on 5th November I went to Holloway, and saw Lowenwurth speak to Dombrowski—I then said to Dombrowski "We are police officers, and I am going to arrest you for uttering 103 forged Russian rouble notes to Lowenwurth"—he said "I think you make a mistake this time," and pointing to Lowenwurth he said "He induced me to do it; I suppose to gave information"—this was about 11.30 am.—I took him to Clerkenwell Police-station, where he was detained—I went to 29, Arlington Road, Tulse Hill with a search warrant—Marshall knocked at the door, a woman opened it, and Mrs. Seymour was called, and came downstairs—I did not know her—I said "Can you tell me from whom you received the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that you changed at Mr. Martin's round the corner?"—she said "I did not change any note"—I sent Marshall round to Mr. Martin in her presence—I said "We are police officers, and I hold a search warrant to search the house; who is in the house?"—she said "Nobody but me, the woman in the kitchen, and the baby upstairs"—Dowdell had gone upstairs, and I heard him calling to me to go up; I tried to go up, but Mrs. Seymour held the bannisters, and prevented me, saying "There is nobody upstairs but my baby"—I pushed by her, went up to the front room first-floor, and found Dowdell there, and the two Yankowskis facing him—there was a fire in the room, and some paper burning in the grate—Mrs. Seymour followed me up, and came into the room, and I read the search warrant to them—Vincent threatened me, and was very excited, but did not touch me—I went upstairs, and on the second floor I found two rooms with the doors locked—I went downstairs again, and asked Mrs. Seymour to open them—she said "I won't"—I told her if she did not I should smash the doors in—she said "I shan't do it"—I went to the second floor with Marshall, forced the front room door open, and found a large number of three-rouble notes laid on the floor for drying—I then broke open the second door, and found a printing press in working order with a good three-rouble note on it, and a copperplate on it with the engraving of part of a note—I found a quantity of plant, and two stamps, one with a Russian name on it, the same I found on other notes in the front room, and the same as those in the packet addressed to Chaim Haipern—I made a list of all the things found in these rooms; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); this book was found on the mantelpiece in the back room (<hi rend="italic">This was in French "on the art of engraving</hi>")—I saw there parts of the engraving of the 1874 and 1878 notes; a lot of paper ready for printing, and paper with the water mark and parts of notes printed on it—I took some of the notes down into the room where the prisoners were, and Vincent Yankowski said "These gentlemens who belongs to the rooms upstairs are gone out"—there were no signs of any one living there, nothing but the forged paper and the plant—they were then taken to Lambeth Police-station, and Dombrowski was taken, and placed in the dock with them; they appeared friendly, and talked together in a language I could</p>

Seymour for two top rooms, 1879, but no date—I produce all the other letters and papers which Mr. Lowenwurth received—I have searched for the keys of the top rooms, but cannot find them—Annie Gibbard came to the house next day when we were completing the search, and made a statement to me; I wrote it down, and she signed it, and after<lb></lb>wards, in consequence of what she said, I went with her to the House of Detention on the 7th; she was shown the different cells, and when she came to Vincent Yankowski's cell she spoke to the warder—I think he was near enough to hear what she said—I asked her if she knew him; she said "Yes"—I said "Who is he?"—she said "Mr. Mitchell"—I don't think he made any reply—she had previously given me a description, in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I took her to the House of Detention, and afterwards to the solicitor's office to make a full statement—I know a person named Montag; he was a witness last March in a ease relating to some forged rouble notes—he came over from Russia, and assisted the police when certain people were tried at this Court; he gave evidence at the police-court and here—there was a second man named Symkiewitz—there was, I understand, a man named Spitz, a former agent of the Russian Government—all the materials are here, plates and all, they have been shown to an expert—I found in Dombrowski's pocket-book this receipt for a registered letter to "Miss Davis, 25, Liverpool Street, Walworth—it bears the post-office stamp of November 4.</p>

I had not seen Mrs. Seymour before the day I went to her house—nothing is known against her to my knowledge up to this charge—I was not present when the woman opened the door—I was not in uniform—we said that we were police officers, and I read the warrant—I did not ask her anything about her family, I said "Is there anybody else in the house?"—she held the bannisters with both hands, but I pushed by her—she came upstairs after me but said nothing—afterwards Goodenough came and failed to identify her as the person changing the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and then she said "I did not change it"—I have made inquiries, but know nothing about the two Poles—we first said that We were police officers immediately after Goodenough came in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Dombrowski has lived at 27, Sussex Road, Holloway, two or three years—I did not know 171, Church Road at that time, that is about a mile and a half from Sussex Road—I am the officer who had a case here of six or eight men for having Russian notes; a large seizure was made and I received the present for the attention I paid to the case—the authorities of Scotland Yard are applied to as to whether we are allowed to receive a present, and the Commissioner gives his sanction if he thinks fit—I had permission to receive the watch and chain.</p>

Foxall, of Hampetead Road—I have since ascertained that he worked for Farmer and Cotteroll eight or nine years ago—their address was not given me in that conversation; perhaps it would be unfair to mention when I obtained it—he did not say that the appearance to his hands had been caused by metal cutting—when he said "I can smash you "I had not told him that I was a police officer; I ran suddenly into the room—no violence was used—he threatened me after that, and he certainly rose his hand, evidently in a violent temper.</p>

I am single, and have lived at 25, Liverpool Street, Walworth, three or four months—I go out charing occasionally, and among other places, to 29, Arlington Road—the first time I went there was May 7th, when Mrs. Seymour's mother died—I had known her before in Walworth, and I went to her once in Gray's Inn, and I knew her at Beading—I saw her and her baby at Arlington Road—I have seen the two Yankowskis there—I heard one of them spoken of as Mr. Vincent—I have seen him there four or five times; I have not spoken to him, but I have passed him and he has nodded—I do not know what he was doing there—I knew the other as Mr. Albert—I have seen him there about four times, but do not know what he was doing there—I have seen Annie Gibbard there—I knew that she was Mrs. Seymour's sister; I did not know her as Mitchell—I saw Mr. Vincent at Beading once—I have not seen him at Gray's Inn Road—some little time before 24th October Mrs. Seymour said "There will be a letter come for me, will you be kind enough to take it in?"—I said</p>

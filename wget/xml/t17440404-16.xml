               <p>Redman White. Last Sunday was fortnight I met the Prisoner and another woman in Drury-lane, between nine and ten at night, and the Prisoner took me to her house in <placeName id="t17440404-16-crimeloc93">Holford's Alley in Drury-lane </placeName>

               <p>Q. What did you take her in for?</p>
               <p>White. I was in liquor, I did not know what I did; we had two quarterns of gin. I sat down in a chair and fell asleep; and when I awaked, I found I was robbed. I charged them with robbing me of my things. I was robbed of my shoe buckles, &amp;c. They said they had no such things.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was drunk, how did you know you was robbed there?</p>
               <p>White. If I had not been drunk I should not have gone into such a house as that - I did not drink a drop of any thing in the house - I believe I was asleep about three quarters of an hour; when I found I could not get my things I went away; the next day I went and demanded the things: the Prisoner confessed she knew of one knee buckle, but said she did not know of any thing more; and she said, if any of her servants or people had taken them, I should have them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she had that knee buckle?</p>
               <p>White. She said she had it from me, and she took it out of a box - she said before the Justice that she had the shoe buckles, knee buckles, stock and stock buckle, and hat; she said she had all except my wig.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did she say, she took them from you; or that you gave them her?</p>
               <p>White. I gave her nothing.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did she say she took them from you, or that you gave them her?</p>
               <p>White. She said that I pledged the knee buckles to her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did she say she took them from you?</p>
               <p>White. She said she had them all.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174404040009"></xptr>Q. What did she say, did she say how she came by them?</p>
               <p>White. She said one of her servants took them from me and she received them.</p>

            . On Sunday March 18, I was at a publick house by Covent-Garden, where I saw Mr. White. He was pretty much in liquor, and I advised him to go home - this was about half an hour after nine. The next morning he came to make his complaints to me, told me what he had lost, and wanted me to go with him to endeavour to get them again. I told him I could not go then. On the Tuesday morning he came and told me he had found out the place where he was robbed, and showed me one of the buckles. We got a warrant and had it executed; and when the Prisoner was before the Justice, she owned every article except either the hat or wig, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say, did she own she took them from him?</p>
               <p>Hughes. She said she knew of them, and if the Justice would indulge her to let the Constable go home with her, she would show him where the buckles were, and she said they were under a brick in her cellar. The Constable and I went with her, she found the brick but did not find the buckles, then she said that one Sullivan, who she said was run away , or something to that purpose, told her she had left them under a brick in the cellar for her, but she did not know, what Sullivan had done with them.</p>

            . I went with the Prosecutor in order to get his things again, and the Prisoner said she had robbed him of the shoe buckles, knee buckles and stock buckle, and that they were under a brick in the cellar. We went with her into the cellar, and when she could not find them, she said she believed the person who was a companion of hers and was gone away, took them away with her.</p>
               <p>White. Besides the Prisoner and the other woman, there were two other girls in the house, and a person the Prisoner called her husband. <rs id="t17440404-16-verdict94" type="verdictDescription">

I live with my mother, who keeps the Alma Tavern, Plumstead-common—on 12th December, about 12 o'clock, the prisoners came in together—I did not notice them speaking together—Woodger asked me for a pot of ale, which came to sixpence, and gave me a bad crown—the other two prisoners had gone into tap-room, but the door was open, and they could hear what took place—I told him it was bad—he said, "I am very sorry, I hope not"—he hurried round to Gray and Sullivan, who had just come out of</p>

I am landlord of the Earl of Warwick, at Welling—on 12th December, at a little before 4 o'clock, Woodger and Sullivan came in together—it was dusk—Woodger asked for half a quartern of gin, and tendered a shilling—I put it in the till—there were three or four other shillings there—I gave him sixpence and 31/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—they both drank of the gin, and left the house together—a policeman came in immediately—I then looked in my till, and found that the top shilling was bad—I had put nothing else into the till afterwards—I gave it to the policeman—I live a mile and a half or two miles from Plumstead-common.</p>

I am a carpenter—on 12th December, at a little before 4 in the afternoon, I was at work in Welling-road; heard something, looked up, and saw Woodger running towards me and a policeman following him—he put his hand in his trousers pocket, took something out with his left hand, which he appeared to be putting into paper—I saw some coin in his hand which looked like silver—it was partially in paper—he threw it across the road, over the fence, into the Park—I was about two yards from him—I stopped him, and a policeman came and took hold of him—I afterwards got through the fence, and found five half-crowns in paper, and two loose, a crown, and two shillings, and gave them to the policeman.</p>

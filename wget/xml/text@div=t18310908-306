On the 11th of March the prisoner took a room at our house, and on the 5th of September I took an officer, and examined the room; I then missed this property - the duplicates were produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Is your husband here? A. Yes; I was greatly surprised at the loss of these things - she had pawned before, but the things were replaced, and it was made up; she had not apprised me of pawning these things - they owed money for rent, but since she had been in prison, her husband had paid 1l. 13s.; the prisoner had said she had 2000l. coming to her, I do not consider such a person could be in distress: I had not asked them for rent - she had promised to pay the rent two or three days before she was taken.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner on the 5th of September; I asked if she had any duplicates - she said Yes, went to a drawer, and pulled out a purse with a great many duplicates; I looked them over and the prosecutor claimed some of them - the prisoner said her husband was in the City, she thought he would not he long, but if he were there, he would know nothing about it; as she had pawned them herself - she said the pillow-cases had been lost at the wash; she made no difficulty of showing the duplicates.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were they not in distress? A. They did not appear so; there was a good dinner providing, of meat and pudding - there were some duplicates for pledges as low as 6d.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Smyth, of St. James's Steam Plough Mills, in the hamlet of Hitcham—on the night of the 17th July our dwellinghouse was broken into between half-past eleven and a quarter to six—my husband got up at that time—the house was secured when we went to bed—I came down at a quarter to six, and found the back window open—the latch had been slipped back—we missed pro<lb></lb>perty to the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I identify the property produced as mine—these articles were in my house the night before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 228 <hi rend="italic">B</hi>). I remember this house being broken into—on the 18th July I received a description of the lost property, and from information I received I went to the prisoners' van, which was then standing on West Green, Hitcham—I saw Stockwell there, and asked her who was in charge of the caravan; she said, "I am"—I asked her if she knew Jane Smith, and she said, "Yes"—I asked if she was aware she was locked up; she said, "No"—I then told her I was a police constable, that Jane Smith was locked up, and that I had come to search the van—I asked her if there was anything in the van that did not belong to her, and she said, "No"—I commenced searching the van, and she said, "If there is anything here, I know nothing about it"—the first thing I found was some pieces of silk—I asked her how she accounted for them, and she said she had had it for a long time—I also found these articles that have been identified by the prosecutrix—I found them under the bed in a large box—on the 24th July I went to Stockwell's house, and on the mantelpiece I found a pawn-ticket, and in consequence I went to Mr. Putnam, and he gave me a shawl, which was part of the property lost—on the 2nd August I apprehended Smith at the House of Correction, Wandsworth, wearing a jacket which was stolen from the mills on the night of the burglary.</p>

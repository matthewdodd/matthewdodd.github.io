            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 30th of January I was on duty in White's-yard - and at two o'clock I saw the prisoners, Walker and Wise, coming up White's-yard, together - I was sitting in my box; they both passed me, and were stumbling, as if drunk; they were going in a direction from Crawley's - I called my regular hour, and saw Wise again, alone, at four o'clock in the morning - I saw him go towards Crawley's house, and stand opposite to it; I was then in my box, which is about forty yards off; he went up and down the yard - there are two houses and two coach turnings between my box and Crawley's house; I looked out of my box, and saw all down the yard; Barnett, my officer, came up to me - we talked together, and then separated; he went up the yard, and I down, towards the Two Brewers, after Wise - when I got to the house he was gone through Crown-court; I went round Crawley's house, and saw the kitchen window open - I went to call Taylor, and we went and called Mrs. Crawley up; I stopped outside while Taylor went in to search the house; no one was found there - I then called half-past four o'clock, and then went to the watch-house; I found Smith and Barnett there - I went with them, Taylor, and two other watchmen to Parson's-court, Blue Anchor-yard - we knocked at the door of a house there - a woman's voice asked who was there - she was in a room on the ground floor; Smith said, "It is only me - don't be afraid - open the door," which she did directly; I, Smith, Taylor, and another went into a room, and there found the six prisoners - this was between four and five o'clock; they were all dressed - three were laying on the bed, and three were sitting up; we took them all into custody. I was conveying Maney to the watch-house - as soon as I got out of the house, he up with his hand, and threw his arm out, to drive me away, saying, "I am d-d if I am going to be taken by you;" I tore his jacket, but he got from me, and out-ran me. I returned to the house, which Smith was searching - we stopped there a little while, and Maney came into the court - I said, "Smith, here is one of the men we want;" Smith came out, and said, "Oh, I know you" - he said, "If you want any thing with me, I will go with you;" we secured him at last, after a great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050004"></xptr>struggle; Smith found some things under the bed, upon which three of the prisoner had been laying.</p>

I cannot swear to any of the things - the handkerchief is something like mine; we give out cans, and do not always get them back - I think I missed one, but cannot be certain whether I gave it out or not; I did not give it out that night - I did not miss rum, but there was a strong smell of it in the bar - I could not tell whether any was missing; my servant had a shawl something like this one; mine cost 38s.; I believe there is the name of "Crawley, Two Brewers, White's-yard," on the can.</p>

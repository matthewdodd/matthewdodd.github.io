            . I am a watchman. I received information from Knight, and got assistance. I placed some watchmen to prevent persons coming out of the premises; I then went to Breedon's house, and got the key; I opened the door: we rushed in, and found the two prisoners in a cart, which was tilted up; Cox and myself stepped up to secure them: they made a rush, got on the top of the cart, and then on the tiles - I went round a court, and heard a great crash of tiles, and in a few minutes Atkins appeared on the top of a wall; I said, "You may as well come down;" he threw down twenty-three bricks at me, as fast as he could - one of which struck my hat; I stooped down; he thought I had fallen - he then made a bolt, and got down; I followed, and overtook him: I found some picklock keys on him. I took him back to the stable, where we found, in a bag, eight fowls, just killed, and a dark lantern; we went up the steps of the loft where the fowls had been kept, and the padlock had been forced off with the handle of this brush, which has some red paint on it, and their hands were covered with the same paint.</p>

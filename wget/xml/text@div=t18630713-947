Allan, except we might have bought an odd bit now and then"—George was near enough to hear that—Mr. Napier was with us—he searched the place but found nothing that belonged to him, and we went away—on 25th June, Whitney and I went to his shop again—we told him that we had received information that his sons had brought a deal of metal away from there, and we wanted to see them—he said they were both out—I then asked him if he had any invoices or papers—he said he was sure he had not, they had no dealings with Mr. Allan, whatever; they might have bought an odd bit now and then—he then came out into the street, I followed him, and I then said, "Our infor<lb></lb>mation is that your sons have received a deal of metal away from this place, have you sold any in the shape of stoves, or made it up into stoves and sold it?"—he said no; his business was not to sell stoves, but to fit them up for other people—I said, "Have you not sold any stoves or ranges to Mr. Kilby or anybody else?"—I told him candidly that we had seen two ranges at Mr. Kilby's—he said he had not sold a dozen stoves for more than a twelve month, and he mentioned the names of one or two persons round the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood whom he fitted up for—I said to him, "If anybody says you have sold those stoves, they say that which is wrong?"—he said, "Yes, they do"—Whitney was not with me all this time, I left him in the shop waiting for the sons—I then told James Thomas that he must consider himself in cus<lb></lb>tody, he would be charged with receiving the goods, and his sons with steal<lb></lb>ing them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Allan—Hardy was employed as head-porter—he had no authority to deliver property to any<lb></lb>body without coming to me, or to one of the clerks—I do not know any<lb></lb>thing about the Thomases, they are not customers of ours—we do not deliver goods in Smith's ride; the proper place is the front of the warehouse, in Thames-street—I went with Gaylor to several builders about Belvedere—I went to Mr. Tear's house in a park there—I afterwards saw Mr. Tear, and told him what houses I had been to, and he said they were his—I found nine stoves in two of those houses exclusively our pattern—it is a registered design, and we have had it in our place about twelve months—I did not see any iron railings—I also saw some stoves that Mr. Blofield had at Belvedere—I identified nine stoves and one range at his houses—the stoves are what</p>

               <p>are called eliptic stoves, of a pattern we have only had out a very few months—there was about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property in Mr. Blofield's houses, and about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth in the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you sell many of those eliptic patterns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes we do—it has not been out more than nine months at the outside—I believe we have sold thousands of them in that time in and around London, and to ironmongers in the country—we always give invoices in ready-money trans<lb></lb>actions; we should for one stove or two—it was my duty to be there at 9 o'clock in the morning, sometimes I called on several of our customers first, and I should then arrive at 10 or 11—there are three other clerks who have power to serve, and take money in my absence—the books are here—they show what has been sold.</p>

I am book-keeper at Mr. Allan's—we had a man named Robert Adams in our service—he left after Hardy was taken into custody, and has not been seen since—on 10th June I accompanied the officers to the Thomases' premises—Gaylor told James Thomas that we had got information of a lot of metal being stolen from our premises, and wished to know if he knew anything about it, or if he had any invoices for metal of ours—he said he had not; he had no dealings with Allan's, and had not had any for several years past—his son George was present at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any boy in the house? - A. Yes; there were several children in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any difficulty about the key? - A. Yes; the second time, when the prisoner was with us, we were led to the room by a key; the officer had the key, the prisoner was close by; the officer went to put the key in the key-hole, and the prisoner immediately seized hold of it, and after some struggle wrested it out of the officer's hand, and chucked it down stairs; it went down to the very bottom of the stairs; he called out to a boy to run away with it; the boy got the key, and did run; Bray run after him, and brought the key back again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You said something about a machine for splitting straw; I believe you had some difference with the prisoner - you thought he wanted to take a copy of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These boards were part of boxes which had contained straw, and sent from the country? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not these boxes used for fire wood? - A. Parts of them are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Godsell, a carpenter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever had any boxes from your house? - A. Only one; I gave it to him to alter, and he brought it back again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go afterwards to his lodgings? - A. Yes, in Redcross-street, with a key for him to open the door, and to look at it; when we came there, his landlady insisted we should not search.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the second time? - A. Yes; the prisoner was sent for, and directly he came, he said we should not search, because there was no warrant; I insisted upon seeing his apartments; he shewed us up stairs; when I went to put the key in the key-hole, after a long struggle, he got the key out of my hand, and threw it down stairs, and called to a boy to run away with it; I caught him before he got out at the door, and then we took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

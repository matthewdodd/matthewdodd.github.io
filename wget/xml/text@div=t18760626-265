                  </hi>. I am in my seventeenth year—my father lives at 1, Cedar Terrace, Fulham Road—he is a house agent and collects rents—I was living in May, at 11, Hope Terrace, at a house kept by Mrs. Mowbray—I know both the prisoners—Down lived at 64, Stafford Place, Buckingham Palace Road, and Hilton, at 1, Stafford Villas, Odessa Road, Forest Gate—I have known Down intimately for sometime, and had on prior occasions taken cheques to get cashed for him, bearing the name of Hall—Hilton was called <hi rend="italic">Jos</hi> sometimes, and Down's sister passes as Mrs. Hilton—on Tuesday, 9th May, I was engaged with my father at the Brompton County Court, on some matter about rents, and when I went home I found Down at my father's office, at Cedar Terrace—I said some<lb></lb>thing about his looking ill and mentioned 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was owing to <hi rend="italic">me—</hi>. he said that he had been waiting for me a <hi rend="italic">deuce</hi> of a time, and he thought if he went to the County Court he might find me—we went out together, called at a shop to get some food, and then went on to my lodging—he said "I want you to go and cash a cheque for me?"—I said "All right, I will"—he took out a pocket-book and placed the cheque on my table—he gave me a sovereign—he owed my sister 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, he would pay me what he owed me—I sat down and had some food, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards I heard someone talking outside the door—I opened the door and saw Down—he came towards me and then I saw Hilton talking to Mrs. Mowbray—Down said "We've been waiting a <hi rend="italic">deuce</hi> of a time for this fellow; he has only just found me"—it was then about 2.30—Hilton came into room, shook hands with me and sat down; I asked him to have something to eat, and he had some lunch—while he was having it he noticed the piece of blue paper which was lying on the table, and said "Oh; here's the cheque," and took it up and looked at it—I went and got some beer and some peppermint, and brought them in—Hilton then said "Do you know where you are going?"—I said "No, I do not know whether I am going to the same place"—Hilton said "You are going to the Western Branch of the Bank of England"—I said "All right"—</p>

               <p>Hilton said "Go to the middle cashier on your right hand"—I said "Very well"—he gave me the cheque and said I was to get 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and the rest in bank-notes—Hilton remarked that "I looked very shabby," and said to Down "You had better lend <hi rend="italic">Charlie</hi> your coat"—Down said "I don't see what he wants my coat for"—I ultimately put on Down's coat—it was a light coat, a large sort of a plaid—Down put on my coat—he took some papers out of his own and a purse, and Hilton said "You had better lend Williams that purse," which was done, and I took it to the bank—Hilton said "Wait here till we come back"—Down said "Very well"—I went out with Hilton—we had something to drink and then we went on the top of an omnibus to the Burlington Arcade—Hilton went to a convenience while I remained at the corner of Cork Street—he then said "There's somebody coming along to whom I owe money, and I don't want him to see me go into the bank; I will wait at the corner of Burlington Arcade"—I then went to the bank and presented the cheque—there was some little delay—the cashier then asked me how I would take it—I said "35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In gold, and the rest in notes"—I received eight 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and,35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, which I put into the purse—I then left the bank, went to the Burlington Arcade and searched for Hilton, but could not find him—I ultimately went back to my lodgings—neither Hilton nor Down were there; I then went to 22, Wood Street, Chelsea, the residence of Emma Goldspink, who I have seen frequently with Down—I then went to South Kensington, and from. there to Liverpool Street, and from there to Forest Gate, to Hilton's house, 1, Stafford Villas—I arrived there at 8.30 or 9 o'clock, and found Mrs. Hilton there—I had some conversation with her—the bouse was poorly furnished—the first person who "came in was Down, at a little after 9 o'clock, but they had no clock so I could no tell exactly—there were not many chairs there—Down said "Have you got the money all right?"—I said "Yes, I have"—he said "Hand it over?"—I handed him the purse, and he laid it on the wash-house table—he asked me whether I had got it all right—I said that I believed I had—he said "Where's <hi rend="italic">Jos?</hi>"—I said "I do not know; he promised to wait for me at Burlington Arcade, and he had gone when I came out, so I thought perhaps he had come back to you"—he said "No, I have not seen him"—Hilton came in about 10 o'clock; Down and I were then in the washhouse—he said "Oh, here you are "—I said "Where have you been to; I have missed you"—he said "I missed you; I went to the <hi rend="italic">pub</hi> and I thought I had missed you"—he asked me "If I had got the money?"—I said "Yes, what are you in such a flurry about"——Down said "Here it is," on the table—Hilton sat down on the only chair they had got, moved the cups and saucers back, turned the money out on the table and counted it—when he had done that he gave Down several bank notes; I do not know whether he gave them all—Hilton said to Down "That squares up my account with you?"—Hilton put the gold in his pocket; I do not know what became of the purse; I afterwards saw Hilton take the money out of his pocket and give it to his wife—he then said that the last train had gone—Down said "I must go to night"—Hilton said "There is a place for either one or other of you to sleep"—Down went away and I stayed—it was then past 11 o'clock—I slept on some rags in a corner—there was no furniture in the room—I was aroused at 6 o'clock a.m. by Hilton, and had some breakfast—Hilton saw me to the station and I went on to my father's office—I was at work the rest of that day, and on the next day, the 11th; I went to see a friend off from</p>

               <p>Blackwall, who was going to India, and as I passed through the Royal Exchange, on my way back I saw Hilton and his wife getting out of a cab—that was from 3 to 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I shook hands with him and asked him whether he had seen Down—he said "No, I hare not seen him"—they walked in the direction of Liverpool Street, and I accom<lb></lb>panied them—he asked me to have something to drink—we went into a public-house in Bishopsgate Street, and Hilton ordered a glass of beer and some brandy and water—while we were there Hilton asked the barman for change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which he took out of his inside pocket; the barman asked for the name and address to be written on the back of the note—it is not true that I took that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from my pocket and handed it to Hilton, and asked him to get it changed for me, nor that I wrote my name and address on it—it was Hilton who wrote on it—I cannot say whether this is the note—I do not remember ever having seen it, and I do not know the writing on it—it is not my writing; I did not see what it was that Hilton wrote on it in the public-house—it was given to the barman, and the change was handed to Hilton—when we got outside Hilton gave me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said that Down told him to give it to me—I said "I thought you had not seen him"—he said "That was sometime ago, but I forgot to give it to you"—I bade them "Good-bye "and left them—I was afterwards taken in custody by Sergeant Butcher; I believe it was on the 21st—I then made a statement to him and a voluntary statement afterwards—I was charged before the Magistrate, admitted to bail and ultimately gave evidence as a witness.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Vickers &amp; Co of Victoria Street, Westminster—I keep a drawing account at the western branch of the Bank of England—this cheque is not in my writing or written by my authority—I know Hilton—I first became acquainted with him at Christmas last year—he spoke to me about making an advance to him on his wife's reversion under the will of Colonel Hutchinson and proposed to give me a policy on his wife's life, but I found that bis wife, or the lady who passed as his wife, was under age, and it was not completed—I lent his mother-in-law on the 11th January by cheque, on one of the ordinary forms, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 2nd February I advanced him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by cheque on the usual form—Hilton introduced Down to me in February and Down asked me to purchase his reversion, which I did. and made him various advances, all of them by cheque, except the deposit under the contract—he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th February, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1st March, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 7th March, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 6th April—the purchase was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I subsequently lent him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because he said he bad taken a tobacconist's business and wanted a little help—every one of these advances was made by cheque with my usual signature—I have banked with the bank nearly four years and have never but once sent a plain cheque and that was not in a transaction with Down or Hilton—all the cheques to them were on the ordinary forms—Down sent me two I O U's which were irre<lb></lb>gular, not being stamped; they included a promise to pay, and therefore I sent them back to be stamped; one was for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I after<lb></lb>wards got from Downs these two I O U's (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 12th April—that was the last transaction I had with him, and the last trans<lb></lb>action with Hilton was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 2nd February—my impression is that the body of this cheque is in Down's writing—on comparing, his I O U's with it there is a very great similarity.</p>

I have been with Hilton about two years—I knew, him by no, other name but his and Hilton—his own name is Redhead, but he takes the name of Hilton to shield me, because I cannot be married to him yet—I cannot swear that he has got a wife, but there is something which prevents it—his name is William, Elwys Redhead—I think Elwys is one of his, surnames—I have not known him pass as Elwys only with me—he did not live in the house in the name Of Elwys; it was me—Goldspink was my mother's servant—I have not walked down any street with her. after me—I never saw her, after she left my mother's service—I never said "It is sure to be found out; <hi rend="italic">Josh</hi> really did it; but is it likely a man would put his own name; on a forged cheque if he had really done it?"—I was not in Court during Goldspink's evidence—if she has said that, it is utterly untrue I did not say "The detectives are watching us, but I have dodged them"—nor did I say "You had better go to Jersey"—every word of that is untrue—I know Sawter—I did not tell him that the detectives, were watching me—but he came and told me that there were two men at the bottom of the street and he though they were about our furniture—we had furniture in the house at Forest Gate—it was there when Williams came—he saw nothing but the kitchen and the passage, and they were thoroughly furnished—he did not sleep there that night—no one slept there but Hilton and myself—there was no room there in which there was a bundle of rags in a corner—that must be all a fabri<lb></lb>cation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. My brother Charles had been staying at Forest Gate two or three days before the 9th May I do not know whether you will call it sleeping there—he sat up in a chair for probably three nights, and on the morning of the 9th he left by the 9.20 train, and I never saw him again till I saw him here—Hilton did not go up to town on the 9th—he went to Stratford and came back between 4 and 7 o'clock; I cannot say</p>

               <p>nearer than that—he went to the landlord to put him off—I do not know that he went up to town and saw my brother—I was under the impression that he never saw him after he left in the evening—when we went to this public-house the note was laid on the counter, and I passed it from Williams to Hilton—I cannot say who put it on the counter—I saw a pen and ink brought, but Hilton did not take the pen up; it was Williams; and I saw him writing, but I cannot say what he wrote—I was talking at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Hilton had arranged to go into partnership with a man if he got the money, and I have the agreement in my pocket now—he gave the man a bill of sale on the furniture, and he came and sold us up—that is the reason we had no furniture in the house—he owed no one money who would not wait—they were all willing to wait.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hilton in his defence stated that he was married at seventeen years of age, to a woman who he never lived with, but parted from a few hours afterwards, and therefore he was not able to marry Down's sister who was living with him.; that Down had a</hi> 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bill, which he asked him to accept, and could not get discounted, and he paid it into his bankers, and drew two cheques, but the bankers would—not discount the bill; that Down told him Mrs. General Hulchinson. was going to let him have</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in a short time, and he drew a bill, but failed to get it discounted; that Downn said he would lend him</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">which was paid in two cheques, and asked him to step up to Mr. Sawter, the groser, to cash one of than, and he contended that it was not likely that Down should have asked the grocer not to mention the amount; being very stout he pointed out, that his coat would not be likely to fit Williams, and he stated that be never saw a cheque at Hope Terrace, and never made any suggestion about the coat or the pocket-book; that he waited some hours in Bishopsgate Street, for Williams, who never came, that When he took the detective to the public-house it was in the hope that the publican would remember Williams, and he con<lb></lb>tended that if there was any conspiracy it was between Down and William, and not with himself, and stated that he never knew the cheque had been forged.</hi>

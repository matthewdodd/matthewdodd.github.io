                  </hi> (City Policeman 99). I was at the top corner of Cheap-side on Lord Mayor's day about a quarter past three o'clock, and saw a lady in front of a gentleman—the prisoner pulled the lady's dress out a little way—the gentleman pulled him away, and at the same time the prisoner put something into his right-hand pocket—he made a rush and got away—I was shoved on one side, but followed him to King Street, where I laid hold of him and told him I wanted him for robbing a lady—he twisted and tried to get away—Whitney, who was with me, put his hand in the pri<lb></lb>soner's trousers pocket and took out this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took him to the station, and found on him a tobacco pouch and this Albert chain, which he was wearing without a watch—he refused his address.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the streets very much crowded, and a great many rough characters about, and a great many practical jokes being played? A. Yes, and hats were being thrown in the air—there were lots of people near the prisoner, but I was close to the prisoner—the gentleman pulled him from the lady—I was then pushed by the crowd, and he got away, and immediately he got away he put his hand in his trousers pocket.</p>

On the 7th of December, I lost a quantity of metal; I had previously marked it; on the 7th of December, I discovered an ingot of brass was taken from the bin or box, where it was kept; I determined on searching the men when they came down to go out to dinner. I stopped a number, and desired them to walk into the parlour; I robbed down one of the men, and afterwards the prisoner, and in his breeches pocket I found the two ingots of brass. These are the pieces of brass; they are my property; I had marked them a month before I found them on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN CALLEB. I am a brass-founder. I saw master rub the prisoner down; he told him to take the brass out of his pocket; the prisoner took out two pieces of brass, one from each breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Mr. Thurkle's foreman; I asked him for six sets of heutenants furniture; he gave mo the keys to go and fetch them; I took the brass out of the shop; the men were coming down stairs, I was obliged to get out of the way to let the men pass, master was ordering the men into the parlour. I put the things in my pocket; I did not mean to take them out of the shop.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

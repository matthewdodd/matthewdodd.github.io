                  </hi>. I live at Norwood, and the prisoner lodged with me. On the 27th of July, I went out and left this money in my house, about five o'clock, and my wife left about nine—I returned about seven o'clock in the evening—I cannot tell whether my money was gone then, I did not look for it, nor do I know where it was myself—I spoke to the prisoner about it the next day, when the officer was with me—the</p>

I left home that morning, and left the half sovereign and the rest of the money in a box—no one was in the house but the prisoner—I came home at night and missed the money from the box the next morning—the prisoner did not know where the money was that I know of—the box had been opened.</p>

               <p>Who were the two gentlemen? - That is one, and that is the other.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they were the two prisoners?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050055"></xptr> - I am very sure; I told them a great many people had no intention to buy, and it being late in the evening, I thought they only intended to put me to trouble; they told me if I sold them on an equal footing with other tradesmen, they would buy of me; I told them I had got them on an equal footing with other tradesmen, and I shewed them several pieces of silk handkerchiefs; the man with the white head (Smoulter) told the other if he would buy one, he would pay for him; I shewed them a great many things I had got, and he was on the same side of the bench I was; he then went out of the door. I then packed up my goods, and seemed a little confused; a soldier, whose name is Newton, said I had lost a piece of handkerchief; so he claps this Smoulter on the shoulder, and says this is the thief.</p>
               <p>After you had shewn them the goods, and they did not agree to buy, you packed them up again, and then you missed one piece? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You appeared confused? - Yes; I was confused on having lost the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Did you find the piece again? - The constable found them in the course of the night.</p>
               <p>Did you take them up immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you do with them? - They were put into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Did you go with them to the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see the handkerchiefs again? - I saw them next morning; my licence was taken from me as a security for the people being taken.</p>
               <p>You did not see them take any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Were there many others there besides? - There were several people in the other boxes opposite.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else in the same box with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you while you were shewing the goods carry any into any other box, or suffer any body to take any into any other box? - No.</p>
               <p>You opened them in that box only? - Yes.</p>

About two o'clock in the morning, as I was going my beat, they called to me; I went to them, and they asked me if I was worthy, I told them I was; Smoulter said, then if you are true and worthy I will tell you where these goods are.</p>

               <p>On saying you was true and worthy, what answer did they make? - They said the goods were within five yards of the house where they took them.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect which of them said that? - Smoulter; he told me I might go and sell the handkerchiefs, and make the most of them, and bring them some gin.</p>
               <p>Was the other man by, did he hear this? - I handkuffed them both together.</p>
               <p>Was the other asleep? - They both talked to me about it.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - I left the cage, and came to the officer at the watch-house, and desired him to take a walk with me to such a place.</p>
               <p>Who was the officer? - Mr. Williams; we walked down by Mr. Messiter's brickwall, and just by a stone where they said they were, Williams picked them up.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of the watch. About nine o'clock in the evening, a person came to my house, and told me that two men were stopped at the sign of the Iron Gate, for robbing Mr. Campbell; I went there, and saw these men in the house, detained by the people; I asked them for what? and Campbell said he had lost a piece of handkerchief.</p>
               <p>How many? - I can't tell; a soldier was there, and he said, if any man has robbed him, it is that man in the white coat, - Smoulter.</p>
               <p>You said some soldier told you? - Yes; he said if any body has robbed you, it must be the prisoner at the bar: he was immediately laid hold of, and he said, I'll give you half a crown if you'll let me go, and let any body else go with me, and you shall have the handkerchiefs again.</p>
               <p>Who said so? - Smoulter; I said you shall do no such thing; you have sent for an officer to do justice, and I shall not come here to compound felony. I charged them in the King's name, and they were taken to the cage.</p>
               <p>What became of them afterwards? - I don't know; they were sent to Bridewell, and brought back again on the 10th of November to be examined again. Justice Sherwood committed them.</p>
               <p>After this conversation had passed at the cage, you went where the prisoners had directed? - Yes; I went with a candle and lanthorn up by the brick wall, by Mr. Messiter's wall I saw something lying, I thought it was a brick-bat; I touched it with my bludgeon, and found it was the handkerchiefs. Here they are, (producing them) they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>To Campbell. Look at those handkerchiefs, are they your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you know them to be your's? - They are the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Will you swear them to be your's? - Yes; I do.</p>

               <p>Did you see Campbell there? - I saw him come into the house with a bag; he asked the company whether they would buy any handkerchiefs; Sharp said, have you got any good ones; he said he had, and asked him if he intended to buy: he pulled a half-crown piece out of his pocket, and then he opened his pack, and while he was shewing a piece, Smoulter took a piece from underneath, and went out of the house; he staid about a minute and a half, and then returned. When he found he could not deal with them, he packed up his goods; I asked him whether he had not lost any thing, and looking two or three times over his goods, he said he had; I asked him what it was, and he said, a piece of handkerchief.</p>
               <p>How many was there in number? - To the best of my knowledge there was three: I then said, that is the man that has took them.</p>
               <p>Did you fix on Smoulter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From Prisoner Sharp. You did not see me meddle with any handkerchiefs, any further than offering the gentleman two shillings for them? - You offered two shillings, and he could not take the money, and at the same time you came to ask charity in the house.</p>
               <p>SHARP's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to this house, and this man was there, which was the first time of my ever seeing Smoulter; one word began another, and we stopped to drink together; we staid there till about eight or nine, and then I was going home; this man came in, and we could not agree, and when he went out, the soldier swore I took the handkerchief, when I never saw the handkerchief in my life, nor any longer than just to offer him half a crown for it.</p>
               <p>SMOULTER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been at work on board an Indiaman all day; and coming home across Execution-Dock, I happened to call at this house about nine o'clock; I saw a hawker there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050057"></xptr> with stockings and handkerchiefs; and we were in the further part of the house drinking together; he asked us if we wanted to buy any handkerchiefs or stockings; this man answered, and said he would buy a handkerchief for his wife: he then pulled down his pack, to shew his goods, and whispered to me, and asked me if there was any Custom-house officers or Excisemen in the house; says I, I don't know, I am a stranger, I never was in the house before; he pulled out some handkerchiefs, and said they were India ones, and well worth the money he asked; I said they were not India ones, but Spitalfields handkerchiefs, just so; he asked five shillings and threepence a piece, and I told him I could buy as good in the shops for half the money.</p>
               <p>(No witnesses were produced to their characters.)</p>

               <p>in the service of Messrs. Ower as a carman—I recollect on the morning of 9th June seeing Allen fetch six sacks from the stable—they were in a corner covered over with straw—I had seen the sacks there first on the Tuesday before—they were in the same corner, and they were covered over at that, time—they were concealed from sight—I examined them on that Tuesday, and made a communication—when he took the sacks from the stable he put them into the cart which was standing at the door, where we put out the goods—he then drove away—I had some directions, and followed—the cart went up Goodman's-yard, and when it got to the top, the other man was waiting there—he got into the cart, and they both went towards Downs'-wharf—when they got there, Gills got out of the cart, took the sacks, and went up Nightingale-lane—I followed after him to Bishopsgate-street—he there went to a chimney-sweeper's door, put the sacks down, and knocked twice; but no one came—after waiting some time, he went a few yards into the road, leaving the sacks at the door—I waited some time, till I saw an officer, and then gave him in charge—he had left my master's premises about ten minutes past 9—I saw the officer take Gills in custody, and heard him ask if the sacks belonged to him, and he said, Yes; he bought them of a carman—I said, "Mr. Ower's caiman?"—he said, "Yes"—nothing more was said—the officer took charge of the sacks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bill-broker, of 32, Nicholas Lane, Lombard Street—I have been discounting bills for the defendant for about two years, in amounts varying from 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—the amounts were generally for even hundreds, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he received them from his customers for goods which he had sold—I never knowingly discounted accommodation bills for him; I should have re<lb></lb>fused—I knew that he was a shirt and collar manufacturer—in May, 1877, he brought me this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with two or three more, amount<lb></lb>ing to 696<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I gave him two cheques, one for 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one for 495<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 646<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in respect of the three bills—the terms were 5 per cent. per annum and 10 percent.—that accounted for the diminution—McLaughlin's name was on one of the bills as acceptor, and I said "How is it you draw on McLaughlin, as he is a shirt—maker?"—he said "McLaughlin is able to make certain kinds of shirts to better advantage in Ireland than I am, and I can make other sorts to better advantage than he does"—I believe that the bill of 10th May was genuine, and that this was McLaughlin's writing, and drawn for goods supplied to McLaughlin—I parted with my money believing that the bills were for goods supplied to McLaughlin—about 28th August the prisoner came again, and brought with other bills the one for l54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they amounted altogether to 592<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put the question to him whether they were for goods supplied—he said "They are, and you will find that the payment was made by cheque 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short"—some of his</p>

               <p>bills were overdue and unpaid, and he said that if I would discount these bills he could put off those bills, and I could discount a few more a month hence—I gave him these two cheques for 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him on that occasion whether he intended to liquidate—he said "Most certainly not"—I believe that bill of 10th August was for goods which he had sold to McLaughlin, and that this "P. McLaughlin" was McLaughlin's writing—had I known it was an accommodation bill I would not have had anything to do with it—the bill of May 10 came back dis<lb></lb>honoured, and they said that it was a forgery—I saw Mr. McDaid about it—he said that it was not a forgery, and he should be able to convince me that it was not, and would get McLaughlin to write to me, or to come over and convince me—I showed him this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I had received from McLaughlin—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter McLaughlin wrote to McDaid—McDaid afterwards brought me this letter, which he represented to be from McLaughlin. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "September 21st, 1877. Sir,—The bill referred to in your letter of the 17th instant is a forgery, and of that fact I informed the bank here when they presented it to me. I will not pay it.—Yours truly, P. McLaughlin.") This note was brought to me afterwards. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated September</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">from P. McLaugh<lb></lb>lin, stating that he did not expect a bill at that time, but had explained matters at the bank, and would get money to meet it in a day or two</hi>. ) I then allowed him to take away the other letter—that was after 21st September—I saw him again in reference to that bill—he said that it was McLaughlin's bill, and it was too bad of him to say that it was a forgery—I did not have a notice of liquidation from him till the beginning of October—he was first given in custody on the May bill—McLaughlin attended at the Mansion House on the 10th and 17th November—I did not know until he came to London that it was not a genuine bill—at the time of the defendant's liquidation I was the holder of a number of bills amounting to 3,077<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and proved for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I received this letter from McLaughlin about the date it is written, 22nd September—I realised from that that forgery had been committed in his name—I took no criminal proceedings, because I know that forgery is very difficult to prove—when I got McLaughlin's letter I do not think I inquired whether the second bill was a forgery too—I thought it best to settle up one first—I use the expression "settle up" because I was not fully convinced that it was a forgery—I wrote to him, I did not send—I tried to see McDaid—I did not give him in custody—I had many transactions with him prior to May when the bill was brought to me—the earliest was some time in 1875, and from that time I had gone on discounting bills for him, which were generally honoured up to May this year—there were one or two irregularities before, down to July, but they had been put right—I mean that they were not paid when due, but afterwards—I discounted three other bills of McLaughlin's some time in 1875—I think my books will show that I discounted his acceptances the first year that I began to discount—I have not discounted bills for the prisoner to the extent of 24,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think it is 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not looked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I have not in any way been endeavouring to use the Criminal Court for the purpose of getting my money—my expression "settling up" referred to finding out whether it was a forgery; I meant clearing up.</p>

I live at 157, St. James Road, Bermondsey—I was in my brother's employ in Spa Road as a shirt and collar manufacturer—in the autumn of 1876 I heard a conversation between McLaughlin and my brother in the counting-house—they talked about how much more business they could do if they had more capital—a paper like a bill was lying before them—I saw it pass from McLaughlin to my brother—I saw McLaughlin write on it, return it, and say ''There, that is all right"—my brother said that some Saturday he might want cash to pay the workers, and it would take a long time to send a bill in a letter and get it returned if he would allow him to use his name it would be an obligement—McLaughlin said he had no objection, and in return he would want him to assist him in the London houses in trade—my brother said he would do all he could—McLaughlin also said it would be easier if my brother would assist him to open a banking account—my brother said he would see about it—in August, 1877, McLaughlin was in England again and at my lodgings, and Heggerty was present—I mentioned that there was a bill out, and asked if he had any objection to those things going on—McLaughlin said not the slightest, as he depended upon my brother, and he would see to it all right, and that he had come over to see about some trade my brother had promised him—he asked if we had any work ready—I said the last goods were delayed and so turned out bad in the market—McLaughlin said he was so slack now that he could do them cheaper and better now—he also said that he did not mind his name being used, and if my brother would assist him to open a banking account he would meet the bills when they became due when it would not be convenient to send cash, and he could pay him back when convenient.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I sent a telegram to McLaughlin to come and see me and to know when he would leave London, but I do not remember the one saying "I will pay, but want you to protect me"—I telegraphed to Mrs. McLaughlin to Know if Patrick had left for London—I do not remember asking McLaughlin to say the bills were signed by his authority when he was in custody—I managed in my brother's absence—McLaughlin signed three bills for my brother—I do not know what letters my brother sent to McLaughlin—I do not know if an acceptance is in Porter's writing—Porter was employed by my brother about three years—I could not say whether the letter found upon my brother is Porter's writing—he used to write on different paper to this letter—I suppose it is Porter's writing—I never saw Porter sign bills for my brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bermondsey, and am a tram-conductor—I was employed by the defendant three years—I left last year—I have seen McLaughlin at the defendant's place several times—I remember spending the evening at Charles McDaid's lodgings in August, 1877—Charles McDaid asked Mr. McLaughlin how trade was—he said that it was very dull at present, but he hoped Mr. McDaid would assist him in some of the city houses and send him more of his own work when he could, and if he could assist him to open a banking account it would be easier in the way of bills, and that he was satisfied with his arrangements with McDaid so long as McDaid met the bills when they became due—previously at the factory I had heard them talking about bills when I</p>

               <p>went up to supply myself with pens and blotting-paper, and McLaughlin said "Mac, you can use my name to bills."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I mentioned the blotting-paper before—only Mr. McDaid, the prisoner, Mr. McLaughlin, and myself were present at the conversation about the bills—I do not know Porter's writing.</p>

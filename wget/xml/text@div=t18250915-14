            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's lodgings; he was ill in bed at the time; we found the handkerchief in his room, and the shawl and napkins in his landlord's room - he said he had found them on the floor, and was drunk at the time - he was very sorry.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating, that on the 1st of August he picked up this bundle in a public-house, being intoxicated at the time; but had not attempted to dispose of a single article.</p>

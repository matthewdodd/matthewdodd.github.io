               <p>six and seven o'clock in the evening, I went ashore with the ship-keeper to get his things—I came back to the vessel in about half-an-hour, and found the prisoner in the forecastle—he did not belong to the ship and had no business there—he had a ham in his hand—when he saw me he dropped it—I asked what he was doing—he said he had come on board along with two of his shipmates; that they were in the forecastle at the time, that they had handed this ham out of the forecastle to him, and that they were going to have a jubilee at the Phoenix—I called out every man's name on board, but got no answer—he said they would not answer, and ran on shore—I called out for the officer, and ran after him as fast as I could—I did not lose sight of him at all—the foreman stopped him—I went with him and the watchman to the dock-house—one of the men then went on board with me—we went down the forecastle and found a case of hams broken open, and a poker lying by the side of it—one ham was gone from the case—I had seen the case safe in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the same house as the prisoner, in Earl-street, Southwark—he had threatened on the Monday that he would do for me, because I stood between him and his wife when she cried "Murder!" and last Wednesday morning, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was cutting a bundle of wood which was on the table, and he said, "You weak thing; I have you alone, and I will do for you"—he wrenched the knife from my hand, and made a cut at me—I tried to get it from him, and he chopped my finger with it—the first cut was accidental, in his taking the knife out of my hand; but the second was not—they are two very deep wounds—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife I had.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Just before 8 o'clock in the morning, I had occasion to go out—and this party and another were upstairs in the back-room—my little girl has not been examined yet; I wish her to be called, she was ex<lb></lb>amined before the Magistrate—I called her out of bed to light the fire, when I went down, as her mother was not at home—she began to light the fire, and lay the breakfast things—the parlour door was left open all night, and I merely looked in to see what was o'clock; and during the time I was telling her to get the breakfast ready, a pint of gin, and some rum was sent out for—I went to fetch my wife home to breakfast at ten minutes past 9, looked at the clock again, and the prosecutrix came down with a knife in her hand and said, "You ought to have a taste of this"—I said, "For what?—I give you verbal notice to leave"—she made a blow at me with the knife—I put up my hands to save myself and got cut with the knife—I tried to get it from her, and here are the marks on my hands; though they are not so deep as her's—she cut herself, in trying to get it—the policeman told her to get some sticking plaister, but she went to the doctor's—neither her fellow lodger nor she, had been sober since Christmas-day—a gentleman was up the whole night with them drinking rum and gin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am travelling clerk in the Missing Letter Depart<lb></lb>ment of the General Post Office—the prisoner was a sorter at the Eastern District Office—on 13th April, I made up a letter, and enclosed in it 210 penny postage stamps, addressed "To the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Fisherman's Guide,</hi> Crane Court"—I put them in an envelope with an adhesive seal, and handed it to Mr. Stephens with instructions to post—shortly after 1 o'clock, the prisoner was brought to my private room, and I said to him "A letter addressed to the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Fisherman's Guide</hi> is missing, do you know anything about it?"—he said "No"—Rumbold then searched him, but found nothing on him—he was asked if he had another coat—he said "Yes, down stairs"—Mr. Haynes, who was present, went down and fetched the coat, and asked the prisoner if it was his—he said "Yes"—Rumbold took a number of postage stamps from the pocket—the prisoner made a rush</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060012"></xptr>
               <p>at them, but Rumbold interfered—I identified the stamps, and said to the prisoner "Those stamps were enclosed in a letter addressed to the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Fisherman's Guide,</hi> where did you get them from?"—he said, "I don't know nothing about them"—he was given in custody—the stamps are marked—here are 210 of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was spoken to in the postmaster's private room—he had been called from the sorting office—I asked him if he had a cupboard—he said "Yes"—I don't remember his telling me that the key was in the cupboard—he described to me what kind of coat his was, and on what peg it was hanging—he gave me every assistance—when the coat was brought up he was asked if it was his, and when the stamps were taken out he used some such expression as "Good God, what are they, I know nothing about them."</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter carriers at the Eastern District office—on 13th April, about 11.40, I took a letter out of the box addressed "To the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Fisherman's Guide,</hi> 5, Crane Court, Fleet Street"—I had received instructions—I stamped it, sorted it to the W. C. district, and saw it taken by the prisoner to his desk—it was his duty to turn it out as a mis-sort, and pass it on to the E. C. district—he was the sorter to the W. C. district, and Billett was making up the E. C. bag—there was a box for mis-sorts on the right side of each—it was the prisoner's duty to put it into the box, but they do not always do that, they merely pass it over—I was present when Mr. Gardner questioned the prisoner in the postmaster's room, and heard him asked whether he had a coat—I went down and fetched it—I found it on the third peg in the kitchen, where the prisoner told me, and took it up stairs, handed it to the officer, and saw the pockets emptied and a bundle of stamps found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> About six coats were hanging up in the kitchen on the left-hand side—I did not observe the other side—it was merely hanging by the inside of the collar with the inside towards the peg in the regular way—the inside breast pocket was concealed, doubled up—over forty people were employed in the room where the prisoner was—a mis-sorted letter may sometimes be flung on the General sorting table—after the prisoner had sorted his letters for the W. C. district he would go to fetch some newspapers—he would not pass the General sorting table only at its very extreme end—he does not stand a yard from it—he could fling a letter there, but it was against his duty to do anything but put it in the mis-sort box, although the man was standing next who ought to have received it—mis-sorted letters on the General sorting table are restamped for the next hour—they are in the legal custody of the senior stamper, but he does not wait there all the time—there is nobody there to look after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The General sorting table is on one side and the Town sorting table on the other—supposing a sorter picked out a letter which was not in his district, the effect would be to postpone it for an hour—I should not put a town letter there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sorter in the E. C. district office—on 13th April I was making up letters for the Central district, and the prisoner stood by my side making up letters for the W. C. district—I saw him take a rather bulky letter in his hand, feel it, and put it on a little shelf on his right side, I and while he was sorting his letters I saw that it was addressed "To the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Fisherman's Guide,</hi> 5, Crane Court, Fleet Street"—after he had sorted his letters he took that letter and took it away with him, and I saw no more of it—my attention had been called to the test letter, so that I was watching.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had five or six more letters to sort when he had finished his, which would take me a quarter of a minute—he went to the end of the office to take his newspapers, and he tied his bag and went into the street—he had to go out and dispatch the City cart and to receive a cart from the City, and check and sign way bills—the letter was in his hand all that time—he then went into the kitchen and I did not notice him any further—about two minutes after he had gone I made a communication—I did not go outside when he was removing the carts, but the letter was in his hand when he went to the table to get his newspapers.</p>

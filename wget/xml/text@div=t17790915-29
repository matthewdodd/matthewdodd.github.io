             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Priestman. On the 10th of July, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner came to my master's shop, in company with a man who came to pawn a pair of shoes. She was speaking to him. She stood a minute or so near some linen that was hanging up for sale. A woman who was in a box, pawning some linen, told me the prisoner had a piece of linen hanging under her petticoats. I looked and saw the linen, and jumped over the counter, charged her with having the linen, and saw her drop it from under her petticoat. I do not know whether the prisoner or I took it up. She begged me to let her go, and said what would you have more, you have got your property again. I charged a constable with her, and took her before the justice.</p>

               <p>I never had the linen. I had been drinking with a woman, who came in to pawn some linen, and in spite she said I had the linen.</p>

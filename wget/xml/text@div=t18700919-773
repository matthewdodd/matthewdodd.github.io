                  </hi>. I live at Shadwell, and am a builder—on 22nd August I was at the Canterbury Arms, and had some gin there—I do not recollect seeing the prisoner there—my watch was safe, and my purse, with some cheques in it, which were drawn to order, and some sovereigns and silver—my watch was fastened with a cross-bar to my button-hole; it was worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it cost nearly 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not consider I was drunk; I had had some drink—I do not recollect that the landlord refused me any more—I do not remember what time I left—I recollect nothing afterwards—I do not recollect walking home to the prisoner's house, and I do not believe I did—I have a sort of half-recollection, a sense of being on a bed without power to help myself—I felt somebody feeling over me without my having power to resist it, a perfect consciousness of mind but no power of body—when I was conscious I found myself walking in the street—I spoke to the first man I met, and informed him of my loss, which I had then discovered—I gave information, and my wife went for Mr. Garty, the doctor—I had vomited at that time, and part of the vomit was preserved—I was wearing the same shirt when I saw Mr. Garty as I were the previous night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Agar Terrace, Brixton—on 23rd August, at 8 o'clock in the morning, I was called to the prosecutor's bedroom, and found him lying on his back in a very exhausted state—his feet and hands were cold, he was almost pulseless, and the pupils of his eyes were firmly contracted—on inquiry I found that he had had stertorous breathing during the night—I asked for the vomit, but it had been thrown away—when I took his hand out of bed to feel his pulse I smelt chloroform—I felt his shirt, put it up to my nose, and found chloroform on both sleeves—my judgment is that he had been drugged first with morphia, and after, to destroy sensibility entirely, had chloroform given to him—a small room like a public-house, with the fumes of tobacco or gas in it, would cause morphia to take effect upon him very shortly, as such things deteriorate the Atmosphere—morphia would increase the amount of vomit—the utensil did not smell of alcohol, such as gin or brandy; I should have detected it by the smell if it had been thrown up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Morphia will increase bile, or I suppose beer would not be a good thing for a bilious person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it would increase it—drunken men vomit a good deal, and if there is bile it would be apt to come up with the beer—I ascertained that he had vomited a good deal—that would decrease his pulse—when a man has been very tipsy over night, you do not expect to find his pulse strong in the morning—I did not examine the room, but am certain he had no bottle of chloroform there—the only trace of it I detected was the smell of his shirt—chloroform is highly volatile, but I detected it in the folds of the shirt.</p>

On 25th August, I met the prisoner, and told him I was going to take him for stealing a watch and chain, on the Monday night previous—at the time he was at the station the police had received no information of the robbery—I traced the watch by the maker's name, and the number—he said he was in the Canterbury Arms, and a gentleman came in and had some gin, and paid for a pot of beer, and he had some of it, and when he came outside the gentleman was drunk, and wanted to go home—he said I asked him to come home with me, which he did, and when he got into my room he fell on the bed, between my wife and daughter—there was a <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> and the light was put out—I got a light again, and it was put out again; and when I got a light again I saw the gentleman exposing himself—he said he was very sorry, he had got no money, and he gave me his watch, and said I could make 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—I asked him if he knew the gentleman—he said no, he never saw him before, and knew nothing of him—he said "He left my house, and went away, and I never saw anything more of him."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not he say "He had got no money, he was very sorry for what he had done, and gave me his watch and chain to go and pledge?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think those were the words—I do not think anything was said about the gentleman coming in the morning to bring the money, but I think I understood him that he expected the gentleman in the morning—I examined the prisoner's house—there are two or three little cottages all on one floor—there is only one small room, and as soon as you enter from the street you come into it—the prisoner lives in one room, that is all he has—he and his wife and daughter sleep in that room—the daughter's age is seventeen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "When he came into the Canterbury Arms he was the worse for liquor. He called for wine; he was not served. Does not that show he was drunk? I had a drop, and he had the same. He would have me go home with him. I said, 'No;' but he took hold of my arm, and would stick to me. I said, I have no bed for you, but you can come home and sit in the chair.' When I went in I went to the mantelpiece and got a light. He saw the bed and took a view, and dashed the candlestick out of my hand, and got into my bed. My wife and daughter jumped out in a fright. He lays hold of my wife by the middle of the back, and got her up against the bedstead. I said,' My good fellow, what do you mean? I thought you were a different sort of a man.' He said, 'I am very sorry for what I have done; I have got about me; here is my watch; take it to the pawn; you will get 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I am very sorry.' I said, 'You had best go away, and take your</p>

               <p>watch with you.' He said,' No, I won't take the watch with me.' I said, Well, I'll keep the watch till 12 o'clock to-morrow for you; and if you don't come then I will go to the pawn with it.' I followed him out with his hat. He was in such a hurry to go out, I believe nature overpowered him. I think he was too fond of the ladies. He pat on his hat, and walked away as well as I could. He had too much wine in him. If I had meant anything wrong, I should not have gone to the pawn with it, nor to the station afterwards."</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman to Mr. Harvey, who keeps the Canterbury Arms—the prisoner came there on Tuesday morning, 23rd August, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I had seen him there the previous night—he wanted a half-pint of beer; but had got no money—he wanted to borrow some, and he did; but I cannot say of who—the barman told me that he had a watch and chain, which the prosecutor had given him overnight—the barman has been here the whole week.</p>

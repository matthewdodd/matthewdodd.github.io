               <p>ELIZABETH HARVEY. I am a laundress at Clements Inn, to Mr. Sandys and Mr. Cousins. The pri- prisoner came on the 28th of October, at half past ten in the morning, he enquired for Mr. Cousins and Mr. Sandys, he told me that he had appointed to meet them there, I told him they were not within, he went away and came about one o'clock on the same day, he enquired if Mr. Cousins had returned, I told him no, he said that he had seen Mr. Cousins, and that he would be there at a quarter past one, he gave me some papers and told me to give them to Mr. Cousins, and he would return directly; I immediately put the papers into the chambers, about a quarter after one the prisoner returned, he enquired if Mr. Cousins had been, I told him no, he said would I return him the papers he gave me, I immediately opened the chamber door and gave the prisoner the papers, the prisoner then said he would wait a little while, I said very well; he walked in and sat down, I came out and left him in the room setting in the chair. I shut the parlour door and the passage door after me, I ran up stairs to my own room, which is over the chambers, and staid there about ten minutes. Mr. Cousins not coming home, I wanted to go of an errand, and being uneasy leaving a stranger in the chambers, I sat on the garret stairs, and on hearing the chamber door go gently, I looked over the bannisters, and saw the prisoner come out of the door with a great bundle under his arm, I immediately ran down stairs after him, and called out stop thief as quick as possible, he dropped the clothes he had under his arms on the last stair case, I immediately stepped over the clothes and followed him through the Inn, and called out stop thief, he was stopped by some gentlemen, who brought him back, he was searched, and these things were found upon him, two shirts, four cravats, they were taken out of his pocket, he was immediately taken to Bow Street. When I pursued the prisoner, I never lost sight of him until he was taken.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PHILLIPS. I am a laundress at Clements Inn. I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran out of my room, and on the second pair of stairs I picked up these clothes.</p>

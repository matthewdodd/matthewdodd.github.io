                  </hi>. I am the wife of the prisoner Turner—we were married on 2d February, 1859—we lived a short time together, and I have been living separate from him—the last time he visited me was three months ago—on Sunday, 28th August, he left me and returned on Monday at 4 o'clock—Keefe was with him—when he came, he knocked; I opened the door and he came into my room after a little time; they both came in my room together—my husband asked me if I had been to the counting-house—I said, "No"—he said, I had been to the counting-house—I got in a passion with him—I did not strike him, I pushed him against the wall—he said no more to me—he went out and returned between 7 and 8 in the evening—he asked me to go for a pot of beer—I refused, but I fetched it at last in a quart pot—my husband and Keefe drank it; I drank out of the pot—they drank out of one tumbler—they were sitting on two chairs with their backs to the bed—I did not watch them all the time—I went for a candlestick and it had no candle in it, and I sent my niece for a candle—there was another child there, Mrs. Tane's little girl, and my husband gave her some money to go for some sweets—after that my husband and Keefe went away suddenly, without saying anything—after the children returned Mrs. Tane came in—there was then about one third part of a glass of beer in the tumbler—there was no beer in the pot—when Mrs. Tane came in, she drank some of that beer in the glass—I offered her a drink of beer and she drank some, and said it was very sweet—I took and drank what she left, and I felt as if I were losing my senses—I took and smoked a pipe full of tobacco, and I vomited—I afterwards went to a surgeon, Mr. Shewell—I then went to Mr. Tane's—I then returned home and found some white powder on the floor where Keefe had sat—I collected up what I could of it and took it to Mr. Shewell's—I afterwards gave it the policeman.</p>

I am a surgeon at Kennington—these two women came to my place on the evening of 29th August—they told me they had been sick—I did not think it necessary to give them anything—this powder in this glass and in the paper, is sugar of lead—it is a poison if given in large quantities—the popular idea is that it is more poisonous than it is—it is difficult to say what quantity there was—I should think the portion was about two drachms—it would not dissolve very quickly—I cannot tell what the quantity was.</p>

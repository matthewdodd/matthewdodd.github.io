               <p>Prisoner. Whether you knew me by the name of Plunket? - Yes, I did, because Miller's wife had told me that was his name. I had seen him several times, and therefore knew the man very well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you did not make some overtures for making it up? - No; I did not; the wife of Miller came and offered me money to keep out of the way, which I refused.</p>

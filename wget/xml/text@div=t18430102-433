                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's shop in Upper-street, Islington. On the evening of the 26th of Dec, I was in the room adjoining my shop—the prisoner and a companion came into the shop, and asked for a Christmas-box—he or the other represented themselves as dustmen—my wife refused them—one of them said, "Why, mistress, it is Christmas time, a few half<lb></lb>pence we shall be satisfied with"—I said, "I am sure you are no dustmen, go about your business, I have nothing for you"—the prisoner turned round, and the way in which he was leaving the shop excited my suspicion—he said to his companion, "Come along, they won't give us any thing," and on looking at the place where two parcels of tobacco were, I missed one of them—there were six ounces made up into thirty-six papers—I went out, and overtook the prisoner within fifty yards of the shop in the road—I collared him, and accused him of the robbery—he denied it—I saw the tobacco in his bosom—I took two of the papers out, and the rest he let fall in the road—a struggle ensued, he fell, got up, and ran away—I ran after him, calling assist<lb></lb>ance—he was stopped by another person—I gave him to a policeman, and he was taken to the station—his companion escaped—Lawrence brought some more of the papers to the station.</p>

            . I live at Lambeth; my wife is in a lunatic asylum at Peckham, for which I pay the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, 9s. a week. On the 7th of July I received a note from Mr. Wilks, saying he was desired to apply to me for the arrears of my money: and on the 10th of July, after tea, from half-past five to six o'clock, I sent by my nephew two sovereigns, to the best of my recollection - it was 2l.; I said to him, "Bill, take this over to the workhouse, and make haste back;" he returned between seven and eight o'clock, and said he had delivered the two sovereigns at the gate.</p>

On the 17th of July the prisoner came to me, and said he came to give himself up, and he supposed I had heard what he had done - I said I had heard he had done wrong, but I did not know to what amount; he said to the extent of 40s. - he said he was sorry for what he had done, and he was a fool for it.</p>

               <p>William Clark. On the 27th of November last I lost a brass candlestick, a pot-lid, and a stew-pan</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Clark. I have a witness here that stop'd the pot-lid. When the prisoner was taken up, he said he knew nothing about the things; but before the justice he acknowledged the taking of them.</p>

            . The prisoner came to me to sell this pot-lid ( holding one in his hand.) I suspected it to have been stolen, and stop'd it. He said he found it in a dust hole.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Frankline. I don't know the day of the month. It was about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When did you lose this pot lid ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not come into the house where I live, till old Michaelmas day, and I lost the things about three week after.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Deadley. The prisoner's wife brought a stew-pan and candlesticks to me, and I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her for them ?</p>
               <p>M. Dindes. I gave her one shilling and six-pence. Before the justice I heard the prisoner say he sent his wife with them.</p>
               <p>William Corner. I am a constable. Last Sunday was seven night, at night, Mr. Clark's wife brought me a warrant to take up the prisoner at the bar. I did so, and took him before the justice; but he would not confess. The justice committed him for farther examination. On the Monday I had a search warrant. I went to the house of the last evidence, and found the stewpan and candlestick, and brought them before the justice; where the prisoner's wife said, her husband sent her with them to sell, and at last the prisoner confessed he took them.</p>

               <p>I never was before a justice of the peace in my life. I had lived in the house of the prosecutor, and found these things lying upon the stairs there.</p>

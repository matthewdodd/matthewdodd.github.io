I cried out, and the other two men came up in a minute's time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the prisoners the two?</p>
               <p>Nutt. I am sure Simpson is one; the other two held me, and scratched my face, while Simpson took two guineas, a half guinea, and a quarter of a guinea, and two rings (which were in a little box) and a small penknife, out of my pocket, and they took a brisket piece of beef out of my basket; they blinded my eyes; I believe it was Turner that held my mouth and blinded my eyes; I am not sure as to him; he said twice he would cut my throat if I made any noise or made the least resistance; I did call out once or twice, but there happened to be no one passing. I knew Turner by his jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all you know him by?</p>
               <p>Nutt. Yes; I never saw him in my life that I know of before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether he had his hair or a wig?</p>
               <p>Nutt. He had his hair. I could see but very little of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see enough of his face to be able to swear to him?</p>
               <p>Nutt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know him by nothing but his jacket?</p>
               <p>Nutt. His jacket was the principal thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat had he?</p>
               <p>Nutt. Really I cannot say, I believe a small one; I do not know what they call the hats now there are so many sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>
               <p>Nutt. On Thursday morning the 29th. I was robbed on Tuesday the 27th; I saw them the Wednesday after they were taken at Sir

               <p>Nutt. One of the others were shorter; I said one had a kind of a drab coloured coat: He came before Sir John in a waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoners are the people that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Graham. Yes. I have seen them very often in Westminster; I could see their faces; I am as sure that these are the persons as ever I was of any man. I got hold of one of them, Humphreys the accomplice, and struggled with him some time, hoping somebody would come up. I struggled with him some time, but not having any relief, I apprehended it might be dangerous, so I let him go. I went home, and by the advice of my friends, I went that very night to Sir

            . Turner, Simpson, and I, robbed the prosecutor; Simpson picked his pocket, Turner took his buckles out, and took his money; I don't rightly know what the money was; I had part of six and six-pence and five-pence halfpenny; there was some linen which we threw away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you throw it away?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Because we found it was good for nothing; and we took a bottle of vinegar.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Was you robbed of any vinegar?</p>
               <p>Graham. Yes.</p>
               <p>Humphreys. We threw the buckles out at a window and a girl picked them up, and I heard, her say she sold them to a Jew in the street.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. A bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with these men?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Not long, only by drinking a night or two with them.</p>

               <p>Humphreys. Nothing happened, only he and I had a bit of a skirmish; he wanted to take me and I would not let him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoners use to lye at night?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. In the Ambury, at Westminster; we lay at Mrs. Ashley's house the night we were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Fisher's there?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Yes.</p>

               <p>Humphreys. Yes; we were all taken together.</p>

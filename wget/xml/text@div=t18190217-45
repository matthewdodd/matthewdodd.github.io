            . I live in Baham-street, Camden-town; the prisoner lived in a cottage at Hampstead. I have had two relations under my care for some years, named Emily and 
               <persName id="t18190217-45-person485">
                  Eliza

            . In the early part of November Eliza left my house; I afterwards found she was at the prisoner's house, and I went to him on the subject. I asked him if he had made the young lady his wife? - he made a bow, but said nothing. I asked him again - he said he was not accustomed to answer questions put to him in that kind of way. I then appealed to Eliza, who was present, and asked her if she had been in that house ever since she left mine, which was about ten days; she cried a great deal, and said she had. I said</p>
               <p>"Are you married?" She was going to answer me, but looked at the prisoner, and he said,</p>
               <p>"You must ask me any questions you have to ask." I then told her she had left her home, and was gone into the paths of wretchedness and misery, and that the villain who had now got her, would keep her a few months, and then return her upon my hands - she was then just turned sixteen years of age. I then told the prisoner he had been the means of making two unfortunate orphans completely unhappy, in separating them in this kind of way, and requested her immediately to leave the villain; she still cried, and said I cannot leave him. The prisoner observed that it was impossible for me to say that they were not married, and that no one should put their feet between Eliza and him. I requested her again to leave him and go home with me, telling her, that as long as I had a home it should be her's, while she remained in the paths of virtue - I was very warm. The prisoner arose, and seemed to put himself in a posture of defence between her and me - I suppose he thought I was going to take her away. He said,</p>
               <p>"If you get her away, I will be the death of you;" and that he would give me satisfaction at any time, or any other gentleman that would come to him. I thought he might mean money, and told him money would be no satisfaction to me, and I disdained his purse; he said sneeringly,</p>
               <p>"I have no purse, I keep my money in my pocket." He pointed to the door, and said he did not wish to see me, and he was sure Eliza did not. He then said he felt for Emily, her sister and that she might be under his roof with Eliza, and then the sisters could be comfortable together; he made a great many promises to Emily, who was with me, that he would be her father and protector, and that he would give every satisfactory answer to her if I would leave the room. I went out, leaving Emily there, and he said I should not come in again. Emily soon after joined me, and we went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Eliza come home after this - A. Yes, on Monday, I think, and remained till the Sunday week following, which was twelve days. The day after she returned I heard that he had called, and promised her any recompence. I went to him, and asked him if he would marry her? for nothing else would be a compensation for the injury done; he said he could not marry, for he was under a 600 l. bond not to marry, and that he never intended, nor ever would marry her. I told him her father was a man as high in rank as himself, under his Majesty, and that the young ladies had been brought up quite different to what he imagined, seeing them in an humble situation with me. Her father was a purser in the Navy. He then said he could not be accountable for his conduct in seducing her, for if it was the daughter of the Prince Regent, or the first Lord of the Admiralty, it would be the same thing to him - nothing more particular passed; Eliza left me again in about twelve days. I requested Fleet to go with Emily to his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The prisoner offered no violence to you - A No; he said if I got her away he would be the death of me - he was an officer, and has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170030"></xptr>lost a leg and an arm. I am a married man. I told the prisoner the young women were relations of mine.</p>

            . I have a sister named Eliza, we lived together with Mr. Gittens. In consequence of Eliza going away, I went with Mr. Gittens to the prisoner's cottage, and saw her with him. There was some conversation between the prisoner and Mr. Gittens, after which he left the room. The prisoner then desired me to take a chair, and said he would tell me the particulars, and not to make myself uneasy; I asked him if he had married my sister? he smiled, and asked me if I did not think it equally solemn to be married in that house, as to go to church? I said certainly, if by a proper person; he said soldiers never went to church to be married - nothing more particular passed; I went out, and went home with Mr. Gittens.</p>
               <p>Q. After your sister returned, and went away again, did you miss any thing - A. I missed a letter, and went with Fleet to the prisoner's cottage about half-past six o'clock in the evening; I knocked at the door, and heard Captain Royal say he would answer the door himself; he requested to know who was there. I said my name was Neysmith; he said he did not know such a name or such a person. I said I had merely come for a letter, which my sister had taken away in her box, as I supposed, by mistake. He said my sister was gone to Dover, and he had got no letter of mine. He asked me if I was alone? I said yes, in hopes I should obtain the letter, upon which Fleet said,</p>
               <p>"No - she is not alone." The prisoner immediately said,</p>
               <p>"It is that villiain Gittens, I will shoot him, and send him home without a leg, or a wing." I said it was not Gittens - it was Fleet. He said Fleet or Gittens he did not care for he would shoot them, or twenty more. I heard him go up stairs, and call for his pistols - he opened the window, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now I am ready," put the pistol out of the window and fired - I was at the door; it was not fired towards me - Fleet was by the garden railings. He called for more powder and ball, came down, and said if I did not go from the door, he would pepper me also - I went away very much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Fleet was never at the prisoner's before - A. No, he merely went to protect me. The letter I wanted, entitled me and my sister to a small pension - I do not suppose he meant to injure me.</p>

             to the prisoner's house, she has spoken correctly; she said she was alone - I said I was with her. He said</p>

               <p>"D - n Fleet, or Gittens, or twenty more, I will shoot them," and called for his pistols; he went up stairs, and I went to the footpath. He opened the window, fired, and said,</p>
               <p>"Did that touch you - if not I have another that will" - I could not see in what direction it was pointed; there was a loud report - I heard no noise of ball.</p>
               <p>COURT. The conduct of the prisoner is certainly very improper, but this case does not come within the meaning of the Act.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Brewhouse Lane, Greenwich, and am a coal porter—in the morning or midnight of the 17th July, I was standing in Billingsgate Dock, talking to a young woman, named Elizabeth Hudson, when both the prisoners came down the street, one on the path and the other in the middle of the road, when Strodt indecently insulted the young woman, and Oltaus called her a b——whore—the young <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> turned round and asked him what he called her that for, and then he insulted her by calling her so again—I asked him why he insulted the young woman, and he made use of the same expression to me—I asked him why he did so, and he come behind and kicks me off the path, which caused me to fall on my back, and Strodt jumped on my stomach—I laid there two or three minutes till I gathered myself up again—Oltaus jumped down and struck me, and I struck him and knocked him down—both of them were on at me—I struck them as long as could for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, when I felt a knife plunged into my back by Oltaus—I hit on to them till they dragged me 20 or 30 yards, when I fell down from loss of blood, and I think Tasked the female to take off my coat—I became insensible, and they made their escape—I was taken to. The Seaman's Hospital—I still feel the effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was well enough to appear before the Magistrate on the morning of the 19th—I stopped at the hospital for three or four days there had been a regatta or race on on the 17th, and I had not been to my work, but had taken part in it—I had not been successful in the match—there had been a little dancing and that sort of thing going on—I was suber—there was a little liquor going on—in the thoroughfare where</p>

               <p>this occurred there is the dock wall on one side, and houses on the other—I had been chatting with Hudson about a quarter of an hour—I had not known her before, merely picked her up for the night—I tossed up whether I should go home with her or not, and I was not to go home with her—I had not called out to her to give me my b——cap—there had been no dis-pute between us about a cap—some shingle was thrown up there—I had not retired with Hudson inside the gate close there—it is not the fact that Oltaus went inside for natural purposes, leaving Strodt outside, and that while he was waiting for his companion, Hudson went up and accosted him, and that he not being able to answer in English, she became a little bit rude to him—I struck Oltaus violently in the face after I got up from being kicked—we scuffled up and down the road for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—he did not go up against the gates leading to Mr. Noakes' yard, or Mr. Allen's yard—I know the gates—I do not remember knocking his head against the wall, and his crying out "Oh, my poor head"—there is a gate into Mr. Wood's yard, but we were not up there—it is not protected with iron spikes—it is 10 yards too far up—I have been bred and born there—I have been in custody for having goods in my possession twice, and had seven days and two months, I believe—one was about some wood belonging to a gentleman named Andrews, and the other a little coal stolen from a barge in the Thames—I was locked up on suspicion—I have not been before the Magistrate on a charge of assault—my father gave me a month once for enlisting as a soldier—I might, after he knifed me, have run after them and said "Let me get at them, let me return it"—I don't remember following up and shouting out "Oh, you have got a stone in your hand" and their stopping and showing me they had no weapon in their hands—I don't know where the German ship Europa was lying that night—the road leads down to the Billingsgate Dock.</p>

I am single, and live at 3, Arthur's Row, Greenwich—I remember talking to the prosecutor about midnight, on the 17th July, and seeing the two prisoners—Strodt was in the road, and the other was on the path, and he went to make water, to tell you the truth, and began to behave indecently—I said You might go round the corner, not stand before a young <hi rend="italic">lady</hi>"—they asked me who I was talking to, and Oltaus called me a b——whore, and then Mr. Dyett turned round, and said "Who are you insulting?" and Oltaus turned round and knocked him in the road, and Strodt jumped on his stomach—upon my screaming, the other witnesses came up, and because I screamed Strodt knocked me in the mouth with the handle of a knife, and one tooth broke off and another went down my throat—I called out "Murder! help!" and the police came—I. heard Mr. Dyett say "I am stabbed, I am a dead man"—he was bleeding when the police came up, and he said to the other witnesses "Take off my coat"—the police took him into their charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known Dyett before this for some time, and had keen with him ever since 3 o'clock that afternoon—I don't know of any arrangement or tossing up as to whether we should spend the night together—it is not the fact that one prisoner went inside the dock wall and left the other outside, and that I addressed him, and that in consequence of his not being able to answer me, the elder prisoner came out and stood waiting there for him—when we were together the struggle took place—it was about 11.40 when they first came up—it was about the time we came out the Music Hall together—it lasted till about 11.30.</p>

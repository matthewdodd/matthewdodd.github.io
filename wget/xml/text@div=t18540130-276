                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live in Dudley-street, St. Giles's. About half-past 9 o'clock in the evening, on 4th Jan., two foreigners came in my shop—the prisoner was one of them—the other man bought a hat—I served him, and he paid for it—the prisoner was behind him, trying on hats, and while I was serving him, the prisoner went out of the shop—when I had served the other man I missed a hat from the counter—it was a second-hand black hat—I went after the prisoner the moment I missed it—I overtook him, and found him with my hat on his head, and his own <hi rend="italic">wide-awake</hi> hat under his arm—I charged him with taking my hat, and he knocked me down, and ran away—in running he threw my hat away, and put his own on again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> My countryman bought two hats; I was coining back to your shop. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, he was not, he was on the other side, going the con<lb></lb>trary way—he did not run before I came up to him, but after I charged him with the robbery, he knocked me down, and ran away.</p>

I saw the prisoner running up White Lion-street—I pursued, and took him in St. Andrew-street—I did not lose sight of him—I saw him throw this hat out of his hand, and put his own on his head—Mr. Collins picked his hat up, and gave it me—this is it—the prisoner resisted, and got away once.</p>

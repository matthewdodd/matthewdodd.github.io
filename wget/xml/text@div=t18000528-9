               <p>Q. Was it light, or dark? - A. It was rather light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see a man's face? - A. Yes; I could see a man's face very plain, and likewise the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that by moon-light? - A. I did not observe whether it was moon-light or not; I unlocked the bed-room door and went into the kitchen, which is up one pair of stairs, and looked out at the window; I saw a man lying upon the ground between two watchmen, that was the prisoner, Williams; I immediately went into the bed-room again, put on my small clothes, and came down into the tap-room; I ran against the bar-door, which I found open, I found the outer door upon the spring-lock; I opened that and went out into the street; I had bolted that door with two bolts, I found the bolts undone, but not the spring-lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you conceive that that door had been opened? - A. I cannot say; I went into the street, and was informed that Williams was one of the thieves; I desired him to be taken to the watch-house, which they did; he said he had lost a shilling, I saw a shilling lay, and some halfpence, and I picked them up and gave them to him myself; I did not go to the watch-house, but went home; there is a door in a gateway under my club-room, I found that door unchained, and unbolted, not even upon the latch, I saw it chined and bolted over night as usual; the door that is at the top of the cellar-stairs had been broke open, the lock was inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that door you think must have been opened from the inside? - A. Yes; (produces the lock); I found the lock forced off, and lying upon the tap-room floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then some person or other, by breaking open this door, got into your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that door locked over night? - A. Yes, it was; and the key in my till in the bed-room; I did not miss any thing; a neighbour brought a light to me, he is a baker, his name is Freeman; there was an iron crow found in the gateway, a dark lantern, and a little bottle, and matches; they were found close upon the spot where the man laid upon his back.</p>

             sworn. - At half past two o'clock on Thursday, the 14th of May, I left the watch-house to go to bed; as I was coming down Water-lane, past Hughes's-court, I saw a man standing at Mr. Williamson's back-door; when I saw him at that hour in the morning, it led me to a suspicion that he had no right to stand there; I rushed in to see what he wanted, and he ran off immediately; I do not know who the man was, he was twenty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280020"></xptr>panes from me, the first time I saw him; when I came to the back-door of Mr. Williamson's house, I put my hand to the door, and the door went in, by that means I discovered a light at my right-hand, I stood upon the threshold of the door; it was a dark-lantern and had a candle in it; I looked round and saw the two prisoners at the bar, and one more; Newman had his hand upon a drawer in the bar, pulling it out; there were three of them in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the two prisoners are the men? - A. I am; I saw Newman take a paper that was tied up, I do not know what it contained; I was looking at them for four or five minutes before I went in, I did not see what he did with the paper; when I saw that, I shut the door in order to keep them in; I asked them what business they had there; Newman told me he would tell me; after he made that reply, he came out of the bar, and when I had an opportunity I struck at him with a stick, I am sure I struck him; and it was but a very short time before he returned the blow, and I received it upon my arm; after I had got the blow, I went back to the door again, and endeavoured to spring the rattle but I could not, they prevented me; they struck at me; at this time we were in the dark, they forcibly opened the door and rushed out; another watchman was coming round upon his beat, and he was pretty near the door when they rushed out, his name is Harrison, he secured the prisoner, Williams; I heard him sing out, I was inside at that time, that he had one of them, and I saw Williams struggling with Harrison; I struck at him with a stick two or three times, to prevent his getting away; as to Newman, I saw no more of him till I saw him a prisoner in Castle-Baynard watch-house, I believe it was about fifteen or twenty minutes afterwards; I was sent for by the constable to see if I knew him, and when I came to the watch-house, as soon as ever I saw him, I told the officer of the night that he was the very man that struck me in the public-house; at that time he was in a gore of blood; I am sure he is the same man that I saw in the bar.</p>

               <p>Williams. He said, at the watch-house, that the man was a big stout man.</p>
               <p>Witness. I said no such thing; I said he was a stouter man than Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only the light of this lantern in the bar, are you sure there was light enough for you to be able to say these were the same persons? - A. Yes; I stood looking at them for some time, and they moved the lantern about round the bar to see what they could find; I saw them very clearly.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there light enough at that time to see a person's face? - A. Yes, it was quite light; I heard some noise in the house, which made me stop to know what it was, because I knew the family, had been gone to bed some hours; the door was open, and the first man that came out was Williams; we had a long scuffle together, at last I got him down, and there I held him upon his back till I got assistance to take him to the watch-house; in the scuffle he dropped some of his money, which I gave him; I took him to Blackfriars watch-house, and from thence to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure Williams was one of the men that came out? - A. Yes, he came out at the door under the gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it under the gateway that you laid him upon his back? - A. No, that was in the front of the house, in Water-lane; there were two more came out, but who they were I do not know.</p>

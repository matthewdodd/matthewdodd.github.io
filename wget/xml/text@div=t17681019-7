               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Dorril. I believe he lives about Whitecross-street, I do not know what he does for a living; he is a sort of a fighting man, one of the boxers; I found there was to have been a battle that morning, and he was to have been a second to one of them: he desired me to wait till he sent for one of his friends; I did wait six hours, but none came.</p>

On Friday morning, the 4th of July, I was alarmed by my servant, between six and seven o'clock, that the house had been broken open. I came down, and saw a square of glass had been taken out of the parlour window. The square was big enough for a middling sized man to get through, by which they had made their entrance; and they had broken the parlour door and made their entrance into the shop. I missed a dozen silk handkerchiefs, a waistcoat, a jacket, and a pair of pantaloons. There was about four pounds of cash in the till; that was also taken; that is not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the jacket - A. Six or seven shillings; the dozen handkerchiefs, two pounds ten shillings; the shoes, six shillings; the waistcoat, five shillings; and I lost a spotted handkercheif.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the spotted handkerchief - A. The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at that spotted handkerchief; do you know that - A. Yes, that was not one of the twelve handkerchiefs, it is a bundle-handkerchief, in which there were some things tied up on the counter; the twelve handkerchiefs were in one piece the spotted handkerchief is my property; it was part of the property that I missed at the time I am speaking of.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended Marks, and from Marks's information I apprehended the prisoner. The first thing I found on the prisoner was chisel, concealed inside of his trowsers. This was on the 7th of July. And this spotted handkerchief was round the prisoner's neck. I also found a knife upon him, and a pocketbook.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that they were his lodgings - A. The prisoner told me they were his lodgings. He spoke tolerable English then. I had been there in the course of the day before, and the girl that he lived with told me that he lodged there, but he was not at home. I went there again after I confined the prisoner, and found a new shirt, and a pair of trowsers. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That shirt and trowsers belonged to my son. I had seen them in the shop two days before they were taken away.</p>

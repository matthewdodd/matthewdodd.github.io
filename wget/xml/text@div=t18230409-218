I left my watch on the chimney-piece in the bed-room; we took the prisoner in out of charity! he went to school with me; he slept with me; we went to bed about eleven o'clock, and when I awoke about eight next morning, he was gone. I missed my watch, and afterwards found it in pawn; he was taken on the 7th of March; he said if I would go to Piccadilly with him. he would give me the money; I went as far as Fulham he then gave me the duplicate.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Dobree, a pawnbroker. On the 15th of January, about half past eight o'clock in the morning; I took this watch in pawn of the prisoner for 17 s.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I made a ship in miniature, and sold it to the prosecutor for 25 s., he paid me 5 s. I wanted to go into the country, and I asked the prosecutor for the rest; he would not give it me; his sister suggested that I should pawn his watch; I did so, and gave him the duplicate; he returned it to me, saying it was useless to him. He walked with me as far as Hammersmith, I returned in three days and drank tea with him; he said nothing. I was apprehended about a week after, and the prosecutor desired the the officer to let me go; he did so, and I visited him for a month after.</p>
               <p>E. G. PAPWORTH. He came to the house two or three times after the watch was taken. He gave me the duplicate when my sister was with me.</p>

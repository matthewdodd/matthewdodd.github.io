               <p>Q. Where were you at that time - A. I was in my room; it was near twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your bed-room - A. Yes; at the Fox. First I heard a noise at the door. I had been a-bed three quarters of an hour. The master gave me orders to let a man sleep with me, that he had given leave; the prisoners forced themselves in after I had let the man in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master gone when the prisoners forced themselves in - A. My master was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man to sleep with you - A. A coachman. When the prisoners came in the coachman flung himself on my bed; and Mackdonald flung himself upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mackdonald before - A. Yes; he had slept in the room above me four months or better.</p>

               <p>Q. Mackdonald threw himself upon you - A. Yes; and Smith himself upon him. They put the bolster near my face, and they used me ill.</p>
               <p>Q. In what respect - A. With their hands, beating me on my side. I took a stick to defend myself; they took it away from me the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing away from you - A. My watch, and my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your watch - A. Under my head under the bolster. My purse was in my left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not any of your clothes on I suppose - A. No; only my shirt. They turned out the room the minute I missed the watch. I felt for it; I could not find it. I got a light, and could not find it then. I dressed myself and went into the street, and got the officer of the night; they came in and searched. My purse was found in Mackdonald's hat, and the watch was found in the yard, hid under an ale-barrel. I was present when the purse was found in Mackdonald's hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was there in your purse - A. There was no money in it. I had no money about me that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Smith and Mackdonald before very well, did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came into your room, was there a light with them or not - A. They brought a light with them.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you had a full opportunity of seeing who they were - A. Yes; they lodged in the room over me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any quarrel between you and them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they lodged in the room over you - A. Smith had lodged there about three weeks, and Mackdonald about four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing while they were in your room, that they had got your watch and your purse - A. No; they turned out, and took the light with them, and stopped in the landing place.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, after leaving your room, they went up into the room above, did they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the coachman's name - A. I do not know his name; he is not here.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160052"></xptr> Q. Was there any body besides you and the coachman in the room -

            , who slept in the next bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this happened was it that you found your watch - A. An hour. The officer and the watch found it in the yard, hid.</p>
               <p>Q. After Smith and Mackdonald went out of the room, did they go down stairs - A. I heard one of them go down. They stopped on the landing place some time, and then I heard one of them go down stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. After they tumbled you about in this odd way, you say they went to their room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure that Smith was one of the two - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it after Mackdonald got the pillow over your mouth, did he get your watch - A. As soon as Smith threw himself upon him, in about a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you call your master as soon as he had got your watch - A. I did not think they meaned any harm.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mackdonald first threw himself upon you, you say he struck you - A. Yes, he struck me violently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mackdonald struck you, that was before Smith threw himself upon Mackdonald - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mackdonald struck you with the violence that you have mentioned, you could not suppose that he meaned no harm; why did not you cry out then - A. I tried to assist myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mackdonald threw himself upon you, and Smith upon him, where was the candle - A. The candle was alight; it stood upon the table. He put the candle down before he threw himself upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many blows did Mackdonald strike before Smith came upon him - A. He struck me twice; they were more than small blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Smith and you any words - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mackdonald and you any words - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in liquor - A. They had been drinking a small quantity; I had been in the room to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing passed between them and you in the room - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They had not been joking with you at all had they - A. No.</p>

            . Q. Did you sleep in the same room with Brown - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember somebody knocking at the door - A. Yes; Brown opened the door after the master ordered it. The master said, Brown open the door, and let the man come in and sleep with you. Mackdonald then came in, and the other coachman. There were three came in in all; the third man was Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Mackdonald and Smith before, did not you - A. No; I was quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remark the persons of Smith and Mackdonald in such a way, so as to be sure that Mackdonald and Smith were two of the persons that came in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came in, did either of them bring a light - A.Mackdonald brought the light. The coachman threw himself down on the bed without undressing. Mackdonald set the candle down. He threw himself three or four times on Brown; then he took up the bolster and throwed it on Brown's face. Brown begged him to leave the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blows - A. I saw Mackdonald strike Brown with his fist. I thought it was in fun; I being a stranger I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mackdonald had struck him several times, you say, he took the bolster and put it on Brown's face - A. Yes; and Smith threw Mackdonald upon Brown, and threw himself upon him; that was after Mackdonald put the bolster on Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue there - A. Five or six minutes; and when they went away, Mackdonald said, Brown have you any candle. I begged them to leave the room.</p>

               <p>Q. What did Brown do upon this - A. Brown got out of bed, and struck a light. I saw him searching for his property. He got up and endeavoured to get a watchman; when he got the watchman, he then got the master of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Mackdonald and Smith using Brown in this way, why did not you call the master - A. I being a stranger, thought it might be fun. I begged him to leave the room.</p>

            . I keep the Fox public-house, Islington. On Sunday night, the 30th of August, I lit one of the prisoners and the man Brown, out in the yard to go to bed. The stairs that leads to their apartment has no concern with the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You lit Mackdonald and the coachman out into the yard, that they might go into their apartment - A. Yes; Smith went out before. In about half an hour I bolted the passage door; I and my wife and family we went to bed. We had not been in bed half an hour; we heard three going up stairs, and in about five minutes they returned down stairs. Mackdonald, Smith, and Stockings, (it is a nick name) they returned down stairs; saying, that Brown would not open the door to let him sleep with him. I saw Smith and Mackdonald on the stairs. I called to Brown twice, to open the door, from the landing place; he opened the door. I said to Smith and Mackdonald, whatever you do, do not go into his room. I said, that is the reason he would not open the door for the man that was to sleep with him; because you were near the door. Mackdonald was in the habit of using Brown ill; I had seen him do it frequently. I then went to bed, and bolted the passage door. In the course of an hour I went to sleep; I was awoke again by a knocking at the door. I got out of bed and opened the passage door; there I saw the constable of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160053"></xptr> the night, and patrol, and watchman, standing with Brown on the staircase. I asked them, what was the matter. Brown said, they have now taken my watch from me. The prisoners were in bed at that time. We went up and searched the premises; we found the purse in Mackdonald's hat. I put on my things, and went up stairs. I said, Mackdonald, rise yourself, what have you been about; he said, nothing. I said, you have, and you are sensible of it. I asked Mackdonald, where was Brown's watch. He said, he knew nothing of it. Then said I, how came Brown's purse in your hat. He said, he knew nothing about the purse. I then said, how came you in his room, after I so strictly told you not to go; directly upon that, Brown came into the room with Mackdonald's hat. Mackdonald said, what do you want with my hat; you shall not have my hat. Directly the officer came up stairs, and secured him; and then called Smith. Smith got up without any abuse; the constable, patrol, and watchman, took them to the watch-house. They returned back again to search for the watch. I stopped on the stairs until they returned, to see that nobody went down stairs until they returned. We then proceeded up stairs, four of us, we searched all the rooms; we found nothing. In the yard, I saw the watch shine under an ale-barrel, which stood in the yard; the officer picked it up. Brown said, it was his watch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Arabin. Mackdonald had been accustomed to larking with Brown - A. Yes, and beating him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mackdonald was taken in custody in his room - A. On the landing place He was following Brown down stairs. His clothes were brought him; he was dressed on the stairs, and then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS IZZARD. I am a patrol, belonging to Bow-street office When I came into the room, Mackdonald and Smith were asleep. I awoke both of them. I told Mackdonald, Brown had lost his watch, and I insisted on having it. He made use of very profane language; saying, that he knew nothing about it; I might o to hell: he laid down again. I proceeded to search the soom; I said to Mackdonald, how came Brown purse in your hat. He said, he knew nothing of the bag, nor how it came there. Brown had not been near the hat before I found the bag. We took the two prisoners in custody. I went down stairs along with the constable of the night; we made Mackdonald dress himself on the landing place. He swore, d - n his eyes, if we took him to the watch-house; and if he did go, the first time he came out, he would murder Brown. After we had taken him to the watch-house, we came back again. We made a search. We afterwards found the watch. I have had the watch in my possession ever since. The prisoner, Smith, was very willing to go to the watch house; he never said a word. Mackdonald was very much out of humour.</p>

            . I am a constable. I and Izzard were together. I have heard his account, it is correct. I have nothing to add to it.</p>
               <p>Mackdonald's Defence. On the 30th of August, I was acting as waterman, at Seaman's house; there came a gentleman, he called for a dozen bottles of wine between some gentlemen, Smith, and me. Thomas Stockings, the post boy, came and asked to sleep there that night. Mrs. Seamen said, he might sleep with Brown. Mrs. Seaman said, as you are going up stairs, you can shew Stockings the way up. I went over to the Pied-bull; there Smith and me had two or three glasses of peppermint. Smith and I, when we came back, found Stockings standing on the stairs. I went down to Mr. Seaman; I said, he will not let the man in. Mr. Seaman called to Brown, to open the door. Brown opened the door, he had a mop-stick in his hand. He said, you shall not come in here. I said, I do not want. Stockings shoved my face against Brown's face; he threw himself on the bed. I said, give me my handkerchief; he picked up my handkerchief, and put it in my hat. I was charged to go to the watch-house. Brown came up stairs, he had my hat; I said, what do you want with my hat; they said, if I did not like to go to the watch-house dressed, I should go naked.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was in bed asleep. I was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to White. Brown opened the door for the coachman to come in - A. Yes.</p>

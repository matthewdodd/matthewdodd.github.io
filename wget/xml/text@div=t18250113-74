On the evening of the 8th of January, the prisoner came to my shop; he asked me for change of half-a-crown - I remarked him by a particular waistcoat he had on - I could not give him change, and he pulled the door too, and I turned to go into the parlour, but heard a noise in the shop; I returned, and saw him lying across the counter, with his hand in the till; as soon as he heard me he ran out; I looked to see if he had got the box, with the halfpence, and it was gone; I ran after him, and met Maybank, at the end of the street; in about half an hour the till was brought back by Mr. Maybank; it had some money in it - but I cannot say that it was all mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not say, you were not sure he was the man? A. Yes - I only noticed his waistcoat; he had the same waistcoat on at the Office.</p>

            . I am a constable. Between eight and nine o'clock, last Saturday night, I was in Sloane-street - I saw the prosecutrix; she gave an alarm; I pursued the prisoner, who ran by me in a direction from Ellis-street. The prosecutrix then came out and said -</p>
               <p>"They have got my till." I pursued the prisoner down Sloane-street. I found the till, with part of the copper, and the remainder in his waistcoat pocket. I then took the till to the shop. The prosecutrix said it was her's; the waistcoat was a fustian one, with pearl buttons in the front.</p>
               <p>(Till produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to the Woodman, public-house, and got a pint of beer. I afterwards saw a young man place this box against a plumber's-shop - I took it up, and went down Sloane-street.</p>

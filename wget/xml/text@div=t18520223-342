                  </hi>. I live at Seymour-cottage, Newington; I am a widow. I lived with the prisoner, who is my son; he is a coppersmith's porter; he has supported me for many years—on Sunday, 25th Jan., between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning, I was sitting up in my room—my son came into the room, and cut me across my neck—I felt the blood come from my neck—I said, "John, what are you doing?"—he did not make me any answer; he got up, and ran away, and said he had murdered his mother—I did not see anything in his hand—he was rather queer in his mind—I can assign no reason for his having done this—there had been no quarrel—he had been rather flighty lately.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Mrs. Iliff, in her room, on Sunday, 25th Jan.; I had occasion to leave the room for about five minutes, about five or ten minutes before 10 o'clock—when I returned to the room the clock was on the strike—I saw the prisoner turn from his mother, and the blood running from her throat—I did not notice that the prisoner had anything in his hand—but after he had gone out of the house, when he was between the door and the gate, I saw a razor in his hand—he said, "I have killed her; she will soon be dead"—I saw the razor drop from his hand—I have observed that his manner has been siugular—one evening I was sitting there, and he jumped up and opened the window and the shutters; and then returned and shut them again—I asked what he did it for—he rubbed his head, and said his head was in a confused state—his behaviour to his mother was very kind and affectionate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house with the prisoner. On 25th Jan., about 10 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Murder!"—I ran from my kitchen, through my parlour, into the garden—I there saw the prisoner brandishing a white-handled razor—he said, "I have done it; I have done it, Mr. Read?"—he made his way towards Horsemonger-lane Gaol—I took up the razor, and went in and held Mrs. lliff till the medical gentleman came—I have koown the prisoner four years—I have repeatedly observed very strange ways with him, speaking of things that I was satisfied were far beyond his reach of doing—I did not believe his statements.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

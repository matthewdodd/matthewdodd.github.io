I understood that to be the money he had given her to pay the rent; she said, my dear Joe, do not kick me, nor beat me, for I did not spend it; he said, where is the woman's money, a number of times: you bloody bitch, I will knock your bloody liver out, and your bloody melt;

             and my wife were in my apartment at the same time, the partition between the rooms is only lath and plaister; I heard her fall down, and she shook my plates; Fox and my wife hallooed out to him; he gave some saucy answer; I told them to hold their tongues, that it was a customary affair; after that he went down stairs: I heard her moaning when I awaked at about three o'clock.</p>

               <p>Was she lying upon the bed to your opinion, at that time? - No, upon the floor behind the door; a woman came up in the morning, and a girl; I went in and put the deceased upon the bed, with her head against his legs; some hair was pulled off her head, and lay in various parts of the room.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the hair of her head? - The hair matched with her hair; I wanted her to speak, but she could not.</p>
               <p>How long before this beating had you seen the deceased? - In the morning of the day he beat her; she washed for a good many men, she was then about her business as usual; there appeared to be nothing the matter with her more than usual; she was no way ailing that I know of.</p>
               <p>How long had she lived with the prisoner? - I have heard him say four or five years; when I returned up stairs again on Christmas day, at about one o'clock, I saw her again; the prisoner was not in the room, she was upon the floor again, I lifted her upon the bed; she lay just at the back of the door, that we could hardly get in; the bed is near the door.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090041"></xptr>Do you think she slipt off? - No, I think she was not able to move; I think she must have been pushed off.</p>
               <p>Did you lift her up on the bed again? - Yes; she was as bad before; I did not not see any change in her; I observed upon the floor, blood and hair, and her cap; she lay without a cap, and was all bloody in her mouth, and all over her, and her hair all in strings clotted with blood or something.</p>
               <p>Was there blood upon the ground near where her head lay? - Yes, besides hair, and upon the chairs; she died I believe the day after.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I think you say she was a woman of a weak constitution? - She was a woman of a thin body.</p>
               <p>Sickly? - I never saw any sickliness.</p>
               <p>Did not she use to drink very hard? - She used to drink to be sure.</p>
               <p>Do you know what sort of liquor she used to drink; gin or beer? - She might drink both.</p>
               <p>Did not she often get drunk? - I have seen her drunk, not very drunk; she was capable to come up to her own apartment, and do her business, as far as I saw.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she was drunk that evening? - For what I know she might.</p>
               <p>Had you seen her a little before that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she speak plain? - She did.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. When you took the woman up, and she lay near the door, and you put her in bed where this man lay, did she speak to you? - She would not speak a word.</p>
               <p>And you are sure she said, my Joe, do not kick me? - Yes, quite plain as I speak now; he said, d - n your eyes, you bitch, as I mentioned before.</p>

               <p>I am wife of the last witness, we lodge in the next room to the prisoner; I heard him say he wanted the money; that she had not paid it to Mrs. Carr, that is our landlady; he beat her and said he would cut her bloody life out, and her bloody melt out, and d - d her for a bloody bitch; she said nothing, but my dear Joe, pray don't, my dear Joe, don't; when he took her up and threw her down he shook the very tables in our room.</p>
               <p>Had you heard the blows or kicks before that time? - Yes, several times; then he went down stairs; I never heard her speak more, only she moaned: I called to him once or twice while he was beating her and begged for God's sake he would not beat her; he bid us be d - d and keep our own apartment. I heard nothing more pass that night, but I went down at about a quarter after seven in the morning; I told my landlord and landlady, that I did suppose Bull had killed his wife, for she lay in a deplorable condition; for I had opened my own door and saw her weltering in her blood, with her hair all about her ears; I did not open his door, she lay and moaned in such a manner it terrified me; that was Christmas day in the morning: the prisoner was out when I looked into the room, he did not come home till a man came for his shirt; I said to the man, I should be glad if you would go and fetch Bull home and take that poor woman off the ground; the prisoner came up along with him, and he gave the man his shirt; she was then lying upon the floor, and the prisoner took no notice at all of the body.</p>
               <p>Did any body speak to him about it? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Did your husband go in with you? - I was not there when he lifted her from the floor, my husband went in about nine or ten o'clock, I did not go in then; I saw her the next day, Tuesday morning, she would have spoke to me, but she could not: she died on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the deceased? - She had been there four or five months I believe.</p>
               <p>Was you intimate with her? - I am very seldom at home.</p>
               <p>I believe she used to get drunk very often? - I do not think she had wherewith to do it.</p>
               <p>Have not you frequently seen her drunk? - I have seen her intoxicated with liquor, but not to be drunk.</p>
               <p>Whenever she could get money to buy liquor she was? - When she got money for washing, he always took share of it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090042"></xptr>When the man came for his shirt Bull came back again voluntarily? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You desired the man that came for the shirt to fetch the prisoner, that he might take the poor woman off the ground? - He stept over her, and took no notice of her; he desired the man to appear if any thing should be wanting; and he said he would be greatly obliged to him, for the folks would think the bitch had killed herself with drinking of gin.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Did not she lay as you have frequently seen folks lay that are drunk? - I do not think that she was.</p>
               <p>Did you observe blood about? - Blood came from her nose and mouth, and there were several spots of blood about the room, and her hair was all over blood.</p>
               <p>Did you see her when she was put upon her bed? - I saw her in her bed, when my landlady had stripped her cloaths off upon Tuesday morning.</p>

               <p>She passed as his wife? - Yes; she turned her head to me as well as she was able, and made a noise, but could not speak; her face appeared bloody all over, and her hair all about; there were either three or four locks of hair upon the ground; and underneath the chair where she fat, there was a quantity of blood.</p>

               <p>Did you say any thing to him what you was going about? - I did not speak a word to him; but I am apt to think he heard me there; he did not stay ten minutes in the room after me; the constable came and went with me and

               <p>Was this before the woman was dead? - Yes; as soon as I returned, I went to see the deceased again; Doran had lifted the body upon the bed before I came: I got the overseer to come then, and the apothecary: the apothecary opened a vein, and she bled; he thought she would die; I thought possibly if I took her cloaths off she might survive: I was obliged to cut them off, and about her body there were a vast many marks, from her hands to each shoulder were marked; her hip was very black, and upon one side of her head.</p>
               <p>Did she speak afterwards? - She would have spoke if she could; I told her Joe was confined, she tried to speak, but could not: she died upon Tuesday between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon: Upon Christmas day I was called to see the deceased between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I called by chance upon the apothecary who attended her; he was going down along with the two overseers of the parish to see this woman; I found her speechless: I was informed of the manner in which she had been treated; I examined her I found she had three bruises upon her arm, that was all I saw that night; on the next morning I called again in order to see her, and I was then told that she had more bruises, two of which made their appearance then about her body, and I found an appearance just upon her hip; the skin was discoloured: I examined her head very closely then, in order to discover<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090044"></xptr> whether any wound was there upon her head, it being day light then; I did not find any wound on her head, I suspected there might be; then a man produced some hair that had been torn from her head: I found afterwards upon a strict examination, that the blood had come from her nose; I did not at that time find any place discoloured on the head, and I examined it very closely; I thought the wound that made its appearance might have come from a concussion of the brain or a fracture, and then blood would have come from the ears or mouth; I made a particular examination into that, and as I said before, I found it came from her nose; I did not see her afterwards till the coroner's jury fat, I attended then, and that part which appeared slightly bruised in the hip, made a great appearance; it was very large and much discoloured, there was no kind of wound, there will from a small bruise appear a great discolouration; there was no wound.</p>
               <p>Court. Might not some internal injury happen by a violent bruise of the external parts without any wound appearing? - It might, provided it had been in the abdomen, but this was upon the hip bone; I thought it would be necessary to examine the head further, and I observed a small slight mark or bruise just upon the temple, but so slight that it hardly made any kind of appearance.</p>
               <p>How long had she been dead then? - Two or three days, I believe; it was so trifling that I had not observed it before, though I closely examined it, till that night; I examined the side, but the only bruise she had was upon the hip; there was an account given the first day that I came, that her arm was broke; I examined it very closely then, and also before the jury; but it was not broke, it was greatly bruised indeed; I did observe to the people when I was first fetched, that the woman had been treated very ill, and I made no doubt but that she must die, for she was dying when I called.</p>
               <p>You have heard the account, that she was thrown down or fell down by blows with great violence upon the floor ; I do not find by their accounts that she ever rose from that fall: might not there be a concussion of the brain that did not shew itself in any external appearances by blood, either from the mouth or ears? - I had the honor to be brought up at Bartholomew's hospital, and have seen many concussions of the brain and fractured skulls; but I very seldom saw a concussion of the brain but some bad circumstances had followed, of a retching or the like, and I do not find that she retched.</p>
               <p>The witnesses never heard her stir from the place after she was knocked down, and she was found upon the spot where she was knocked down the next morning? - The blood I saw lay at the feet of the bed.</p>
               <p>From the consequence of being thrown down, never rising more, and being found the next morning speechless, should not you have concluded there must be some internal hurt that you could not perceive; was her head opened? - So slight was the bruise upon the part, that I never saw it till the coroner and we were coming away, and she had no bad symptoms to induce me to open it; I should certainly have opened it else, to see if there was any extravasated blood between the dura mater and the pia mater.</p>
               <p>Might not some shock have been received in these nice vessels? - In the hospitals we have opened the parts and known a concussion and fracture, and have not found any symptoms.</p>
               <p>Jury. The woman said she found her lying upon her forehead, the surgeon says it was upon her forehead? - Rather upon one side of her head.</p>

            . How was the woman lying when first you saw her in the morning? - She lay along upon the ground with her face upon her hand.</p>
               <p>To Mr. JARVIS. You have attended to the whole of this evidence; I take for granted this woman describes how she lay, how she fell as all mere suspicion: I should be glad to know whether you attribute her death to chance, to accident, or to violence? - Upon the examination of what I informed your lordship, concerning her arm and her hip, as these seemed to be the principal kind of bruises; her arm was very much bruised, yet I should not imagine that this could be the occasion of her death, because they are not in parts sufficient; had they been in the abdomen, or the stomach, it would have been different; we all know that broken arms do not occasion any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090045"></xptr> persons death without mortification; the bruise on the temple seeming in fact so slight and she not having had those symptoms that generally attend fractures and concussions of the brain, I cannot tell how far the brain might be injured.</p>
               <p>Court. As to what symptoms she had he went out and left her all night? - I only go by appearances.</p>
               <p>From what you observed of these external marks, you do not think that they could occasion her death so immediately? - No, had she received any wound any where in order to have traced to open the body, I could have been more certain, but as to bruises we seldom open at hospitals upon that account without symptoms of a concussion of the brain or a fracture.</p>
               <p>Mr. HARDING sworn.</p>
               <p>One of our overseers called upon me and took me with him to see the deceased upon Christmas day, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I found her upon the bed in her cloaths very cold; she had no cap on and was in a wretched condition, and I thought in a dying state; we endeavoured to make her speak, to acquaint me how she came to be in such a dreadful situation; she could not speak; I then asked for assistance to endeavour to bleed her, her arm was contracted and quite cold, and it was with the greatest difficulty I could extend it, it was cold and stiff; I took five or six ounces of blood from her; I then spoke to the overseer and wished that he would send for a little wine, that we might see if she could drink; he sent for it; it was with a great deal of difficulty that she swallowed about half a spoonful. I saw there was blood just by the door, not a great quantity, I suppose about a couple of ounces; then I examined her head to see if there was any rupture or bruise, if there had I should have sent immediately for a surgeon; but I found none, the blood I perceive had ran, as I take it, from her nose and had gone into her hair, and had stuck it to the side of her temple; I opened the cloaths; she was not undressed, she had a coarse apron on that was exceeding wet, and all her cloaths were wet and very damp; I bid the woman pull the wet things off, the overseer giving directions to have care taken of her: I left her for that time. Mr. Jarvis called upon me accidentally, I asked him to go with me to see this poor woman; he went with me, I found her much in the same situation I left her in; we were informed she had many bruises and was very much hurt; we examined and I did not perceive any bruises then, but upon the left hip, upon the arm, and upon the temple, all upon the left side; these contusions I thought did not appear sufficient to occasion her death.</p>

               <p>Did you see her after she was dead, before the coroner's inquest? - Her nose and upper lip had bruises as if she had either fell or had a blow upon them; Mr. Jarvis and I were both together before the coroner.</p>
               <p>You have heard Mr. Jarvis's account? - Yes, but I would observe one thing: one of the witnesses says her right arm was black; now that was a mistake of the evidence, for my bleeding her and tying her arm made it black; for it was not so when I bound it.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Would that cause a blackness from the finger's end to the shoulder? - I do not know that it was so; I do not know but it might, it was much swelled; I was obliged to untie it myself in the evening; the arm swelled from four o'clock till I came at eight at night.</p>
               <p>Court. You observe by the account, that she was knocked or beat down at seven o'clock on Sunday evening; that she was permitted to lye there all night upon the floor; do you impute the death to the violence and usage she received, taking the whole circumstances together? - If the woman had received no hurt I verily believe she would have been alive now.</p>
               <p>Do you mean if she had not been left in her wet cloaths all night upon the ground? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You think that an ingredient that might cause her death? - I verily believe her lying upon the floor in that situation was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>To Mr. JARVIS. What do you say to that? - I made an observation before, that I did not suppose the bruises that I had seen were the cause of her death; but I am afraid the ill treatment might.</p>
               <p>Therefore not having immediate assistance, you think the violence she received and the ill treatment, and leaving her in that situation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090046"></xptr> might occasion her death? - I should be sorry to say otherwise.</p>

               <p>Court to MILLER. Did I understand you right when you said it was about seven or eight when he went home to fetch onions? - It was between seven and eight when he came back, he lay along with me all night.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Nares, after very accurately summoning up the evidence to the Jury, concluded to the following purport:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen,</p>
               <p>The death of the poor woman is certain; the manner in which she has died you have heard the particulars of, and you are to determine upon the evidence, how far you think the prisoner at the bar has been the occasion of her death: I desire you not to let any acts of cruelty, which I am sorry to say, have appeared in the evidence, prejudice you against the prisoner at the bar; but to consider it coolly and dispassionately, and try from the whole of the evidence, whether you are satisfied in your mind and conscience, that the prisoner, under all the circumstances, has been the occasion of the woman's death. In order to from that judgment, you will consider, in the first place, what state of health she was in before this happened; the witnesses give you an account, she was what you would call a puny woman, a woman not of a robust constitution, as one of the witnesses, Mrs. Tudor, says she looked upon her to be very well, only she was not a woman of a strong constitution; but she saw her that day about her business, the others saw her that day, they heard no complaint whatever; and therefore to all appearance she was well till this fact happened: none of the witnesses saw the prisoner beat her; but you are to consider, under the circumstances, whether the evidence thus given, is not sufficient to satisfy you that he has beat her, and to what degree. Three people, (one a stranger, who happened to be in the next room, who knew neither the prisoner nor the deceased) all correspond in that account; they all of them tell you that they heard him beat her and kick her; they heard her thrown down, as they describe it, with violence; they all heard her expostulating with him, calling him her dear Joe, and entreating him, for God's sake, not to beat or kick her any more: the dispute, you see, arose, and the cause of his acting in that manner was, as far as we can find, imputed to her having spent the money he had given her to pay Mrs. Carr; the witnesses were asked whether she was supposed to be fuddled then or not; they say they did not see her, but she spoke plain. Mrs. Doran goes further still, and she says, hearing the cruel manner, as she apprehended, in which he was treating this woman, she called out to him and he damned her, and bid her mind her own business, and keep her own apartment; they all three swear that they never heard any thing more said after she fell down, and that he went down in a little time after; and now you find by the account of Miller, who seems to come as his friend in some respect, that after he had been home again, he came back to him and never returned all night; so that if she did receive violence, if he threw her down in this manner, if she never rose afterwards, he certainly went and left her in that state in which she was found on Monday morning; how she was found then the witnesses have told you, and I shall not repeat it: you hear then what evidence there is of violence, both the surgeon and apothecary, though they did not think the appearances of violence were such, that they themselves were immediately the cause of her death; yet they tell you they found her in a wretched condition; the apothecary says, her arms were almost stiff at the time he attempted to bleed her, and she was in a dying state when he first saw her: Mrs. Tudor tells you, she thought she was dying at the time she saw her, she never grew better, you observe, but worse and worse to the time of her death; and then the material thing to be considered is, as these bruises did not in themselves seem timport, any thing fatal from the external appearances of them, whether taking the whole transaction together, beating her in that manner, if you are satisfied he did do so, throwing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090048"></xptr> her down in that manner, if you are satisfied with the evidence respecting it; leaving her in that situation, never taking the least care in the world, which must all be taken as one transaction, was the occasion of her death; how it can be accounted for I shall not intimate, nor speak the least with respect to my own sentiments of the occasion; but you see a person very well before this happened, in a dying state, the very first time she was seen after it happened, you are to judge from thence whether it was or was not the occasion of her death: one thing does occur to me; that is, if he was satisfied from the violent beating, or ought to be satisfied from the violent beating she had received, from the violence she had received in throwing down, that she was in a state at least that deserved care and attention, or that something should be done for her, and went away and left her in that state without any care or attention, and by that means was, as the apothecary thinks, the occasion of her death; in point of law, taking the whole circumstances together, the acts that he did, and the omission of what he ought to have done are to be considered as one transaction, and if you are satisfied all together were the occasion of her death, he is guilty of the murder: if he had went away with a flight degree of injury that had been given her, from which there was no probability of any harm happening to her, and there was no negligence whatever or cruelty in leaving her in that condition and not attending to her; if you could think that, then perhaps, so much negligence is not to be imputed to that act as should be considered as an additional circumstance to make him guilty; I mean wilfully in his own mind of the occasion of it: I am sorry to annex to it an observation, that when he came the next day and was desired to take her up, he walked across the body and did not give her the least assistance; then if from thence you can inter an intention from the beginning of doing a mischief to her, you may be satisfied perhaps with respect to the whole of the transaction, as to the occasion of her death; however you will take it into consideration, and if you are fully satisfied in your conscience that he has been from the whole of the transaction the occasion of her death, then you will find him Guilty; on the other hand, if a doubt remains in your mind about it, though you would be very desirous that the death of a party should be attoned for, yet you will take great care, while we are lamenting the death of one innocent person, that another innocent person may not be in danger of suffering.</p>

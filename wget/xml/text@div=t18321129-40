             (Police-constable F 143). I saw the prisoner accost the prosecutor at the corner of George-court - they went down Buckingham-street, and down Harp-alley; she attempted to take him into a bad house, No, 12; he declined to go in - he went down another court with her; I remained at the corner of the court, and soon after I heard a cry "Stop her! Stop her! she has robbed me!" I stopped her, and she dropped this purse, with 5l. 5s. 6d. in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner. It is the first offence I ever committed - I left my husband six months ago; he will take me again.</p>

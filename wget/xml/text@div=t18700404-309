                  </hi>. I keep a beer-house at 15, Great Prescott Street, Whitechapel—I knew the prisoner as a customer on and off for about three or four years—he represented himself as a seaman—about three weeks ago he came to my place and said, "I have got a ship at last"—I said I was very glad to hear it—he went away and came again, in the course of a week, and said he had been at work on board the ship; he said, "I generally have got my friends to do a little business with me in the shape of advancing money on notes; they have gone into the country, could you oblige me with some money on this advance note?"—I said I would rather not; but afterwards, believing him to be a respectable man, I said I would chance it, and I gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the note—I said, "It is not usual for me to do these things, is it a genuine note?"—he said, "Yes, you may depend upon that"—he wrote his name on the back of the note, and said I was to apply to the agents mentioned in it for the money—I advanced him the money—I afterwards went to 7, East India Avenue, to the agents mentioned, and they refused payment—I have never got my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 71, Camberwell New Road, and am a clerk in the Merchant Marine Office, Hammond Street, Minories—I don't know Robert Healy, the master of the ship <hi rend="italic">Elgin</hi>—Amos D. Healy is the master of the <hi rend="italic">Elgin</hi>—the signature to this advance note has no resemblance to Mr. Healy's signature—the <hi rend="italic">Elgin</hi> sailed about the latter part of January—I have not seen the prisoner before to my knowledge—I have a duplicate of the ship's articles—that contains the signatures of the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Elgin</hi>—I was present when the crew was shipped—I saw them go on board—I saw all the men write their signatures on this paper—the prisoner was not one of them—these advance notes can be purchased for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by anybody—the notes to the <hi rend="italic">Elgin</hi> would be delivered at our office—advance notes were given to all the men who signed this paper for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>When the prisoner landed you found this box in his possession? - In about three hours after, the Captain, his wife and child, and a woman passenger, got the Captain's boat and went on shore, and this young man was not what we call a cabbin passenger, and this chest lay on the deck, and I saw this young man packing up a little wallet, and he told me that box was his, he said there was nothing in it but his old clothes, and that he would have it to his lodgings; the box was afterwards sealed with my seal and the sheriff's.</p>

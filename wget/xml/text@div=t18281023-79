I apprehended the prisoner at the prosecutor's house last Monday week; I went to his master, who took me to his bed-room, and in his trousers pocket, in his box, we found seven cornelian buttons; I found concealed in the room, on a rafter near the ceiling, three seals - it was a top room; I did not either threaten or promise him any thing; I was going to the Compter with him, and said, "You showed a button to Mr. Pickerill's servant; when I have taken you to the Compter, I shall go and see whether you had it from your cousin, as you have said;" he said, "It is of no use going to my cousin, for I took it out of the box."</p>

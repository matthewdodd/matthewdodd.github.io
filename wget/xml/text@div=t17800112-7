When we left the shop to go home it was about half after twelve in the morning, my son, my apprentice, my wife, myself and the prisoner, all went home together; she went first into the room with a great deal of courage, then she said, Lord have mercy upon me, here is a piece of work! my wife's clothes lay all about the room.</p>
               <p>She spoke as if there had been thieves? - Yes; and I supposed so myself at first; my clothes were flung about in the next room upon the bed and upon the floor; we looked in the other room and there was a door broke open; at last I went into the yard and looked upon the leads; I saw there had not been any body in that way. I then suspected the prisoner. I bid my wife see if the money was safe, but I was afraid it was gone. We missed the money; I took the prisoner up to St. Andrew's watch-house, and then I went with the constable to her sister's to enquire for her, for I suspected one of her sisters; when one of her sisters came down, I asked her if there was not another sister? she said there was, but she was not at home; but the constable went up into the garret, and there he found the other sister. The constable searched her, and took from her eleven shillings, and a half-crown piece; she said her own money was only two shillings and some half-pence; we asked her whose money that was? she said it was her sister's; we went down to the sister in the one pair of stairs room, and asked her if that was her money? she denied that it was. We then returned to the watch-house, and the constable said he had got the money in his hand; I said then there were two guineas I could swear to; I did not say that to influence the prisoner to make a confession, though I believe it had that effect, I believe she thought the money was discovered from her sister; she then told my son if he would go out of the watch-house with her, she would confess; she then said that her sister had often persuaded her to rob her master; that she came on Saturday about one o'clock and tapped at the window, and she let the sister in; that she gave her the money; that she threw the clothes about in one room, and the sister in the other; that she went away with the money, and she never saw her afterwards.</p>
               <p>That was the next day? - It was in the morning; she was taken then to the Compter; we took both the sisters to St. Sepulchre's watch-house. The constable searched the prisoner; she behaved with a good deal of impudence, and laughed; since that I have found several bad affairs.</p>
               <p>What age is the prisoner? - I do not know, I believe about 21.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any of the money again? - Not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Had she had opportunities of seeing where you put your money? - I believe she had; she acknowledged that her sister had been with her above a week before to induce her to rob me; I have found since that she has been several times concealed in the house, and lain with the maid without my knowledge. The wards were taken out of the lock of the street-door, and there were pick-lock keys found; she has confessed she could open any door in the house.</p>

I was on duty in St. Martin's-lane - I followed the prisoner from there - he looked into several shops, and when he got through Temple-bar, he took something out of his pocket and rubbed it; he went past Mr. Micklam's shop, then returned, and went in - I went into the shop and asked what he had given - Mr. Micklam said, one shilling, and gave me this one - I saw the prisoner put something into his mouth - I seized him by the throat, and told him if he did not put it out I would choak him - he put out these two shillings.</p>

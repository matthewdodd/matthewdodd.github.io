On the 18th of July, about ten in the morning, three boys came into our shop; two of the boys were tall, and the other one short; when they left the shop, I saw the short boy's coat, it very much resembled the prisoner's coat; the tall boy asked to look at some common handkerchiefs; I shewed them some, they did not buy any; they went out, and said, they would call again; they looked at several other handkerchiefs. In about an hour and a half after, this piece of silk handkerchiefs was brought in by Mr Lee, the constable; that piece of handkerchiefs was placed in the frame of the window; he must have slid back the frame to get at it, while the two other boys were at the counter; he was near enough to open the frame; the frame was not fastened. They said when they went out, they had not money enough to pay for the handkerchief they had fixed on; they would call again. I am quite sure this piece of silk handkerchiefs were in the shop when the three boys came in; I had placed them in the frame some time before; I am quite sure I had not sold them.</p>

            . I am a constable On Monday, the 18th of July, about a quarter after eleven o'clock, I observed the prisoner and two other boys, which I knew to be suspicious characters; the two other lads were older and taller than the prisoner; I knew the three boys were companions. I observed the prisoner had something in the breast of his coat; I followed him; the other two kept behind when I followed him. I caught hold of the prisoner by the collar, I said, what have you got here; he said, a little boy has given them to me. I asked him to tell me who the other two boys were; he would not tell me. I locked him up in the counter. I took from him this piece of handkerchiefs, it was under his coat, at his breast. I took the piece of handkerchiefs to Miss Grant; she claimed them directly. On the next day, as I was taking him to Bow-street office; he said, he found them in a gateway in Fleet-market. This is the piece of handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am sure this piece of handkerchiefs are mine; it is worth fifty shillings.</p>

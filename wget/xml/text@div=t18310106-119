On Saturday, the 1st of January, I was behind my counter, between three and four o'clock; I heard a noise at the door, and in consequence of some information, I went out - I saw a woman and the prisoner; he was about thirty yards from my shop, and had a roll of flannel under his arm - I went up to him, and told him he had my property, which I knew it was; I told him he had taken it from my shop, and I took him back with some assistance - he said, a man had given it him; I looked at it, and knew it was mine - I missed it from my door, when I went after the prisoner; I had seen it safe not three minutes before, secured by a chain; there had been another piece on it, and the noise I heard was of the top one falling, and the chain rattling against the door-post - there were forty-five yards of flannel.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I said a young man had given it me not twenty yards off; I should judge I was three hundred yards when he took me. Witness. No, I think not, he was walking.</p>

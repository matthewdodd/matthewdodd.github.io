               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186212150031"></xptr>
               <p>—I said, "Have you cashed any for any other gentleman in the home?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Have you cashed a cheque for anybody?"—she said, "Yes; I did for a woman"—I said, "A woman; what woman? do you know her?"—she said, "No; I never saw her before"—I said, "What was she like?"—she said, "A respectable woman, dressed in black, with a deep fall over her face"—I said, "Should you know her again if you were to see her?"—she said, "No"—I said, "What did she say going along from Dorset-place to Mr. Stephenson's?"—she said, "Nothing"-—I said, "Do you mean you walked all the way without speaking?"—she said, "Yes; I walked first, and she walked behind me"—I said, "Do you mean you went to Mr. Stephenson's and got 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and counted it into the woman's hand?"—she said, "No; I did not count it at all; as Mr. Stephenson gave it to me, I gave it to the woman"—I asked if the woman waited outside, and she said, "Yes"—I said, "What did the woman give you?"—she said, "Six<lb></lb>pence"—I have seen the prisoner write, but only once—I got her to write "J. Stanley," to see whether it corresponded with this, and she wrote Mr. Stanley's name three times on this bit of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she wrote it readily; she did not hesitate a minute; but she did not write it off-hand—she said that she did not know how to write—I said, "Do the best you can," and she asked me how to make a "J"—I showed her in my simple way—that is the only time I ever saw her write.</p>

On the 16th of March I met the prisoner a little before twelve o'clock at night; I had been drinking, but knew what I was doing - she asked me to give her something to drink; I said I had no money; she said."I dare say you have got money," and kept following me; I put my hand into my pocket, and found a few coppers and a sixpence; I took out the sixpence, went into a gin-shop, threw it down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050103"></xptr>on the counter, and gave her something to drink - she then came out, but still kept close to me; I desired her to keep off; she then turned into an alley, and said, "This is as near a way as any for you to go" (I had told her I was going to Old-street); I went up there, and she turned into a little court, and made a snatch at my watch, took it out, and ran into the street - I met an officer, and told him of it - he said he knew her perfectly well.</p>

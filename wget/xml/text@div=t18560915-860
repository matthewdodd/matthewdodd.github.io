                  </hi>. I am a hat maker. The prisoner was my town and country traveller; the terms of his engagement were, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound commission on country business, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound for town business, and 11/4 per cent, upon all cash he received, in addition to his other commission—I gave, him no salary, and advanced no money for his expenses—his duties were, the greater part of the time, in town—I sent a boy out with him to take his parcels, and it was his duty to account every evening, less discount, and I put it into the book from his dictation—that was the town account—he did not make out an account himself—he did not keep a book—there was another person besides me to whom he could account for the country accounts—it is possible that that person might have received his account of town transactions; he is here—the prisoner never accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received of a person named Hill—he admitted it when I questioned him, but did not account at the time—he never accounted to me for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Eastwood, or for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a person named Home—he has never accounted for these four amounts in this account—I asked him if he would make out a statement of the facts of what he had really taken, and then he opened his mind—I laid before him a list of debts not accounted for, and he said that he had received them, but did not account for them at the time—some of them were not accounted for two months after they were received—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he received from Mr. Eastwood, was not accounted for at the time he received it, but he did account for it—I have not got my books, to say how soon afterwards; he has never been in the habit of paying me till a month or two months afterwards, and has then paid me with somebody else's money—it was his duty to pay me at once, but he did not do so—I do not charge him with the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. East-wood's, he ought to have accounted for it on 10th May—I cannot tell how</p>

               <p>long afterwards he did so, he paid it before I accused him—this (<hi rend="italic">produce</hi>) is a memorandum of the debts which I made at the time—on 20th Aug., he returned home, about half past 10 o'clock at night, after being oat about ten days in the outskirts of London—I had found out on the Saturday before that he had received these amounts which I now charge him with—he came up stairs to see me, as I had been ill, and immediately he came in I placed a paper before him with those names upon it—(I have not got that paper; I have not looked for it, because he pleaded guilty, or I should have employed counsel)—those identical sums were mentioned—I did I not also mention them by word of mouth—I said, "Robinson, what do you know of those accounts?"—he closed his eyes, as if in deep thought, and said, "It is true, Sir"—I said, "What is true? have you received these accounts, and not accounted to me for them?"—he said, "Yes"—I said that I considered he had behaved very badly, and said, "I must have you charged, but if you like to relieve my mind, do so, for there is 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the road you have just come off of"—I made no pro<lb></lb>mise to him—he said, "I will tell you everything"—he then told me, in the presence of Judge, my assistant, of fourteen names which he had received, and not accounted for—they are on the paper, I wrote them at the time, that same evening—this is not the original, it is a copy; I made it very likely the same night, it was about the same time (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it con<lb></lb>tained the name of Mr. Horne 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Barber, of the Royal Exchange, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a bill; Judd, of Hertford, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and others—he paid that account to my assist<lb></lb>ant—when the prisoner said that he had not paid it, he pleaded for mercy, and asked me whether I would make a debt of it—I said that I would do no such thing, I must give him in charge; that I had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out upon that road, and had only received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it—he declared solemnly that he had not a farthing in his possession, and asked my young man to give him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he had paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short that night—he made no excuse for not paying it over; he said that it had been going on for some time.</p>

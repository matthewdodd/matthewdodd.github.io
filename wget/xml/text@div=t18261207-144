            . I live in Rycroft-court. I went out and met the prisoner on the steps with a bag under his arm - on my return I met him coming out with the bag<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070067"></xptr>full on his shoulder - the prosecutrix then came home and said she had been robbed of all she had - I then recollected that I had seen this coloured man - I went and gave information of him and his dress - he had a canvas jacket on- we were directed to Blue Gate-fields - we found the prisoner at No. 37, Angel-gardens - I accused him of coming out of Rycroft-court with a bag; but he denied all about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see what was in the bag? A. No; I met you with the bag empty, and when I returned I met you with it full.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home and had this wood to carry to a friend's; I sat there I suppose an hour, and then this woman came, and said, "That is the man who robbed me;" I said, "Ma'am" - "Yes," said she,"you have robbed me of my bed-clothes;" I said I had done no such thing, what I brought here is in the coalhole - the empty bag was on the floor - she saw it, and did not know it again - I never saw this property till it was shown me by the officer - there are many people come to that house - it is a lodging-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and live in Angel-gardens. I saw a headborough go into a house there, at a quarter before two o'clock - I went in to assist him; the prisoner was in the front-room - I then went into the kitchen, and found this pillow, sheet, and counterpane stowed up between the ceiling and the tiles; Mrs. Cook saw them, and said they were hers; the woman at the house said he brought these things to her; and she begged him to take them out as quick as possible; I do not think the prisoner heard that.</p>

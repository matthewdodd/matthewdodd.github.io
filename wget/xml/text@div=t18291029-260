I caught the prisoner in the act of broaching a cask of brandy, which laid on the quay, about half-past one o'clock yesterday; I took this bottle of brandy out of his trousers - it has about a pint in it; the prisoner was employed there - there were a good many people about; he had bored a hole, and put a spile in - I asked him to give up his tool, and he gave this gimblet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Was his back to you? A. When he saw me he turned his back to the wall- his back was to me when he was doing something at the cask; the cask was leaking from the hole - the bottle was in his breeches; I cannot say that the contents came from the cask - it appeared to be a brandy cask; I did not taste the contents of it - I did not say yesterday that it was rum - I have not tasted what is in this bottle: it smells like brandy - the cask was in the custody of the dock company.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you taste any of that which came from the hole? A. No - a brandy cask is of a different model to others: it was a sort of cask that brandy is generally brought in - it was on the wharf of the London-dock company, and the prisoner was in their employ.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WEBB. I am a cellar-clerk in the spirit-quay of the London-docks. I saw the cask which Osborn pointed out; I dipped it, and found it deficient about one quart - it was brandy, and of the same description as this in the bottle - I tasted them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What difference in a cask would one quart make? A. About 2-10ths in the rule; there is not a quart in this bottle, but the cask was leaking - I do not know whether any one else had been there; to the best of my judgment the brandy in the cask and this in the bottle are the same - I have no hesitation at all in swearing that: the prisoner was an extra man there - all persons are searched coming out, and I should think he would have been stopped with it; no sample bottles are allowed there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not bore the cask - I took the spile out.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

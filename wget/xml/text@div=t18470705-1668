                  </hi> I am nine years old, and live with my father and mother, in Rosemary-lane. On Sunday, the 20th of June, I was playing with some children about my father's door—I saw the prisoner there, sitting at her stall—some of the boys put some orange peel and straw on her bonnet—I did not go up and laugh at her, and point—I laughed at the boys—they put it on her head, and I laughed—she got up from her stall, and cut me across the hand with a knife which she cuts her oranges with—she was going to cut my face, but I held my hand up—I began to scream, and my mother took me to a doctor's.</p>

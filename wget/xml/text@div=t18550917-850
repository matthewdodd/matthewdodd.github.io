                  </hi>. I am master of the <hi rend="italic">Air</hi> schooner, lying off Wool Quay. I was in a public house in Tower-street on the night before I went before the Magistrate—it was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I had a glass of rum—I was perfectly sober—I met with the two prisoners and another, in the public house—the other went away—the prisoners stopped there—I was just done drinking the glass of rum when I got into conversa<lb></lb>tion with them, and we went to a coffee shop and had a cup of coffee apiece—I paid for it—I took my purse out of my pocket, and gave the woman half a crown to pay for my coffee—there was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in that purse, and I had changed two sovereigns that day—I should say there was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in it—after I had put the change in, I put the purse into my trowsers pocket—the prisoners were sitting at the table drinking their coffee—Fitzpatrick then left the other one, and came and sat down close by me—she had not been sitting there a minute before she pulled the purse out of my pocket, and both of them <hi rend="italic">whipped</hi> out of the house—as soon as I saw they jumped up and ran out of the house, I thought there was something the matter—I put my hand to my pocket, and my purse was gone—I ran out after them, I made a jump, and should have caught them, but my foot caught and I fell—I am positive that Fitzpatrick took my purse, the other was not near enough to get it—one was at one end of the table, and the other at the other—my purse was in my left pocket—she came and sat close alongside of me—she had been sitting on the right side, and she came and sat close by my side, and took my purse—there was no one else in the room—I fell down, and that enabled them to get away—I lost sight of them after that—this happened on Thursday night—I saw them again in the police station on Saturday—I should say I was with them an hour and a half, or there<lb></lb>abouts.</p>

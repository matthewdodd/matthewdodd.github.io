               <p>JOHN CODY. On the 4th of August I was a little tipsy, and went with the prisoner to a house - I had seen her before once or twice - I staid there about a quarter of an hour; I did not see her take the watch, but missed it as soon as I got away. I saw her again in two or three days afterwards, and asked her about it; she said it was pawned - I am not sure I did not give it her. She took me to where it was, and I promised to let her go if I got it, but the pawnbroker would not let us have it that night, and I was not certain of its being mine.</p>

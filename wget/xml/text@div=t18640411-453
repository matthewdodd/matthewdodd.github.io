                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Richard Duke, sail cloth maker, of Lower-east, Smithfield—I left the premises on the evening of 9th December, from half-past 6 to 7 o'clock—I left no one there, I was the last there—I closed the warehouse—I should think there were about 400 bolts of canvas on the premises when I left—I returned about half-past 7 next</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110092"></xptr>
               <p>morning—I undid the padlock, and then began to undo the warehouse-door; instead of turning it twice, as I usually do, I only had to turn the catch, and the door flew open; I had double-locked it the night before—when I got in I missed a quantity of canvas, which I had seen there the night before I left—I could not at that moment tell the amount; it was about fifty-one bolts—one of the desks in the counting-house had been forced open, the drawers were open, and papers lying about—no entrance could have been effected at the back—the padlock must have been taken off and put on again—I gave information to the police—on 29th December, I went to Messrs. Morrisons, of Norton Folgate, to make a purchase of some goods; I there accidently saw some bolts of canvas, and recognised them as belonging to my master, which I had left in the warehouse the night previous to the robbery; there were about twenty-seven or twenty-eight there—on the following day, the 30th, I went to Tatton, and there saw twenty-one more bolts, which I also recognised as my master's property—I told Tatton they were my master's property—he said, "As I hear they have been stolen, as a man of honour I shall give them up"—I took all the canvas home with me that evening, the twenty-seven bolts and the twenty-one—I afterwards took stock of the can<lb></lb>vas—there were then about three bolts missing—I went to Tatton next day and told him so—he said he had cut them up for tarpaulins, but as a man of honour he would pay for them—the value of the whole of the canvas was about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the first quality is about 17<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard, the second quality about 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and there were two bolts of about 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard—the twenty-one that I saw at Tatton's were not in the same state as when they were on our premises, they had been undone and done up again—any one could tell they had been undone—there was no alteration in the numbers that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILIPPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many qualities have you got in this canvas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are generally about five qualities; we mostly have four or five qualities in our warehouse—they vary in price a good deal; No. 2 would be about 16 1/2. <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and No. 3, 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it falls a half-penny a num<lb></lb>ber up to 7 or 8—we are continually getting it in and out, sometimes we have a great quantity in the warehouse, and sometimes not so much—some of this canvas might have been in the warehouse two or three months, some a week, and some a fortnight—we are continually getting them in by railway and by steam-boat from the makers at Dundee—most of this canvas we had had about a fortnight—it was bought in different lots—we buy of the manu<lb></lb>facturers—we have a stamp put upon our canvas from a tin plate, not our name—it is, "Extra twice-boiled Navy"—that is a stamp used in the trade—I put this on myself—different warehouses have different stamps—I never saw one like ours—I will not swear there is not any—it is for the purpose of denoting the quality—this is the stamp I identified it by—there is no ticket upon this—there were others with paper tickets on them—Mr. Duke's name was not on them, only the number of yards—the value of the canvas stolen was about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to us as sellers—I can't tell what my master gave for it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a second quality canvas, worth about 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard; at the present time it would be worth more; three months ago, it might have been worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we sell to the trade at a less price than to general dealers—I saw a book at Tatton's, he showed it to me, I saw an entry of the sale of three bolts—he said that he bought the canvas of a man named McCarthy, in Nightingale-lane—T was aware that Tatton had seen Mr. Duke before I saw him—canvas does not very often come to us in a dirty state, it comes in bales, with a wrapper over it to keep it clean—it may get dirty in the warehouse</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110093"></xptr>
               <p>—if I was going to buy canvas, I should examine it to see if it was injured—we should not open it, just look at it—if we did examine it, we should untie it and tie it up afresh—it is not usual to untie it, if it comes from a manufacturer—if a bolt of canvas like this was brought to me for sale, I don't think I should open it to look at it—if it was duty outside I should do so, and then I should relay it in the best way I could, for the purpose of sale afterwards—the twenty-one bolts I saw at Tatton's, had been undone and tied up again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what condition were the bolts of canvas when you last saw them at your warehouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite clean—those I saw at Morri<lb></lb>son's on the 29th December, were very dirty—those I saw at Tatton's, were clean outside, but dirty inside—that was twenty days after the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what per yard do you reckon the canvas to make 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were forty-two yards in a bolt, and we reckon a bolt to cost from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the average would be 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard to come to about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was in consequence of something I heard at Morrison's, that I went to Tatton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it the practice to put those bolts in a press, and then have them tied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If they are going to be shipped abroad they are put in a press, but if they are for sale in London, they merely put a string round them—that would not alter the shape of them—these have not been put into a press—there were from thirty-five to forty bolts of the best quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">McCarthy. Q.</hi> Did you look round the warehouse on 10th December, and see how many bolts you missed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We could not tell how many we missed till we took stock—on the Saturday, 11th or 12th, we had some bills printed previous to taking stock—we took a general average of what we missed—we advertised forty-seven bolts—the book Tatton showed me looked like a day-book, in it was an entry where he had sold three bolts of canvas, and got paid for them—that was all I saw in the book—the number on the bolt does not denote the quality, only the thickness of the canvas—we lost about seventeen of No. 1, about twenty-three of No. 2, of the best, and then some Nos. 5 and 6, I think—there were some No. 3, they were very common, two bolts at 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Tatton told me he had paid you 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the canvas—he said, "I paid 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it to a man named McCarthy, in Nightingale-lane.</p>

I am salesman to Mr. Morrison, of Norton Folgate—on the morning of 11th December, Tatton came and said he had a lot of flax canvas for sale, which he had had in stock for three months, and which he offered at 14 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he would take goods in barter for it—14 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for No. 1, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 03/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for No. 2, and 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for No. 3—I remarked when he offered them at those prices that he had surely made a mistake, it being out of the regular course of selling flax canvas, that it was usual only to drop a half-penny per yard—he said that it cost him that price three months ago—I agreed to take the canvas at the price he offered upon seeing a sample—twenty-seven bolts were delivered at our warehouse the same afternoon by two of his men, with this invoice and note at the bottom: "My quotations for 2 and 3 were quite a mistake"—I received this note also: "I made a foolish mistake to Mr. Barclay in quoting the canvas 2 and 3; they cost me the price I charged you three months ago"—the invoice price is 14 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 13 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remarked, on seeing the bolts, that it was Courser's make—he said, "I won't say whose make it is"—Courser is a well-known maker—it was the best canvas that was manufactured by them—this note is Tatton's writing (<hi rend="italic">Read;</hi> "To Robert Parsons, 11-12, 1863. Sir,—He pleased to refold and mark lengths in Nos. on canvas: No. 6 mark No. 5, No. 5 mark No. 4, No. 4 mark No. 3, and deliver same to my order. Yours, &amp;c, Peter Tatton. ")</p>

               <p>him he bad made a mistake in the quotations—the twenty-seven bolts that I had had not been refolded; part of them had a mark and part were without mark, merely the manufacturer's ticket on it—it was rather dirty, or it would have been more valuable, because the price of canvas does not vary a good deal; it has within the last eighteen months, but it has been stationary for a long time—twelve months ago I bought the same canvas at 14 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and at that time the manufacturer's price was 16 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we buy to sell again—a good deal depends upon the condition of the canvas—I gave up the can<lb></lb>vas on 31st December, at Tatton's request—it was a barter transaction—he left the canvas on the agreement that he was to have goods, and that agree<lb></lb>ment was carried out—I have only been with Mr. Morrison two years and a half; during the whole of that time I have served Tatton—our transactions with him have not been very considerable; about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in that time—we never bought of him previous to that date; he bought of us.</p>

LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that in the presence of McCarthy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he asked me how it was I had not the elder boy, and I said the reason I did not order him to come was, that he was in a place earning a little a week, and it was all they had to depend upon; the family were starving, and I thought it was a pity to bring him away—the Magistrate then desired me to get a sub<lb></lb>poena against him to have him at the Court, and I did so—I had not possession of the books until after the prisoners were committed for trial. (<hi rend="italic">One book showed an entry of</hi> 49 <hi rend="italic">bolts of canvas on</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th, for</hi> 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s., the figures</hi> 49 <hi rend="italic">being written on an erasure.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PORTER WILLIAM DUNAWAY</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give any money to McCarthy's wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I first advanced her two shillings—on one occasion she said she should have been starved if Mr. Duke had not been kind enough to send her four loaves—I advanced her six shillings afterwards, because she was so distressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">McCarthy's Defence.</hi> I have no friends, or I could prove that Dunaway did bring me that beer and brandy. My family want to send me away. The two boys have been put up to swear against me. To speak to a certain day four months ago, it stands to reason that two boys of their age could not state any day without being put up to it, and told the day; but they are so well trained, that I believe they cannot be broken down. I believe my wife would be very glad if I was sent away for a little time. As to that letter, the policeman gave me brandy and beer, which, after three weeks' starvation in prison, had such an effect upon me, that I could not tell what I was doing. He said if I would write such a letter, it would be the means of my getting off better; but he only got me to write it that I might commit myself. He has been in the habit of coming to see my wife where she now lives, and giving her and the boys money. Young boys like those would not, perhaps, know why he came; but they want to send me away.</p>

               <p>In like manner, the entry is made in my name us sold, some on the 11th, and some on the 14th. I was not out of doors, or able to get out, for ten days after, so that I could not have been at Taltors. I was in bed up stairs when the men were there, and don't know what took place.</p>

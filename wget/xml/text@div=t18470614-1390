                  </hi>. I live at No. 14, Park-street, Limehouse, close to the West India Docks. On the 22nd of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was coming from a water-closet in Gin-alley, the expression was used, "You b—, what do you do there?"—that was by the prisoner, and at the same time a blow was struck—a good deal more violence was used, as he had assistance—there were thirteen or fourteen persons there—there were four at one time—the prisoner was one of them—I stood in a fighting attitude against him, and I did fight—I was obstructed by a person unknown to me, and was knocked down by them all together—I have got over a great many of the blows, except my foot, upon which they jumped—I stood against them as far as I could—I was on the ground, and the prisoner on the top of me, and while I was on the ground he drew my watch which I had in my right-hand side, in my corduroy dress—I said, "You don't have that"—after that putt, the officer, came up—I suffered no more violence after my watch was taken—they took it away, and a chain which was attached to it—the number of the watch was 2570—they showed resistance to the constable, and bade him defiance—I held the prisoner against the wall till putt came up, and said, "You shall never leave me, you shall not make your escape now; I will get more force, "I went off for another person, and left him in charge of Putt—I held him from the time of the attack till the officer came—when I came back with the other officers, he had made his retreat—I re<lb></lb>covered part of my watch again—as I was seeking more assistance, a woman placed it in my jacket-pocket, and said, "Oh, Sir, I am sure you would not hurt anybody"—that was two or three yards from where I had left the pri<lb></lb>soner I had not seen her before—the prisoner is the person I was struggling with on the ground when the watch was drawn from my pocket—he drew it out with his right hand—I think there were thirteen or fourteen people round me at the time—the other men came up about a minute and a half after I re<lb></lb>ceived the first blow from the prisoner—I did not see where they came from—we were fighting together when they came up.</p>

               <p>another was holding me down, and as he got from me I felt it go—I swear 1 was not in the water-clost when he struck me—I was about four feet from it, coming out, just allowing the door to swing on its hinges—I went in there about nine o'clock, and this occurred at half-past ten—I had not been there an hour and a half, but about half an hour—I had been to Stepney fair—I came from the fair about a quarter to nine, and came down the Horseferry-road—while I was at the fair I met two persons named Pearce and Burrell in the same occupation as myself—I had some half-and-half with them in the fair—after that I had a pint of <hi rend="italic">winkles</hi>, and coming down the Commercial-road was obliged to find a place to ease myself—I went into this water-closet—I was there pretty long the first time—I came out and went in again, and the last time I came out I encountered the prisoner—I cannot say how much half-and-half I had—it might be three pints or three pints and a half—I am not coming over to two pints—I could take three—I had no spirits that night—I went to the fair about twelve in the day—I was going home from the water-closet—I consider this was in my way—there was no mess at all in the water-closet when I left it—I had both my shoes on—I had my hat on when the prisoner first saw me—my clothes were decent—my trowsers were braced up—any one can go to this water-closet—it is in a regular thorough-fare—I had been there before, but not that week—the first thing the prisoner said was, "What do you do there?"—I had not power to say anything because I received a blow—I struck him again—I cannot say whether the watch-glass was broken when it was put into my pocket—there was no glass in it—I did not see it broken—there were thirteen or fourteen persons present—they have not increased in my recollection—I swear there were from thirteen to fourteen, but cannot speak to the exact number—I have never said there were only eight or nine—I did not give any money to any person about there—nobody complained of my having made a mess there—I did not give 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to any one to clear it away.</p>

On the 25th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was in Queen-street, Ratcliffe, and saw Jones struggling with the prisoner—there were ten or fourteen people about there—there were two or three men and women talking together—I cannot say whether Jones was standing there or not—they were fighting, and he was sometimes down, sometimes up—I separated them and released him—I have known Jones five or six years, and said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Ted</hi>, what are you up to?"—he pointed to the prisoner and said, "That man has robbed me of my watch, you take him into custody"—the prisoner was willing to go with me, but was rescued from me by ten or twelve persons, and taken into a house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140057"></xptr>
               <p>during the time Jones went away for assistance—when he came back with a brother-constable of mine, I went to the house, No. 3, Gin-alley, and called to the prisoner, he came down stars, and was willing to go with me, and went to the station—I have part of the watch here—Jones appeared in an agitated state, but was not drunk—his trowsers were in a decent state, just as they are now—a complaint was made at that time about the place where he had been—I examined it, and it was quite clean.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you came up Jones and the prisoner only were struggling, and some men and women standing by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; no one else was interfering in the struggle—it might have been ten minutes after that that the prisoner was rescued from me—it might be two or three minutes before any of the rest joined in—I examined the water-closet directly after I came back from locking the prisoner up, and again at daylight, at three o'clock in the morning—when I went to the prisoner's house I said, "It will be better for you to go to the station quietly and settle it, than that there should be a disturbance and I should be knocked about."</p>

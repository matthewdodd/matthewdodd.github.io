                  </hi>. I am master of the steamer <hi rend="italic">Pacific</hi>, lying at present in Victoria Docks. About 28th Jan. I returned from a voyage to Balaklava—the prisoner was a seaman on board—we had no freight, as we were returning after taking navigators to Balaklava—when at Balaklava, I had a gold watch and chain and seal, which I last saw safe I think lying on the table—I seldom wore it on board—there were port holes on one side of my cabin-scuttles, through one of which the watch could be taken if a man was in a boat alongside, loaded with bags: a man's arm, standing upon them, would be on a level with the port—I had two seamen named Osier and Allen on board, and an ordinary seaman, a lad named Campbell—about a fortnight after we arrived in Victoria Docks I received information from Campbell, in consequence of which the prisoner was apprehended, and I was sent for to prefer the charge—I did not see him privately, or converse with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Pacific</hi> on her voyage from Balaklava to England. We left Balaklava about the middle of Nov., and were about a day and a half running up to Constantinople—after we arrived in England, I left, and boarded at the same house with the prisoner, Parish's, No. 46, Shadwell—Allen lived there also, but Osler boarded in Star-street—I do not know where Parish is, he went out yesterday morning, and I have not seen him since—on the Monday before last, about 10 o'clock, a letter came to the house, and in consequence of that we searched and found the seals in a cupboard, in a cellar, among some glass—I was present—Parish took the seals to Mr. Thompson—on one occasion I was at the Mahogany Bar public house with Ritchie—I had heard that the captain had lost his watch, and I told the prisoner that Osier and Allen had a gold watch to sell—he said that he knew all about it, that Allen had sold the guard for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave Osier 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they told the prisoner that they had spent his share among them—Ritchie said that Osier and he went into the boat alongside the ship in Balaklava</p>

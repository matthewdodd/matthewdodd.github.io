               <p>Q. Did she take the lodgings from you herself? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know her at the time you let her the lodgings? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. After she lodged with you these seven weeks, what happened? - There were the curtains, one was taken away, and the other was tore in two, and I missed my feathers out of my bed.</p>
               <p>Q.When did she quit your room? - She quitted my room on Thursday, and she was taken up on Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say anything to you before she went away, that she was going? - She did not; she went away in the afternoon; the man that cohabited with her was in the room. After that she did not return never any more. I went momentarily into the room as soon as she was gone; I missed the sheets off the bed, the one was torn in two and part left behind, and the other was quite gone; I missed a flat iron, and a tea kettle; the curtain she had tore, was not taken away; I put it in the indictment to let you know what she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. How many feathers did she take away from the bed? - There is not so many now as I can carry in a pocket handkerchief, it was a well stuffed bed before.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the feathers were taken out? - Because the feathers were not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it ripped? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.These things were all let with the lodgings to her? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she to pay you? - Two shillings and six-pence a week. After she took the lodgings she had a man come there with her; the man sometimes paid me and sometimes she; he had a wife and three children, but she said, where she was there he should be.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the man come there after she took the lodgings? - I cannot say, very shortly, after a night or two; he was not there when she took the lodging; she took it as a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190010"></xptr>widow. I know nothing of the man of my own knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q.You sometimes received the rent of the man? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Was you paid pretty regular? - Tolerably, only the last week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your things again? - I found some tickets in the room, in a drawer of a bureau, when the place came to be cleared, two days after she was gone. I found the ticket of a tea kettle, and the ticket of a flat iron.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean a pawnbroker's ticket? - Yes. I went to each of the pawnbrokers and brought them out, and paid for them. I found the tea kettle in St. Giles's, the flat iron in Carnaby-street, and the curtain I found in St. Giles's, the one that was taken away, the other was tore; the sheet I found at another pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how these things came there? - I don't, only they were in her name.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up? - On Friday after Christmas, the day after she left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her that day? - I see her at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. The man you say, lodged with her? - But she cleared the man when she was before the justice.</p>

I got into Leadenhall-market; I returned back through a court into the inn, and asked if they had heard any thing of the box; they said they had not; we went home.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. What did you do when you found your mistake? - I went to the book-keeper, and she said, she would lay me a hundred pounds I had lost the box by two sharpers.</p>
               <p>What reason have you for knowing me? - By the lamp; there was a lamp before your face.</p>
               <p>What coloured clothes had I on? - He had a round hat, a pen in his ear, a white waistcoat and a long pair of metal buckles in his shoes, and he had a light blue coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. and Mrs. Bateman, of No. 4, Westbourne-place, Eaton-square, Pimlico. On the evening of Tuesday, the 30th of January, my master came home to dinner, about six o'clock—I saw his great coat hanging up in the hall after he came home—it is a blue rough coat, called a pilot jacket—no one came in, after he came home, but Mr. Bateman's brother—they dined a few minutes after six o'clock—about</p>

               <p>seven o'clock there was a knock at the door—I opened it, and found the prisoner there—he asked me for the first and second volume of Ivanhoe—I told him it was not a library, and we did not let out books—he said no, he knew that, but that they had had them from their library, and he wanted them—I asked him to come in—he did so—I shut the door, and went into the parlour—while I was delivering the message, I heard the coat-stand rattle in the hall, as if something was being pulled off it—I called out, and ran into the hall immediately; and as I went into the hall, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner making his escape—he shut the door after him, without waiting for any thing—I saw him again about three or four minutes afterwards in cus<lb></lb>tody, and knew him immediately—I said, "That is the man"—I have not seen the coat since—I had let my master in when he came home, and ob<lb></lb>served him place his coat on the middle peg of the stand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fixture broker. I was passing along Westbourne-place, on the evening of the 30th of January, and within a few yards of No. 4, I observed the prisoner come out of Mr. Bate man's gate, on the foot-path, and run away—at the same time I heard an alarm of "Stop thief"—the houses are fronted by a fore-court—I saw him run out of the gate—it was past seven o'clock—I could not observe whether he had any thing with him—I pursued him directly, and never lost sight of him till I took him—he turned a corner, but there was a gas-light at the corner—he might have put the coat over the railings to another person be<lb></lb>fore I saw him—I am certain he is the person who came out of the gate—Mr. Bateman came up, and held me as well as the prisoner till the police-man came up—the prisoner ran first, he then made a dead stop, and, when he was taken, immediately pretended to be very tipsy—he said he had just come out of the public-house, and asked what was the matter.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I was living in Westbourne-place. When I came home to dinner, I placed my pilot-jacket on the coat-stand, in the entrance-hall, and afterwards went into the dining-room—the servant came into the room about seven o'clock, to inquire for Ivanhoe—we had no such books—before she had finished delivering her message, she called out, "Oh, there is a thief"—I got up, and directly I got to the hall, the door banged too with great violence—I opened it, and pursued, and the prisoner was taken—the coat was missing—I had seen it safe about half-past six o'clock—when the policeman brought the prisoner to the house, the servant immediately said, "That is the man."</p>

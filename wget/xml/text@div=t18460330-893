I heard of the loss of Mrs. Hendry's spoons—I afterwards stopped the prisoner Trevett who was driving a van in Stanhope-street—I told him I wished to speak to him respecting some property that was missing from the goods of Mrs. Hendry that were removed from Princes-street to Fisher-street—he said, "I do not know anything about it"—he admitted he had removed Mrs. Hendry's goods.</p>

I live in Princes-street, Drury-lane—Mrs. Hen<lb></lb>dry moved her goods from that house on the 12th of March, by a van which was driven by Trevett—he put some of the things in, and arranged them—I noticed him to bring a box down—he took it up, and opened the drawer of it twice—he appeared to examine what was in it—I saw some silver in it—he placed it between some bundles in a different place to where it had been—he then drove off.</p>

On the 15th of March I saw the prisoner Turner and another man fighting—a sergeant who was with me took Turner into custody—as he was taking him to the station, I saw Turner put his hand into his right hand trowsers pocket, take out two spoons, and drop them on the pavement—they were picked up by a man, and given to me—I have them—I afterwards saw Turner searched by the sergeant, and four more spoons found on him—he said that Trevett, Mr. Mapley's carman, gave them to him to take care of for him—I called on Trevett afterwards, and said I wanted to speak to him—he came to me, and inquifed if Turner was locked up for anything, and he said something to me about the spoons.</p>

I took Turner to the station—Durston delivered to me two silver tea-spoons—I asked Turner where he got them—he denied having dropped them, and said they did not belong to him at all—I found between the lining of his trowsers three other tea-spoons, and one more dropped from him—his trowsers fitted tight towards the lower part of the leg, so that unless be applied his hand to the spoons, they would not easily fall through, unless he had walked far—I should judge he could not have had them there the whole of the time he was going to the station—these are the four spoons.</p>

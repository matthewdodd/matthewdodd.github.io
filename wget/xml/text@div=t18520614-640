                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Rudduck; we are porter merchants, at Exeter-hall Vaults, Strand. The prisoner was our clerk; it was his duty to receive money, and account for it the next morning to my partner—he had a rough cash book in which he was to enter the sums he received—on 15th March some communication had been made to me with reference to what I imagined an inaccuracy in the prisoner's account—I called the prisoner into the counting house, and told him I could not admit of such inaccuracy, and therefore I should dismiss him—I told him what I had dis<lb></lb>covered—two small amounts—I said, having discovered that he had received money, and not entered it, and not handed it over to my partner, I considered him inaccurate, and therefore should dismiss him—he said he hoped I did not</p>

               <p>consider him dishonest—I said no, I had no reason to suppose he was—he said, "Don't suppose, Sir, that I am guilty of fraud"—he seemed very indignant, and said the least I could do, dismissing him so suddenly, would be to give him a year's salary, he having been of great service to me—I said certainly not, he was legally entitled to a quarter's salary, and dismissing him suddenly I should pay him that—I told him to fetch a receipt, and I gave him a check for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me this receipt, "Received of Messrs. Daukes and Rudduck, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being the balance of my salary to March 1852, and the remainder one quarter's salary paid to me in lieu of notice"—he then said, "Before I leave you, Sir, will you give me up the security which you hold from the Guarantee Society?"—I held a security from the Guarantee Society—I asked the prisoner whether his cash in his box was correct, he said yes it was—when he asked about the security, I said it required consi<lb></lb>deration in giving up a document of such importance, I should consider of it—I told him I had no objection to meet him the next morning, and tell him what I should do—I appointed to meet him at my partner's, Mr. Rudduck's—I met him the next day at 1 o'clock, at Mr. Rudduck's—I said the object of his visit was to know whether I should give up the security; I told him I had determined to retain it—he said he was very sorry indeed to inform me that it was not only the trifling sum already stated, but a considerable sum of money, and he urged me not to apply to the Guarantee Society, as it would be his ruin; he had said on the previous day that he should apply to the Guarantee Society to show them for what a trivial cause he had been dismissed—on this day he told me there were further sums, and urged me not to apply to the Guarantee Society—I said, "Well, what was the cause of your taking this money?"—he said he had suffered a great deal of deprivation, he was extremely sorry, and be would not do so again—I said, "Well, of course, if you are penitent, you have brought me back the check that I gave you yes<lb></lb>terday?"—he said he had spent it, but he had a few pounds left, if I liked to take that—I said, "Certainly not"—I said he was a rogue, and I should immediately apply to the Guarantee Society, and leave the matter with them—I did apply to them—I saw the prisoner afterwards, he called at Mr. Rud<lb></lb>duck's chambers—he said he had received a notice from the Guarantee Society, and the least he could do would be to put our books straight—he gave me a list of the sums which I have here—he makes it a total of 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but it is wrongly added up; it ought to be 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and beside that, there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deficient in the cash—this list does not contain the names of Wilcox or Cope—I find the name of Street here—I produce the rough cash book in which it was the prisoner's duty to enter the sums which he received—I do not find here, 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received on the 25th of Sept., from Mr. Street—on the 27th of Sept. I find an entry of a sum of money paid bv Mr. Street: the Trevor Arms, 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; The Prince's Head, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; making a total of 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is no entry of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Cope, on the 23rd Dec.—nor of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Wilcox on the 5th Dec.—if the prisoner had received these sums it was his duty to enter them in this book—he ought to have had in his box for petty cash, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. And 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the deficiency there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was a memorandum between ourselves, and some money borrowed the day before he went away.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand that the Guarantee Society are prosecuting this case, or where is the money to come from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I pay—I am the prosecutor; I shall have to pay for it—I am charging him myself of my own free will—I did not do so in March, because the matter was left with the Guarantee Society—I do not know whether any one is here from them—they have an attorney, Mr. Cotton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any arrangement who is to pay, or do you expect to get your money back from the Society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I expect I shall—that is not the reason why I am prosecuting—the matter is left in their hands—my object in prosecuting is not to get the money—I do not suppose I should get the money if I did not prosecute—the prisoner said, "The least you can do is to give me a year's salary"—I said no; I should give him a quarter's salary—there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him for commission—he had a few friends on whose custom I allowed him a commission—I met bim by appointment the day after this check had been given; but not to go through the account—I owed his cash-box 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had lent me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. petty cash—when he brought this list, with the account of the defalcations, his wife was with him—he told me that she had been extremely ill—he told me that the defalcation had taken place in consequence of the pressure arising from it, and in consequence of some litigation he had relative to an estate in Ireland—I think he told me likewise that they had been to his attorney's endeavouring to make arrange<lb></lb>ments to raise money—he said something about it with a view to paying off all these things—I forget the name of the person he referred to—when he brought this list, the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was added to it—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was petty cash, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lent to him to pay his guarantee security, which he paid himself—the guarantee security is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it was lent to him, and he gave my partner an I O U for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay his guarantee, and an I O U for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay office expenses; and then I had given him an I O U for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not tell him to write at the bottom of the list that he had received the check for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fraudulently, and under false pretences—I said, "This is not a correct list; you received 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me under false pretences, and now in pretending to render a correct account, you don't choose to do so"—I did not desire him to add that at the bottom of the list—his wife did not say, "Surely, gentle<lb></lb>men, you cannot wish my husband to appear worse than he is?"—she kept on urging me not to carry the matter further—she was very much grieved—I did not desire the prisoner to add the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the list—I merely said that it was not there—I had not numerous negotiations with the Guarantee Society—we called on them to let them know it—I did not try to get the money</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the Guarantee Society had paid you the money, should we have heard of the matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; if I had not depended on them in some measure, and if the matter had not been left to them, I should have prose<lb></lb>cuted him at once—when he came to us he had a very good character—his character was at the foot of the guarantee—I had not heard of his having property in Ireland.</p>

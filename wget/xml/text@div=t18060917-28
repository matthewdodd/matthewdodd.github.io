             sworn. I am shopman to Mr. Greenwell. On Tuesday the 22nd of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, a lady came in the shop and asked me if I had lost a piece of print, I immediately went out of doors and missed the print; from her information I went after the prisoner, she turned up the first turning she came to, from that into an alley where there was no thoroughfare, there I took her; she had dropped the print, I saw her drop it, I picked it up and still pursued her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same woman who had the piece of print. - A. Yes, I produce it, I am sure it is my master's, there is his private mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am very sorry for what I have done, I came very honestly by the property; a person gave me the property, and they gave me a shilling to carry it up the street.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

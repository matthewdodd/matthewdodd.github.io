On 21st May, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was outside Mr. Wilks' window, which is next door to Mr. Gooch's window, and saw the prisoner at Mr. Gooch's window, about two yards off me—he took a darkish brown coat from a rail, put it into his bag, and went away—I afterwards made a communication to Mrs. Gooch.</p>

Q.</hi> How far were you from the shop where you say you saw the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two yards—I saw half of his face—his back was more towards me than his front—he had on a dark coat, a cloth coat; I did not notice any other part of his dress—I did not see him again for a week, but was quite positive of him then—I said I knew him most by his walk—I could speak more positively to his walk than anything else—that was when I saw him walking into the station in custody—I had been told that the man had been caught who had stolen the coat; Mr. Gooch told me that, and then I went to look at him—I am quite sure I saw part of his face at the window—he had either a light bag, or something on it light—I have been talking over this matter with Mrs. Gooch—she told me she thought it was a light bag, or had something light on the top of it—she told me before I</p>

On 26th May, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was at my shop door, and saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the way, at Mr. Gooch's door—my shop is not immediately opposite Mr. Gooch's—it may be sixty or eighty yards from opposite—I saw him take down a brown coat, wrap it up, and either put it in his bag, or top of his bag, I cannot say which, because I was not paying attention—he then felt at a light-coloured coat which was at the door, next to the other one—I did not know but what he had bought it—I did not see any more, as I had a customer come in—after I had heard that Mrs. Gooch had lost a coat I communicated with her man—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

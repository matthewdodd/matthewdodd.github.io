On the 15th of November I lost a list carpet at about a quarter after two in the afternoon; I heard a man's foot in the shop, and my wife came up and said she saw the carpet on a man's shoulder in the street; I pursued, but he was got out of sight. I did not meet with him. It was taken out of the shop window. After that I saw it at Sir.

               <p>M. Terachina. It is about three months ago, or better.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>M. Terachina. I had seen him once or twice before. He told me I should have it very cheap, and that I need not be afraid of buying it. I bought it, and gave him what he asked for it, which was 8 s. I thought I could sell it again, but I was very ill and I could not go out; a little after this my husband went away and left me, and a little after that,

             took my husband up, and then came and grossly abused me, and said he would take me up: then for my safety, and the good of my King and country, I went and told the Justice of this carpet, and the Justice thought proper to admit me an evidence:</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was before the justice. I produced a pattern of the carpet. It matched as to breadth and colour. (Produced in court.) I verily believe it to be mine, but I should be loth to swear it.</p>

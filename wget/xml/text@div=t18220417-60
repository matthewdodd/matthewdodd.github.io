On Sunday the 3d of March, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a loin of mutton, and took one up. I knew him before by his buying meat of us; I told him to go to the scales and have it weighed; he had it jointed, and was going out with it. Mr. Somers stopped him at the door, and asked if he had paid for it; he said Yes, he had paid Mrs. Somers. I said he had not; and took him to her, and she said he had not. I am positive it was never weighed.</p>

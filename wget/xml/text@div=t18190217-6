Before he took the horse, he was to take a bundle of papers to my agent in Threadneedle-street, to be sent to India - he was also to take an animal called a Macaw to Exeter Change, to be taken care of for me. After giving him these orders, I sent for Parry, and informed him that I expected a gentleman to call with a post-chaise for me, and to tell him he would find me in Somerset-street. Parry was to remain in the house till I returned.

            . The prisoner came into my service on the 7th of January - he told me he was in great distress, and wanted clothes and every necessary. I never saw him with a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to town did you see him - A. No. I left town on Thursday morning, returned late on Saturday night, and found he had entirely left me. He had given me no notice, nor had I in any way discharged him. In consequence of information which I received, I searched for valuable property which I had recently brought from abroad, and missed the property stated in the indictment, which was all safe in a bureau when I left town. The gold coin consisted of a quantity of Napoleons, Louis-d'ors, and fourteen large Portugal coins worth four hundred rials each, nine pagodas, and an antique gold coin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any particular article of wearing apparel in your possession - A. I had a hunting-frock of a particular make, it was as good as new, I never gave it away. I missed that, with a pair of plush breeches, and a piece of plush out of a chest which had two locks on it - they were locked, and the keys were in a drawer, were the valuable property was. The property which I lost cost me between 400 l. and 500 l. Parry remained in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this you had a very long pursuit after the prisoner - A. Yes; I went to Ireland, and secured him at a house in a village there - I found the hunting-frock and breeches in his bundle. I asked him where his bundle of clothes was? he said they were in his bed-room. I had the bundle brought down, he said it was his; I took them into my possession - they were then very dirty, and appeared to have been worn. I had received a letter from him. I asked him how he came by the clothes? as I did not then know I had lost them. He said he got them out of a trunk, the key of which he found in the drawer, and that he found the key of that drawer in a writing-desk drawer - I did not know I had left it there, but I found a key in the house afterwards which opened the drawer, it was not mine. I asked him how he could behave in such a manner towards me? he said it was not him. I asked him why he went away then? he said he had gone away, but that was his misfortune. A gold Napoleon was produced by the constable. He said he brought it from Gibraltar. He admitted the house had been robbed, but threw the blame on Parry. I desired him to be cautious in charging others, as I had examined Parry very minutely, and found him innocent of it in my opinion. He then said I owed him five or six days wages, and wanted payment. I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170006"></xptr>him that was nothing, compared to the loss I had been at. He said I had hung and transported thirty servants, and that I was a very notorious character. I left him with the constable, and went to the port, to arrange for his passage to England, as they would not put him in prison. On my return to the constable's house, I found the prisoner had got away. I returned to England - this was in February or March. I heard nothing more of him till last September. In consequence of what I heard, I went to Dumfries, in Scotland, and afterwards found he had been taken in Ireland again. I found him in custody last November, took him in Down, and brought him to London.</p>

               <p>Q. In the way did any thing happen - 
               <persName id="t18190217-6-person102">A. </persName>
            He made a very great resistance in Ireland gaol - I was obliged to have a soldier to come to town with him. When we were between Downpatrick and Belfast, he said I had been an excellent master to him. The soldier asked him how he could serve his master so, and that he would be hung for it? he said he should not, for he did not care for that, as it was not the first time he had forfeited his life, and he was lucky. He then asked the name of a lady, who, he said, came to my house in my absence, and rummaged my drawers, and said she might have stolen the things as well as him. When we got to the Peacock, at Islington, I put him by the fire-side while I went for a coach. On my return he had seized the poker, and swore he would destroy my soul, and send me to hell before he was hung. I handcuffed him, and took him to the watch-house, from thence to Hatton-garden, and afterwards to Marlborough-street, where he was committed. I have found none of my property, except the frock and breeches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. How long before had you seen the frock - A. In the week before, I dare say. I had seen the diamond ring three or four days before. I have no female servant. I always sleep in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have accused servants of robbing you before - A. Never, except one.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he escaped from the constable - I believe you had a dispute with the constable about a reward - A. No, nothing of the kind. I never tried to get him to confess. He was a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it extraordinary for a soldier to have a Napoleon - A. When he came to me he represented himself as greatly distressed, and without clothes - he was obliged to borrow money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he engaged to serve you by the week - A. Yes; his wages were due on Saturday. There were five or six days due to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house is your's - A. I am the owner. There are stables and a coach-house on the ground-floor, and five rooms above. There are two keys, one of which I took out of town with me, and Parry had the other. There is a side passage from the door, which leads up to the rooms. The property was in a chamber up stairs, adjoining my sitting-room, where I keep all my trunks.</p>

            . On the 4th of February I and the prisoner were in the service of Mr. Parkins. My master went out of town between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and gave me orders to take care of the property - the prisoner was not present then. My duty was in the stable and in the house - I had a great deal to do in the stable. My master gave me no orders to go to Threadneedle-street. About three o'clock a man came to the stable, and asked the prisoner if he had taken the letters to Threadneedle-street? he said they were not gone, as he had been to see for them, and they were not ready. The man asked the prisoner to take them, he said he would not, for he was going to Egham with two hunting-horses; the man then asked me to take them; I said I had no orders from my master to take them, and I was a stranger in that part of the town - the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You must take them, as I cannot." The man begged of me to go, and I agreed to it. The man said he would go with me, to put me in the way. We sat out between four and five o'clock, and left the prisoner in the stable cleaning the horse he had brought home. I went up stairs into the house, changed my dress, returned to the man, told him I was ready, and came down stairs with the man. I locked the door, the windows and every thing were safe, and put the key in my pocket. I asked the prisoner if I should leave it with him or take it? he said I should take it, as he was going to Egham, and did not know whether he should return at night. I went to Threadneedle-street, and returned about eleven o'clock at night, having met a friend in Holborn. When I got back I let myself in, and found the door as I left it. I found M'Vey and the hostler up stairs. I saw the prisoner at the top of the stairs with a light in his hand; he asked me where I had been so long? and said that while I was out the house had been robbed. The hostler then came to the head of the stairs and said,</p>
               <p>"Now you are come I will go." I let him out, returned to the prisoner, and found him in the sitting-room. A mattress had been brought down and put on the floor - he said he was going to sleep there. I asked him if he missed any of my master's property? he said it was no matter to me whether he missed anything or not. I said I was going to the public-house to get some beer, and asked him if I should get him any? he said No; and if I had been at home the house would not have been robbed. I went to the public-house, returned in about a quarter of an hour, and found the prisoner lying on the mattress in the sitting-room - he slept there all night. I went up stairs with my friend, whom I fetched from the public-house, as I was afraid to sleep there by myself - next morning I let my friend out. The horses were not taken to Egham.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do next morning - A. I went to the stable, and saw the horses were all safe, but missed my master's dog. I met the prisoner on the stairs, and asked him what had become of the dog? he said he took it out the evening before, and lost it, and after looking for it a great while, he returned, found the horses at a livery stable, and took them back to the stable; that he then found the back-window open, and on going into the yard, he found the shutter had been lifted up - he then went back to tell the hostler of the livery stable, that the house was robbed, and brought him back to see if anybody was in the house - that they got lights; the hostler brought a ladder, and he got in at the window, sent the servant home, and half an hour after he had searched every room except that next to his master's sitting-room, when he got a matress to sleep on, and a man bounced out of this room, and ran into the pantry; that he shot the man as he ran, and was sure he had hurt him very severely, for he fell, and groaned very much; that the man got out at the back sash-window,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170007"></xptr>the same as he got in at; I suppose it is fourteen feet from the ground. He said he shot at him while he was getting through the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a man on getting out of that window, get into a private yard - A. Yes, it is enclosed by buildings - he must get into my master's passage, and then into the street - there was a door in the yard which is not locked. He said he came to the window, and called watch, but none came; that he then ran to the window, and jumped out after the man, but he got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into the yard to see if there was any blood - A. Yes, I looked next day, there was nothing of the kind in any part. He said he got the watchman's light, but could not find the man, and then went to the livery stable to ask if the hostler might come, and stop with him until his fellow-servant returned.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time that day, which was Friday, did he go out - A. About eleven or twelve o'clock; he said he should return in two hours - he returned about seven o'clock, and asked me to go to the public-house and get some beer with him and a friend, which I did - a man named

               <p>Q. When did you see him with a watch - A. Not till that Friday - it was a good silver watch. I asked him how long he had had it? he said a long while, but it had been at Chelsea to be repaired - this was before he went to the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was short of money or not - A. He borrowed 4 s. of me on Thursday morning to pay his expences to Egham, as he had forgot to ask his master.</p>

            . I fetched him from the public-house when I found what had happened, and he slept with me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you leave the house of your own accord, or by the desire of the prisoner - A. By desire of the prisoner. Lindsey waited in the sitting-room, while I changed my clothes - he was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRENT. I am hostler to Mr. Hains, who lives in Riding-house-lane. On Thursday, the 5th of February, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner came to me, and said he was locked out, and could not get in, that the windows were left open, and he thought the house would be robbed, and he wanted to go home to sleep with his wife, at Pimlico; I told him by no means to do so, but get a ladder, and get in at the window. I went and found the casement open - it opens into the yard; I believe it is the room which is used as a kitchen. We got a ladder, and the prisoner got in at the window, which was open - I gave him a light, and left him - I took the ladder away with me. When he got into the house, he said he thought all was safe. In about an hour after I heard the report of a pistol, and my wife went to the gate; there was a cry of Watch! I heard Mr. Parkins's house was robbed. My mistress sent me there. I went, and found another ladder placed on the wall, against the same window; I got in at the window, and saw the prisoner; he wished me to go all over the house with him, which I did, and could see nobody. I asked him if he thought anything was lost? he could not tell, but there was a man burst out of the room as he got into bed, struck him on the head, and wished him good night; that he took a pistol off the shelf, and fired at him. After we had searched, he said,</p>
               <p>"Now we will go to bed." I said I should do no such thing, for I would have a fire lit, and sit up there all night - Parry came to the door, and let himself in; the prisoner said the house had been robbed through his not being there - I wished them good night. I looked immediately to see if there was any blood, as he said he was sure he had wounded the man, but could see none; some persons were collected out of doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You heard the report of the pistol - A. Yes, and went there. Parry knocked at the door; the prisoner said</p>
               <p>"You have got the key, let yourself in. I saw no other ladder in the yard when I went there with him - both parts of the window were wide open.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Riding-house-lane. On the night in question my attention was drawn to the house from eight till ten o'clock. I went out about eight o'clock, and saw Mr. Parkins's back-window open; it looks towards our street-door, the passage leading to Mr. Parkins's door, leads to ours also. I thought it was extraordinary for the window to be open - there was a great light inside; I heard the rattling of something being moved. About ten o'clock I was going to bed, heard the report of a pistol, and ran out immediately; the prisoner called out</p>
               <p>"Run to the bottom of the gate, I have shot a man." I ran to the gate - it is a very heavy gate, and was just ajar - it was not sufficiently open for a man to run out. I called for a watchman who came; the prisoner said the man jumped out, and came on the stones, and that he must have shot him in the back; he said</p>
               <p>"Let us look if we cannot find some marks of blood;" there was none, which there must have been if the man had fell as he said. He said the man he had shot had on white trowsers and jacket, but no hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he at this time - A. He had climbed down out of the window, which was open, and come on the pavement into our garden; he had just jumped down when he called me - there is a partition to the stable, which would assist a man in getting down from the window, it is slanting, and about six or seven feet high. He said the man came across the room as he was going to bed, and said good night, and he instantly took Mr. Parkins's pistol, and fired at him. He afterwards said the man laid six or seven minutes on the stones, which was impossible, for I got out half a minute after I heard the report.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened next day - A. About ten or eleven o'clock he came to our house, and said he was afraid Parry was the robber, for he had come with his head tied up, his jacket on, and his back appeared to be swelled. He came again about two o'clock, and said twelve or thirteen men had come to the stable, and Parry was gone off with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170008"></xptr>them. He said he told Parry to take off his jacket to clean the horses, but he would not. I never saw him after.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Parry - A. Two or three days after, I think, on the Sunday, he then appeared as he always did - I could see nothing on his back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You ran out immediately on hearing the report - A. Yes, and came to the spot immediately, the prisoner was then getting down from the window.</p>
               <p>JAMES M'CARTY. I am watchman of Riding-house-lane. I heard the report of the pistol - I was then on the other side of the way, opposite. I saw nobody run out of the house; nobody could run out without my seeing them, it was impossible - nobody came out whatever. I heard watch called, ran to the spot, and met a man at the door; he said somebody had been there, and told me to go in - I went into the passage and sprang my rattle. The prisoner said he had shot a man, and he was sure there must be blood in the passage - there was none. I am sure no man came out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did you know where the report came from - A. Not exactly. I could see the door from where I was. I heard the report.</p>

            . I am a pensioner of the 26th regiment of foot. I know the prisoner. I met him on a Friday early in February last, I believe it was the 6th. I met him between six and seven o'clock in the evening, at Chelsea, by the Orange Coffee-house. I went to the Hart, public-house, and had two pints of beer with him - we went towards Pimlico. He said he was going to Ireland that night - I said,</p>
               <p>"Why should you leave your master?" he said there was a woman with child by him, and his master threatened to put him in prison if he did not take her out of the country. I went on with him till we came to a watchmaker's shop, opposite the Bag of Nails, public-house, at Pimlico; he told me to stop till he came out - he came out in about half an hour, and said he had been in for his watch. We went to the Gun tavern, and had a glass of rum each. He then gave me 4 s., and told me to call on his wife, and tell her he would send for her as soon as he got to Ireland. He paid for every thing. He said I might help him out of town with his bundles - I said I would. We went to the George, and had a pot of beer; he told me to wait there while he fetched his fellow-servant. It was about a quarter after eight o'clock when he brought Parry in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of Parry's back being hurt then - A. No. We sat there, and had another pot of beer, and some bread and cheese. The prisoner asked Parry for the key a bit - he got it, and went out for a quarter of an hour; when he came back he appeared uneasy. We came out, he wished Parry a good night, and said he would be back directly. We then went to the Swan, public-house. He said to a man, who appeared to be the landlord,</p>
               <p>"Give me that bundle - you have often told me what Mr. Parkins was, and I am going to leave him to-night." We had a glass of gin each. I went a little way with him, and carried his bundle. When he got to the road, he inquired for Highgate. We had half a pint of gin at a public-house - a man came in, and sat by the prisoner's side; he pulled out the watch, and told the man he had bought it, and gave four or five guineas for it. He then pulled a large ring out of his pocket, told the man it was a diamond ring, and that he bought it for his sister; it appeared a large diamond. The man said,</p>
               <p>"It is a large ring, I don't think it is all gold" - the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"It is; I bought it as such, and am going to carry it home to my sister." He put it into his pocket, and pulled out a bunch of pearls in a cluster, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have bought these also for my sister" - there appeared a great many of them. The man said they were very nice things, but he did not know the value of them. He inquired for a lodging at Highgate, but could get none. He got a bed at the White Lion, public-house, at Finchley, and ordered the coach in the morning to carry him to Liverpool. I stopped there, and had some beer. As I was going away, he gave me 6 s. - I left him there, and saw no more of him. When he was at the public-house, he pulled out some bank notes, and said,</p>

               <p>"Ward, I have plenty of money!" The bundle was pretty heavy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORRIS. Q. You was taken up for this robbery - A. Yes; the man who took me told me I was implicated in it - I told this story.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no secret of leaving his master's service - A. No; he told Parry he was going to return.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you examined at Hicks's Hall, or put to the bar as a prisoner - A. I was taken to the office, there was nobody there. Mr. Parkins never charged me with the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever hear him say how his master treated him - A. He told me it was a good place. When he went into the silversmith's, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have been in there for my watch."</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Magene, of Prince's-row, Pimlico, opposite the Bag of Nails public-house. In February last the prisoner came to our shop - I am pretty sure he is the man, but will not be positive - it was in the evening. I do not remember what day of the week it was. He asked me if I bought old gold coin? my master said, sometimes. He produced a small Indian piece; my master said he did not know the value of it - he urged distress, and my master agreed to buy it. Next evening he brought several others, there were some Napoleons and pagodas - my master bought 9 l. or 10 l. worth. He received a silver watch, and I believe, a gilt chain and seal, and the rest in notes - I believe the watch was valued at 50 s. He produced a bunch of pearls, which he said he was going to give to his sister. He left no watch to be repaired, but bought one. When he came the second day, he said he had got a place, and was going out with Lord Cochrane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You are not certain of his being the man - A. I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you inquire how he got the property - A. He said he was a soldier, and come from abroad - he was very shabbily dressed; it is very common for soldiers to bring these things.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What room does this window belong to - A. A little pantry, which joins my master's sitting-room - it was shut and bolted inside when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170009"></xptr>I went out. One of the panes, I think, was broken, so that a person could put their hand through and undoe it - it was not dark when I went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at York barracks, Chelsea, and engaged with the prosecutor. I got some money at Cox and Greenwood's to take me to Ireland, and they desired me to go home with it - my master had engaged another servant; he was always bringing his servants into trouble, which made me anxious to get away. I gave him notice on Tuesday evening of my wish to leave him when the week was out; he refused to give me the testimonials of my character, which were in his possession. On the Thursday morning he was going out of town, he sent me with a letter to Sir

            , and told me to send Parry with the papers to Threadneedle-street. I found two strange men in the room with Perry; he said they were come to buy the old coach; he went out with them, and did not return until eleven o'clock in the morning. He then went with the papers, and returned about half-past nine o'clock at night; before he returned I saw the back-window open; I got Brent to bring a ladder, and help me into the house. I had not been long a-bed, when a man ran by me as I lay on the floor; I fired at him with the prosecutor's pistol, and called Stop thief! he jumped out of the window upon the wall - I thought he was either hurt by the fall or wounded with the pistol. I called Watch! no one came to my assistance, and he escaped - the watchman came at last. I got Brent to come and stop with me till Parry came home, which he did in about half an hour, and called out</p>
               <p>"Dan, open the door!" I was surprised he should know I was in the house; he was drunk. Next day I got everything ready for my departure for Ireland - I was four days at home, when I was taken by a constable. The prosecutor had given me the coat and breeches; he said if he could get no more of his property, he would swear to them - the constable taking him for a madman, would not hold me in custody. I have been in the habit of going to and from Gibraltar for nearly seven years, by which means I became possessed of a quantity of foreign coins. I was afterward apprehended again, and the prosecutor brought me to London. I was treated most cruelly on my journey.</p>

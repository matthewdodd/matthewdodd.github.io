On the 14th of November, between five and six o'clock at night, I saw all his sheep right - there were twenty: I went next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, and one was gone - I saw some blood on the ground, and a few nuts at the gate of the next field; I saw an ass had been tied to a post, near the gate; I know it was an ass, by the hoof marks; I saw some wool on the little quick hedge, as if a sheep had been driven through. I got a warrant, and went to the prisoner's house at Edgware, and found a leg of mutton in a cupboard - it had been in the pot - it was boiled a little, and all greasy. I found a sheep's head and some fat in a basket - it appeared fresh killed; we found the skin and entrails in the place behind; the skin was not well taken off; they were Leicester long-wool sheep, two years old - we call them two-teethed wether sheep; I found such teeth in the head; I believe the skin to be the skin of master's sheep; and the ear of it, which is marked, is here.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house with the patrol and constable; he is a green-grocer, and keeps an ass and small cart; we found the cart in the yard, cleanly washed out, and set up to dry; we went into the house, and saw a woman, who said "For God's sake, what do you want?" we found a leg of mutton in the cupboard, and what Johnson has stated.</p>

            . I know Richard Franklyn, and his farm - I work on the road as a labourer. On the 14th of November, about a quarter-past eight o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner leading an ass, drawing a load in a cart; it appeared to me to be bed-clothes - it was on a Tuesday; he was between Edgware and Hendon - he was going towards Hendon, and on the off side of the cart, I saw written, "John Chapman, Little Stanmore," and behind the cart was a man named Samuel Weedon, shoving; he knew me, and said "How are you old man;" I said "How are you?" it was on Tuesday - I cannot say whether it was the 13th or 14th.</p>

            . I saw all the sheep safe on Wednesday, the 14th, and missed one next morning; here is the sheep's ear; it has a cut on it; it is the same mark as that on the other nineteen, and there is a mark on the rump of the skin, but it is nasty, as the entrails have been wrapped in it, and it is probably rubbed out; here is the remains of a pitch-mark, and the head was marked with ruddle.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to STANBRIDGE GINGER. Q. Are you not an officer? A. Yes - I know Weedon; he is gone away somewhere - I have not looked for him, but other officers have; he lived at Finchley. The prisoner bore a very good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Weedon brought the sheep to my house; he came to me, and I let him a room, and next day took my cart to get his goods - I went into a public-house; Weedon and his brother came in, and sat there from four to ten o'clock; we then got into my cart, and Weedon drove it home, and when we got within a quarter of a mile, he hoisted me out of the cart, as I was tipsy, and asked if I knew what was in it - I said No; he then said, "It is a woolley bird;" I felt in the cart, and said it was a sheep; he said he had picked it up, and it would do for his dogs - I said, next day, "We shall have a piece of work about it;" he said No; he skinned it next day.</p>
               <p>STANBRIDGE GINGER, He said nothing about Weedon, when we were at his house.</p>

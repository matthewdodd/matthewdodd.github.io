                  </hi> I keep an oil and Italian warehouse in Strutton<lb></lb>ground, Westminster The prisoner, Edmund Lewell Wilson, was my traveller, and had to obtain orders—it was his duty to enter them in a book, and cause them to be delivered by Michael Wilson, who was the carman—if Edmund received money, it was his duty to pay it to me immediately—Michael was authorized to receive money when goods were paid for on delivery—here is the cash-book, in which all money received was entered—on the 26th of March Edmund paid me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as received from Mr. Cracknell, and on the 20th of March here is en<lb></lb>tered in the order-book, two gallons of pickled cabbage to Mr. Cracknell, but no order for any treacle—if he received an order for pickles and treacle from him, it was his-duty to enter them both—I have never received from him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for 141bs. weight of treacle—this bill of parcels—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is my brother Frederick's writing, except the 14lbs. of treacle, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is Michael Wilson's writing, and "Received, E.

               <p>wrote "paid" opposite to it in the day-book, and then enter it in the cash<lb></lb>book—I sometimes did that in his presence—it has never happened in the payment of accounts that money has stood over to be paid by him after<lb></lb>wards—about four years ago he deposited some money in my hands, and I settled his wages with him every quarter, or if it went on to the half year, I considered it as due to him, and paid him five per cent, for it—I have about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his—he had regular wages, but on pickles I allowed a penny a gallon between him and my brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chemical operator at Apothecaries-hall. I received three parcels from Kendall, in the early part of Dec. last—they con<lb></lb>tained oxalic acid—I ascertained that by subjecting them to a series of chemical examinations, and the result quite satisfied me of the nature of their con<lb></lb>tents—the two packages described to me as having been sent to Mr. Clouter, contained one fifty grains, and the other thirty-five grains—the corners of the papers were a good deal worn, and the acid was liable to be spilt out—I am not prepared to say whether the quantity contained in those two papers, if taken into the body, would be capable of causing death—we have no direct</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 3—"Newgate, London, Feb. 14, 1846. Dear brother,—About eighteen months ago Harriet gave a little party consisting of some of the neighbours' children to come to tea and spend the evening, among whom was Elizabeth Spriggs. At the time the party was given I asked to leave off my work about a quarter to seven; when I came home I noticed Elizabeth, but as I had never seen her before I did not look at her much at that time; in the course of the evening I had to go in to Mrs. Howe's, our next door neigh<lb></lb>bour, to fetch something, when she said to me, 'Did you notice what a very pretty girl that little Miss Spriggs is,'(meaning Elizabeth), and I said no, because being a stranger to me I did not think to look at her more than any of the others; when I went in the room again I did look at her, and I thought she was very handsome, and for about a week afterwards I could not forget her, and during that time I noticed persons (neighbours or their children) speaking to her, and it made me feel rather jealous to think that they could speak to her and I could not, and so I determined in my own mind that she should not speak to any one, and so I took some oxalic acid out of the bot<lb></lb>tom drawer in our parlour and took and bought two seidlitz powders, for which I gave 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I took and ground this oxalic acid up fine, and took and mixed it with the seidlitz powders, and put it in a letter, and posted it and sent it to Elizabeth, at Miss Ward's; at the time I wished it to kill her, but I was sorry afterwards that I had sent it at all; the letter was merely telling her to take it with a little cold water, and telling her I would come to tea with her on the following Sunday; however, I did not take any more notice of her till about three months after, when I saw her again. On new year's night Harriet gave another little party, and that was where I did see her again, and every word she spoke to any one made me feel jealous, and so I thought in my own mind that I would murder her, and so I wrote that letter threatening to murder her as she returned from St. George's church on the following Sun<lb></lb>day evening, which was some weeks after the second party, but I never, at the time, meant to fulfil the threat—however, the fact was, I had for a long while read a great many of Lloyd's works, in which were some most wonder<lb></lb>ful characters, and I thought at the time I could do as was represented in the books, and appear a very mysterious character, and then after that I wrote them letters to Miss Ward, and then to Mrs. Spriggs, and then to Mr. Humble; and when I signed your name and Miss Ward's name, which was signed in the first letter sent to Mr. Humble, I did not do it with the intention of doing either you or her any harm, and when I had gone so far writing so many let<lb></lb>ters I could not drop it, and so I thought I would send to Clouter's, not that I owed any of them any spite, nor did I, when I sent the poison to Elizabeth Clouter, wish her to take it, or wish her any harm—and then I sent some to Mr. Bowling's, and then to Mrs. Humble, and although I sent the poison to her I did not wish her to take it, for it was impossible for me to owe spite to a person who I never did see; and when I sent that letter to the church about Elizabeth's mother I did not owe her any spite, nor did I wish to injure her, but I thought it would be a <hi rend="italic">lark.</hi> These are the facts of the case. My reason for beginning it, was as I have stated, concerning Elizabeth Spriggs, but I had no reason for keeping it up, nor did I ever wish to injure any one, but I used to think it a rare <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, and at the time I was not aware of the dangerous course I was pursuing. Dear brother, I have now stated it all to you. I am sorry, very sorry to think that I have pursued such a wicked course, but when I get my liberty again I promise I will fulfil that promise that I will do no<lb></lb>thing but what is upright and just. I used to write the letters up in Mr. Lewis's composing-room, during my dinner-hour, and I used to post them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230149"></xptr>
               <p>when I went out. The first letter that was took to Miss Ward's I took there; it has cost me a trifle for postage, and besides, losing my time in writing them. If I only had the last eighteen months to go over again, and knew as much as I do now I should never be in trouble now. The three last letters that I wrote to Elizabeth was just what I felt towards her—and about going to Miss Ward's with the knife the night that I was taken, which was Feb. 3rd, 1846; when I knocked at the door the servant came and she asked me what I wanted; I said I wanted to see Miss Ward, and she said I could not see Miss Ward, but I could leave any message and she would take it to her, or if I would leave my name she would go and tell her, but I objected to that and said I wanted to see her; so she shut the door, while I waited outside, and said she would go and tell Miss Ward. In about three minutes' time Miss Ward came down and opened the door to me, and asked me what I wanted, so I said I wanted to see Miss Elizabeth Spriggs; so she wanted to know what for, and I would not tell her; so while I was talking some gentleman came to the door, so she called him by his name, and she said I had better come in; so we all went into the passage, and she then asked me what I wanted to see Elizabeth for, and so did the gentleman, saying he did not con<lb></lb>sider it a proper thing for a youth like me to see a young girl like that alone, however, I persisted in seeing her, and alone; so Miss Ward was quite agree<lb></lb>able, but the sister was not, and so, while I was waiting in the passage they sent for a policeman, and he also asked me, but I would not tell, so he asked me my name and address, and I told him, and then we went to the station-house; so he asked me what I had got about me, and I did not answer; how<lb></lb>ever, he searched me and found the knife. Now, if I had have seen Elizabeth Spriggs alone I meant to have told her I loved her, and asked her if she would try to have liked me, as I was a going to be tried to-morrow, found guilty, and then, perhaps, I might be away a long while, and I meant to have pulled out the knife and told her I would kill her when I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> her again if she would not do as I had told her, and then I meant to come away. The knife being dirty when I brought it away from home in the morning, in my tea-time I rubbed it on the stone, with the intention of cleaning it, not sharp<lb></lb>ening it. Talk about harming her, I would not harm a hair of her head, for I love her too dearly. While I was standing in the passage Miss Ward asked me if I sent those three last letters, and I said no, and I also denied telling her who I was, and she asked me if I had heard she had been annoyed by a great many letters, and if I had sent them, for she thought my name was Kil<lb></lb>lerby, she did not say why; I told her I had heard about it, but I did not send them, nor did I know the person that did. I was in the passage talking to her about half an hour. Now I have stated all the particulars just as they occurred. I am very sorry to think I have acted as I have, and when I get out of this trouble I will never do anything that shall bring me into trouble again. I have now told you all of it. Be so kind as to write to me, so that I may have the letter, the latest moment at two o'clock on Tuesday next, just telling me how to act. I have been the only person concerned in it, and I never did think that you bore any affection towards Elizabeth, nor did I suppose any one did. I have to ask pardon of all of you, and you also, dear brother. You must excuse bad writing, and you must make the sense you can of it, for all the trouble I have brought upon you and all the family.—Your truly sorrowful but affectionate brother, <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY KIILERBY</hi>."</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on the 24th of August, about twelve o'clock in the day, she asked me if I would send some spencers to a lady, the lady was not able to come herself; I called one of my young woman to go with the spencer, and the prisoner. The prisoner conversed with me in the shop near twenty minutes, which gave me an opportunity to recognise her again. When the young person was ready, I packed up the spencer, and gave it to her, and told her to go with the lady to Hart-street. I worked for several ladies in Hart-street, Bloomsbury, and thought it might be for some of them. The young woman returned to me again, as white as ashes, and in such a tremble, she could not tell what to do; when the servant came back, she told me she had been to the Bath hotel. I went to the hotel, and asked who the person was that wanted the spencer; they said, they knew nothing about the lady. The second time I saw the prisoner was in St. Martin's-court; a lady that was with me, said only look at these two girls; I looked at them, and stood looking at them ten minutes. I said, there is the person that took the spencer from me; her face was towards me as she was eating the pastry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she look off you - A. Not that I know of. I went away from the window with intent to get a person to take her into custody; the person with me said, I would not take her now. We watched her out; I said, I would go home and fetch Louisa, and see if she was of the same opinion. She walked up New Street; I fetched Louisa; she said, that is the person, I first saw her on the 24th of August, this was on the 25th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from your looking at her in the pastry cook's shop, and your seeing her in New Street - A. An hour. I had a full view of her in the pastry cook's shop; she might not see me. When Louisa recognized her in New-street, Covent Garden we followed her up King-street, down New-street again; I went into George-street to inquire for a constable; not finding one, I went into a public house, saw a watchman; he went with me, I laid hold of the prisoner; she was with Clara then, that is her and then I got to the light, I said, to the watchman, this is the woman take charge of her; she pulled herself away, and said she was not the person. I was mistaken. She went to the light because I would not let go of her, she pulled off her bonnet at Bow-street, at the first examination I swore to her; the same as I did the second examination, and the more I see her the more I think it to be her.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to the prosecutrix. On the 24th of August, I went with the prisoner to the Bath hotel, in Hart-street, Covent Garden, at twelve o'clock in the day; she knocked at the door, and a servant let her in; she walked into the back parlour; she desired me to set down until she returned, I thought she went up stairs to a lady. Finding she did not return, I went out to the landing-place, called the boy who was cleaning knives; I asked him if he knew any thing of the person who had brought me there with the spencer; he said, he knew nothing of her; he called a person of the name of Mrs. Brown. I asked her if she knew any thing of the person; she said, she did not. I went out of the room, and I never saw the spencer after that. When the prisoner came to me, she said, give me the spencer, and I will go and fit it on the lady. That is all I know, I gave it her. I am certain the prisoner is the person. The spencer has never been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general clothier, living in Albion-road, Woolwich, and I have another shop at 132, High-street, Woolwich—the prisoner was my shopman—he had the care of the shop, 132, High-street, for eight weeks—he was the only one in the shop; my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> sometimes came there in the afternoon—on 16th June, I missed from the shop, four coats, a pair of trowsers, one shirt, and some leggings—I told the prisoner that the stock was short—he said they were all right—I asked him if he had sold them—he did not say he had—I found the articles upon him; in his pocket—I found one pair of leggings in the inside pocket of his coat; also two cap<lb></lb>covers, and one waistcoat—the policeman took some keys from him, and we went to his lodgings, where I found one white shirt; two waistcoats; one necktie—these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all mine—I had not sold them to him;</p>

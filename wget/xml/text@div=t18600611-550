                  </hi>. I am a dressing-case manufacturer of Siae-lane—on 16th April the prisoner called and selected a despatch-box; the invoice was to be made out in the name of Boucher, and sent to Metcalfe, Musgrave and Co. of Goldsmith-street—the price was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had known those gentle<lb></lb>men some years, and had no hesitation in sending it, which I did with a receipted invoice, directed the porter to leave the box and bring back the money—I heard these directions given by my young man Bottomley to his brother, who is my porter—he brought back the invoice but not the money—this is the box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is quite new.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Messrs.

I took this despatch-box to Goldsmith-street, and saw the prisoner and another man—the other man took it and opened it, looked at it and said, "I do not know anything about it, you had better take it back"—the prisoner said, "No, there is no occasion to do that, you may as well leave it"—I told him that I was to have the money for it, and then the other one said, "Mr. Metcalfe is not in"—I asked him when he would be in—he said, "In about half an hour"—I left the box and brought the invoice away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Manchester and have an office in Goldsmith-street, Cheapside—there was a person named Wood there, but he has absconded since this affair—he had no authority to let the prisoner go there—I never gave him authority to order a despatch-box for me—I never saw the prisoner before till he was brought before the Lord Mayor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

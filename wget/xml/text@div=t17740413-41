I told Mr. Chapman there had been three or four others offered for payment that I believed were drawn by the same hand. Knowing the person of the prisoner, I took him in the Borough, and brought him before my Lord Mayor; I sent to Mr. Chapman immediately, who came with the other witness, and swore to his person, first before my Lord Mayor, and afterwards before Sir

                  </hi>. I am a merchant. On the 15th of January, I was in Thames-street, and in turning up Bush-lane, 1 felt tome one at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner and another youth—they both ran down Bush-lane, and were stopped—I charged him with stealing my hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and a person came and brought my handkerchief, which had been dropped under a cart—I did not see the prisoner in possession of it, but it was picked up in the line he ran, and within a few feet of where he was stopped—one or two persons had ran when I called "Stop thief"—the pri<lb></lb>soner was close to me when I felt the pull at my pocket—I then missed my handkerchief, and pursued him—the handkerchief was thrown into the mud just off the pavement, near where he was running—I did not see it in his custody.</p>

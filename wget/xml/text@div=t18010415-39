             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an Excise-officer, at Yoxford: On the 31st of July, 1797. I went to a place called the <placeName id="t18010415-39-crimeloc206">Cross-bow, between Yoxford and Wangford</placeName>

               <p>Q. That was the first seizure; be so good as come to the second? - A. Before we got to Lord Rous's Park the prisoner passed us in a cart; I am sure of his person, I knew him very well; he had been sent back with one of the carts, and when I saw him he had got the cutter's men in the cart; he called us b-rs; we went up to Lord Rous's Lodge, and let them pass us, they were huzzaing; we went on, and in Lord Rous's Park we found to the number of sixty or seventy half ankers, I counted thirty in one lot; Mr. Gooch immediately went off for a waggon to convey them away, and while he was gone, I saw the smuggling carts coming from the White-hart, at Blithborough; I ordered one of the waggons that we had hired, to bring the half ankers out of the wood; we slaved a half anker, we knocked the head in, on purpose to taste it, it was foreign geneva; I told him I should seize that tub, and the rest of the tubs that were in the wood; I ordered my men to load the waggon, and when we had got about twenty half ankers in the waggon, the smugglers appeared upon the hill, in five carts they were about two hundred yards from us when I first saw them; when they saw us they huzzaed, d-d their eyes, and said they were glad to see us; I asked them what they wanted; the prisoner replied that he wanted to go past, he said the King's highway was as free for them as for us; he then said, d-n your eyes we want the tubs, and the tubs we will have; they immediately surrounded us, and blocked us in between the waggon and the pales, and their carts; Dick then jumped down off the cart, and said, d-n their eyes they are fixed; we charged them with our swords, and then we forced out between the carts, and we left the tubs behind; I told them they had got the tubs, but if they offered to move them I would fire at them; one of the sailors, with a straw hat on, came immediately up to me, and said, d-n your eyes shoot; he unbuttoned to his shirt, and said, here is a breast to shoot at; we then fired at them several times, and they retreated; they then charged us with pitchforks, and bludgeons, up the hill, and stoned us till we got loaded again, and then we drove them back again, and so we kept on for nearly half an hour; then they holloaed out that we should have twenty tubs; I then consulted Mr. Gooch, and we found we had only one cartridge a-piece left; then we said we would accept of twenty tubs; Little Dick's reply was, d-n your eyes we will not give you twenty; we then fired at them again, and then they agreed to give us twenty, and we carried them off; when we parted, he said to Mr. Gooch, d-n your eyes I will mark you; upon which I told him he would have to answer for the whole, for I knew him very well; I had seen him several times at Bawdsey, in Suffolk, he used to be along with a man that went by the name of Frenchman, I am sure that is the man; there were two foreigners in the party that could not speak a word of English, they assisted in picking up stones for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you always been as certain as you are to day? - A. I am certain to the man now at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been as certain? - A. I have been mistaken in a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150026"></xptr>Q. Have you not mistaken another man for him, as much unlike him as any man in Court? - A. I was once at his house, and they wanted to counterfeit Dick, and persuade me that another man was him.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking you about any thing that passed at his house. - Did you never, at any other place, charge any other man with being the man that you now charge the prisoner to be? - A. When we were going to serve the summons, we overtook a Mr. Woolner, we understood that Dick went out of Saxmundham before us upon a black horse, this was a man upon a black horse; and Mr. Woods; who was with me, said, don't look at him, and I will serve him; I passed him, and Mr. Woods spoke to him; I then turned round, and immediately said it is not Dick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go with Woolner to a public-house, and keep him till the landlord told you who he was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the house of Mrs. Buck, at Ash? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not there mistake another man for Dick? - A. No; that was the time when they were counterfeiting another man for Dick.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never in the same room with him and did not know him? - A. Never, to the best of my knowledge; if he was he was in disguise.</p>
               <p>Q. But if he had been in the same room with you, undisguised, you must have known him? - A. I suppose I must.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did you ever see this man, and were you about to take him? - A. Yes; I met him last November, and he presented a serew barrelled pistol at me.</p>

            , sworn, Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was with the last witness at Blithborough; I know the prisoner at the bar very well; I have known him ever since the year 1797; he came up in a cart, and there were a number of men in another cart; some had the appearance of landsmen, and some sailors; we had found the goods before they came up; we made a regular seizure of them; I am sure the prisoner was one of the men; he had a slop on; we had a scuffle for half an hour, and they rescued the goods from us; the prisoner was in one of the first carts that came up; three other carts came up upon us, and fixed us against the railing of Lord Rous's park, and he said, with an oath, "We have fixed you;" we drew our sabres, and forced our way out; I have not the least doubt that he is the man; I met him once since, going from Snape to Yoxford; but I had not the writ with me, and therefore I had no business with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Having no doubt of him, you never can have been in his company without recognizing him? - A. I never was, except at Bow-street, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen him in a party of fourteen or fifteen people, and sat down and drank with him you must have known him again as you knew him so perfectly? - A. I don't know, they wear so many different dresses.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he was not disguised, could you have been in his company for two hours together, and not have known him? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge any other person with being the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not stop some other person on the road and charge him with being the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not with Burdett when he charged Woolner with being the man? - A. No; I came up after him, and heard him say, I beg your pardon, Sir; but what had passed before I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take Woolner to a public-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. MAYOW sworn. - Examined by Mr. Attorney General. Q. You see the prisoner now, was he dressed in the same smart way when he was apprehended? - A. When I saw him at Bow-street, he was in a very dirty sailor's dress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you know how long he had been in custody? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I was an officer of Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Gooch? - A. Yes; he is an officer of the Customs, and Mr. Burdett is an officer of the Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they knew him or not? - A. I know they have not known him; one night Gooch and Burden called me up at my house, near Orford, in the county of Suffolk; I dressed myself, and came down; they asked me if I knew a man of the name of Little Dick; I told them, yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mean the prisoner? - A. Yes, that identical man; they said they wanted to take a man of the name of Little Dick, but they did not know him; I asked what they wanted, and they said there was a reward of fifty pounds from the Revenue to take him, because he was supposed to be of a party that rescued some goods; I told them I would assist in taking him, but they said positively they did not know him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Attorney-General. Q. For what fraud upon the Revenue were you dismissed from the office of Excise? - A. The Revenue were not defranded by me.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what was the gross fraud for which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150027"></xptr>you were dismissed their service? - A. I received a fine of the Revenue, and did not return it in due time, but the Revenue had their part, and I lost mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you received twenty-five pounds, as a fine, which you ought to have accounted for, and which you did not account for? - A. They had their due.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Burdett.) Q. Did you tell Thompson you did not know the person of Little Dick? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. At the close of 1797, do you remember seeing Burdett and Gooch? - A. Yes, by Little Glenham; there was one man on horseback, and two in a cart; Burdett I think accosted me first.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure, or do you speak doubtfully? - A. This is the man, certainly; he jumped out of his cart, and seized the reins of my horse; he said, d-n you, I have taken you now; I said, I see you have, but I don't know what authority you can have for doing it; he said, yes, he had; he then said, I think your name is Harnell; I told him I could not think what he meant by stopping me; he said, I think your name is Little Dick; upon which I said, you are near enough; they looked at each other, and hesitated some time, and then said, I believe we are mistaken; they stopped me, I suppose, about five minutes; Gooch was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they let you go as soon as they found their mistake? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Attorney General. Q. How soon afterwards did you see Little Dick? - A. I never spoke to him in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it that you saw him afterwards? - A. I dare say it was half a year before I saw him, to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the third man, who was on horseback before those who were in the cart, say something to you, or do something? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a third person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. The 3d of May.</p>
               <p>Burdett. It was Bird that got out of the cart, as Gooch can certify, I did not get out of the cart at all; Gooch was on horseback.</p>

I keep the Halberd public-house, at Ipswich: On the 20th of September, 1799, Harnell came to my house, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and stopped the whole day; and between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, Burdett and Gooch came in; Harnell was dressed in a coat very much like the one that he has on now, he was not at all disguised; I was smoaking my pipe with Harnell, when Burdett and Gooch came in; they sat within three or four feet of him, right opposite to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Must they have seen him; therefore? - A. They must have seen him; they did not change any discourse with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say directly, you are Little Dick; you were guilty of obstruction us, or any thing of that sort? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q. And you verily believe they did not know him? - A. They did not appear to know him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your company? - A. An hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney-General. (To Burdett.) Q. Were you at the house of that man on the 20th of September, 1799? - A. I was taking a man to jail, and I went to this man's house; I had a writ against a man that used his house, of the name of Edwards; I went in with Mr. Norman; I was not there five minutes; we had but one pint of beer, and we left some of that; Mr. Gooch was not with me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person there in the dress of the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did not observe any such person; I afterwards did arrest Edwards at his house.</p>


               <p>Q. Was Gooch ever with you at his house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You went there to look for somebody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you looked at the faces of every body in the room? - A. Yes; I looked into all the rooms.</p>
               <p>Gooch. I was there once about five minutes with Mr. Burdett, but that was in July; this house is notorious for the resort of smugglers; this gentleman is called the Telegraph. <rs id="t18010415-39-verdict207" type="verdictDescription">

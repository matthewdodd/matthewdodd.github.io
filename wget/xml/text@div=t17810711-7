             passed for his wife. He said, He had married this young lady, and was to receive 2000 l. and he could not receive it without her. I thought it was a great thing for him, and gave them the best entertainment I could. On the Friday they went away. I sat up till eleven o'clock. Nobody came. I took a candle, and went up stairs. The door was locked, but the spring had not gone into the receiver. I went into the room, and missed two silver spoons. He came the next morning, in hopes to have another benefit. My wife asked him for the spoons, and he ran away as fast as his legs could carry him. I had another room, next to that, where I keep my valuable things. I saw that room was broke open. My wife and I went into the room, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them from a list.) He told me his name was Oliver. I knew his face, but did not know his name. I made application to the Office in Bow-street. I found four gowns at Mrs. Griffiths's, a pawnbroker, in Bunhill-row. She delivered them up. She is not here. I found the other things at Mr. Ward's, facing St. Andrew's church, Holborn. I saw no more of the prisoner Thompson till he was in custody. They were taken by another person six weeks ago, and he came and told me they were in the Compter.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, at the corner of Union-court, Holborn. These things ( producing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110110"></xptr> two table-spoons, two tea-spoons, a coat, a pair of breeches, a pair of sheets, a petticoat, and three shirts) I took in pawn of the man at the bar, in the name of Smith, in March and April was twelvemonth. I lent him a guinea and a half upon them. I have served him many times. He gave me his direction, No. 10, Shoe-lane. I have not seen him these fifteen months. He used to be a constant customer. I missed him of a sudden.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor had other lodgers in the house beside myself. He employed others in the house. There was an elderly woman about his house that he gave an infamous character of at Guildhall. When I went out, I left my door open. The woman that attended this old gentleman used to say she was brought up in great repute, and used to make a public shew of them. I did not know but they were her own property. I pawned these things, and gave her the money. She lived in Shoe-lane, at a lodging I lodged at before I came to Churchill's. When I came home that night, she desired me not to say she gave me the things to pawn. I said I would not.</p>

               <p>I had a letter to go to Croydon. I went in the afternoon. I know nothing of what I am brought here for.</p>

               <p>To Prosecutor. Was there any such old woman, this man speaks of, in your house? - There was an old woman lived with a watchmaker that lodged in my house before. She owing me something, I let her lie in my kitchen, to do some jobbs for me, in order to pay myself. I said to this lady (Young),</p>

The prisoner came the 7th of August, and took the three pair of stairs floor, at 2 s. 6 d. per week. Thompson said he came from Reading, in Berkshire; he went by the name of Parker. He said he knew nobody in town, and desired to dine with the family. We agreed for 4 d. a dinner each. Some time afterwards, they had some words: Mrs. Young complained he would not let her have common necessaries. On that my wife lent her 1 s. On the 28th of August the man came home to dine, at four o'clock. I laid the cloth; and he sat down to dinner. The plate was in the beaufet. I left him and his wife, and went down stairs into the kitchen. In a few minutes after, his wife brought the meat down. I desired my wife to go up. She could not. I went up, and they were both gone. I missed the watch and plate. I never heard of the prisoner again till the 29th of August: then a gentleman came, and asked me if I had not been robbed ; that there were some persons in his house that answered my advertisement. I went home with him to his house, and saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110111"></xptr> the prisoners. I laid hold of Thompson's hands, and said,</p>

               <p>"You villain, what have you done with my watch and plate?" He said, Mr. Humphreys, I did not rob you; I only went away in your debt. I said,</p>

               <p>"You did rob me." He said, He did not mind that; it was only sending him three years to the lighters, and her two years to Newgate; and then we must take care of ourselves after that. I said, It would affect his life. He filled a glass of ale, and went down on his knees, and said, If I go up Holborn, I do not care; I will die game. After they were committed, I spoke to them at the Compter; and Thompson said, He was sorry for having robbed me, and my watch was at the pawnbroker's in the Minories: that he had taken out the maker's name and the number, and put in Graham or Young: the outside case was studded with gold; he had taken out that, and put in pinchbeck: that it had been pawned for five guineas; was taken out, and pawned again for four guineas: that he had taken the chain off, and put another on that cost him a guinea: and that all my plate was melted, and sold to Mr. Cox, in Little-Britain.</p>

               <p>My husband was a new-man. I was opposite the prosecutor's parlour window, and saw the woman prisoner come out. I cannot say to the day, or the month: it was about a year ago, and was about four o'clock in the afternoon. She went to the next door, and returned with a pint of beer in her hand. Presently after she had carried it in, she came out again, with neither hat nor cloak on; and I saw no more of her. Then I saw the man come to the parlour-door, and look into the court; and then he turned his head as if he was conversing with somebody in the parlour: then he came out with something in his hand, and a silk handkerchief over it. He walked hastily away, and wound the silk handkerchief round it as he walked. After that, I saw Mr. Humphreys come to the door in great agitation, and say he was ruined. Their fright was so great, they could not speak at first, or I could have had them stopped.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Winter, a pawnbroker, in the Minories. I have a gold watch, which I took in pawn of the prisoner Thompson, on the 4th of May, I believe it was; but I speak from guess. It was about a twelvemonth ago. He had pawned it before. He re-pawned it on the 4th of May, with this chain.</p>

               <p>(The watch was produced in court.)</p>

               <p>To Prosecutor. What sort of a watch was your wife's watch? - A striking clock watch; the maker's name Landaw, Temple-Bar.</p>

               <p>On what part of the watch was the maker's name? - I don't know; I cannot read: I only know by people that told me so: here is a person had it to clean.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a watch-maker, at No. 32, Cow-cross. Upwards of three years ago I cleaned an old striking watch (what we call a clock-watch) for Mr. Humphreys. I do not recollect the maker's name. The maker's name was on the pillar-plate and the middle piece of the dial-plate. (Looks at the watch.) This is the watch I cleaned. Now I see it, I recollect there was a ruby in the cock. I did not recollect it before. It had another case to it, a gold case.</p>

               <p>You say you remember the ruby on the cock of the watch? - Yes.</p>

               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>THOMPSON's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>That watch I bought, with others, in Flanders. It is impossible for any body to swear to that ruby. I have had five in my hand of the same size. At Guildhall he positively said he had had the watch fifteen years before his wife had it. The watchmaker said he had had the watch of the wife's in his hand: he would not swear that was it.</p>

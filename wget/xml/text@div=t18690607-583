                  </hi>. I am a brass finisher, of 32, Wootton Street—about 8.45 on this night my attention was called to a white glare of light in the prisoner's parlour, which is opposite me—the shutters were open then—I was in the street at the time—I saw the prisoner come out of his door, and close the shutters—it appeared to me that lie had been drinking—I don't think he was drunk—I said to him, "Tour place is on fire"—he said, "No, it ain't"—I said, "Yes, it is"—with that he walked up the street—I went and opened the shutters, and another witness forced open the street door, and we got into the front parlour—I saw the bed on fire in two or three places, and the curtains had caught from the bed—the place was full of smoke—we ran into the back room and found that in the sane con<lb></lb>dition—there was no fire in either room; there was a fire in a back wash-house, right at the back—the bed and bed clothes in the back room were on fire in one or two places—I got some water, and with the aid of one or <hi rend="italic">two</hi> neighbours put it out—we then went up stairs to the first floor front room, and the bedding there was all on fire, flaming, and the curtain too—if we had been five minutes later the place would have been too much heated for us—we put it out—we used up all the water there was in the place—it was all out when the firemen came—I stopped in the place till the prisoner was brought back—I went about the house—there was not a soul there—I went into every room, and I am quite sure there was no one in the house—the door of the up stairs room was shut—I could not say, in the excitement, whether it was looked or not—the doors of the down stairs rooms were shut, I don't know whether they were looked—the prisoner was brought back by a policeman in about an hour; he appeared to be more in drink then than when I first saw him—I could not discover any appearance of sulphur.</p>

About a fortnight after, she borrowed a cloak of my wife, to go to Hammersmith to see her aunt, who was ill; the daughter remained in the house eight or nine days afterwards; the prisoner did not return; the daughter said, she had heard from her mother, and her aunt was dead. On the 29th of November, the daughter disappeared; after three or four days, I had the door broken open on the 2d of December; I was not present at that time, my daughter was.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Mitchell.) Is that true? - A. No; I found her coming out of Newgate; she has a husband there for two years; I told her she had served me a very pretty trick, and said, I should be thankful if she would tell me where the things were; she said she knew nothing of them, she had the key in her possession; she acknowledged to nothing but the cloak, which never was returned.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. This man lodged in the next room to me, and things of this bulk could not have been carried out without his knowing it; I can hear every thing that he, and his wife, and child say.</p>
               <p>Matthews. Mr. Mitchell allows his lodgers to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110004"></xptr>have a latch-key, so that she could come in at the dead of night, and go out again.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. These things might have been made very portable, by taking out the feathers a few at a time; she came home one night without the key, and I was obliged to get up to let her in at eleven o'clock at night, and I then saw a man with her.</p>

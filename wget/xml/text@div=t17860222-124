               <p>Whose wire was that? - I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>What quantity of it, do you know? - Rather better than two ounces, but I found one piece in a cupboard, which he said belonged to the other, and it was put to the other, which made four pieces in the whole: the cuttings are off the buckles, little bits about half as big as a pin's head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. It is not wire? - No, I did not go after wire.</p>
               <p>Are you a wire drawer? - I draw for my own use.</p>
               <p>Are you at all able to identify this wire, to say that it is yours? - I cannot say I have any knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether his brother was at the house at this time? - No, Sir, I do not believe he was.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether in fact there was an execution, either against the person, or the effects of that person in that house? - Not that I know of, I have not heard any such thing.</p>
               <p>I believe before the Magistrate, you only charged this man with suspicion of this? - Yes, Sir, but my man swore to this property.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I will not be positive of it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he was committed on suspicion, and has been out upon bail, and has surrendered himself to day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not that because no creature could venture to identify this wire? - I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know now that nobody could? - I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>You heard your porter examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at this instrument, is it an instrument for wire drawing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220176"></xptr>Is it possible for any man to swear to wire of any size; would not a like wire be produced by an instrument of that sort in any one's hands? - It may be possible to produce the same, and I have a drawing plate of the same kind as this.</p>
               <p>How is it possible for any man to distinguish a wire, which is drawn through a drawing plate of the same size? - The purity of the silver is much the same.</p>
               <p>I fancy it must; had not your house been robbed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you make some application to the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What application did you make to him or what offer did you make to him? - I told him, if he would tell me, an act the honest part, that I would help him, and do him all the service I could; on finding the wire upon him, he told me he would give me an account how he came by the wire.</p>
               <p>Did not you offer him thirty pounds, if he would give you some information that you wanted? - No, Sir, no such word, none at all, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Tell us what you did say to him? - The words I repeated before.</p>
               <p>Let us hear them again? - I told him I was informed he knew something of my robbery, he said, he did not, I told him if he knew any body that would tell me, I would be his friend, I believe that was what I said, I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>How many men were left there, when the prisoner went away that evening? - All my men but four.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Yardley you delivered out your silver to your men, and received it back by weight from them? - I never said any such word to him.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him about the weight? - None at all.</p>
               <p>I believe you had some reason to know that the prisoner was not the man that committed that robbery? - I believe the people are taken.</p>
               <p>It is a very near relation of yours that committed that robbery? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. There is not the smallest suspicion on the prisoner about that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I am content.</p>

               <p>If this piece of wire had not been rough, could you have distinguished it from any of these that I shew you as to size? (shews him several.) - No Sir, I cannot say I could.</p>

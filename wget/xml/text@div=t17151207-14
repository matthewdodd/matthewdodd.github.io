                  , a Lunatick, under her Charge; for want of which the said Susan Shepherd miserably died
            </rs>. The Substance of the Evidence for the King was, That the Prisoner made herself acquainted with Mrs. Shepherd at Maidstone, and persuaded her to come with her to London most part by Water, she being then in a weak Condition, where she took two Rooms. That during that Time she took but little Care of the Deceas'd, and that for the last Fortnight of her Life she kept Fire, Candle, and all other Necessaries from her. That the Deceas'd having an Estate. of about 80 l. per Annum, the Prisoner deluded her to sell one half for 620 l. which Money remains in the Prisoner's Hands. That the People who liv'd in the House, observing no Meat, Drink, or other Necessaries administred as usual, and that she appear'd no more at her wonted Times, going into her Chamber, found her very ill, and at the Point of Death. That an Apothecary being sent for, he declar'd she was in a Fever, and had not half an Hour to live. That being dead, the Prisoner refus'd to bury her as the Deceas'd had desir'd, or that the Searchers should visit her Body. That being buried privately, she was taken up 12 Days after by Order of the Coroner; and being viewed by two Surgeons, they were of Opinion she died of a Fever, for want of proper Advice and Remedies. The Prisoner's Defence was, That she had no Power over her late dear Friend Mrs. Shepherd. That she did not know in the least that she was afflicted beyond<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171512070004"></xptr> what was usual at the Return of her Fits. That she had a very great Respect for the Deceas'd, and was very much griev'd at her Death. She call'd a great many credible Witnesses, who depos'd, That Mrs. Shepherd was frequently subject to Fits; in which Condition, one Evidence depos'd, she drank hut two Draughts of warm Ale in four Days: And another, That she knew her to have Fits ten Days together to such a Degree, that she neither eat nor drank any thing all that Time. That she had been often importan'd to take the Advice of Physicians; but she always refus'd it, saying, she had tried them too much already, and would have nothing more to do with them. That during the Intervals of her Fits , she would frequently express herself kindly of Mrs. Flood and seem'd very desirous of making her Satisfaction for the Civility, Care and Tenderness, with which she was always treated by her. That she always complained of her Relations , who she said had been very rude and uncivil That Mrs. Flood had done her great Services. That the Deceas'd always chose Privacy and Retirement. And that the Prosecutor's Motives were Malice and Revenge, being Heir at Law to the Deceas'd's Estate. Several Persons of great Note and Distinction gave the Prisoner an excellent Character, And the jury considering the Matter, <rs id="t17151207-14-verdict69" type="verdictDescription">

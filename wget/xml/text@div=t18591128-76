                  </hi>. I am page in the service of Mr. John William Bolton, who resides at Lee, in Kent—On Thursday morning of 6th October I saw a silver ladle, safe in the pantry at ten o'clock—I then went out for three-quarters of an hour—I did not miss the ladle till the afternoon—I then found that it was gone—this is it—it has my master's crest on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith at Deptford-bridge—on Thurs<lb></lb>day, 6th October, the prisoner came to my shop about 8 o'clock in the evening with another man—the prisoner brought this ladle and asked me if it was silver—I told him it was, and asked him how he came by it—he said he found it in the dust in China-court—I asked him how long he had had it; he said "Three months"—I told him I should send and make inquiries about it—he desired me to let him have it as he had better keep it a little longer—I told him again that I should make inquiries, and he repeated that he had better keep it a little longer—I said I should make inquiries at the station-house—he asked when he should call again—I told him in half an hour—he left the shop in company with the other man—I went to the station—the prisoner did not come again—I gave the ladle to the inspector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever seen the prisoner before? No; my sister happened to be in the shop; she was on one side of the shop and I on the other—she only saw the men's backs—they were in the shop from 5 to 10 minutes—there were no other persons in the shop—it is lighted with gas—I think I saw the prisoner again in about 14 days—I applied to the police and they made inquiries—they said I should be required to go to identify the boy who had stolen the ladle—they told me he was in custody on another charge—I went to Greenwich and he was shown to me in the police-yard—he was with another person at the time who was dark and about the same height—I did not notice the other—the prisoner was the one with whom the transaction took place—I gave a description of him to the police—I said he was a pale-faced young man, and had a light jacket on.</p>

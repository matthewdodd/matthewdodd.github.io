On the 20th of March, early in the morning, I went into the garden adjoining master's stable, and saw the prisoner standing close by the wall, which separates our garden from another—I saw a pair of carriage-lamps and the driving-box at his feet, and a pair of my boots on the top of the wall—I went towards him—he drew a knife, and made an attempt to come at me—I went back, and called "Master"—the prisoner got over the wall into an adjoining garden, and made his escape across the road—I looked stedfastly at him, and am sure he is the man—I went to the coach-house, and found master's carriage-lamps and driving-box gone, which had been safe the night before—the stable is in the yard between the two houses—there is a wall right round, enclosing the garden, coach-house, and dwell<lb></lb>ing-house—I had locked the front door of the coach-house over night—it was about five minutes before six o'clock when I found the prisoner in the garden.</p>

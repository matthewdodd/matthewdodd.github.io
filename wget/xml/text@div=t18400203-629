                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 111.) On the 20th of January, about two o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner in an open shed belonging to Mr. Seager, in the Seven Sisters-road—he was between the shafts of a cart—I asked him where he lived—he said he lived at Totten<lb></lb>ham, and that he was there out of the rain—I heard something rattle about his person, and asked him what it was—he replied, "Only a few coppers"—I desired him to show them to me—he did not do so—I removed the skirt of his coat on one side, and discovered this brass chandelier in his right hand breeches pocket—I asked what it was—he said, "A piece of brass "—I took it from him—he said he picked it up in the road—on the way to the station-house he attempted to throw this other chandelier into the field, but it lodged in the hedge, and I took it—I told him if he had any more to deliver it to me—he said he had not, neither had he thrown that one away—I took him to the station-house, and took one of the chandeliers to Mr. Seager, who identified it.</p>

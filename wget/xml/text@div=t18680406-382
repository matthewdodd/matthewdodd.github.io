                  </hi>. I am a shoe manufacturer, at Chelmsford—on 27th April, last year, I caused an advertisement to be put in one of the daily papers in reference to a sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I was claiming—on 1st May the prisoner came to my shop: I am quite certain he is the man; he was in my shop nearly two hours—when ho came in he held out these two documents, and said, "Are these worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to you?"—I looked at them and said, "Yes, if they are what I want, they are"—I examined them—I said, "How came you to know where to get them, and so soon?"—he replied, "We can get anything to our office for 300 years back"—I then said I wanted the certificate of Mary Boutell, the sister—he said, "I wish you had said so, for I saw Mary's whilst I was searching for the others"—I said I also wanted the marriage certificate of the father and mother of the three—he said he should be able to get that, but not for a day or two, for he would have to get that in his own time, not his employers'—I said I should also want him to search and see that there were no other members of the family,</p>

               <p>and to make a declaration to that effect—he said he would do so—he said his employers were Messrs. Showell &amp; Co., solicitors, in the City—there is no such firm—I searched the Law List, and found no such name—I gave the prisoner three sovereigns, and he wrote this receipt in my presence (<hi rend="italic">The certificates purported to be of the baptism of Thomas Boutell on</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1763, <hi rend="italic">and of William Boutell on</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th October</hi>, 1761; <hi rend="italic">certified by Rev.

Showell &amp; Co., Thomas Ward"</hi>)—next day, 2nd May, the prisoner came again; he then handed me these two other certificates, and a printed form of declaration, partly printed and partly written—he filled it up in my presence—he said he had carefully searched the parish books, and there were no others of that name to be found: in fact, he said the parish clerk was a very old man, and ho never remembered any others—the prisoner asked if we had a magistrate near—I said, "Yes, there was Captain Travers, in the Orderly Room at the barracks opposite"—we went over together—Captain Travers read the declaration, and said to me, "Is this all true?"—I said, "Yes," believing it to be so, and the prisoner said, "Yes;" then Captain Travers signed it (<hi rend="italic">The one certificate was of the baptism of Mary Boutell, on</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1765; <hi rend="italic">the other was of the marriage of Thomas Boutell and Elizabeth Cripps, on</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1759, <hi rend="italic">at Stanmore.

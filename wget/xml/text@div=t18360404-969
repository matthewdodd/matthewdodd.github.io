                  </hi>. I am a cooper's labourer, and live in Easton-street. On Friday evening, the 4th of March, about half-past eight o'clock, I was coming from home, and going to Laystall-street—coming up Mount Plea<lb></lb>sant, I saw two young men scrummaging or fighting together; I could not well tell which—I went on one side—I passed them—Parr after me, and caught me round the waist, and threw me into the kennel—I did not know him before—he thew me down and doubled his knee into my belly—I lost my senses then for a bit, and laid flat on my back, with my heard be<lb></lb>ing bruised against the paved stones—when I recovered, I got on my hands and knees—I found my watch lying on the pavement by the side of me—the buttons were all torn off my waistcoat, which was torn open; and I found my watch-fob pulled right out of my trowsers—I got up, and put my watch into my side-pocket, and buttoned my coat—I followed the pri<lb></lb>soner Parr into Pool's-buildings—he returned from Pool's-buildings into Laystall-street, when I met a policeman, and gave him in charge—the policeman took him into a wine-vault to search him, and asked me for the watch—I delivered it to him—I lost the seals and things, besides the watch—they were all lying by my side—I picked them all off the pavement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a steel pen maker, and five in Baynes-row, Clerkenwell. On the 4th of March, I was coming down Baynes-row, towards Mount Pleasant, about nine o'clock—I saw the prisoner insulting every person they met—they stopped a seafaring man, and he pushed them away from him, and passed on—directly after that I met the prosecutor coming along Mount Pleasant—the two prisoners pushed him about ten yards—the prisoner Parr turned round, went up to the prosecutor, took him round the waist, threw him on the ground, and knelt on him, and drew his watch from his fob—when he saw me he let the watch fall on the pavement—he got up and staggered away, pretending to be intoxicated, and went round into Pool's-buildings—I brought him out of there, down to the prosecutor, who was standing in Mount Pleasant—there being no policeman present, we let him go, and followed him till was we went a police<lb></lb>man in Laystall-street, and then gave him into custody—the prisoner Snell was ten yards off at the time Parr knocked the prosecutor down—Snell was staggering about at the time—he went to the workhouse, and we took him into custody at the workhouse, in bed, about an hour afterwards—when Parr was waiting with the prosecutor, after he had thrown him down, Snell called to him to come on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is Baynes's-row, the address you gave at the station-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the same address—it was not Red Lion-street—is did not take a minute for Parr to throw the prosecutor down and draw his watch—it might be two minutes after that I took Parr—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him round directly and took him—I should think in two minutes the outside of the time—it might be three or four minutes—when I came back I found the prosecutor standing up in Mount Pleasant—I consider Parr war sober—he had been drinking—Mount Pleasant is a good thoroughfare—there were they very few people going by at the time—I saw nobody but our two selves at the time it happened—there was no other person passing except the prosecutor, and he was knocked down—I was close to the prosecutor when Parr threw him down—I heard his head fall against my foot—I should think Parr might have seen me—we did not lose sight of him when we let him gohe walked up Laystall-street, round the corner—I ascertained that both the prisoners belonged to the work-house—Pool did not run away—the watch was not broken—the prosecutor took his watch up to</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you think it very difficult to distinguish whether this was a drunken attempt to molest the prosecutor or to rob him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had seen them insult several people before—I said to Parr, "You call yourself drunk?"—he said, "No, I am sober"—I said, "You have been drinking."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Clerk's-place, Bagnigge-wells-road.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was going home from this Court on the 4th of March—I saw Parr pass me, and the prosecutor, and two witnesses—about a minute afterwards they gave him in my charge—I took Snell at the work-house about an hour afterwards—the prisoners were in liquor, but not so drunk as not to know what they were doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you found the prisoner had got nothing, but that the prosecutor had got the watch, you might have taken the man before a Magistrate, and had them committed as rogues and vagrants, might you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—there was no bruise on the watch—Parr told me he belonged to the workhouse, and said where we could find Snell.</p>

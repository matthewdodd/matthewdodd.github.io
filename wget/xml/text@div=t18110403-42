We have our scales examined once a month to see that they are correct, from the information of my foreman I came down stairs and asked if that was the person that committed the robbery, they said it was, they said it was prussian blue that he had taken and it was in his pockets, an officer was sent for, prussian blue is fourteen shillings a pound.

               <p>Q. You were put into this cask. - A. Yes, I saw the prisoner come and put a box on a cask on the outside of the room door, he then went into the colour room and looked round a little while, he took a scoop from underneath the counter and went towards the box that the colour was in, I heard the colour rattle as he got it out with the scoop, but I did not see it, and then he put the scoop under the counter and began to do the scales, he went to the box a second time, came out and worked at the scales, he went the third time and got some more, came out, took his box and went down stairs. I got out of the hogshead and told the foreman what he had been doing, I went and asked the prisoner why he took the prussian blue out of the box, he said he wanted to paint his house with it.</p>

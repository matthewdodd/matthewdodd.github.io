                  </hi>. I am a messenger in the General Post-office. On the morning of 3rd July, I was on duty in the Inland office—the prisoner was employed there—there are several tables, distinguished from each other by letters—the prisoner was stationed at the table letter C—the Scarborough bag would be taken to that table and opened—it was the prisoner's duty to open it, take out the letters, and separate them—I had received directions to watch the prisoner during the performance of his duty—I was looking at him when the Scarborough bag was brought to his table, that was about a quarter-past six o'clock—I saw him open it, take out the letters, and put them on the table before him—there is a letter-bill along with each bag, with the amount of paid letters—the prisoner puts all the bills before him on the table as he opens the bags—I could not distinctly see the Scarborough bill by itselt—there might have been twent or thirty bags opened at table C—it would be</p>

               <p>the prisoner's duty to open them all—as many as can be carried are put on the table at once—I saw him put two letters before him on one of the letter-bills—I was not near enough distinctly to read their addresses—one of them had two red postage stamps on it—the letter-bills should state what letters are registered letters—it would be the prisoner's duty to fold up the registered letters in the bill, and put them into a drawer under the table provided for that purpose—the letters that are not registered are put on one side for a senior clerk to examine—I saw that the prisoner did that, leaving the two letters where he first put them—I could see they were not registered letters, because all registered letters are marked "registered" in red ink—I was near enough to see that there was no such writing upon them—I saw him take the registered letters out of the drawer and give them to the register clerk when he came round to the table—they are put over to the stamper's and stamped when he opens the bag, before he gives them to the register clerk—the register clerk, when he receives the registered letters," checks them by the bill to which they refer, and then signs the bill—Mr. Davis was the register clerk that morning—I saw him go to the prisoner and receive the registered letters—I saw the two letters that I had previously noticed, the prisoner put them on one side, and after he had given the registered letters to the register clerk, he put them into the drawer again—Mr. Davis then went to his desk—the duty went on, and other registered letters were collected in the drawer—after the prisoner had finished opening the bags he took all the letters out of the drawer, and went up towards the register clerk with them and the bills—I followed him to the register clerk—he gave the register clerk the letters and bills which he carried—they were checked with each bill, by the clerk, and signed for—he still retained in his band the bill, folded up as if it contained letters—I know it was a bill by the red colour of it—he then proceeded in a direction towards his own table—he did not go there, but went towards down stairs, to the water-closets—I immediately made a communication to Mr. Hodd, one of the presidents—I afterwards went down to the water-closets—I saw Peak, the officer, take these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the basin of a water-closet—I am sure this letter was one that I bad seen lying on the pri<lb></lb>soner's table, it is the one with two stamps—I know it by the handwriting—Iliad noticed the hand-writing as it laid on the table—I could not speak to the other—this one was lying over the other—I could tell the form of the handwriting—they both bear the Scarborough post-mark—they have not the stamp of the Inland office.</p>

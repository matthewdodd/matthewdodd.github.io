            , JUNIOR. I went in company with my father and Limbrick with a search warrant to the prisoners house in Field Lane. On the 2nd of February, a warrant was taken out to search for other things; in searching, we found these sheets wet, we found two of them; the prisoner was in the same room where I found these two sheets up stairs. Limbrick can produce the other sheets. I produce one sheet marked and the other not marked. I told the prisoner I apprehended him on suspicion of stealing these sheets; he said he bought them; I saw two footsteps at Mr. Hobler's Garden, they appeared to have got in the back way.</p>
               <p>COURT. How high were the rails.</p>
               <p>MR. HOBLER. Nine feet high; with a ladder it is very easy to get over on the garden side, there are some shelves for green house plants; when they get to the inside, there is a ladder on purpose for them.</p>

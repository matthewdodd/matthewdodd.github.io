On the 20th of June, about one o'clock in the day, there was a chest of tobacco which had been opened for sampling—I saw the prisoner hanging about the cask a considerable time, and then he stooped down where the cask was, took part of the tobacco out, and put it into his pocket—I was about six yards from him—he moved towards where I was standing, but seeing me, he turned to the left, and ran away, which brought him to another part of the same ware-house—he had no right there—he went to the gangway, among some cases of cigars—there is an opening to go in there, but no opening at the other end—there were some small casks of tobacco in the place between the cigars—he put his hand into the same pocket as he had put the tobacco in, and threw the tobacco down—he could not see me—I did not speak to him then—I told the constable—I got into a situation which would give me a command of the opening—I watched there nearly two hours at that time—I never lost sight of the prisoner for one minute—he went to the opening again, and stooped down in the same spot—he rose up again—I came round and met him about two or three yards from the opening—I said, "Cogan, have you any tobacco about you?"—he said, "No, you may search me"—I rubbed him down, and found nothing—I went back to where I had seen him throw something down—I told him he could not do me—I took him by the arm—he went to the opening—I stooped down and found 14oz. of negro-head to<lb></lb>bacco completely covered with a piece of stave, so that if a person had not watched that place he would not have seen it—no other person had been to that place—I handed over the tobacco to Dix—the cask the prisoner went to was marked "M. O. O, 21."</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk in the tobacco warehouse of the London Docks. On the 20th of June I saw a cask of tobacco, marked, "MOO, No. 21"—its weight was 1cwt. 3qrs. 6lbs.—I weighed it the next morning, and found it weighed 1cwt. 3qrs. 3lbs.—about 21bs. had been taken out for a sampling order, and there was 1lb. missing—this tobacco appears to be the same—the prisoner's duty would not carry him to where the tobacco was found—the tobacco was weighed in the cask first, and then turned out, and put in again—I was directed to weigh it for a merchant the first day, and the following day to ascertain the net weight of it.</p>

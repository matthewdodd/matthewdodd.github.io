                  </hi>. I live at present at No. 28, Queen-street, Ratcliffe. On Friday, the 5th of March, I lived at No. 2, Pleasant-row, Limehouse, in the prisoner's father's house—about half-past nine o'clock that evening I went down to the kitchen door with my little girl—the prisoner's father asked me what I accused his girl of, that he was informed I bad accused her of taking some things off the bed which were lost on the Saturday before—I said I did not, I had lost several things before, but who had taken these articles I could not say, although my suspicions were very great—Mrs. Atteridge was there, and she said I had accused the prisoner of it while we were getting water from Mrs. Ramsay's mother's—I then went out and got Catherine Ramsay, to know if I had said so—she came in with me, and said I had never named her name at all—the prisoner then got behind her mother and stabbed me on the forehead, over her mother's shoulder, but what with I could not say, for I did not see it—it bled, but not much—it was a cut—I put up my hand and said "She has stabbed me! she has stabbed me!"—I went out and got a policeman.</p>

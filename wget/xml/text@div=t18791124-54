                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, at 20, Cannon Street—on November 8, at night, I was on the north side of St. Paul's Churchyard by Mr. Jessop's shop—there are no-shatters to it, only bare—I heard a rattle of the bars, and a sound as if something had fallen—I turned back sharply, and the prisoner and two other lads ran from the window—I followed the prisoner, who was the nearest, and saw his hand go out and heard something fall over the railing—I caught him—he tried to escape 1 put him on the ground and gave him in custody.</p>

On Saturday night, 8th November, I was on the north side of St. Paul's Churchyard, and saw Hawkins and the prisoner struggling—he said "This man has broken a window and thrown something into the churchyard iron the jeweller's shop"—I took him back to the window, which I found broken and stoned, and then to the station, and found on him a comb, 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a latchkey—he gave me an address—I went there, but discovered no trace-of him—I Went to the churchyard and found this gimlet nearly opposite the window—the prisoner's thumb was scratched, as it would be by glass, and I found a stain of blood on the window.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You gave me the address in the police-court cell, not at the station—you said you did not know where you lived, but it was at the back of Shoreditch Church—you gave another address afterwards, which I did not go to, as the first was false—you said that your hand had been trod on, but the inspector said that it was cut with glass—your right hand was all over blood, all over the fingers and under them as well.</p>

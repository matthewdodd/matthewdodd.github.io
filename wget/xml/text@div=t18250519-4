On Tuesday, the 12th of April, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came to the house, and asked if Mr. Sedgwick was at home; I said he was not - he asked if Mrs. Sedgwick was at home; I said Yes; he asked to speak to her; I desired him to walk into the passage; he came in: I asked his name; he said Captain Barnett. I then asked him to sit down in the parlour - I went and told Miss Sedgwick, and then went down stairs; she gave an alarm in about five minutes, saying he had stolen her watch - he had then left the house; I went out, and saw him walking down the grove; I followed: three men were coming up who I called to; he turned back, and asked what I wanted: I said, "You have got the watch;" he gave it to me, and I gave it to Miss Sedgwick; he ran down the grove, and the men stopped him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. The servant sent me into the room - I found the prisoner there; he said, "You don't want any spirits, do you?" I said No: he said nothing more, but went out: I immediately missed my watch out of a case, which laid on a cabinet in that room - I had seen it a few minutes before. I alarmed the servant, who immediately went after him. The watch is my own property, and entirely under my control - it was a present from my mother; I am twenty years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to George Emery and another, of Farringdon-street, linendrapers. On Wednesday morning, 17th July, at twenty minutes before nine o'clock, I put up twenty-eight yards and a half of lustre Orleans cloth on the right-hand side going in at the door—directly I hung it up, my attention was called to a horse falling down, and in about</p>

               <p>three minutes some one called out something, I turned round, and missed the piece that had been at the door—this is it; it is Messrs. Emery's property—I saw Burding in custody at the station—I had not known anything of her before—I went the same day to the prisoner Seed's—she was not there, she was in custody—she was brought to Guildhall while Burding was under examination—as Seed was going to the Compter she said she hoped we should be merciful to her, and if we went to her place we should find the other piece of the stuff in a box behind the door—we went to her room, and found the remainder of it—there was a ticket attached to the piece when I hang it up in the morning—it was my master's ticket; it was the length of the piece of goods.</p>

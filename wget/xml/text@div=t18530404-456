                  </hi>. I am inspector of the Manchester police. On Thursday, 17th March, I was sent for to the Clarence Hotel there; I hid received information of this robbery—I saw this chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying on the table of the prisoner's bedroom: he was there, and owned it—I then took him into custody—on searching him, I found this purse, or <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>; and on a chair, close to where he stood, I found this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him where his watch was—he said he had never had one—I told him I bid reason to believe be had one, and no doubt this was the chain that was stolen from the hotel in London, where the watch was stolen from at the same time, and he must accompany me to the various watchmakers' in the town—I afterwards went with him to Messrs. Bunning and Gardener, at Manchester; they are watchmakers and jewellers—I received from them this watch in the prisoner's presence—I was told, in his presence, that he had sold it there two days previously, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was by a person waiting in the shop—the prisoner said nothing to that—this was all said in English; he understood me with some little difficulty; he could always ask very plainly for his food—when he said he had no watch, he spoke in English.</p>

I know the prisoner; I remember his coming to the house on the night of the 11th and 12th—the second time he came in he asked for a bed—I showed him a room with two beds in it, on the third floor; 1 went up with a light to show him up—that was at 2 o'clock in the morning I went with him into the room—I then went down to my bed, and about an hour or two afterwards, the policeman rang the bell—I got up, and found the light down below in the passage burning, and the street door open—I had locked it, and put a chain over it, before I went to bed—when the policeman awoke me, and showed me the door was open, I took a light, and went up to the prisoner's room; he was gone, and the bed bad not been slept in—I told Mr. Bretz—this coat belongs to his partner, Mr. Hahn—I had seen that at 11 o'clock that same night in the smoking-room, on the ground floor—the prisoner bad seen that coat—the first time he came at 1 o'clock he came without a coat, he came to fetch his umbrella—he saw this coat hanging up, and he wanted to borrow it—I said I dared not give him that, but I would lend him my coat, and he took it away with him; he said he would be back shortly to go to bed, and then he brought my coat back—I have been in the habit of brushing this coat of Mr. Hahn's—Mr. Kortlandt was lodging at the house that night, he slept in the next number to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps a cigar shop in Poplar.

I am mother of the last witness—I remember the prisoners coming to my shop—they came in together—Gorman asked for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of cigars—he took a sovereign out of his pocket, and threw it down on the counter—I said, "I have got nothing but large change; I have not got two shillings"—he said, "Any sort of change will do for me"—I put down a half sovereign, a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and two half crowns—when I put down the full change</p>

               <p>Greenhough said to Gorman, "Have you got no small change?" and Gorman said, "I believe I have," and he produced a sixpence from his pocket—I had said I would send out for change, and Gorman said, "Any sort of change will do for me," and he produced the sixpence—he took up the 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and the cigars—as the prisoners were going out, a man came in for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco; it came to three farthings—I served him, and he then quitted the shop—I had not put the sovereign out of my hand—a gen<lb></lb>tleman of the name of Parker came in, in two or three minutes, and I showed it him—it was not out of my sight—in consequence of what he said, I went out in search of the prisoners—I met a constable, and told him what had happened—in two or three minutes afterwards, I saw the three men coming up the street—the two prisoners and the man who had come into the shop for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—they were together and were smoking—I fetched the constable I had just spoken to, and gave them in charge—I gave the sovereign to the inspector at the station—I had seen Gorman in my shop once before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 140). On Thursday morning, 2nd January, between 5 and 6 o'clock, the prisoner came to the Wapping police-station, and said to me, "When I got up this morning I found my wife dead, and I expect I shall be locked up, for when I went home last night I found my wife drunk, and nothing provided for me, and the fire out; I had a few words with her; I struck her and knocked her down, then I went to bed, and when I got up in the morning I found her dead"—I went with him to the house where he lived; on the first floor I saw a woman lying on the floor dead, with her head against the wall, under the window—she was dressed—I then went to Mr. Ross, the surgeon—I did not take the prisoner in custody then, but I did at the commencement of the inquest.</p>

               <p>St. George's—I know the prisoner, he lived at 6, New-court, right opposite me—on the night of 1st January, I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at a little part 10—I stood at my door and heard the cry of a woman and of a child, at the same time, in the prisoner's house—I could not exactly tell what room it came from—I heard a blow at the same time as if something had fallen against a table—I did not see anyone come out of the house, but I heard the woman scream after the blow was struck—I returned into my room, and afterwards heard somebody come down stairs in that house—it is a very narrow court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the first noise you heard something knocking against the table? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the first noise was the cry of a woman—the only persons in the house are the prisoner and this woman, and two children whom he takes care of and who were sleeping in the same room—I have said before that I heard the cry of a child—what I heard was as if a per<lb></lb>son had been shoved—it was a fall against a table that I heard, it was like as if a person knocked against a table—I had known the deceased six or seven weeks—I never saw her drunk—I never saw her out late at night—I have known the prisoner for some time—nobody was in bed at my house I did not call any one, but I said to my husband, "There is a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> over the way"—what I heard, appeared like a person coming down stairs—our house if No. 1, and the prisoner's No. 6—No. 5 is not so nearly opposite our's as No. 6—I did not go to bed that night as my little boy was very ill—I heard what had happened at half-past 5 in the morning, his sister came and told me.</p>

I live at No. 4, New-court, two doors from the prisoner, on the same side—on 1st January, I was sitting by the fire; it was getting on for 10 o'clock, and I heard a very heavy cry in the prisoner's house it was soon over—that was a little after 10—then there was another cry—I did not hear anything between a man and a woman—I went to the door to see where the sound came from, and I heard, an "Oh!"—I heard no more than that—that came from the prisoner's house, the door opposite Mrs. Johnson's—the prisoner came downstairs—he was talking and jawing about and stepped his foot on the door step, and I immediately turned in and saw no more of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon of 156, High-street, Shadwell—on 2nd January I was called in by the police-constable, Bugby, to No. 6, New-court, St. George's, between half-post 5 and 6 in the morning—I went into the first floor, and upon entering the room, found a woman dead, lying on the floor—she was dressed—her clothes were not at all disturbed—she had a graze on the forehead as from a fall—being a very dark room and early in the morning, I was unable to observe any other marks of violence—the rest I found out from the post mortem examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was she on her back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and her head was under the window, rather on the fire-place side of it; it was a little room—the prisoner was in the room—he said, "I have been out two days and one night at Ber<lb></lb>mondsey, at work pulling down old houses, and when I came home last night there was no fire, and nothing prepared for me; she then called me names, and I struck her, and she fell first against the window-sill and then on the floor; I then went out, returned shortly, got into bed at the foot, and went to sleep, then I got up in the morning at 5 o'clock to go to work, and I trod on her back"—I think he used the word "deceased"—he said, "I then fetched her sister, and then went to the police-station"—the following day I made a post mortem examination of the body—I found a graze on the forehead, a graze on the left cheek, two small bruises on the left side of the head above the ear—on opening the head I found the brain congested and an infusion of serum into the ventricles—on opening the chest I found the heart very much diseased, the liver congested, the viscera healthy, and the whole of the body remarkably fatty—there were fatty deposits in the heart as well—when I had made that examination, in my opinion the immediate cause of death was disease of the heart, accelerated by the blow or fall—person with such extensive disease of the heart would be in a precarious state at all times from any shock or exciting cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the two little bruises on the side of the head which seemed to me to correspond with the knuckles—this is not the first time I have mentioned the knuckles—I believe it is in the depositions—I said so before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you got rid of those marks on the head was there anything inconsistent with death from natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the woman had her natural hair, a pretty good head of hair—she was an unhealthy woman altogether—it was not thin at all, but it was not a good head of hair; it does not follow that because it was not thin, it was a very good head of hair—I found the appearance of knuckles upon making the post mortem examination, on the side of the head, on the scalp, not on the bone—I did not find it through the hair—I shaved the hair off and found the two bruises on the scalp—I cannot say that they were not the result of her head knocking against something—I do not presume to say so—I I paid it was as if from the knuckles; they were close together—I cannot say that it was not the result of a fall—from the state I found her heart in she would be liable to sudden death at any time—the heart us not ruptured; it sometimes is, but it was not in this case—there is no doubt that the immediate cause of death was the disease of the heart—any excitement which would impede the heart's action would cause death, especially to a person in her state, taking the diseased brain into con<lb></lb>sideration—her brain was congested, or it would not have been so when I saw it—I should say she was accustomed to drink—I should say she was not drunk the night before, because there was a small quantity of beer in her stomach—I am not able to say what quantity she had been drinking during the whole of that evening—she had just had a hearty meal—I know that from what I saw in the stomach—I should say she was not drunk the night before—she had had beer; I cannot say what quantity—there was no giving way of any of the muscles of the heart—it was from fatty degenera<lb></lb>tion, with fluid in the pericardium—any exciting cause would have produced death—the heart ceased to move; stopped—any sudden quarrel, or words she made use of, or excitement of any kind; would produce that—upon the action of the heart ceasing, from any of those causes, she would of course tumble down, and receive bruises in the fell—there were marks of a fall—the bruises were caused either before death, or immediately afterwards—if it was a few hours afterwards there would be no difficulty in telling that—I saw the body lying on the floor—the head was near the window—she was a woman of about 5 feet 2 inches; I should say her head was about 4 feet 8 inches from the bed—the feet were under the bed—it was a small room; about 11 feet by 9, I should say, as near as I could guess.</p>

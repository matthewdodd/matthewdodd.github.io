On Friday evening, the 19th of November, I came home a little before ten; I was informed by Mason, my servant, the prisoner had taken money from the bowl. I fetched the watchman in my house, and gave the prisoner in charge; the prisoner was then in bed. The watchman, I, and Mason, went up stairs, into the prisoner's bed-room. I took up the prisoner's working jacket; I asked him if it was his; he replied it was. I gave it to the watchman; he searched it in my presence. In the jacket pocket was thirteen three-shilling bank tokens, a five shilling paper of halfpence, and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. We have nothing to do with the halfpence, he is charged with stealing four three-shilling bank tokens; can you tell us whether you lost any bank tokens - A. No. Mason can prove that I lost four.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he claim these thirteen three-shilling bank tokens - A.He did not. In consequence of the money being found in his jacket pocket, I took out my pocket handkerchief, and the watchman tied up the thirteen three-shilling tokens, and kept possession of it. I gave the watchman charge of the prisoner; he took him to the watchhouse. The prisoner wished me to forgive him.</p>

            . On the 19th of November, between five and six o'clock, there were eight three-shilling tokens in the bowl in the desk; I counted them over two or three times. I marked four of them: I made a cross under the neck part. A little after this, I lent a neighbour two three-shilling tokens out of this bowl; they were not marked. I left the four marked ones behind. In the course of half an hour the same person brought two others back; that made the number eight again. Between seven and eight, I saw the prisoner go to the desk; after I had seen him there, I went behind the desk; I then saw five bank tokens had been taken away; they were only three left. I informed my mistress of it. I saw the watchman take thirteen three-shilling bank tokens from the prisoner's jacket pocket, among which were the four marked ones; I picked them out at the watchhouse; they were given to the constable.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's daughter. I had cut off some linen for my brother's shirts; I do not know what quantity, but I saw that some had been cut off, by its being cut and folded differently to the way I left it - I then looked for a pin which I had left in it, for the length of the sleeves - that was gone, and a corner was cut off; there were about three yards of the cloth gone. My mother then inquired of the prisoner, and the other servant, who both denied it; my mother then said, "To end all dispute, you had better produce your boxes;" the other servant opened her's first, and then the prisoner opened her's and took the piece of cloth in her hand; my mother said, "What is that?" the prisoner said it was not ours, an Irish woman, a friend of her's, had brought it to her, but she could not tell her name, nor where she lived. I found it was the piece which had the pin in it, and I am certain by the length and width of the sleeves that it had been cut from the piece which I had left.</p>

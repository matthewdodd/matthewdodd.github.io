                  </hi>. I am a constable employed at the post-office. I went to the receiving-house in East-place, Lambeth on Friday, the 1st of April, with Mr. Bell and Mr. Peacock—the name of Weatherhead was over the door—I was never there before—I had a search warrant, and searched the house—the prisoner was not at home when I commenced—I found in the back-parlour this paper box on the sideboard by the side of the fire, and found this purse in it, wrapped in this blue paper—I am quite certain it is the same—here are my initials and the date on the paper, in my own writing—I laid the purse and box on the table, out of the box—I believe Mr. Bell put it into the box—the prisoner came in about five minutes after—Mr. Peacock, Mr. Bell, the prisoner's mother and sister were present—Mr. Peacock held the purse in his hand and said, "Who does this belong to?" or "Whose is this?"—the prisoner said, "It is mine"—the question was asked, "How long have you had it?"—she said about three months—"Where did you get it from?"—she said, "I had it given to me by a friend"—"Where did he get it?"—she said somewhere in the Strand—he bought it somewhere in the Strand—she was asked where about—she im<lb></lb>mediately turned round, addressing her sister and said, "It is yours"—the sister said it was not—another question was put, I do not recollect what, but she made no answer—I finished my search, came down stairs, and the prisoner said she bought the purse at the Bazaar—I asked which, and she said she believed it was the one in Soho, she had been to them both—I was ordered to take her into custody, and took her to the post-office. and then to the Police Court, Bow-street—on our way there she said, "If I was to tell who took the purse, what would they be done to?"—</p>

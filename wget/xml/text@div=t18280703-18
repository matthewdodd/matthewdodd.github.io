On the 2d of July, 1827, I had an order for thirty quarters of oats, to be fetched from Thames-street, and delivered to Mr. Shefford of Camberwell; I sent the prisoner about the middle of the day with the waggon and horses to execute that order - I heard nothing more of him till ten o'clock at night, when master's son brought a message to my house; I went directly to Camberwell - I found the waggon and horses in Mr. Shefford's-yard, but the prisoner was not there; I did not see him again till the end of May, this year, when he was in custody - he never came to our premises; I found a quarter and a half of oats had been shot at Camberwell, and twenty-six quarters and a half were left in the waggon, making a deficiency of two quarters out of thirty; but instead of there being only three empty sacks I found four in the granary and three in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was what he said before the Majistrates, taken down? A. I cannot tell - he was asked what he had to say, and said he should leave it to his solicitor.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Smith. of Anchor-wharf, Thames-street - he has a granary at Paul's-wharf. On the 2nd of July, 1827, thirty quarters of oats were delivered into Mr. Thomas's waggon, to be delivered to Mr. Shefford - here is my entry of the transaction; I have no recollection who the waggoner was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. By whose direction did you make this entry; A. I wrote it myself; I enter every thing that goes out; I recollect that thirty quarters of oats were delivered into the waggon - it was the only time a waggon came for any of that lot; the name was on the waggon, no doubt - I did no notice whether it was on it or not.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL WILMOT re-examined. The waggon had Mr. Thomas' name on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the waggon go off? A. Most assuredly, and I saw it at Camberwell; when it left our place he had twenty-five quarters of oats to deliver at another place, and then he was to call for these.</p>

            . I am a labourer; I was in Mr. Shefford's service, as horse-keeper. I saw the prisoner drive the waggon into the yard on the 2d of July; there was another man with him - they began to unload the oats, and wanted me and the other man to help, as he was in a great hurry; we had our own work, and could not; they carried up two or three sacks; he then said he should leave the other man to finish, as he was going to join his benefit society, at the Grove House, to dine; he went away, and I never saw him again; the other man stopped in the yard some time, but did not unload, for master came and asked how much corn had been shot; the rest was not unloaded. The waggon remained there till after eleven o'clock at night, and then Wilmot fetched it home, after unloading it. I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did the prisoner arrive at your yard? A. About six o'clock in the evening; it was very near six; master is a stage proprietor; strangers are not allowed in our yard; the other man was not detained: the prisoner said he wanted to have his dinner, and would come again; I was absent at tea about ten minutes, and when I returned master was questioning about the corn.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many sacks go to a quarter? A. Two; there was no cart on our premises to carry the corn away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The carman gave you this note with thirty quarters written on it? A. It was given to my wife by somebody; there has been no attempt to alter the figures: I followed the waggon into the yard almost directly it came; they had shot three sacks; I found nobody in the yard but two strangers; they said they had nothing to do it with it - I did not see the prisoner.</p>

            . In 1827 I belonged to a benefit club, and on the 2d of July was at the club with the prisoner, at Grove House, Camberwell; the prisoner was there at a quarter to four o'clock - he was a member; he stopped there with me till half-past nine; a short thick man in a smock-frock came running, and told him something wrong had happened about the corn - he said there was something short; I did not exactly understand it; the man ran away directly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever seen the short thick man since? A. No; I should know him among a thousand; the prisoner asked him what was the matter, and he was off directly: the prisoner ran after him, to know what was the matter, and did not come back - he stopped out on the green till I came to him, which was in four minutes; the man ran towards town; I ran after him for half a mile; he ran by the Elephant and Castle, into the Borough: the prisoner did not return to the club, nor did I; the man came about half-past seven o'clock, as near as I can guess - we paid for every thing as it was brought to us: I knew the prisoner lived at Dock head, somewhere, but did not know his master's name; I once lived with him at Russell's, in Friday-street; I never saw him after this happened; he has a wife and family - he never came to the club again, and his name was scratched out.</p>

I shewed her a drawer - as I took up one piece she took up a second. I shewed her a remnant which she approved of, and gave me a half-crown. I went to the till for change, and saw her drop her handkerchief over a piece which she had laid on the counter. She then asked for bonnet trimmings. I went into the back room for it, turned my head, and saw her covering the handkerchief over the ribbon - the trimming did not suit her. I followed her out, took her basket from her hand, and took the ribbon out of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Her handkerchief was in the basket as well - A. Yes - she made two attempts to put her handkerchief more over it to conceal it; it was only six or seven yards, but there is a block of wood inside it; she said she did not know that she had it.</p>

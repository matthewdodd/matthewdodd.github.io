                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Molntyre and others, warehousemen, of 9, Addle Street—on Friday morning, 28th October, I saw the prisoner come quietly up the stain, and deliberately take three boxes of shirts from the fixtures, and go down stain—I followed him, and overtook him about the middle of the street—I put my hand on his shoulder, and he dropped them on the foot-board of the Tan of a box maker who was delivering boxes at our warehouse—I had never seen the prisoner before—he had no authority to take the boxes; they each contained six shirts, and were worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

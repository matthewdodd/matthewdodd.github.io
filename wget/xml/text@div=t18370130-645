On the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of January, I stopped the prisoners between eight and nine o'clock in the evening in Bath-street, upwards of a mile from the prosecutrix's—they were in company, and Squires had this copper on his right shoulder—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said to sell it to Mr. Barnes, of the City-road—I asked if it was his—he said yes, and he lived at No. 85, Banner-street, which is close by, that it was part of the fixtures of his own house, and he had bought that with a blind and water butt for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was going to sell it because he was out of work—Day said it was perfectly right, and that Squires was his brother-in-law—he knew it was part of his fixtures, and he bad bought it with a blind and water butt, and he had helped him to poll it down—I took Squires to the station, and Day walked away sharply—I told another officer to bring him back—I went to No. 35, Banner-street, and then found their tale was not true.</p>

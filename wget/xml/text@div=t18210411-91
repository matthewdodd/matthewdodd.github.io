On the 23d of February, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked if my wife was at home. I replied she was not. She said she wanted to see her. I desired her to walk in the parlour, as she would soon be in. She did so - she sat on the left hand side of the fire-place. A few minutes after a person came in and paid me 1 l. 15 s., I left the money on the table, while I shewed him to the door. I returned and took the money off the table, and placed it on the mantle-piece, in a mug. A person then came in, and while I was attending him, I saw her move from the left side of the fire to the right. She then took the opportunity of taking the money out of the mug. I heard her say to my daughter,</p>
               <p>"Tell your mother I shall be in in two or three minutes, when she comes in." Nobody was in the room but my daughter and her. The prisoner went out, but returned in twenty minutes. I have not recovered the money.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the last witness. The prisoner was in the room, at the time she got up, and sat on the other side and took the money out of the mug, and put it under her sleeve. I heard it jingle. She said she would return soon. I went to tell my father, but she was gone down the steps. She lived in the next house. I went for her - she came in about five minutes, and said, she had not got it. While my mother was gone for a constable, she attempted to get out, but I prevented her.</p>

I am a servant—about ten o'clock in the evening of the 26th of May, I was in Pudding-lane—I met the prisoners—they asked me to treat them—I went to a public-house with them—we had something, which I paid for out of some silver which I had in my left-hand trowsers' pocket—I afterwards went with them down a dark lane or passage, close by the Monument—after I had been there three minutes Morden ran away—Madden was talking to me, and about two minutes after she left me, saying she would go and look for her friend—I missed my purse from my right-hand pocket, containing thirteen sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and two half-crowns—I went after Madden, and overtook her in King William-street—she topped—I said, "Where is your friend you were looking for?"—she said, "I don't know who she is, nor where she is, I never saw her before"—I said, "Just come across the street, there is something wrong"—she said, "I will"—I saw a policeman, and gave her in charge—I afterwards went with the policeman to Smithfield—I there saw another policeman, named Courtney, and we found Morden—I am sure she is the person—she was conveyed to the station—as we were going along I said, "How do you do? you are just the person I was looking for"—I nipped her hand, and she said, "Oh my thumb"—she had showed me her thumb when first I met her, and said she had had it bit—I said, "I forgot about your thumb"—I do not know whether it was the same thumb—she did not show me the thumb again—my purse was afterwards given to me—this is it—I was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Crescent-terrace, Millbank-street; Westminster, and am chief clerk at Millbank prison. On the night of 21st Sept I left my house at 6 o'clock—at that time I had a purse, containing three sovereigns and a half, and a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Mr. flight—I examined it at 6 o'clock, and know that I had it safe then—I went to an upholsterer's in Rochester-row, which is about half a mile from my house, and went to Mr. Best's shop—at the next shop to Mr. Best's they were selling off, and I stood there a short time, less than ten minutes—there was a crowd there—I did not see anything of either of the prisoners, not to recognise them—there were some women in the crowd—I went into Mr. Best's shop, and purchased an article, and when I went to pay for it I found that my purse was gone—that was about a quarter to 7 o'clock—I went to Han keys', the bankers, and stopped the cheque, on the following morning—I did not remain there to see if it was presented—I had occasion to go to Mr. Flight's—I then returned to Messrs. Hankeys', and found Eiley there—she was pointed out to me as the person who had offered the cheque, and I gave her into custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque.</p>

About 10 o'clock, on the morning of 22nd Sept, this cheque was presented by Riley—it had been stopped by Mr. M'Intyre, about half an hour previously—I asked Riley from whom she received it—she said, "From Mr. Flight—I asked her where she lived—she said, "Near the Vauxhall-bridge-road—I then told her that it had been lost, that the payment of it had been stopped, and she had improperly obtained it—she then said she had found it—we begin to pay at 9 o'clock—Mr. Flight had an account at our house—the cheque would have been paid if it had not been stopped.</p>

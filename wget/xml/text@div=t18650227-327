I and my partner Mr. Philip Goldschmidt carry on business in Fenchurch-buildings—we have an account at the Alliance Bank—the prisoner was in our service from February until May of last year—this order is not in my writing or my partner's, or written by our authority—I have a very strong opinion that it is in the prisoner's writing this cheque is not in my writing, or written by my authority—I believe it is the prisoner's writing.</p>

Q.</hi> Did not you give him a written character when he left in May? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I believe my partner did—I have not seen it—I don't know whether it was a good one or not—I say the whole of it is in the prisoner's writing, it does not resemble my writing very much—the signature is an attempt to imitate mine, but it does not resemble it very much—we have two other clerks, they knew the prisoner's writing—he was in our service as office boy—I don't know his age—my partner is in London.</p>

Alice Powell. I am the wife of Frederick Powell, provision merchant, 98, York Road—about 1 p.m. on the 28th April the prisoner knocked at the door—I was called to the door—he said "I have brought you a box from the Great Western Railway, for which you will have to pay me half a crown"—he handed me this consignment note—I asked him to let me look at the box, but he at first refused; afterwards he let me look at a part of it—I had my suspicions, and refused to give him the money unless he gave me the box in my hand, and he ultimately gave it me—he wished to have the half-crown before he gave me the box—I preferred seeing the box—I asked the prisoner to wait till I got change for half a sovereign—I took it into the parlour to my father and broke it open; it contained a brick <hi rend="italic">very</hi> carefully wrapped in brown paper, and the box was tied very well and tightly—I asked the prisoner to come inside while I went for change for half a sovereign, and I went for a constable—I saw a man outside whom I believe I have seen before.</p>

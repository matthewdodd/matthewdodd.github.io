               <p>Mr. Burdett, of Council for the Prosecution, thus opened the case.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury; although many prisoners have appeared before you in the course of this long sessions, indicted for offences, similar to that with which this prisoner stands now charged; yet I will venture to affirm, that not one of their cases has been accompanied with similar circumstances of ingratitude. The prisoner was left by her husband, who had gone to sea, with a young child at her breast, in very great distress; in the month of September last she contracted an acquaintance with the prosecutrix, and informed her of her unfortunate situation; and that she had no other way of subsistance, but by working at her needle, and having no acquaintance in town, she insinuated, that it would be a very great act of charity, if through the recommendation of the prosecutrix or her friends, she should get employed: upon this, the prosecutrix, who is a very poor <rs id="t17840225-90-viclabel465" type="occupation">widow</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17840225-90-victim937 t17840225-90-viclabel465"></join>, and has lived where she now resides, in <placeName id="t17840225-90-crimeloc466">Prescot-street</placeName>

In consequence of this encouragement, the prisoner called daily on the prosecutrix, and obtained from her, and through her means, both assistance and work; and soon after proposed to come and lodge with her: the prosecutrix being old and infirm, and not able to keep a servant, was willing to accept this offer, she having at that time a very sore leg, which confined her: accordingly the prisoner came to reside with the prosecutrix; but the prisoner had not been long there, before the prosecutrix missed several of her things; however, she had no suspicion of the prisoner at the bar, until she discovered the loss of a cloak, which she was very confident could be taken by no other person but the prisoner, nobody else having access to the place wherein that cloak was kept; upon this, she charged the prisoner with robbing her, and the prisoner being so charged, confessed she had taken it, and said she had only pawned it; this satisfied the prosecutrix, who imagined, that by shewing her some lenity on this occasion, it might cause her to confess, and return the rest of the things; but instead of that, in a very few days afterwards, one morning before the prosecutrix got up, the prisoner was rummaging for something under the bolster, and being asked by the prosecutrix what she was searching there for, she said, she was looking for her stockings about the bolster and bed; but after the prosecutrix got up, and came to put her hand in her pocket, she missed a guinea; and the same day, or the day after, she missed the remainder of those things, as stated in the indictment. The prosecutrix then told the prisoner, if she did not return her things, she would bring her before a magistrate: the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250172"></xptr> prisoner promised to get them, but instead of doing so, she absconded for several days, and when found, it appeared she had hired herself as a servant to an attorney of Clement's-inn; she was upon this taken to Bow-street, when one of the prosecutrix's cloaks being found upon her, she was committed. Gentlemen, this is a short state of the facts, which will be proved on the part of the prosecutrix, against the prisoner at the bar, if I am rightly instructed; and if they are proved to your satisfaction, it is your duty to find the prisoner guilty; if these facts are not proved by the evidence we will produce, you must acquit her.</p>

               <p>I took in the prisoner out of charity to lodge with me the 12th of September, I have had no servant since my husband died, I took care of her child while she assisted me as a servant. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; when I was able to get out of my bed, and to go from one room to another, I went up stairs for some things; she did not want me to get up, she said it would hurt my leg to go up stairs, and advised me not, but I did go; I went to the chest to get a piece of callimanco out, and when I opened the chest, I missed a pair of new stays that were in the chest; when I came down she was sitting in the room, and had some small needle work by her; says I, where did you leave my stays; says she, in the chest; says I, they are not there; says I, is there two table cloths there? yes, says she; then, on St. Stephen's day, when the prisoner's child was buried, I went to put on my black silk cloak, and I asked her where it was; says she, it is in the drawer; says I, I cannot find it; says she, it was there not a quarter of an hour ago, let me look for it; says I, I can see as well as you; she laid her hand upon mine, says she, make yourself easy, Mrs. Richardson, do not put yourself into a passion, I know where it is, and that night she told me she had pawned it for three shillings, and a week after she said she had put it out for three shillings and sixpence, in the name of Brown; then I lost the sheets.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you, after missing all these things one after another, and she telling you that she had pawned some of them, to leave her in your house? - She only owned to the cloak; after she went away I missed the sheets, two shifts, and a shirt; I lost also a silver table spoon and a tea spoon, and a stewpan; she had my black silk cloak upon her when she was taken.</p>

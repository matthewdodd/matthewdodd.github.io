                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, of No. 6, Cock-lane, Smithfield. On Monday evening, 12th Sept., about a quarter to 12 o'clock, I was in Forestreet—I had been drinking, but was quite sober and collected—the prisoners and another woman accosted me at the corner of Fore-street, and <hi rend="italic">huddled</hi> me along till they got me to King-street, to the <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> wall of Whitecross-street prison, where King laid hold of me by the collar, put her knee against my hip, and pushed me down on the pavement—both the prisoners kicked me, and I got a blow on the nose which made it bleed—my waistcoat was torn, and I lost a reading glass and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—I got up, and saw a young man who ran after the prisoners—this is my eyeglass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it was in a morocco case, which is missing—I had been drinking with two of my shopmates at the Flying Horse, from half past 8 till a quarter to 12 o'clock—we had two quarterns of rum and three pints of porter between three of us—I never saw the prisoners before—the matter only lasted a few minutes; they met me, laid hold of my waistcoat pocket, and bearing halfpence there they still kept on.</p>

I was in Whitecross-street, going home, and as I got to the corner of Whitecross-street, I saw Kelly lay hold of the prosecutor round the neck—she took him as far as the prison wall, and shook his waistcoat pocket; I then saw her <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> him on his back with her foot on his hip—the others were close by, and when they saw him on the ground they ran up and kicked him; they put their hands over his nose and mouth when he called for assistance—they both kicked him, and King knelt on him; I did not see them take anything—they went away, sod I went up to him and found him so short of breath that he could not speak, and there was blood running down his face—I saw the prisoners again, ten minutes afterwards, as they were going to the station, and am sure they are the same persons.</p>

I was passing the end of Whitecross-street, about 12 o'clock on this night, near the blank wall of the prison—I heard a disturbance, went up and saw the prosecutor on the ground, getting up, and three women going away; one of whom dropped something which sounded like a coin—I got a policeman and went after them—I found them opposite Moor-lane, about twenty or thirty yards from where I had seen the man on the ground, making their way back; one was on one side, and two on the other—when they saw the policeman they turned back; we overtook them—twopence and a glass dropped from one of them—I picked up three half-pence, and the policeman picked up the glass, which the prosecutor afterwards claimed.</p>

I have been acquainted with the prisoner better than twelve months—he proposed to marry me about a month ago—for about two or three months he had never stopped from my place—in consequence of his request, I left my situation, and went to live with my sister—after that he wanted money to furnish him with some clothes, and I let him have it—he imposed on me the belief that he was going to marry me, and I furnished him with money to <hi rend="italic">rig</hi> himself out—he then took me to buy a wedding-ring at my own expense, and then persuaded me to give him money to buy furniture, a table and chairs, and to take a room—he represented that he had collected articles in the room—he asked me for the key of the room to put an article in—I went very early the next morning for it, and could not get it—I found the banns were not put up where he said they were—Tuesday, the 16th of Feb., was fixed on for our marriage—he appointed Mr. Swaine's lodging, near Cripplegate church, to meet me to go to get married—I found him there—in going, as I supposed, to church, when we got to Aldersgate-street we went to a public-house—we had some refreshment, and I changed a sovereign—I had 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—I sat down near the prisoner—he asked me to show him what money I had in my pocket—I was not in the act of counting it—I had changed a sovereign, and I had my hand in my pocket, putting the money in—he reached over and snatched my money from my hand—he turned the pocket up, and took every farthing of money—I resisted—I put my hand on his, and said, "You have got every farthing of money I have, and I could take better care of it than you"—he said, "It would look very stupid of me, when we get to church, not to have the money to pay the fees, but to have to ask you for it"—he assigned that as a reason for taking it from me—we got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and when got out, he pointed to a church just by, and said, "That is the church"—he took me to another public-house, and then he <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> away through the courts, leaving me to pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>,—I had not a farthing, but my sister, who was with me, had a few shillings, or else we should all have been given in charge—I afterwards found the prisoner in Red Lion-court, wearing the coat I had bought for him—I asked him for the ring and the money be <hi rend="italic">thieved</hi> out of my pocket—he said he had lost the ring.</p>

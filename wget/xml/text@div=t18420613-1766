                  </hi>. On the 5th of May I was a policeman of the N divisions and was on duty that afternoon, at Hornsey, by the side of the wood—I met a gentleman there, and observed that he had a large bunch of seals—previously to that I had received information of robberies having been committed in that neighbourhood, and a description of the man suspected had been read at the station—in consequence of this I turned round, in the direction the gentleman was going—I did not see any person, and was going on my beat again—as I turned round to go from the gentleman towards Hornsey-wood-house, I saw the prisoner about the middle of the road, walking towards me—I was in my police uniform—when he saw me he ran to the opposite side of the road, and went down a little bank, into the adjoining field by the road-side—I followed him into the field, but saw nothing of him when I first came into the field—I found him, stooping down by the hedge—I saw that he had two pistols laid down before him on the ground—I asked him what he did there—he answered, "Nothing particular"—I then told him if he did not give a better account of himself than that, I must take him into custody—on my saying that he sprang from the hedge, and stood before me—he then had one pistol in his right hand, and one in his left—he then aimed the pistol in his right hand at me—it was apparently aimed at my head—I put up my left arm to save my head, and put the pistol on one side, and he then fired it—I might then be about two yards from him, as near as I can judge—he fired the right-hand pistol, and something from it went into my arm, and came out just above the elbow—he then stepped backward two or three steps, changed the pistol in his left hand to the right, and the right to the left—I advanced towards him—he aimed the pistol which he then had in his right hand at me—it appeared to be at my head—I was then rather closer to him—he pulled the trigger of that pistol then, and I heard it trig off, but it was not dis<lb></lb>charged—I then rushed at him—he then, with the pistol which he had in his right hand, struck at my head, but only knocked my hat off—he and I struggled together for a short time—during the struggle his hat came off—I was obliged to let go of him, for I found I bad not the least use of this arm—I did not observe that it was bleeding at the time—when I let him go, he ran ten or fifteen yards from me, and turned round—I went to pick up my hat, that he had knocked off, and he said if I attempted to follow him, or make any alarm, he certainly would shoot me dead—he ran away without his hat—he had a pistol in each hand when he used these threats—I pursued him, calling out "Murder!"—when he had got about half way along the field, he stopped, and put the pistol in his right hand into his breast—he had his coat buttoned, with a button or two at the bottom—on putting it into his breast he pulled out a large knife, appa<lb></lb>rently from his watch-pocket—I do not exactly know where he pulled it from—it was a large carving-knife, as it appeared to me, but I was not close to it—when he drew that knife out, he said if I followed him any further, he certainly would do for me—I stopped then, and pulled out my staff—he put the knife back to where he took it from, and ran off—I con<lb></lb>tinued</p>

               <p>to follow him till he got over the hedge of a second field, all that time calling "Murder!"—I tried to get over the hedge, but this arm failed me—I found then I was wounded in the arm—I succeeded in getting over at last—I did not see him at first—I went back, and saw him, in a minute or two—he appeared to be loading a pistol again—there was about tea yards between me and the hedge—he had turned back towards Horn<lb></lb>sey-wood again—I went up the hedge, as I could trace his footsteps on the grass; and just before I got to him, I saw him stooping down in the hedge—I ran back again into the field, saw him looking over the hedge at me, and aim the pistol at me, and said something, but I do not know what—I became very weak then, and could not follow him any further—Mallet, the policeman, came up, and be pursued him—Young, the waiter, also came up—I spoke to him, and he pursued—I was in the hospital, and am not discharged yet, in consequence of the wound I received.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at Hornsey-wood-house tavern. I recollect the afternoon of the 5th of May—I did not hear the report of a pistol, but in consequence of something that was said to me, I went out, and found Moss, the policeman, lying on the ground, on the grass—in con<lb></lb>sequence of what he said to me, I went in pursuit of a man, and about a mile from where I saw Moss, I caught sight of Howard, in a cart, in Horn<lb></lb>sey-road—I told him something, and afterwards found the prisoner run<lb></lb>ning</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130054"></xptr>
               <p>across the field, a very little distance from Howard—he was running to the left of the road to Hornsey—I saw he had a pistol in each hand—I went towards Highbury-barn tavern to get a policeman, and found the policeman Daly, the deceased—I told him to take a man coming down the lane with two pistols in his hand, to take him in charge for the murder of a man at Hornsey-wood house—I thought he had murdered him—I left Daly to go, and I went for assistance to Highbury-barn tavern—when I got more assistance, I went to Highbury park south, and there saw the prisoner again—it is no thoroughfare there—he was standing with his back against the paling, with two pistols, one in each hand—there were about twenty persons round him, or there might be more—nothing was said about shooting a policeman that I heard—Daly was there—the prisoner stood with a pistol in each hand, first looking on one side, and then the other, in this position—(<hi rend="italic">holding both arms out</hi>)—I heard Daly say to him, "I don't think those pistols are loaded"—the prisoner said they were, and he would shoot two more—Daly said, two or three times, he thought those pistols were not loaded, and the baker ran into him—Daly said, "Surrender, I don't think those pistols are loaded"—then he said they were, and he would shoot two more—the baker then ran in to him on the left side—he ran in with his head down, trying to get his arms down—I did not see a stick in the baker's hand—when the prisoner found he was secured on the left-hand side, he partly got his arm down, lifted his arm up, and shot the baker through the shoulder, and as Daly advanced, he extended his arm, and shot him through the body instantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the rapid way this passed, could you or not judge whether he took an aim at Daly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I should say he did—he appeared to me to do so—he was immediately seized, and taken into custody by the people—I went to the station when he was taken there, and saw two ballets taken from his fob pocket—the boy Hewson handed a hat to me at the station—I showed it to the prisoner, and asked him if it was his—he said, yes, it was—I saw Mr. Drewry, the surgeon, with Daly before I left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You know the ground in the neighbourhood of the tavern perfectly well where this occurrence took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Pretty well—when I went out, I found Moss about twenty yards from Hornsey-wood house, which stands by the side of a road—the lane goes off at oblique angles from that road, at the end of it is the Seven Sisters-road—nearly opposite Hornsey-wood house is a stile, and a foot-path from it down into a valley—you cannot see into the valley from the house, the road, or stile, without going to the top of the rising ground—there are palings or hedges in the valley, running along, and going off rather south-west—there is a lane not far from Hornsey-wood house, leading into Hornsey-wood—any body might pass me, and go into the wood very quickly, or down into the valley, and down by the hedges, and be out of sight in an instant—the second field joins the one the stile enters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now a person running along those field?, and towards Highbury, was likely to have been kept in sight all the time, or near it, for a considerable distance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If they were close after him—from the second field the pri<lb></lb>soner ran from, there is no rising ground for a considerable distance—I know the black ditch which runs towards Highbury—it is from fourteen to eighteen feet broad, and wider at some places—in the course the prisoner took, he must have gone over that ditch—at some places it is not so wide—I saw him cross the ditch, but do not exactly know the part—I went across the ditch after him—he jumped from one side of the ditch to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130055"></xptr>
               <p>other—it may be half a mile from the second field, or three-quarters of a mile—in going towards Highbury he would run behind some gentlemen's gardens, Highbury-park-terrace, and so on—the course from the second field to the lane spoken of is all open to the left of Hornsey-road—to the right of the field towards Highbury, and then to the right it is all open ground—there is a hedge or two to the right—these roads are rather un<lb></lb>frequented—the lane Daly was shot in, is called Highbury-park south—round at the end of that is an enclosure—there are two enclosures—there it a high paling to one, and over this paling you get to another one which lies immediately at the end of the lane—from that enclosure the ground lies down towards a woody part, trees and bushes, and a paling at the bottom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing instead of going to Highbury-park south he had gone down this declivity, there was no one to stop him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the gar<lb></lb>deners were in the garden-ground working—it was more open to the right at the end of the lane—there is a declivity, and at the bottom of that trees and bashes—there was nobody to stop his going down there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the persons in the first or second enclosure after him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were in the second enclosure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he had run down the declivity, would be not soon have been lost among the bushes and trees, unless you had gone down after him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—people were there at work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the bottom of the declivity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could not have got out of light—the people at work in the gardens were not to the left of the enclo<lb></lb>sure coming from Hornsey, but on the right as I ran after him—he must have passed between them and Mr. Wilson's—they were at work, I believe, in Mr. Wilson's garden, which is to the left of Highbury-park south coming from Highbury—leaving the palings to the left, there is a falling ground, and at the bottom trees, bushes, and palings—if he had gone down the declivity there were the gardeners to stop him in Mr. Wilson's garden—that is surrounded by a paling, but they were at work in the garden, and would have taken him if they possibly could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you say he was looking from right to left, was not he throwing his bead backward and forward as fast as he could? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he was doing so full ten minutes after Daly came up—it was ten minutes before any body offered to take him—he was throwing his head backward and forward in that manner at the moment Mott rushed on him—Mott tried to take advantage and seize him just as his head was away, and the moment after<lb></lb>wards his head came back to where Mott was—I had a gun—it was handed to me by Mr. Simmons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not just about that time that he fired when he saw the gun in your hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the baker had not a broom handle in his hand to my knowledge—I did not see any—I saw nothing done with a broom han<lb></lb>dle—I saw Turnbull with a brick in his hand—he was going to throw the brick at him—that was nearly at the same moment as I had got the gun—he was seized directly after he fired, and his arms held.</p>

On the day this happened I was in Hornsey-road in a cart, and was spoken to by Young—in consequence of what he said to me I drove along the Hornsey-road, and saw the prisoner close to the field running towards Highbury College—he had no hat on—I cannot say whether he had any thing in his hand—I pursued him—I got out of the cart, and went across the fields in the same direction as he was taking—I called out as I went along to induce people to join in pursuit—I called out, "Stop that man without a hat, he has shot a policeman"—there is a broad ditch in the way he was taking—I did not see him clear that—I went over it—he got over a fence leading to an enclosure—I did not get over myself—I was let through round by Highbury-barn—I was then inside the enclosure—I observed the prisoner then pacing up and down—he was ramming his hands up and down inside the breast of his coat—this was when he was in the enclosure close to Highbury-park South—I observed one person get over and go up towards him while he was in the enclosure—he got within a few yards of him—upon that the prisoner took two pistols out, one from the breast of his coat, and the other from his pocket—he presented one at me—I did not see him do any thing with the other—I did not hear any body say any thing—I then lost sight of him for a minute or two—I was let through round by Highbury Barn, and lost sight of him for that time—when I saw him again he was standing in the lane called Highbury-park South—there were a few people about him, and they kept increasing—he was standing with his back against the palings, and his arms extended with a pistol in each hand—I saw the policeman Daly there—Mott was standing by the side of him—I was not near enough to hear any thing said—I saw Mott make an advance towards the prisoner while he was so standing—upon which I directly heard the report of a pistol—I was thirty or forty yards off—I cannot say for a few yards—I taw the smoke of the pistol, and saw the pistol in the prisoner's hands—it was pointed in the direction of Mott</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener. On Thursday afternoon, the 5th of May, about four o'clock, I was at work in Mr. Paul's garden, near Highbury College, and heard Howard call out, "Stop the man with<lb></lb>out a hat, he has shot a policeman"—I came out and saw the prisoner standing in an enclosed ground with a pistol in each hand—I did not see him get over any fence—I went round in order to meet him—when I got round it brought me into Highbury-park south—I found the prisoner there, standing with his back against the fence, with a pistol in each hand and his arms extended—there were persons round him—Daly the police<lb></lb>man was standing by his side, about four yards from him—I heard Daly say to him, "I don't believe they are loaded"—the prisoner said, "The first one who dares to attack me shall have the contents"—I did not hear him say whether they were loaded—I saw Mott make a rush at him on the left hand side—the prisoner then lifted his arm up and fired with his left hand—it hit him on the left shoulder—I was close to him—he turned instantly to Daly, and fired at him with his right hand—he took a de<lb></lb>liberate arm—Daly immediately fell—he reeled a half circle and fell—I directly rushed in on the prisoner with others and seized him—I took a knife out of his watch-pocket—before that be bad dropped the right hand pistol, and I saw him lift his waistcoat to get the knife out of his watch-pocket, but I was too quick for him, and got hold of him—on getting the knife from him, he said, "I am <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> you have got all my weapons, but don't ill-use me"—the other pistol was wrenched from his left hand by some<lb></lb>body—I assisted in taking him to the station—they tied his hands with a piece of twine that I gave them—as we were going along to the station I asked him how he could do such a thing as this—he said, "I would have served you the same"—I saw two bullets taken from him at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Highbury. I was going home to tea, and saw the prisoner come from a spiked fence, near Highbury-park west, which led him into Highbury-park south—I did not perceive any thing in his hand when I saw him cross the field, nor when he came over the fence—I saw two pistols in his hand when he was in the field—he had two in his hand when he came into Highbary-park south—I was coming up towards him—he said, "What do you want with me? I have done nothing"—this was in the field before he got into Highbury-park south—I first saw him get over the spiked fence—he then had to cross the field before he got into Highbury-park south—it was in that field he asked what I wanted of him—I went after him—I said, "The people are hallooing after you, and saying you have shot a man in Hornsey-wood"—he said he had done nothing—he pulled out two pistols, and pre<lb></lb>sented at me—Murray, one of Mr. Wilson's men, was by at the time—I did not hear him ask him any questions at that time—the prisoner said no more, but sidled down the field—I saw him go through a motion as if loading a pistol—he came up the field and got over the fence into High<lb></lb>bury-park south—I followed him, and about the centre of the distance from where he got over, he placed his back against the paling—at this time Daly, the policeman, and several others were coming round the corner from Highbury-barn into Highbury-park south, which is no thoroughfare at one end, and at the other end these people were coming in—Daly said he thought the pistols were not loaded—the prisoner said, "You may take my word they are"—he was holding them out, one in each hand, at the time—Turnbull came up with a brick in his hand, and said, "You ought to have this"—he presented a pistol, and said, "You shall have this"—I saw Mott there—he had a broomstick in his hand—one pistol was pre<lb></lb>sented at Mott, and the other at Daly—I did not see Mott do any thing with the stick—I saw him rush in upon him—he then fired at Mott and wounded him in the shoulder, and then immediately shot Daly with the other pistol—Daly was about two yards from him—I then rushed in and secured him—the pistols and a knife were taken from him, and he said he was <hi rend="italic">done</hi> then, they had got all his weapons from him, he should give up.</p>

I was called into Highbury-park south on the day this happened, and found the deceased on the ground there—blood had issued from his wound—he was dead when I saw him—when I examined the body more particularly, after attending to Mott, I found a pistol-shot wound, which had decidedly caused his death—the body was in every respect correct, except that wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Supposing you had a patient who exhibited great want of sleep, should not You attribute that to some affection of the brain, to a diseased action of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in all cases, certainly not—continual excitement will keep sleep away—it is not always to be attributed to inflammation, because in affections of the brain we have <hi rend="italic">coma,</hi> and a perfect <hi rend="italic">comatose</hi> state of body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a patient showed great wakefulness beyond that of an ordinary person, would not you attribute that to an extraordinary and unusual action of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends very much on circumstances—a constant stimulant will some times keep persons swake, but in affection of the brain we have a very different state—the brain would sot be wrong in all cases of wakefulness—there are many cases of fever where there is great wakefulness—that may be to a certain extent caused by the action of fever on the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the absence of any artificial stimulant, and a person in an ordinary degree of health, showed great wakefulness, should not you attribute that to something wrong in the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it may be, but not in all cases—there are cases in which you might have action going on in the brain, and yet wakefulness kept up—if a person exhibited great wakefulness for years, without any symptom of disease, I should not attribute that to an affection of the brain—some people can do with two, or five, or six hours' sleep out of twenty-four, and go on in that way for years—I should say that was natural, unless explained in some other way—we have so many cases of the sort—I should attribute sleeplessness beyond the ordinary course of nature to a good mental activity—I should refer it to the operation of the brain, of course—if a person had a kettle of boiling water fall on his arm, and exhibited no signs of pain, I should not say it was natural or unnatural—I should say he would feel it, but whether he expressed what he felt would be another thing—he certainly must feel it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he does not appear to feel it, is not that at variance with the ordinary course of nature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not say it is perfectly consistent with the ordinary course of natural feeling—I say he would feel the pain, but whether he expressed it is another thing—if he has great moral courage he need not express it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe there is a disease in which the patient is excessively ravenous, and can hardly get enough to eat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are occasional symptoms</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130062"></xptr>
               <p>of that kind, called <hi rend="italic">bulimia,</hi> in which ravenous eating is the principal symptom, it is a depraved appetite—a want of control over the evacuations is certainly not usual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing an individual in apparent health exhibited great sleeplessness, was excessively ravenous in his appetite, very dirty in his habits, said he was converted and a child of God, called himself Dick Turpin and King Richard, and wanted to dig his father out of his grave, because it was no use he should lie there, would You be prepared to say he was in a sound state of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend very much on the circumstances—if satisfied those things existed, I should say there might be some peculiarity about him—he might have some of those symptoms without having the mind affected at all—if they all existed, I should say he was not in a sound state of mind—an alienation of the natural affections, a person fond of his relatives at one time, and subsequently exhibiting great violence to them, is one symptom of insanity—continual expressions of weariness of life is not always a symptom of insanity, it is at times certainly; an attempt on life may or may not be so—coupled with the other circumstances, I should say it was a symptom of unsound mind—an acute state of fever generally affects the brain, as putrid fever, and a malignant form of typhus—the brain is peculiarly liable to be acted on in that disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And sometimes the effects of the disease do not pass rapidly away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they last for a considerable time—I have known that disease, and disorders of that character, affect the brain for some years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person affected in that way, and a year or two after<lb></lb>wards had another severe illness of an inflammatory kind, that might increase the effect produced by the fever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—insane persons are particularly prone to resist aggressive attacks or violence—it is characteristic—wandering about without an object, is a symptom of insanityquiet and repose are favourable to the restoration of reason—in a person of unsound mind it is quite uncertain at what time the disease will reach the period of mania—any circumstance may bring it forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It may come out at any time, and particularly when acts of violence are threatened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a great many individuals only exhibit unsoundness of mind on certain subjects, that it <hi rend="italic">monomania</hi>—it is quite uncertain how soon a limited insanity may assume the form of a general one—the bodily faculties, in cases of mental derangement, are very considerably stronger than in ordinary persons—wakefulness is a symptom of deranged mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard the evidence in this case, and the conduct and demeanor of the prisoner deposed to throughout the transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there has been no act or expression attributed to the prisoner, deposed to to-day, which I consider a symptom of insanity—those circumstances do not show him to be a man of unsound mind in any one particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming a person had committed several robberies, noticed a po<lb></lb>liceman coming towards him, to jump through a hedge into a field, and conceal himself, would You refer that conduct to a diseased mind, or a consciousness on the part of the party so acting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perfect consciousness—supposing him to be followed by a policeman, and to disable the policeman in pursuit, by firing at him, I should refer that to perfect consciousness of what he was about</p>

I am clerk at the Police-court, Clerkenwell, and was acting in that capacity at the prisoner's first examination—after the conclusion, when the depositions of the witnesses were being taken, at the conclusion of the examination of each witness, Mr. Greenwood, the Magistrate, asked the prisoner if tie wished to ask either of the witnesses any questions—I took a note of what he said—at the conclusion of the examination of Young, the Magistrate put the question to the prisoner, and the prisoner, addressing the Magistrate, said, "Instead of saying I would shoot both, I said I would shoot the first one who would take me"—Young had stated to that effect, and the prisoner corrected it—this was on Saturday the 6th of May—the prisoner paid particular attention to the reading of the depositions of the several witnesses, and attended, to the questions of the Magistrate—at the conclusion of each witness, the Magistrate asked him if he understood all along what was going on—he gave his consent, and declined asking any witness questions, except the observation about Young.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's mother, and live at No. 1, Rawstorne-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner was twenty-three years of age last January—when young he had a severe illness—he had the putrid fever—he was about one year and eight months old then—previous to that he was like other children, as fine a child as was ever born, and had every symptom of being a fine, sensible child—after that illness he presented a different appearance—he never seemed to take any rest at all like another child—as he grew up he always was very restless—wake when we would, we always found him awake—up to this time he never to say, would rest half-an-hour at a time to my knowledge—since I have given tap housekeeping, we have slept in one room, and wake when I would, I always found him awake—it was a matter of observation with others besides myself—the old lady that is living with me now, and another that was with me five years back, when my husband died, knows that I have gone down to him many times in the night—from the time of his having this fever up to lately he has always exhibited this restlessness, and want of sleep—when any thing struck him, or he was scalded or burnt, he never appeared to care about it—he never appeared to have any feeling—once when he was about twelve years old, when I was up stairs with his father, when he had the gout, he threw a saucepan of broth all over his arm, and scalded himself, and the skin came off with his jacket and shirt sleeve—I applied oatmeal and water, and vinegar to it—he did not appear to care in the least about it—I cried bitterly to see it so—he said, "Never mind, I don't care much about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130064"></xptr>
               <p>it; I don't feel it"—he said he did not feel it but very little, and I was not to cry—when he was thirteen or fourteen years of age, he got up to some hooks at the top of a paling, and tore his arm and jacket—he said he did not feel it—he has from that time never seemed to care for hurts or scratches—however he hurt himself he did not seem to feel it—up to a late period of his life he has shown that disregard of hurts—when he was a child he fell under the grate, and burnt all the skin off his neck, and then he did not even shed a tear—that was after he had the putrid fever—with regard to his appetite, he was always very ravenous, very hungry—I could never give him enough—he never knew when he had had enough—that has continued down to a late period of his life—all the money he could get he would spend on cannons, pistols, and fire-arms, and buying and selling watches and Dutch clocks—I have taken cannons and pistols away from him, and bid them from him—he has missed them, (in the mean time I have had them in my possession,) and if he has earned enough money he has gone and bought more—that has continued to a late period of his life—he works at his business as a bricklayer when he can get it to do, when he was allowed to work—my husband was a bricklayer—frequently after I have been to bed, I have been disturbed by the prisoner's getting up, and walking about the room—he has many times said that there has been something lifting his bed up and down, and he could not sleep in it, and I have frequently made him up a bed in my back parlour where I sleep now—that has happened many times—he has often jumped up, and said he was King Richard, and Dick Turpin, when he was sitting in a chair—at that time he had no weapons—some times he had a pistol in his hand—that has happened more than once—he would often say he was King Richard when he had nothing in his hand—when he had, I made him put them away for fear he should do mischief with them—I have known him lay out his money in pistols, cannons, and so on, when he has not had a bit of bread to eat—he would go without a bit of shoe to his feet, and then buy pistols and watches—he has always expressed an indifference to life, always wishing to make away with himself—he was always tired of his life, from being quite a boy—he has said so many times, more than 100 times—when I was confined two years ago come the 4th of August, he got a bottle with some arsenic and laudanum in it—I got out of bed, and knocked it out of his hand, or he would have taken it—he was in the room at the time, towards the fire-place—I saw the phial in his hand—there was a white powder in it—I asked him what it was after knocking it out of his hand, and breaking it—he said it was arsenic and laudanum, for he was tired of his life, and if he did not do it then he would at another time—he was in his shirt at the time—he took none of it then—I knocked it out of his hand—between five and six months back he took 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of laudanum—he bought it a penny-worth at a time, and drank it.</p>

               <p>who is here, told me something, in consequence of which I went into the kitchen and saw the prisoner—he was then thrown on the bed by his brother, who is here—he was black in the face, and in a fit—at that time he was ill in bed, confined to his bed through illness—he had not been in Bartholomew's Hospital before that—it was shortly after that, I dare say two months afterwards—I put him into the workhouse before I put him into the hospital—I said it was because he was ill, but it was because he attempted to hang himself—I could not keep a watchful eye on him—his father (my husband) was then lying on his deathbed—he came from the workhouse without leave or liberty, and after I put him into the hospital, he came home from there one day without leave—he was never discharged at a patient—he came home without leave, the moment the music played op for the fair—when he was put into the hospital he was very ill—I believe he had the dropsy—he was swollen all over, and he was the same when he came home—his feet were wrapped up in pieces of carpet—he had no shoes on—he was swollen so that he could get no shoes to fit him—he could get no shoes on—once, after his father's burial, he fainted away—I was not at home when it happened, but after I came home he said he was going past the burial ground, and he saw his father come out of the grave—he said he wished he himself could die—I do not know that he said any thing about doing any thing to his father—since my husband died I have got my living by going out washing and charing, and part of the time I kept a little coal-shed—from the time the prisoner had the putrid lever down to the present time he has been very dirty indeed in his habits—he appeared to me to have no control over the natural motions—he would do hit occasions, and shake them out of his trowsers, as he went along, when he was fourteen years of age, and when he was older than that—when he was young I always used to put him in a coarse sheeting bag when I put him to bed, and when he got up, I always had to put him in a pail of water, and sluice him well—I could not put him in any thing when he grew older, but he has been very dirty up to this period, for if he was close to the place he would do it in a <hi rend="italic">po,</hi> and set it away under the bed, even latterly—his behaviour to me and my other sons has been pretty quiet in general, if he was not put out of the way—he has threatened me with violence when I have put him out, when I made him angry, when I wished to have any control over him—he has ill-used me on more occasions than one, once particularly, when he wanted to buy a watch, I had not got the money to give him, and he gave me a heavy blow on the side—at other times he would get and cry, and be as fond of me—about two years back he jumped out of bed, and threatened to blow his brother's brains out, and his own too—he frequently jumps out of bed and walks about, and sometimes when be does so he is violent—he was violent when he jumped out of bed and said he was going to blow his own and his brother's brains out—he has not slept out of my house for the last fifteen or sixteen months, except on one night, and that night he said he had got a check, and gone to the Surrey Theatre—he said he had come borne and knocked at the door, but could make nobody hear—that was about sixteen months ago—I remember his taking two Dutch clocks, one from the front kitchen and one from the back parlour, and pulling them to pieces—they had belonged to my husband—he took the faces off them, and said they were two skeletons—he took the weights, ropes, and the pendulum off, put the clocks, one on one side of the fire-place, and one on the other, set fire to them, and said he was burning</p>

               <p>down two castles—he would sometimes pawn his pistols, and sometimes sell them—I remember on one occasion, when he earned 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at his business, he went and bought a silver watch for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he picked it to pieces, and put it together again—he then went hack to Petticoat-lane, and sold it for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was not with him, I think his brother was—he brought back another watch, a metal one, which he also picked to pieces—he put that together again, so that he went and sold the movements for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was not with him, I believe my other son was—I know he pulled it to pieces, put it together again, and went away with it—that was on the same day—it is between three and four years ago, as far as I can guess—he has had very bad health lately—he is very weak, but he seemed very careless over it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing, then, that a person showed this sleeplessness, ravenonus appetite, dirty habits, and also an insensibility to hurt, would You say that that person was of sound mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not necessarily say from hearing that, that he was of unsound mind—I should ask for further information—I have had no information of any kind from the prisoner's relatives—insanity sometimes gives greater mental and bodily power than under other circumstances—I have heard all the evidence on the part of the defence, except the medical evidence—from the evidence I have heard on the part of the defence, and from what I have observed, I believe him to be of Bound mind—if I had merely heard the trial and not seen the man, I should still have thought him of sound mind—that would be my opinion, and that is my opinion from what I have heard to-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Sleeplessness will proceed from a variety of causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may—if a man was to be kept in total want of rest for many days, it would be likely to cause insanity instead of being a symptom of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am keeper of the gaol of Newgate. I recollect the occasion when the Messrs. Elliott came to see the prisoner—I was not with them when they saw the prisoner—I saw the gentlemen in the front lodge in the gaol, but did not go further into the gaol with them—I do not know from the prisoner on whose account they came—the prisoner has been in my custody ever since the 9th of May—I have had daily and frequent opportunities of seeing his conduct and manner—I have conversed with him, and heard him converse—I have not seen the least symptom of insanity in his conduct, manner, or conversation—I do not admit medical men to see prisoners without an order—these gentlemen presented no order, but application was made by the prisoner's solicitor.</p>

I have known the prisoner eight or ten years or more—I have had him in my custody on several occasions—I have conversed with him many times—I have never observed anything at all unusual or irrational in his conduct or conversation from the first to the last—when he was apprehended on this charge he was placed in my care—that was on the 6th of May—he was very talkative to me on any question that I asked him—he and I were conversing together for some time—when he first came, I called him Tom,</p>

               <p>as I knew him from a boy, and I told him it was a bad job he had got into now, it was worse than all the jobs he had ever come to me before upon—he was then labouring under some effects of illness—he said he had taken sixpenny worth of laudanum and sixpenny worth of arsenic—he appeared to be labouring under the effects of vomiting and sickness—when I told him it was a bad job, he said, yes it was, but he should have shot any man that had come near him, if it had been me it would have been the same, he would not have been taken by anybody if he could have helped it—he said he wished Penny had been there instead of the others, he should have shot him more freely than the rest, for doing his mother an injury—his mother had been in custody some little time before—at the second reexamination, I had heard from the doctor who came to see him while he was in my custody that some grass was issuing from Mott's wound, and I said to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> how came the grass to be in Your pistol?"—he said he had no paper, and he wadded his pistol with the grass in the field as he ran along—his mother was present on that occasion—I heard her tell him to pray to God for his unhappy soul, and urge him very much for some time—he answered with an oath, and said, "Oh, don't bother me with preaching; I have had preaching enough already"—he had been in prison one or two days.</p>

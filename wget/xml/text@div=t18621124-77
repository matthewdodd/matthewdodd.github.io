                  </hi>. I am a house-decorator, living at 34, Royal-street, Lambeth. On 17th November, about 5 minutes past 8 in the morning, I was coming up Snow-hill, towards the Old Bailey—Cooper was being executed that morning; he was hanging at the time—I turned into the Old Bailey—there was a crowd—previous to my getting to the Old Bailey the two prisoners followed me up Snow-hill, and kept very close to me—I did not like their appearance—when I got opposite the gallows, I thought I would turn back and go to Snow-hill again, where they hustled me, got my hands up right over my head, and got my watch from my pocket, breaking the guard from the key—as soon as I got my hands free, I seized them both by the collar—I told them they had my watch—I saw Windsor take it and pass it to Hurley—I saw him take it from my pocket; and I saw the guard in his hand, passing down from my waistcoat pocket, before I seized him—I did not see what became of it—I think it was passed, but I can't say where it went—it had been safe in my pocket a second before I saw the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, at 5, Queen-square, Hoxton. I was at the Old Bailey about 8 o'clock, on the morning of 17th November, and saw the prisoners standing by the side of me—I looked at Hurley—he said, "What are you looking at?"—I said, "I suppose you may be looked at?"—he said, "If you look at me again I will hit you in the b—eye"—they moved away then—just as they moved, the prosecutor was coming past—they followed him, and got him with his arms forced up; and I saw Windsor put his hand to his waistcoat pocket, and take it away very quickly; whether he passed anything or not, I cannot say, but he passed his hands towards Hurley—I tried to catch hold of him, but there were so many round I could not—the prosecutor detained them till the constable came.</p>

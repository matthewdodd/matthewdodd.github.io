On a Thursday I carried some articles from this house, and on this Saturday night I had got some more, and was stopped by the officer - I carried some boards and fixtures; I did not see the prisoner at the Pavement - I had seen the prisoner at Mr. Poole's yard, in Whitecross-street, and he went with me from there to Mr. Wilkinson's, in Golden-lane; this was on Saturday morning - I carried to Mr. Wilkinson's some leaden pipes; I cannot tell who helped me to load the cart, but the prisoner was in the yard at Poole's, and he went with me from there to Wilkinson's; I had before carried those things to Poole's from the Pavement, but I did not see the prisoner there; I also took a cistern to Poole's, and I took that to the Green-yard - I cannot say on what night I took the cistern from the Pavement; I did not see the prisoner at the Pavement.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was employed at No. 8, Pavement; I do not know the day - I had been there at work for three or four days before the things were stopped; the prisoner employed me to take down some fixtures there - I took down an iron safe, some partitions, and other things; I took down a cistern, and the prisoner assisted me - I took down some lead pipes, but the prisoner was not there then; I took that down by direction of young Mr. Poole.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not all this done in open day? A. Yes, there was no disguise about the prisoner; there were four persons at work there; these things were put into a van in the open day - there was no attempt to cover them. I remember the officer coming, and the prisoner demanded to know by what authority he came there - the prisoner said he had a right to the fixtures; he did not give me directions not to hurt the house, but I understood that was what he intended - I acted as I would in any case between landlord and tenant.</p>

I am a willow-manufacturer, and live<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110124"></xptr>in Whitecross-street; Mr. Richards is a broker - he employed me, on the 20th of February, to remove certain fixtures from No. 8, Pavement; I was to take them down in consequence of a distress - I am a pretty good judge of what are tenant's fixtures, and what are landlord's - and I removed all that I considered as tenant's fixtures; I saw the prisoner there once or twice - there were two leaden cisterns sold to Mr. Richards by Mr. Pitt; the things that were taken down went to my father's house in Whitecross-street - I thought they were all tenant's fixtures that I took down; I saw the cisterns and the water-closet taken down - I considered them tenant's fixtures; I received a sovereign from Mr. Richards - the shutters had not been opened on the 23rd.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You took down two cisterns? A. Yes, on account of Mr. Richards; and they were taken to my father's - one was taken from the yard, and the other from over the water-closet; there were three cisterns in all, and they were all taken to my father's.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you take down any thing but what was in your inventory? A. Yes, some partition, which Herdsfield said he found in the cart; we took down the window-sash, because Lowe said it would tumble - and some doors were taken down by mistake, to remove some of the articles, and they were put into the van, but not by my order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They were taken by mistake, and returned? A. We should have returned them if we could have got into the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What were the partitions you mentioned? A.Partitions in the shop, which I understand were put up by Mr. Adams - I think we were about an hour taking them down; they were wedged up from the floor - there was a sort of leg for them to stand on distinct from the fabric of the house - I understood Mr. Adams was attending there on account of his sisters Eliza and Anna Maria; I did not remove any articles but what I understood were claimed by the tenant - I superintended the removal of every thing; some three-quarter pipe was removed - it was such as would be put up by the tenant, and I have understood since that Mr. Adams put it up; we did not remove the large pipe which carried the water from the roof - Herdsfield came on the Saturday night, turned us all out, and took the names of the persons who were there, he pushed me off the step, locked the doors, and left a man in possession; he said he did not care, he had good backers, and Mr. Adams might do as he liked.</p>

            . I am a copperamith, and live in Golden-lane. I had seen the prisoner before he brought the lead to my house, which was on the 23rd of February; he had come before to inquire what price I gave - I said 9s. a cwt.; he said, he would send some, and he came with the cart - I asked where he came from; he said he was a dealer, and said, "We are pulling down some houses in the Old Bailey;" there were some lead cisterns cut in two, and some lead pipe - I paid him 5l. for it; he called on me again about three weeks ago, and said, "I understand you want to see me about this lead;" I said, "You have given me a great deal of trouble about it;" he said, "You have mentioned that I told you I brought it from the Old Bailey;" I do not think I made him any answer - he said, "Well, all I want is for a man to speak the truth, for I am sure no Jury can convict me for what I have done;" after I had settled with him for the lead, he said he had another wooden cistern lined with lead, which he thought he should take to the sale-room, as it would fetch more money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was any one present when this observation took place about his pulling down houses at the Old Bailey? A. No; I did not deny to Herdsfield that I had bought any lead - I buy lead every day.</p>
               <p>Q.You say the prisoner said "You said that I told you I brought the lead from the Old Bailey," why did you not make him an answer? A. I did; I said, "So you did."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell my Lord distinctly, that you made no answer? A. I did not understand the question; when he said all he wanted was for a man to speak the truth, I said certainly, I should do it; my daughter was there - I do not know that she heard it.</p>

            . I am an appraiser. I was employed by Mr. Pitt to make an inventory of the goods which had been seized for King's taxes, at No. 8, Pavement - I made an inventory of all that was liable to be seized as tenant's fixtures; there were three leaden cisterns in the house, but only one belonged to the tenant as I considered - we wanted more money, I should have taken more if we could - we wanted 44l., and what we took fetched but 16l. 3s. - I left my inventory with Mr. Pitt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you leave Poole there? A. I think he was; there were three cisterns on the premises - I think we left two behind; we took only one, there certainly are not two in my inventory - I do not know when the house was shut up; we condemned on the 18th, and the things were removed before the 23rd, I should think.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. There was a water-closet - was that a tenant's fixture? A. To all intents and purposes a landlord's fixture.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you at all judge, from the mode in which that water-closet was put up, whether it had originally been put up with the house, or put up afterwards by the tenant? A. No, I cannot tell; it might have been put up by the tenant, but it belonged to the landlord - some fifteen years ago I saw the same water-closet there, because I was then about taking the premises; the ground floor was then adapted for a private residence, and was in Mr. Selig's occupation - it has since been converted into three shops, by putting up partitions, which was most likely done by the tenant; the original front had been taken out, and a court-yard had been inclosed, since I saw it fifteen years ago - I cannot tell how many cisterns were there then.</p>

I saw the things which were brought back from the van fitted to the premises - I saw a cistern lined with lead fitted, it fitted the place exactly - I met Mr. Montague on the 23rd of March there; he told me there were some things at the Green-yard, and he wished me to bring them back - I got a cart about one o'clock, brought them back, and fitted them as near as I could - some of them were tenant's fixtures, and some landlords, but that depends on the clauses in the lease; I should say a water-closet was a landlord's fixture - I cannot tell whose the partitions and skirtings were - I saw some mahogany window-sashes which had been cut to take out the glass: I do not know how old it was - I had never been on the premises before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is not the skirting a ledge of wood put up along the floor, to make the partition flush with the floor? A. Yes, and by removing that and the partition the room would be restored to its former size - they were not the original fabric of the house, they were put up like a screen.</p>

            , ESQ. The house in question belonged to the City of London - I was there on the 26th of February, in consequence of a statement made to me that there were very considerable dilapidations there - I found the shelves and closets had been removed, a cistern and water-closet taken away, various partitions and some of the doors of the rooms - a mahogany glazed sash had been taken away; the water-closet and cistern were the landlord's fixtures.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the front sash cut to make a place for a fishmonger? A. It appeared to he cut for the purpose of taking out the glass with more facility - it might have answered for a fishmonger.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was not the frame and glass removed in one piece? A. No, part of it was evidently broken, part of the broken sash remained on the premises - the frame part was left, but that which holds the panes of glass in was removed; the shutters were up; if they had not been up, the whole would have been open - the manner in which it was done led me to the impression that it was done for the purpose of taking the glass away.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q.Was this a part of the house? A. Most unquestionably.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. That shop front could not have been let with the premises? A.Certainly not.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I produce the commission of bankruptcy against the prisoner's brother.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My brother purchased the lease of Selig in 1822 - the premises then consisted of a private dwelling-house, and he contracted with a carpenter in Cullum-street, to alter it into three shops - the centre one he occupied himself; he paid the carpenter 300l., and he laid out about 200l. more, and Mr. Selig had expended 1500l. or 2000l. on it; in 1824 my brother became a bankrupt, but he had previously mortgaged the lease for 300l., and the assignees would have nothing to do with it; my sisters were partners with him in his trade, but he was a bankrupt on his own separate account; the trade paid in full, and my sisters purchased of the assignees his one-third interest in these premises - of course I need not say that, when my brother laid out this money, he had no idea that the City would take them down; but when the City took it in their heads to take these premises down, they gave notice (on the 12th or 13th of February) to the tenants to remove; the object of the tenants then was to dispose of the fixtures, and my sisters employed me to take them down, to sell them to the best advantage; I said, "There are King's taxes due, and the King has power to come in, and, as you are going away, the best way would be for

             to put Poole in possession" - but the King's tax-gatherer came in, and distrained; I saw my brother, and said, "It is not worth while to stand out - let them take the things;" he agreed not to act; Poole however remained by desire of my sisters; the fixtures were appraised, and my sisters purchased them, and the whole of the property again became my sisters'; we were proceeding to remove them, when, on the Saturday evening, one of the men came to me and told me to go down - I went, and saw Herdsfield; I said, "What is all this about?" he said, "I act under the orders of the City Comptroller - I have orders to stop every thing coming from the premises, and I shall take possession of the house;" he said, "I understand you have stripped the lead off the roof," and he went up to see, but he was afraid to get out on the roof; he said a great many things had been taken away - I said,"We have taken the things we have paid for;" he said he had nothing to do with it, that he was employed by Mr. Hookey; he then asked the men their names, and said, observe, "I do not insist upon their giving their names and address, but I advise them to do it" - I gave mine, and he put it down; he them said, "It is very well you gave your names, or I should have locked you up;" he then said,"The next thing is, you must walk out," and he pushed us out, and left a man in possession - I went to Mr. Poole and was telling him the facts, and in a few minutes Herdsfield came in; he called for a light, which brought out Mr. Poole, who said, "What is all this about?" Herdsfield said, "I am a City officer, I came to see what you have got" - he said his name was Herdsfield; Mr. Poole said,"I desire you to show your authority or warrant;" he said he had none, but he came by order of Mr. Hookey - Mr. Poole desired him to walk out, but I said "We have done nothing that we are ashamed of, let him see what we have;" he then said he was not a judge, but Mr. Montague would come on Monday - on the Monday I was there; the patrol came, and said he came from Mr. Newman, who gave his compliments, and desired that nothing should be removed; I said it should not - the articles were then in the yard; on the Tuesday Mr. Poole was summoned to show cause why he detained certain property; and on the next day he was summoned before Alderman Wilson, to know why these things were removed - on the Saturday I went to the Justice-room, where the witnesses for the prosecution were present; I was ordered to stand before Mr. Ald. Wilson, who read over the evidence of Lowe and another, who had been examined - I said if any charge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110126"></xptr>existed, it should be made against myself, as they had been employed by me; he discharged them, and ordered me to find bail, and I was detained till four o'clock. when my friends arrived, and bail was given of two house-keepers, in 20l. each; on the Tuesday I went again before Alderman Wilson, and was examined in a private room; no clerk was present, but the deposition was taken by Mr. Newman, and I was committed for trial - when my brother took the house it was the private residence of Mr. Selig: he divided it into three shops and three separate dwellings, and was obliged to erect water-closets in each of them, and to take water from the yard to supply them, and also a sink and a cistern for domestic purposes - the one which was for himself was on the third story; he made one attic his own kitchen, and carried the pipe from the street to it - there was also a kitchen in the further part of the premises, but no cistern to that; with respect to the cistern in the yard, weighing five or six cwt., it was purchased by my brother when he went into the place - the real fact of the case is, that I was too much of an Englishman to put up with this City possession; and I told Herdsfield I would bring an action against him, and thus they have instituted this charge of felony. But I am here to abide your verdict, and all I ask for is justice at your hands - I ask for no mercy, I have committed no offence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in King-street, Borough. The prisoner lived in my house up to about June, for some weeks—on the 12th of June a letter arrived, addressed to him at my house—I saw him open it, and take out a stamp, with a blank acceptance across, in the name of "Fryer"—I saw him fill it up in the usual way of a bill—he endorsed it—he got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me—the bill was for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to take out of it what he owed me, which was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for clothes and other things for nearly the amount—he gave me the bill—I took it to Mr. Bennett, came back, and told the prisoner Mr. Bennett would make inquiry as to the bill, and in the morning he would give the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Well, I will go with you to Mr. Ben<lb></lb>nett,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183909160170"></xptr>
               <p>which he did; and from what he said, in connexion with what was said in the letter the bill came in, Mr. Bennett was satisfied, and would not inquire—he said if it was Fryer's name it was as safe as the Bank of England—on the 18th of the same month another letter came to the prisoner with an enclosure—he opened it, read it, and expressed himself astonished that it had not been much more, and he expected he would have sent him money instead of that paltry bill—I said he ought to be satisfied with the bill—I went out of the room, and when I came back the bill was lying on the table—the prisoner said he was waiting for Mr. Newington to put his name to it, saying, according to the engagement he was under with the house he travelled for, he dared not put his name to a bill, or accept one—Mr. New<lb></lb>ington came—the prisoner afterwards delivered me this bill, filled up for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and signed—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this was delivered to me on exactly the same terms as the former—he wanted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash, and the remainder he would take out in the way of business—he had a suit of clothes immediately on it—I took it to Bennett, who gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I handed to the prisoner—I received a letter from the prisoner, purporting to be written by Hannington—the bill had come in that, and he left it in the room—I received a letter by post, marked "No. 2"—I believe that to be in the prisoner's writing.</p>

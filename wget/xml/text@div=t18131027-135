            , myself. On the 22nd of January, we missed a cask of ale; I received information of it being missed about six o'clock in the evening. On the next morning we obtained a search warrant to search the defendant's house, the sign of the Sun and Punch Bowl, Long-lane; the officer told him what we had come for; we found the ale in the cellar, behind a butt; we found parts of the head of the cask in the coal cellar adjoining, with the remainder of the two heads; the body of the cask was in the cellar where the other beer was. The inside of the cask was wet with the ale; the rushes between the staves were full of ale; the hoops on the outside of the cask were rather bright, from friction of being rolled. I then searched for the ale itself. The size cask that we lost was thirty-six gallons. In the cellar adjoining it, we found the ale in another cask, with the bung out; we tasted it; I have no doubt it was our ale; he did not take ale of us. There was no other ale in the cellar like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your marks upon the cask - A. Yes; there was the name Hale, Red-cross-street. It had been nearly obliterated by an adze. I do not think the ale had been brewed three months.</p>

            . I went with a search warrant to search the defendant's house. I told him what I came for, to search for a cask of ale, and he could save me some trouble if he would shew me where it was; he said, he knew nothing about the cask, it had been about the premises two years. It appeared to me to have been broken up recently.</p>

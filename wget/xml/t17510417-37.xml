            . I live at Ipswich, which is about nine miles from Hadley, I was present when the prisoner at the bar was apprehended at Seymore, with a quarter-master and some dragoons, we got to his house, and when the soldiers were properly planted I knock'd at the door; his wife said who is there? Mr. Nodes, I said yes; said she, I'll come presently, the door was barr'd, I could not get in, then said she what do you want, I said, to see what you have got in the house; after we were in she fell down on her knees, and said for God's sake don't ruin me; looking behind a bed where was a maid servant in it, I ordered the candle to be held, so that I could look round it, which stood close to the wall. I saw something white, at last I saw it stir; said I, come out, said the prisoner, I will, said he, it is to no purpose to make any resistance for I know I am outlawed. I have been in his company abundance of times, I never knew he worked at his trade these eight or ten years, and we always called him John Baker of Hadley.</p>

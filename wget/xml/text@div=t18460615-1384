                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Salisbury-street, Bermondsey. I had a shawl in pawn at Mr. Sprunt's—these pieces now produced are parts of it—it has been burnt—I swear to the pattern of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Ann Bennett. On the 1st of June I went to Mr. Sprunt's, the pawnbroker's, for the shawl—it was put on the counter—the prisoner was standing there—I left the counter, leaving the shawl there—I returned in about two minutes—it was then gone, and the pri<lb></lb>soner also—I am sure the prisoner had been next to me—there had been ano<lb></lb>ther young woman there, who went out before me, and she and I came back together—as I was going home I saw the prisoner talking to two women—I asked if she had been to Mr. Sprunt's—she said, "No"—I said there was a shawl missing, and she was like a person who had been there—I asked her to let me look under her bundle, and she would not—she said, what did I want—I asked her to go back to Mr. Sprunt's, and she would not—she said I night come to her house—I went to Mr. Sprunt's, and the young man came with me to her house—the shawl was not there.</p>

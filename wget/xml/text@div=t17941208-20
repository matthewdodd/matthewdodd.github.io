               <p>Q. What side was it, the right or the left? - The left side.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the thigh part of her body? - Just below her ribs, on her belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the thigh? - Yes, there was a mark there, which was rather black, white and purple.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was delivered, was the child living or dead? - The child was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been long dead, in your judgment? - I think, in my judgment, about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the poor woman make any expressions how she came by that injury? - I had heard her say several times, the day I was with her, O, Watt I you have been the death of me! she said that several times to herself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she live after her delivery? - Nine days.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she, at all, mend or get better after her delivery? - She got a little better on Monday, but she was very bad again on Monday night; she was delivered on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any judgment of the cause of her death? - No; I think it was owing to the kick that she received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You found this a difficult case, and your skill was not sufficient to deliver her, and then you called in one Dr. Cooper. Now, I take it for granted, your's is not so good an account of her death as Dr. Cooper's will be? - I really take that to be the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080078"></xptr>Q. That is not an answer; but I take it for granted, you do not apprehend yourself to be so good a judge of the cause of her death as the surgeon? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray which should you think was the cause of her death, that you see on her thigh or that on her belly? - That on her belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not think that the kick on her thigh could be the cause of her death? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. You have practised in the midwifry department many years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you called in to attend the labour of this poor woman, Mrs. Hubbard, in the workhouse? - I was. I found she had a fever on her, and she complained of a pain in her side; I asked her how long she had been ill, and had had that pain in her side? she said, about a fortnight; the labour was over in about an hour, but the pain in her side increased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her attribute any cause to the pain in her side? - I heard one of the women say, but I did not hear the woman herself say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks about her person? - The body was opened about nine or ten days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you formed any judgment of the cause of her death? - It appeared to me that that fever was the immediate cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you called upon to form any judgment as to any violence about her, at the time she was delivered? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The child we have heard was born dead? - Yes, and it had been dead some time.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended that dissection, were there any external marks, or internal, by which you could form a judgment of any injury having been done to the woman? - Not that I could trace to any external injury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You was called upon to deliver this woman because it was a difficult case? - I believe her fever made the midwife think it was more difficult than it really was.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe the fever was the cause of her death; you was present at the dissection? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And of course you have examined whether any external injury whatever could occasion her death? - She was opened by my desire for that express purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. And from the accurate inspection you made, you are of opinion that there were no external injury that could produce the consequence that followed? - That is my opinion.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you open the body of this poor distressed woman? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard of any external injury she had received? - I was told she had been kicked.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon examining the body what did you find? - Upon opening the body there was an appearance of a great inflammation, and in consequence of that inslammation there was a large deal of matter floating on the surface of the bowels, but no external injury.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you, from your judgment, tell whether it was occasioned by any external injury? - I should think that the death was not occasioned by any external injury.</p>

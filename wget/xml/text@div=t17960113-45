               <p>Q. You have had the misfortune to have had your till robbed? - A. A great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th of December you had occasion to mark some money? - A. On Wednesday, December the 9th, I had a great quantity of halfpence in the till; I called Mrs. Waterhouse, a person that does my business when I am absent.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you come to the night before you lost the things out of the till? - A. This is the Wednesday before; the bar is very large; Mrs. Waterhouse put some halfpence into the till which I gave her to put there, and I saw her lock the till, and lock the bar door; it is customary for me to leave the key for her to go into the bar in the morning, and I gave her the key of the bar, and took the key of the till myself; on Thursday morning, I had not above 8d. in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you put in? - A. Mrs. Waterhouse can tell better than I can; on Thursday night there was 6s. left in the till in halfpence; we went to bed; I begged Mrs. Waterhouse to watch particularly how the bar was in the morning: on Thursday night I took four copper medals and a sixpence to Mr. Hay, a neighbour, and desired him to mark them; I did not see him mark them, but I left them with him; he returned them to me in a few hours after, and I kept them during the day, and at night put them into the till; I called Mrs. Waterhouse to put some more halfpence into it, we left 6s. copper in the till, I told them myself; the medals, the sixpence, and the halfpence; in shutting the till, I told her it was necessary to cover the silver sixpence, she put her hand into her pocket, and took out two-pence, which I covered the sixpence with myself, she stood by me; Mr. Hay came to me by appointment, to sit up with me that night; at eleven o'clock we went into the most convenient room, which was a back parlour, at a great distance from the bar, near the stair-case, close to the stair foot, and between half past one and two, I heard somebody come down stairs, or more properly I heard the stair-foot door fly to.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that you heard somebody come down stairs? - A. I am certain I heard something of a person moving; we then concluded that we would not alarm the watchman or any body, till the morning; in the morning, at six o'clock, when my family were going to get up, I struck a light, and sent Mrs. Waterhous to search the bar; I did not go with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell us what passed between you? - A. I then heard somebody going down stairs, and I found it was Smith with his shoes in his hand; I stopped him, and said, Smith, my house has been robbed three nights running, you, nor nobody else shall go out of my house till I have had you searched; he then returned up stairs, and I called to my man-servant not to open the door, and to take care that nobody should go out; I called for a light, and Mrs. Waterhouse, the servant-maid, and the watchman and I went up stairs into his bed-room, and he was then sitting upon his bedside; the feather-bed had been ripped open, and the feathers had flown all about his back, and about the floor; I went up to him and asked him to give me the money he had robbed the till of, that I had been robbed, and I was sure he was the thief; he made me some answer, I don't recollect what, I told him there was marked money among it, not to hesitate, but give it me directly; he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a parcel of halfpence; I begged the favour of Mr. Hay to take them from him, and in turning them out of his hands into Mr. Hay's, I saw the silver sixpence that was marked; I then desired the servant-maid to examine the bed, her name is

               <p>Q. You told him your house had been robbed, and he should not go out till he was searched? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You observed some feathers on his coat? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the bed could not have been of a very good kind? - A. A very good feather bed; it was on account of his employers, that I took him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know, it is customary for persons, who have not sufficient covering upon the bed, to lay their cloaths upon the bed? - A. I suppose it may.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had been out of his room for sometime, of course? - A. There was no place for him to be out of his room, but coming down stairs; I stopped him when he was coming down stairs.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live in Drury-lane: Mrs. M'Cann came to me on Friday, the 11th of December, to mark some money; and I marked four copper medals, and a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you mark them? - A. With the prong of a fork; they were different marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to identify the marks you made, when you see them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you them? - A. I cannot say; I might have them two hours; I left them for her when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they ever out of your possession? - A. Yes; lying on a table.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they wrapped up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the same medals, and the sixpence, back again, that you had received from her? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do next? - A. In the evening she asked me to sit up with her, during the night, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen in the night that you took notice of? - A. Yes; I heard somebody come down stairs, and we took no notice of it, till the next morning, at six o'clock, I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got the medals? - A. I have one of them, and the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave them to you? - A. The prisoner at the bar; I was sent for about twenty minutes after I went home; I returned to Mrs. M'Cann's; I found Mrs. M'Cann and the prisoner in the bedroom; she immediately demanded the money, that she said, he had taken out of the till; and he gave me one of the medals, marked, and a marked sixpence, and 1s. 10d. in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that marked sixpence and that marked medal, the same sixpence and medal that you had marked? - A. The very same. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us if these are the same that you marked, and that the prisoner gave you? - A. Yes; they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did you see any thing else particular in the room? - A. I saw the feathers, in the room, strewed about; I found a great many halfpence, two keys, a stone bottle of liquor, I supposed to be rum, and a piece of sugar; he was taken to the watch-house, and I saw a key found upon him, of a very particular nature; and a knife that answered the purpose of a knife and a turnscrew; said, by the prisoner, to be a thing he made himself; I left him at the watch-house, and appeared before the Magistrate; and that is all I know</p>

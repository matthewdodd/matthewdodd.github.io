               <p>Q. From what part of the house was the property taken - A. From a one pair of stairs back room; he got up the water butt, and by a ladder fixed on the butt he got in the window; it was a sash window, it was up, I had left it open. I lost property to the amount of between thirty and forty pounds, the exact amount I cannot tell, in notes and cash. The money was in a drawer, locked up, I had the key in my pocket. The prisoner lodged in my house, he told me he was a lighterman, he had lodged in my house between five and six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at home that night - A. Yes, I saw him that evening at half past eleven o'clock, he was in the parlour; he went out after that, and staid out about a quarter of an hour. I saw him when he came in, I asked him where he had been.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had lost between thirty and forty pound - A. To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever since seen part of your property - A. Yes, on his first examination. The prisoner was apprehended on the 20th, he was taken at a public-house close by.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Before you open it do you know the number of your notes - A. I know the five pound note by a tare. I cannot say I know the numbers, there is no mark to enable me to speak to the ten pound note; I have every reason to believe this is my five pound note; I tore it myself; the money was all safe in my drawer at four o'clock, the five pound note likely I might have it a week or a fortnight. I cannot exactly say.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the Thames police office. I apprehended the prisoner on the 20th of July, between nine and ten in the evening, I took him out of the tap-room into the parlour, I told him he was charged with a robbery; he said nothing, he was about half groggy; I found in a pocket inside of his jacket, that he has on now, a ten pound note, a five pound note, and a one pound note, and in his outside pocket, two dollars and six shillings, that was all; I kept him in custody. I asked him if he had received any money; he said upon the Saturday before that he received a one pound note of his master, that was all he received. On the Sunday morning I went to him; he was locked up in the office; I asked him if he knew what money I had taken from him; he said yes; I asked him where he got it; he said he took it from Mrs. Shepherd, he got into the room at the back window; I asked him how he had forced the half chest of drawers; he said, by pulling it the lock flew off; I told him there was more money lost than found; I asked him whether his wife had any part of it; he said no; she was apprehended, and she said she knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That gentleman swore false against me; I said no such thing. The money I brought from sea with me.</p>

A. Perkins, some cottage, Rotherhithe—she asked me to fill up the notice, and asked if she could have the warrant left at the post-office till called for, as she did not know which house they would be at, as they were about moving—I filled up the notice of withdrawal—I saw the book and saw that there was more than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there, but the prisoner said that she only wanted 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out then—I sent the notice to the chief officer—the prisoner made her mark and I witnessed it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then gave her the deposit book and she left—she came again on Mon<lb></lb>day, the 11th, and asked if the papers had arrived; she had not got her book with her, and I told her to come again—she came in the afternoon and brought Mary Ann Perkin's book—she was asked to call a little later on and she came about 4.30—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the warrant for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable to Mary Ann Perkins—I did not give the prisoner the money, because she could not bring anybody to identify her as Mrs. Perkins—she said that it was very awkward as she did not know anybody who would know her as she generally dealt at Deptford, and no tradesmen near would know her—the deposits had been made at Rotherhithe, and we suggested that she should get Miss Crowson, the daughter of the postmistress to identify her, to witness her mark—she went away and came back with the book—I then found that the warrant was signed "Mary Ann Perkins," and a cross put to it—she said that Miss Crowson had guided her hand, and had put the cross to make it all right—I said that Miss Crowson must put her name as a witness, and she went away and came back and said that Miss Crowson said that she was not going to do it as she did not know anything of her—I told her she had better go to the post-office, and I gave her back the deposit book and the warrant, and she left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Surrey Commercial Docks—I had a savings' bank book as well as my wife, and documents and receipts for payments, which I kept in my wife's box, tied up in a bundle—on a Sunday evening, at 8 o'clock, my wife went to fetch her book for me to look at, as there was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to make up, and she discovered that it was lost, and my documents as well—I kept my book in another part of the house—I gave no one authority to take the book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My documents were kept in my wife's book—my book was kept in my writing desk—I have not had frequent disagreements with my wife about money—we have had a few words, but nothing out of the way—that was a few weeks before—I have not followed her down the street threatening to murder her—it was not I who gave the prisoner into custody—I gave information to the General Post-office—I have not seen the prisoner much in my house, but I have occasionally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My wife told me that she had handed her book to Mrs. Burke, and that upset me—I told her it was very foolish, that if she wanted money I could always draw some from my bank book—I have never lost a day's work and never kept money away from her—there is no pretence for saying that my wife and I take different lines—that is the prisoner's hus<lb></lb>band who is now suggesting these questions about my following her down the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 52, Trinity Street, Rotherhithe, and keep house for my father—the prisoner is my landlady—I know Mrs. Perkins; she has been in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to the prisoner's—I remember her coming on the Saturday—I was at home—I always open the shop for the prisoner—I was in the parlour; nobody was there but me and the prisoner—between 10 and 11 o'clock Mrs. Perkins came in, she took the prisoner's jacket off her and put her own shawl on her, and she then handed her a book and some papers, as the prisoner sat on the <hi rend="italic">sofa</hi> and said "Come along with me, my dear, I thought you would have been out before this"—the prisoner said to me "Lock the door, Mary," and they both went out together—I am quite sure that I saw a book and some papers; I solemnly swear it—I have had no conversation with Mrs. Perkins since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am single—I have kept house for my father since my mother's death—he occupies the front parlour upstairs; we have only one room—I occupy the same bed-room as my father; he is a carman—I do nothing for my living—the prisoner does not pay me anything for opening the shop for her—I have been there three years; I have only been at home' two years—I was in service when my mother died—my father has two young children—my other sister is married and gone away—that is the prisoner's husband (<hi rend="italic">pointing him out</hi>) he is a cooper, I believe—I know nothing about the the savings' bank—when Mrs. Perkins came in the pri<lb></lb>soner was ready dressed—Mrs. Perkins took off her jacket and put on the shawl—I do not know whether the shawl was smarter than the jacket—it was not a very warm morning—it was a thick jacket—she did not ask her to lend it to her, she took it off without speaking—I can't tell you what sort of a book it was, it appeared as if she did not want me to see it—it was not the same colour as this testament, I think it was more of a drab</p>

               <p>colour, but I could not exactly sec it—as she handed her the shawl she gave her the book and papers, but they were passed so quick that I cannot tell you anything about them—the papers were like this (<hi rend="italic">foolscap</hi>) and they were doubled up in this way—I never heard that the prisoner was going to move—she had not been there all the time my father had; she was only there seven week—I never heard that she was going to move to Jamaica Road—the brokers were not in about the time she came—I never heard of her borrowing money of Mrs. Burke—they never mentioned to me that they were going to America; I had not heard it discussed—I new had any conversation with Mrs. Perkins, only I used to open the shop for her of a morning—I live in the house still and the husband lives there—I have never talked it over with him—I have only seen him two or three times, and he has never said a word to me, except asking me what time Mrs. Burke went out on Saturday, if I did not mind telling him—he asked me if "I would tell him what I knowed"—I said that I could not state the time she went out, but 1 thought it was between. 10 and 11 o'clock—that was the time that Mrs. Perkins gave her a book and some papers—I don't know whether it was on the Monday or Tuesday—I went to the police-court on Friday, but I was not called—I told the husband that I had seen Mrs. Perkins give her a book and papers on the Monday or Tuesday, and on Friday I went to the police-court—the husband was there and I was not called—I did not tell the solicitor, because I did not see him.</p>

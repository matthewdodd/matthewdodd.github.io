This was on Friday I think the 14th, about eleven o'clock at noon. I cannot positively say it was the second week in May.</p>

            . I live at the King's-mews-gate, Castle street. I am a dealer in foreign linen; the prisoner came to my house and asked me if I wanted to buy any rich furniture, he produced three curtains, the outside rich damask, the inside rich sarsenet, and the border blue velvet; I asked him how he came by these curtains, I had suspicion they were not his own; he said he was a carpenter by trade, and he was in good circumstances. I said where these curtains were, there must be more; he said his wife had got the remainder of the curtains, he had got a bad woman for his wife, he had parted with her; he said I had no occasion to have suspicion if I would go with him to Westminster, I should find he had a good character. I went with him to the corner of Charles-street, there is an oil shop, he went into the oil shop and stopped ten minutes; he came out again; he said the people that I want<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020043"></xptr>to give you a character of me are not at home. I went into the oil shop. I happened to know the oil shop-man. I asked him if he knew the prisoner; he said he did not know him; I took him of oneside, and said the prisoner had brought me some furniture, I thought it was not his own. In the mean time the prisoner ran off. I went home and found the prisoner at my house; I said, what did you ran away for, I think the curtains do not belong to you. I sent for a constable; the prisoner ran out; my son ran after him, and caught him in the mews; I went for a constable, and he was taken before the magistrate at Queen-square office. The prisoner asked me two pounds for the curtains.</p>

The prisoner returned before my father came home; he said he could not agree about the price of the curtains with my father, and therefore wished to have them back.

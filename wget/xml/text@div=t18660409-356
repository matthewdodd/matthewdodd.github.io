I apprehended Morgan—I then went to Bull's house on 24th March—he deals in old clothes and boots, and is a general dealer—I was in plain clothes—I asked him if he knew who I was—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you bought any plate of any young man lately, about last Friday week?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I after<lb></lb>wards told him I had made a mistake, it was last Friday fortnight—he said, "It is all the same, I have not bought any, and I have not seen any for a long time"—I said, "I have been informed that you have purchased some of a young man named Beazley, and you must consider yourself in custody for receiving things (which I enumerated), knowing them to have been stolen"—he said, "I have not seen any for a very long time of any sort"—I took Bull—he was confronted with Parry at the station—Parry stated what he had to-day, but Bull said nothing—the inspector said, "You hear what Parry says?"—he said, "Yes"—about an hour afterwards, I left a constable in charge of Bull, and searched his house—there was nothing there—that was rather more than a fortnight after the property had been missed—I took Dagworthy on the 11th, and Morgan on the 19th—Dagworthy was dis<lb></lb>charged by the Magistrate—I told Morgan what I took him for—he said, "I know nothing about it."</p>

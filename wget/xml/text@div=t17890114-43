               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I obtained a conditional pardon, and that was obtained before my mother died.</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. He says there is a pardon in the Recorder's Office.</p>
               <p>Townshend. There certainly is such a pardon. I went down with this lad to Portsmouth, and the captain told me to find out his friends, and send them down to take him away, for he had received orders to discharge him. I have seen the pardon, in the name of Ward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The captain set me at large; I waited on him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Dixon. I called at the Recorder's Office myself, and Mr. Jones, the Recorder's clerk, told me there was a conditional pardon; but that the prisoner had never availed himself of it, and it was of no use. He was to enter into sureties to transport himself; and he never did, but made his escape.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. If there is any such pardon, which I am inclined to believe there is, it is on condition of leaving the kingdom, and giving security.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Campbell ordered me to be set at large; and if you write to the captain, you will find it to be true.</p>
               <p>Court. Care will be taken to enquire.</p>
               <p>Young. He made no resistance when I took him.</p>

These were all taken out of the box, I ran back and told the grenadier who had stopped Williams, what I had lost; the grenadier then gave me a silver tea spoon, the three bank notes, a canvas bag with seven guineas, and I believe the silver sizes. I then went back to see what was lost from the bottom of the cupboard, from whence I missed thirteen pounds, in half crowns, and a guinea; on my return again, my wife had all the money in her apron, they kept Williams in custody, 'till I got a constable: I have got all my property again, it was all found on Williams, the grenadier found the things on Williams that he delivered to me.</p>

As Mr. Venables was coming into the room he delivered me the notes and a canvas bag; I delivered them to Mr. Venables, and he went out of the room again as soon as I delivered them, Mrs. Venables came in and said she had lost her half crowns; I put my hand to his coat pocket and felt something; then I put my hand in his pocket and took out some of the half crowns; he gave Mrs. Venables the rest. I asked him if he had any more of the landlord's property, he said he had only a few shillings of his own; I felt in his breeches pocket and found two or three shillings and a sort of a coronation medal, which I thought might be his own property, and therefore I gave him them again.</p>

Somebody told me we were robbed. I saw it was the same man I had before served with rum and water: somebody called me to take the money. The warder held his sword before Williams, Williams told me not to be afraid, he would deliver me my property: I went, and held my lap, and he put in thirteen pounds in half crowns, eight guineas, five quarter guineas, and a silver spoon, and two pounds fifteen shillings and sixpence in shillings and sixpences; I am positive to the sum, my husband had it put down every day.</p>

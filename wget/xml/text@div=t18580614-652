                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a general shop, in Carlisle Street, Lambeth. On 28th April, about 9 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me a bad half crown—I asked him if he was not ashamed of himself, to bring me such a thing as that; he said, "I did not know it was bad; I took it an hour ago, of Mr. Hearne, at the dust yard, in payment of wages"—I took it to Mr. Tennison, next door, but did not part with it, and he returned with me, and said to the prisoner, "Did you tender this bad half crown?"—he said, "I did not know it was bad"—he went away from the shop some few yards, and Mr. Tennison followed him, and called a policeman—I gave the half crown to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of Broad Way, Westminster. On Thursday, 13th May, the prisoner came to my shop three times, about half past 7, half past 8, and 10 o'clock, for three eggs each time, and tendered half a crown each time—I served him the third time, and put the half crown between my teeth, and said, "You might have been satisfied after giving me one at night and two in the morning; you might have let me alone for a little time; where did you get it?" he said, "I took it"—I said, "Where?" he said, "I do not know" (I had served him the night before, but my wife took the money, a half crown, I believe, but I could not posi<lb></lb>tively swear, and it was put with other money)—I marked the last half crown and gave it to the policeman—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took five bad half crowns and eight bad shillings from Monday to Wednesday, and I be<lb></lb>lieve this man gave them all—I gave them all to the policeman.</p>

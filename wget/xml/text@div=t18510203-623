                  </hi>. I live at 4<hi rend="italic">1,</hi> Theo bald-street, Newington. One of these two copper boilers is mine—it was safe at ten o'clock on Friday night last, in my kitchen, fastened in the brickwork—the door that leads from the kitchen to the garden was fast—there is an inner door from the kitchen to the house which was latched, but not bolted—on Saturday morning I was called up by my next neighbour about five—I went down to the kitchen, and missed the copper—I went to the garden door, and found it fast as it was the night before, and the inner door was the same as I had left it—I also missed the water-tap, and part of the pipe—before six this copper was brought back by the policeman—it fitted to its place.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 193). On Saturday morning, 1st Feb., I received information, and found the two coppers in a yard belong<lb></lb>ing to a house in Adam-street—you can get from there to Walker's by getting over the fence—I fitted this copper at Mr. Walker's—it fitted the brickwork very well—I took the coppers back to where I found them, and watched, and about six o'clock the two prisoners came, walked into the yard, and took them up—they were walking out again when I stopped them-Fisher had the coppers—I sprung my rattle—my brother officer came and assisted to take the prisoners—I examined the house—by the door not being bolted a person could get in and out again.</p>

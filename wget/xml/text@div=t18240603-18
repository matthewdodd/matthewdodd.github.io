I particularly spoke to him one morning about some whalebone having been seen to go from the premises a week or a fortnight before, and said I believed that there was a deficiency. He said I should find it all right when I took stock. I appointed an officer to watch, and on the 27th of April I was sent for to the Mansion-house, and found him in custody; I said he was the last person whom I should have suspected; he said it was the first time, and he was sorry for it; I held him out no inducement to say anything; I found some whalebone at the Mansion-house, which I believe to be mine; it weighed 37 lbs., and is worth about 40 s.; I have examined my stock, and find a deficiency of 12 cwt.; I had left my warehouse about ten minutes before I was fetched to the Mansion-house.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 27th of April, about nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Lombard-street, with a bundle on his shoulder. Herdsfield looked at him - he said,</p>
               <p>"What are you looking at?" - I said, What have you got here? - he gave no answer, but said</p>

               <p>"I am going to Mr. Mills, Hollywell-street, Strand." I asked if he had got a bill of parcels - he said Yes. I said,</p>
               <p>"Walk into the Mansion-house, and I will see it." I took him there, and said.</p>
               <p>"Now where is the bill?" he said he had not got one - I said,</p>
               <p>"You told me just now that you had" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Stop a bit and I will feel" - he did not produce any - I said,</p>
               <p>"Where did you bring it from?" - he said,</p>
               <p>"From Mr. Mills, 137, Whitechapel-road - it is the firm of Mills, but is carried on under the name of Matthews" - I said it was a pity he was not civil when he was stopped with a load - he said his master told him not to give an answer if he was asked what he had - I asked him why he came that way to go to Hollywell-street - he said he liked it - I was going to Whitechapel, but called on Mr. M'Kenzie, and brought him to the Mansion-house.</p>

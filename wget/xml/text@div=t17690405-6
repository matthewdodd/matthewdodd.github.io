After that I took her again, but she was still the same. Then I'turned her away again, having no suspicion of her dishonesty. About three months, ago a person came to me, and said, I had been greatly wronged by this Smith. I asked the person where she lived; she said with the prisoner. Said I, Have you had any quarrel with her? She said, Yes. Then I said, Go about your business. Some time after that another came and said the same. I bid her go about her business. After that I had some reason to believe she had not been honest. I went and got a search-warrant, and found a great many of my things, more than I have laid in the indictment; to the amount of 3 or 4 l. I am a turner by trade. (The things laid in the indictment produced in court.) Those are my property. I found them in the prisoner's lodgings: The prisoner owned she took them from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and let out barrows and carts for hire. I know the prisoner—on 24th March I let the prisoner a cart—he agreed to pay me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month for it—he said he had taken a business at Bexley, and he wished to transact business with the cart—no time was fixed for him to keep it—three weeks after that I received information, in consequence of which I went to the police-station, and gave information—on 3rd May I saw the cart again—Mr. Flicker then had it—the prisoner had no authority to make away with it—I did not see him again till he was at the police-station—I had not been paid anything for the loan of the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman, at Erith. On the Saturday before Easter, I was going through Plumstead, and saw the prisoner at his own house; he then told me he would sell his cart—I met him again on Easter Monday; we had some beer together, and I then asked him if he would sell the cart; he said, "Yes," and said he wanted 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and it was as cheap as a donkey at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the Tuesday morning I agreed with him for the cart at 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and took the cart away—that is the same cart Mrs. Scudder has seen.</p>

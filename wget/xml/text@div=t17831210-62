               <p>About a month ago I was at Mr. Pigott's house, when the prisoner came to it, Mr. Pigott was out, Mrs. Pigott informed me that it was the prisoner, and that there was a warrant out against him for stealing Mr. Pigott's harness, and some livery, the prisoner came to beg forgiveness, upon which he was detained till the legal officer came to take him into custody, he went down stairs, and attempted to go out of the door, but the servant had put the chain up at the door, he did not endeavour to escape by any precipitation, I desired him to go into another room, I asked him several questions respecting the harness, where he had taken them to, and what he had done with them, at last he told me they were at a certain person's house, whose name I have really forgot now, though I took it down in writing, he told me he had taken them and pawned them, and told me the name of the place or the street.</p>

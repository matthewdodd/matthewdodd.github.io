               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what state were the hides when you saw them? A.

            . I live in Cable-street, in the County of Middlesex. I found these cows in my premises about nine o'clock in the morning, when I came home - it was the Friday after Christmas day; between nine and ten that morning Nottage called, and asked if I had two cows belonging to him; I said I did not know whether they were his; I showed them to him, and he said they were - that they were sent by a friend of his out of the country, to make the best he could of them for him; he said he must go and look for a man to kill them; I recommended him to Hawes, who generally kills at my house for people, and they were killed; I cannot say whether they were in calf. I saw Nottage again about nine o'clock that night, with Banks and Wainwright; he sold the body of one cow to each of them, as I understood; one was a black cow, and the other red, with a white back - I did not notice any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150046"></xptr>particular mark on the black one. Nottage brought a young man next day, with a truck, which the hides were put into, and taken away. I have known Nottage several years - he is in the cheesemongery line, and was so before Christmas, when he kept a cheesemonger's shop in Rosemary-lane - I have known him several years buying beast in Smithfield, and slaughtering them at my house; he had slaughtered none at my house for twelve months before this, nor any where else, that I know of; he was in the butchering business before he commenced cheesemonger - the last place he lived at, as a butcher, was at Ratcliff-highway, twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known him slaughter cattle for people? A. He has killed for several people at my house, but never sold any of his own before.</p>

On the 29th of December, between nine and ten o'clock, Nottage came to my house, No. 37, Chapple-street, St. George's East, and asked me if I could go and kill him two cows; I said Yes - he said they were at Stieber's; I went there and killed them; one was a brown and white pole cow - the other was black, with horns, and there was some white about it - the black one gave milk, the brown one was dry; they were both in calf - it is not unusual to kill them in calf; we cannot always tell till they are killed; most beast have a Smithfield mark, which is the hair trimmed off the tail; the hair was still on these, as if they had come from the country; I flayed them, and left the hides at Stieber's - I should know the hides again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you to be particular, and dress them well? A. Yes - he said they were for market; he did not say where they came from; I could tell one was in calf before I slaughtered it.</p>

            . I am a tanner, and live in Russell-street, Bermondsey. On Saturday, the 30th of December, Coulstock brought me two cow hides, and laid them on the floor; I bought them of him. Brett afterwards came and claimed them; as Coulstock was going away he said, to the best of my recollection, "You are not going to let them lay there long, are you?" they were quite exposed, near the door; I said, "No, but why?" he said, "Because I don't know much of the person" or "chap I had them off." I gave him 2l. for them, which was quite their value.</p>

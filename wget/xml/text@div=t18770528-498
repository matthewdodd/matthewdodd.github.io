                  </hi>. I live at Southampton, but was formerly in business at Bournemouth, and Mr. Lane, a banker's clerk, of Bournemouth is my friend—on February 8th I saw an advertisement in the "Standard," in conse<lb></lb>quence of which I addressed a letter to "Veritas, 1, Great Queen Street"—I received a reply, making an appointment at 35, Parliament Street, West<lb></lb>minster—I went there and saw a man who called himself Wright, and made an appointment to call again, which I did, I think the same afternoon,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">about</hi> 4 or 5 o'clock, and saw the prisoner Raven—I told him I had come on behalf of a friend to inquire about an advertisement in the "Standard," to which he assented.<hi rend="italic">The advertisement was dated February</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">of a partnership half share in an auctioneer and estate agent's office in the West' end for</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">letters to be addressed to Veritas</hi>, 1, <hi rend="italic">Great Queen Street</hi>). I said that if the business was a satisfactory one I would communicate with Mr. Lane—he said "These are the offices"—I asked how long the business had been established there—he said "About four years"—I asked what income was derived from the business—he said "About 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the twelve-months, "but it was capable of extension, as it was an increasing business—on 17th February I called again with Mr. Lane, who asked, in my presence, where the offices were—he said "Here," and as to the length of time the business had been established the prisoner gave the same replies as he did to me—Mr. Lane also looked through the ledger and put questions which I did not pay attention to—I asked how the offices were let—the prisoner said by a three years' agreement, and that as he had the letting of the greater part of the offices in the neighbourhood the tenancy could be renewed on the same easy terms, but if let to any one else they would be worth more money—he also said to Mr. Lane, in my presence, "Within the last few days an estate near Epsom, worth 22,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., has been put in my hands, which had formerly been placed with Messrs. Farebrother, but they did not push the thing as I shall," and that the profits of that should be thrown in—he showed us a printed bill, on which I saw the name Farebrother, but did not read it—Lane asked whether there would be time to run to Chippenham to see his father to ascertain how soon he might be released from the bank, as they could claim his services for three months—Raven said the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. must be then paid or the thing would fall through, as others were after it—references were exchanged—the money was then paid on the understanding that it should be returned—I wrote a cheque and gave it to the prisoner—the agreement was then signed, Raven's name being first—this is Raven's endorsement on the cheque. (<hi rend="italic">This was on the Bournemouth branch of the Bank of England; the references were F. B. Cameron, Esq.</hi>, 78, <hi rend="italic">Queen Vic<lb></lb>toria Street, and Frank Keen, Esq., Hillsborough Villa, Talfourd Road, Peekham</hi>.) We received this paper with a lithographed heading "35, Par<lb></lb>liament-Street, Westminster. Mr. Briant has this day paid to me the sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as deposit that Mr. H. L. Lane shall complete a partnership with, me; the same, if the references given by me are not found to be satisfac<lb></lb>tory, to be returned. Thomas Raven"—I believed the prisoner's statements or I should not have parted with the cheque—I afterwards went to Parlia<lb></lb>ment Street to make inquiries, as the references were not satisfactory—I saw the prisoner on the Saturday and asked him to return the money, and on the 20th I went to Messrs. Tatham &amp; Mackreth, solicitors, and previous to 3rd March I went to Bow Street and swore an information—I have since been several times to Parliament Street, but found the offices locked, they appeared to be empty—I could not find the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The references were not fictitious—the prisoner did not say that he hoped before long to have the letting of the offices—I do not know much about London—the offices struck me as being rather mean; they did not bear out the description given of them in the advertisement—I saw a board but did not take much notice of it—I am sure the prisoner said he had carried on business there four years—it was not a general statement that he had carried on business four years—I saw a book" lying</p>

I am a cashier in the Wilts and Dorset Bank, Bourne-mouth—Mr. Briant called my attention to this advertisement, and on 17th February I went with him to Parliament Street—I saw Raven and Mr. Wright, and two clerks in the outer office—Mr. Briant introduced me as the intended partner—I asked the prisoner how long he had been there he said "I have been four years as an auctioneer and estate agent, here"—I asked about the profits of the business—he said they were 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or "800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but if he took a partner the profits were capable of extension—that the profits consisted of commissions on sales and lettings and the letting of apartments at the Lord Mayor's Show and other occasions—he said that the commissions went a great way towards the establishment; that he had just had an estate at Epsom of 22,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. value put into his hands which had been taken out of Messrs. Farebrother's hands, and that the profits of that estate, which would be considerable, should go into the partnership—I was to have a half share—I gave three references and he gave me two—Raven said that a deposit must be paid or the partnership must fall through as he had several other offers, and, in fact, had received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that morning as deposit—I thought his statement satisfactory, and paid the cheque produced on the understanding that if his references were not satisfactory the deposit would be returned—this letter was written in my presence.

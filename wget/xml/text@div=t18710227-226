                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I belong to the ship "<hi rend="italic">Lena"</hi> now lying in the Lavender Dock, Rotherhithe—on Monday afternoon, 23rd January, about 3.30, I was in Upper East Smithfield—I had at that time a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a sovereign, half-sovereign, and three or four shillings, in a purse, in my left-hand trowsers pocket—I was paying a man, who had showed me my way—I took my purse out for that purpose, and put it back in my pocket again, and walked on—two men came up behind me, and another in front, tore open my coat, and then put his hand in my left pocket: that man was Guinea—he got my purse, and ran away—I called out "Police!" and ran up the street—a man tripped me up with his foot, and I fell—I am quite sure Guinea was one of the men.</p>

I took Guinea into custody on 25th January, in Leman Street—I told him I should take him for being concerned with four others in robbing a foreign sailor at the corner of Glasshouse Street—he said "I know nothing about it; I do nothing of that work now"—at the station he said "I was there with him; I know who had the purse, but they gave me none of the money."</p>

I took Munro, about 7 o'clock, on the 25th January, in Back Road, St. George's—I asked him where he got that coat from—he said "I bought it, and gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it about three weeks ago"—I took him to the station, and he was placed with Guinea, but was not identified by the prosecutor—Guinea was picked out from several others—they were afterwards put in separate cells—I was in the cell between them—Guinea called out, and said "Munro, where did they take you?—Munro answered "In the Back Road; Mike was with me, but they did no see him; somebody has <hi rend="italic">rounded</hi>"—Guinea then said "It is that girl you gave the purse to, or else it is your having the new clothes on"—Munro said "Shiney asked me where I bought the coat; I told him in the lane for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; mother told me not to put it on this morning; I wish I had no put it on. How did they find you out, you have not got any fresh clothes on"—Guinea answered "Someone <hi rend="italic">rounded</hi>, and I shall tell of you as you did not give me coal"—Munro said "I gave Harry Hinty 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; when did they find the old man. I expect he told of the <hi rend="italic">fiver"</hi>—Guinea said "What did you do with the other money?—Munro said "Spent it all; they have got 13<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. belonging to me"—Guinea said "Chivy has got six weeks; I suppose he will be out of this; I should like to be in his place; I suppose they will not take him when he comes out"—in answer to the charge Guinea said "We were both there"—Munro said nothing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Guinea's Defence.</hi> I saw this gentleman paying a man; Chivy stood by, and looked in his purse, and said to Munro "I can see some little bits of gold;" Munro said "I won't touch him," and Chivy says "Come on," and Munro followed him, and they went up to the man, and took the purse out of his pocket.

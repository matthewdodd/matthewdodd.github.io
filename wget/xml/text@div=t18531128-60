                  </hi>. I am a messenger in the General Post-office, and live at the Branch Post-office at the corner of King William-street and Lombard-street—that office is occupied during the daytime by the clerks, until about half past 7 o'clock in the evening—I sleep in the house, over the office—on the night of 2nd Nov. the clerks left about half 7 o'clock—I then took charge of the premises—I went to bed about 11 o'clock that evening—before doing so I examined the office, and found all secure—the breakfast things were laid in the office for the clerks next morning, according to the usual custom—I got up about a quarter to 7 o'clock in the morning and came down into the office—I missed two silver forks off the table, and a salt cellar; and on looking further round I saw that the window had been thrown open—I had noticed the forks there the night before; I put them on the table myself—I found a chair had been put on the stamping board, close under the window, and the window was open—it had been shut over night—I saw that one of the drawers had been forced open, and the money drawer had been tampered with, but not successfully—other drawers had been forced open—I gave information to the police—on the evening of 8th Nov. the clerks left, as usual, at half past 7 o'clock—I saw the premises quite safe that night when I retired to rest—I heard nothing particular in</p>

               <p>the night—when I came down in the morning I examined the window and saw that some person had been cutting away the putty—there had been an unsuccessful attempt—no one had got in that night—in consequence of this, an arrangement was made with Mead and Carroll, two constables, and after that night they remained on the premises, in the inner office—on 15th Nov. I retired to rest at the usual time—I let the constables in at 10 o'clock—I left the premises all safe—soon after 12 o'clock I heard a noise at the window, as if some person was cutting; and later, about half past 2 o'clock, one of the officers rang the bell from the office to my room—I ran down, and found the prisoner in custody—the office <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in the parish of St. Mary Woolnoth, and is the property of the Crown.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 426). In consequence of what was communicated to me, I and Carroll were placed in the post-office in Lombard-street, for the purpose of watching there at night—we were there on the night of 15th Nov.—we placed ourselves at the end of the office, behind a screen—about 12 o'clock at night I heard a noise at the window, as if some one was trying to cut the frame away—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a model</hi>) it was at this window, which looks into the office—the noise continued, with the exception of short intervals, and at half past 2 o'clock a square of glass was broken—none of the glass fell inside—the prisoner then came through the hole; the place was quite light from the lamps outside; he came through legs first—he dropped down on to the bench, and from there he got on to the floor—we waited till he came down to us, and then we seized him by the arms—he gave a scream, and said, I am Dutch—he had no coat or shoes on—he had a chisel in his hand, and a dirk in his waistcoat pocket—I found on him a purse, containing four sovereigns and a Swedish dollar—the window through which he came opens on to the roof of the vestry of St. Mary Woolnoth's Church—a person could get from there into King William-street very easily—I took the prisoner to the station, and he was examined at the Mansion-house the same day—I afterwards went to the house of Mary Galvin, of John's hill—she pointed out a room to me as the prisoner's; and this canvas bag was handed to me by a lodger, from a closet in that room; that bag contained another bag, marked, Lombard-street, Foreign, Paid; it is a Post-office bag—that contained a salt cellar, a spoon, two forks, and a ladle—I also found at the lodging some pieces of woollen cloth, which I produce, and a comb and a brush which I took from the mantel shelf—I went next day to the same lodging, and this clothes brush was handed to me—I also obtained this letter stamp and shaving brush—I have compared the pieces of cloth I found with a cape that has been produced to me, and it appears to have formed part of it.</p>

I was with Mead on 15th Nov. in the post-office in Lombard-street, and assisted in apprehending the prisoner—I left him in charge of Mead, in the office, and went into the street I proceeded to the railing of St. Mary Woolnoth's Church, in King William-street, over which I climbed into the churchyard—I then climbed up to the leads of the vestry room, and there found two pieces of rope, a poncho wrapper or cape, a coat which the prisoner wore at the Mansion-house, a pair of shoes, two legs of old stockings which had been apparently used as overshoes, part of a bottle containing tar, and a piece of a foreign newspaper, over which the tar had been spread, and to which some glass was adhering—I also noticed that the framework of the window on the outside, the beading, was entirely cut away, evidently for the purpose of taking the window sash out—one square of glass was covered with tar, and partly</p>

               <p>broken—the square by which the prisoner entered was knocked clean out, and the contents lying on the paper—I took possession of all the things I found there, and brought them into the office; I showed them all to the prisoner—the shoes he seemed to own, as he put them on, and also the coat; they fitted him; he has on the same coat now—Mrs. Smith identified the cape—I produce it, and all the other things.</p>

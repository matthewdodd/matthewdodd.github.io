On Tuesday the 26th of July, at half-past six o'clock, the prisoner came home to 16, Sophia-street, where I live—his wife was at Mr. Baron's house over the way, which is a bad house—She was rather drunk—I went and called her over to give him his tea—She seemed to use very bad language to him—She asked if he would have his tea—he said he would take his tea when he wanted it—She knocked the things about, and he got his tea himself—he went with his pipe to the street door, and she went over to Baron's again, till half-past ten o'clock—I fetched</p>

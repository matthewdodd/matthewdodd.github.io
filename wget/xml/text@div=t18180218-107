On the 31st of January, I went out without my master's leave, and slept with a friend at the Collonade, Russell-square. I got up at four o'clock in the morning, and went home but could not get in; I walked about the street, and met the prisoner in <placeName id="t18180218-107-crimeloc566">Piccadilly</placeName>

I gave her in charge. The notes were never found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was you not drunk - A. No; I walked about ten minutes with her. I first met her in Golden-square.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COOK. I am a constable. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house - She denied the robbery. At the office she asked after a man, who, she said, was going to give change for one of the notes; she said," he is not going to do me, if I have done the other." A man brought her ten shillings, and said, there is your change.</p>
               <p>OWEN DORKIN. I am the watch-house-keeper. The morning being cold, I let the prisoner, and another woman, come to the fire; the prisoner asked me if I would split? I asked what she meant; she said if I would go and get change for a 1l. note, she would give me five shillings, and asked if I would tell. I said I would not. She went down to the cell, and brought me up a 1l. note. I returned it to her, and said I would have nothing to do with it. The man who got the note changed for her was present - She gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked him to change the note for another person.</p>

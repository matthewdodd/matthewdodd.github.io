               <p>Did Powis give that money to the prisoner? - Yes, I saw him give it; the prisoner went into a back room, and brought the halfpence tied up in my handkerchief and gave them to me; I gave them to Mr. Powis; we paid our reckoning and came away, and the prisoner came along with us over Moorfields; then that Mr. Johnson, that he said made the halfpence, went by us in Moorfields, and the prisoner said Mr. Johnson was worth three hundred pounds a year, and then the prisoner run away, and I thought he was gone to give information against us for buying the half-pence, and I carried the halfpence to the headborough; there was twenty-six shillings and ten pence halfpenny; all that I did this for, was to get the prisoner away; it was fixed on purpose by the inhabitants, because he owned to me he robbed a vessel of one hundred and seventy pounds, and my back door lays at stake.</p>

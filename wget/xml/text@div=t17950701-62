Mr. Helus said something to you which induced you to follow a man and woman out of the house? - I sent Mr. Helus after the woman, I was got up to the door, and see Mr. Helus bring her out of the public house, Mr. Cooke's, the corner of White Cross street; I see Mr. Helus and the prisoner at the bar come out there both together; he brought her into the shop, I told her that I had a very strong reason to think that she had got some property of ours, which did not belong to her; she immediately assured me she had not, and seemed very ready to be searched; she had got two cloaks on, a black one and a red one; she seemed to throw them both entirely aside, so that I could see all round, and laid her hand down, and said we were very welcome, any in the house, to search her; from what observation I could make, there did not appear to be any thing of any bulky nature of consequence, she was not searched; after she was gone Mr. Helus comes up to me, and said, I am certain, or I am sure she has got something; I said then why have you let her go; I gave him no other answer, but went out myself; I went to the public house, I went up to the landlord, who was in his bar. I found the woman in a box by herself, I told her I was not at all satisfied about the business after all, for I found that the had brought a parcel into the public house, which she had not with her when she went from us, as I could perceive; I was determined I told her to see it; she told me she knew nothing of a parcel or bundle, she knew nothing what I meant; I repeated the same words over again, and told her if she did not produce it I would charge Mr. Cooke, the constable, who was the landlord of the house, with her; he immediately came up, and I gave charge of her; she immediately says, then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010148"></xptr>what parcel is it you want? is this the parcel you want? pointing to her foot; I looked round and see a piece of cotton lay down on the ground, close by her feet; I immediately stooped down, and took it up, and found our private marks on it; the constable has got it.</p>

               <p>I keep the King's Arms, Whitecross-street; I was in my bar, and Mr. Hurd came in, I cannot tell the day of the month, he asked me if there was not a woman that came in with a parcel? I told him there was a woman in the box that had a parcel with her, and I went along with Mr. Hurd, and shewed him where the woman was, and the parcel was laid by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else with her? - No, nobody at all; Mr. Hurd then gave me charge of her, Mr. Hurd went round, and took the parcel from the side of her, and gave it me into my possession.</p>
               <p>(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you mean to say that it was laying by the side of her? - When I went in it was laying by the side of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the bottom of these seats communicate one with another? - Yes, they do, there is room enough for a dog to go under from box to box.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the Lord Mayor at this examination? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. This poor woman's husband was there? - Yes, he was.</p>

               <p>Hurd. I can swear to its being Mr. King's property, it has a private mark on it, my own making, on Wednesday morning, as it was lost in the afternoon; this is the same that I picked up from the ground when I went in, and it was laying on our counter when the man and woman came in, I had just unfolded it to shew a lady that came in for something to make a boy's striped waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Q. When you picked it up, was it on the seat, or down by her feet? - I only see it but once, and it was down by her feet, I see her before the landlord came up, I went round twice to her, and asked her for it before Mr. Cooke came up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. At this time there were some customers in your shop? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Might not some other customer take it as well as that woman? - I knew it was on the counter when she came in, and the next time I see it it was at her feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not employed in serving customers when that poor woman came into the shop? - Yes, one customer.</p>

               <p>I happened to be coming into the public house, and I see the piece of linen laying under the bench of the settle in the tap room of Mr. Cook's house, and I asked the prisoner whose it was? and the prisoner said it was her's. I believe it may be about four o'clock, as near as I can tell. Soon after that Mr. Hurd came in while I was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether he claimed the same piece? - I think it was. I have not any particular doubt; but it is so long time ago.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you whether that piece that Mr. Hurd claimed was the same that she spoke of before as being her's? - Yes, that was the same piece that I detected on her certainly.</p>

Yes, I recollect taking the spectacles from his pocket, but that was before they were lost; he took them to school with him, and I took them from his pocket, and gave them to my father the same day - I did not give them to the prisoner for a pair of braces - I had used a pair of braces of the prisoner's, and I afterwards gave him one shilling and a penny for them.</p>

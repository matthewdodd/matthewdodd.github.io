On the 18th instant, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in my cutting-room, up stairs; I was alarmed by a neighbour that there were men in my house. I went down stairs, and the prisoner was in the custody of several people at my door; he was searched, but nothing was found upon him; we took him to New Prison. When I came back again I searched my house, and missed the things in the indictment. The sash was up; I had been there a little before, and then the sash was down; the goods were brought over the way from my brother Guest's: the hat and great coat I have not seen since.

They seized me by the collar; one of them said he saw me jump, out of his brother's house. I said if you think so search me; they did so, and found nothing upon me. A good many people came up, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240007"></xptr> one said, take that villain to gaol, I know him to be an old offender. I was taken to gaol, though they did not find a halfpenny worth of any thing about me? The gentlewoman says she was in another house; how then could she have her eyes upon me? I was taken in St. John's street. I could have had a good many people to my character, but I did not expect my trial would have come on now.</p>

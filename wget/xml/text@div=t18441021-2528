                  </hi>. I live in Preston-terrace, Queen-street, Bethnal-green. I had a coat, which I saw safe between ten and eleven o'clock on Tuesday night, the 22nd of Oct. I fell in with a shipmate, and went and had a little drop to drink—some coal-heavers came in and knocked my bro<lb></lb>ther's hat off—I laid my coat down on the step and went to assist, and when I went to look for it, in two or three minutes, it was gone—this now produced is it.</p>

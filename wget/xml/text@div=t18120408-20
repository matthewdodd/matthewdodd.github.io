            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 25th of February last in consequence of some information I received. I went to a public house in White Hart-yard, Drury lane; I there saw the prisoner in company with some other women drinking, this was about three o'clock in the afternoon, I took her and the other women into an adjoining room.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you heard of Mrs. Graham's robbery at the time - A. I had, but I did not know what I was enquiring into led to this. I asked each of them separately, if one of them had not some articles of plate about them; I then asked the prisoner if she had not got some plate about her person, she denied having any such articles, and I proceeded to search her; she then became alarmed, and on searching her I found four silver table spoons in one of her pockets, wrapped up in a towel and a handkerchief; upon my asking her from whence she got them, she said she had them from a person who was with her in a hackney coach, she did not know any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not say of a gentleman's servant - A. No. They all seemed so much intoxicated at the time the prisoner was taken care of till the next day when she was identified, that is all that past then. From the initial G upon the plate, it struck me then that it was the property that had been stolen from the house of Mrs. Graham, upon enquiry it so turned out. She was then committed till the next day, she was examined the next day or the day after. I produce the spoons, they have remained with me ever since, in my custody. When I first saw her at the public house she was in a bed-gown, she said she had cut her gowns up to make aprons.</p>
               <p>Q. to Isaac. You said that you found some part of the prisoner's wearing apparel - A. Yes, I did, I rolled them up and put them into my own drawer, I gave them to Mr. Adkins the officer, Adkins gave it to Mantz, and on the Sunday morning it was given to Lavendar.</p>
               <p>Lavendar. On the Tuesday morning the wearing apparel was given to me by Adkins.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080018"></xptr> Q. Open that bundle - A. Here is a gown, apron, and two handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Isaac. These are the same that I found on the Sunday morning, I know them by the pattern, they are the same that I found in the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the table spoons - A. There is four table spoons, I know them by the G upon them, they are such spoons as Mrs. Graham had, I believe them to be hers; the four desert spoons, I believe them to be Mrs Graham's; three forks, they are marked in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I met this man it was nigh two o'clock in the morning, I was at a watering-house in St. Giles's, he asked me to go with him to Gower-street, Bedford-square. The watchman passed us he said all is well, I said what have you to do with the watchman, you told me you had no family; he took me down into the pantry, he gave me a shilling, it was a bad one, he poured out a glass of brandy, he said it was his mistress's; I said if he did not give me the five shillings I begged to go; he told me he had no more money, if I made any alarm he would charge the watchman with me, he gave me another glass of brandy which intoxicated me; he put something into my hand rolled up in a bundle, and told me to keep that, and in a night or two he would see me again; he told me to go up stairs, he had left the door open, to unlatch the door and go out at the street door before the watchman saw me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q to Isaac. Did you give her a glass of brandy - A. Yes, shrub and brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any thing rolled up in a bundle - A. To the best of my knowledge, no.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these four spoons - A. The table spoons, I think the value of them near six pounds, the desert spoons about thirty shillings altogether, and the forks about fifteen shillings a-piece.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. After you had been drinking with this woman, were you able of understanding what you were about - A. I had been drinking, but I never should give my mistress's property, I had two watches of my own, I should have given them away.</p>

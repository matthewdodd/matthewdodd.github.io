               <p>Mr. Bull. (He takes it in his hand.) This was produced to me as one of the committee, and I signed it the 8th of Nov. believing it to be her hand-writing. I wrote upon it allowed, and signed my name as allowing of it.</p>

Before this accusation I never heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176304130023"></xptr> any thing against him in my life. I have trusted him till within a month of his elopement, he sold out 300 l. of stock for me; I left it in his hand to sell when he thought he could get the best price; I received the money from his hand a very little time before he went abroad: In the course of business I have had with him, he has acted with integrity. Upon his father's leaving off, he recommended him to me, and I recommended him to the Amicable Society.</p>

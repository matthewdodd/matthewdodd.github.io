               <p>came to me in Market Street, South Place, and struck me a violent blow in the mouth, and stole my scarf and pin—he ran off, and I followed, and caught him by the back of the neck, and he again struck me in the mouth—I held him, and he resisted—a friend of mine came up to me and said "Teddy, Teddy, what's the matter?"—the prisoner took up the word, and said "Teddy, what's the matter; what are you doing?"—a policeman came up, and I charged him—he said "Policeman, it's ad—lie; I have known this man as a common bookmaker for 10 years; haven't I, Ted?"—I said "Certainly not"—we took him to the station with very great difficulty, and I retained hold of him till we got to the station—we were surrounded on the way by a large number of the prisoner's friends, who tried to rescue him, and were striking me on the back of the neck and head—I preferred the charge against him at the station, and saw him take this scarf and pin from his pocket and give it to the officer.</p>

I heard cries of "Police" in Finsbury Place, and proceeded to the spot—I found the prisoner and the prosecutor struggling—the prosecutor gave him in custody for stealing a scarf from his neck—I took him to Moor Lane Police-station and charged him, and took from his hand this scarf, which the prosecutor identified.</p>

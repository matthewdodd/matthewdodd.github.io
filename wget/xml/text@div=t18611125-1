                  </hi>. I am a clergyman living at Weston Lodge Grove<lb></lb>end, St John's-wood—on Monday, 12th August, I went to the London-bridge terminus of the South-Eastern railway—it was after 10 o'clock when I got there—I had a large black leather bag with me—it was one like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had no mark on it whatever—I gave a police-constable the key of that bag when be afterwards came to my house, I cannot say the date—after getting my ticket I took my bag to the place where the luggage is labeled, and requested the porter to put the usual mark upon it—I left it with the porter and went away for a minute or two, and when I returned my bag was gone, and this other bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was left in its place—my bag was quite full; this appeared to have nothing in it, comparatively—I had not packed my bag myself, my daughter's maid packed it for me—this coat and pair of trousers and boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine, and were in my bag—I can also swear positively to these slippers and these collars—this note paper has my monogram and crest on it—this Church Service has my writing in it—the contents of the bag were worth about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot speak to the bag; it is similar to the one I had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister—this bag is my pro<lb></lb>perty—I lost it the first Monday in August at the Victoria Station—I see my initials plainly on the bag; they have been rubbed out, but have since appeared again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an East India merchant—I was at the Waterloo station as a passenger on the evening of the 19th August—I arrived at the station about five minutes before—I had with me one of Mechi's bags—I missed it—I looked for it with the porter everywhere but could not find it—I think it was between 8 o'clock and twenty-five minutes past—a small common leather bag for carrying papers in was left in lieu of my bag, and that was claimed by somebody immediately afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in a long defence, after complaining of the length of time he had been in custody and the treatment received by him in the House of Deten<lb></lb>tion, stated that he should be able to prove that the bag claimed by the pro<lb></lb>secutor was his own, and that he had had it for eleven years; that he had only been at the London Bridge station on two occasions since October</hi>, 1860, <hi rend="italic">and those were on</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th or</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th July last, and previously, to see the remains of the great fire: that on being taken into custody he had given his correct name and address, which he should not have done had he been guilty, and that the state of his health was such as to render him physically incapable of carrying away the bag alleged to be stolen.</hi>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner about six years—from what I knew of him while he was a resident in my house, I could not sup<lb></lb>pose he would be guilty of the acts he is charged with; he bore a very good character—he has resided with me at intervals during the last six years—I have known him up to March last; that was the last time he left my house—I have frequently seen him since he left my house—as far as my know<lb></lb>ledge of him goes he has borne that character up to the present time—I have not seen the bag—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I should scarcely like to swear to</p>

               <p>this bag; the size is similar to Mr. Holloway's bag, which I have packed several times—it had no partition in it; it had a pocket like this; but bags are so much alike I could not swear to it—it is exactly similar to the bag that I have packed for him five or six times—his bag was a little torn at the hinge; I perceive this is mended—the tear was more in the lining than the leather—he had the bag in my house from the first time I knew him; that would be six years—I remember his coming to my house in January, 1860; he was then in a very infirm state of health—I should think he remained in that state for three or four months before Dr. Fuller saw him—he very seldom went out—he remained with me after Dr. Fuller came, until September, principally confined to his room—he very seldom went out, and only for very short intervals—he returned to my house on 3d January, 1861—he was very unwell at that time, and during the time that he then remained with me he was principally confined to his room—his eyes were bad and his hands also, and I had to write a great many letters for him because he could not see—he remained with me until the 13th or 14th March—I have seen him occasionally walk about the room with an I umbrella and stick—I remember his losing the use of his hands during the time he was with me—I should say he was incapable of carrying anything or walking away with anything, but he partially recovered before he left me; and he went out on one or two occasions before he left me, but even then he was not able to carry any of his luggage down the stairs, I took it all down for him to the cab, and went with it to the George and Blue Boar, Holborn—I saw him many times while he was there, and I have met him at Storey's Gate, once or twice by appointment—he was then apparently very infirm in the bands and feet when he walked—from knowing him infirmities and from his character, I really could not suppose him capable of doing what is laid to his charge; I was astounded when I heard it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-called</hi>). I recollect the 19th of August—the prisoner was at home on that day; he was very ill on the sofa and could not move; he had a dreadful pain in the limbs—he said he had occasion to go to the Bank on the Monday, and he was so ill he should defer it till the Tuesday, and he did not go out that day—I know it was the 19th August that he was so ill, because I went down and spoke to my landlady that day in regard of some rent.</p>

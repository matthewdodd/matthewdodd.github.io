                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 15.) I was on duty on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 8th of September, at ten minutes past one o'clock, in Palace-yard—I went round the shed which is used by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, and heard a footstep—I saw the Prisoner going from there towards the water side—I went down to see who it was, and saw it was a waterman—I had no suspicion of him then—he called out to a man is a barge, "Go to bed," and some one cried out, "We are just come from bed—he said, "Is that the way you talk to me, your master?"—"Who are you? "cried one, "I will give you a toss for a pot of beer"—I thought all was not right, and I went round the yard, where I found this bundle, near the place where the prisoner had been standing—it contained these brass fittings in a handkerchief—I then looked about the carpenter's shop, and found two bolts, which had been taken out of it, close to the door—I called in M'Carthy—two boards in the shed had been taken down to enable a man to get in—I gave my lantern to M'Carthy to go in, and see if there was any one inside—I did not go in myself—I went round and saw the prisoner standing with another man, near the bridge, having a pot of porter together—I saw these finger-plates sticking out of the prisoner's jacket pockets—I said, "I shall take you on suspicion of breaking open the car<lb></lb>penter's shop "—he said nothing to that—I called a bridge watchman to my assistance, and in going along, the prisoner kept throwing these metal things out of his pockets, which I now produce—I stopped and searched him, and found all these articles which are in this basket—some came out of one of his pockets, and some out of another—he had some of them in his pockets, and some in the waterman's locker, which is about eight paces from the carpenter's shop—I found three keys on the prisoner, one of which opened the lock of the door of the waterman's locker—I found there these brass locks, and some pieces of iron, which I produce—I had not seen the prisoner before that night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 156.) I was on duty at Pa<lb></lb>lace-yard at nine o'clock on Wednesday night—I saw the prisoner in the yard—he was placing some boat sclls there—I said, would it not be better to secure them, as they would be handy to carry away—I saw him again between twelve and one o'clock, placing some boat cushions, or pretending to do so—that induced me to open the locker, when these keys were found on him, and these things were found in the locker—all the things were scattered about in the shed, and a carpenter's basket was there, ready to carry them away in—I found a piece of iron at the bottom of the locker, which I compared with the boards—I found some marks on the boards—the iron broke open the boards, as it appears.</p>

                  </hi>. I am valet to Sir George Samuel Jenkinson, of 43, St. James's Place—on the evening of 18th February, about 10.20 I arrived at Paddington Terminus and engaged a" four-wheeled cab—I put this port<lb></lb>manteau (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the top of it, against the rail—the portmanteau and the articles inside it are my master's property—I packed them myself—I told the cabman to drive to 43, St. James's Place—as I passed the Marble Arch I noticed that the time was 10.25—we went on and turned down Upper Brook Street, and as we crossed Park Street, the cab turned round and galloped up Park Street towards Oxford Street—I called to the cabman and he pointed to a cart going along Park Street, and said that the port<lb></lb>manteau was taken off the top—we drove after the cart, along Bayswater Road, it turned up a side street and we lost sight of it—I went to the John Street Police Station and gave information—I was afterwards sent for to Notting Hill Station, where I saw and identified the portmanteau.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the cart in the distance going up Park Street—I did not see the portmanteau in it—I could not distinguish who was in the cart, it was too far off.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 96, Stanhope Street, Hampstead Road and am a cab driver—I was the cabman that night—I put that portmanteau on the top of my cab at the Paddington Station and secured it with a chain in the usual way, with a hook—I drove on till I came to the crossing in Park Street and Brook Street—a woman called out "Cabman"—I looked behind me and saw the portmanteau being lifted into a cart over the tailboard—the cart was just being started as I turned round—the horse's head was towards Oxford Street—two men were lifting the portmanteau in and there was one man sitting in the cart—the cart went on rapidly, and the two men walked away—I immediately turned round and galloped after the cart up Park Street—at the corner of Oxford Street I was stopped by an omni<lb></lb>bus and the curt got ahead it was a dark green cart with wings over the</p>

About 12.20 on the morning of 19th February I saw a green cart and a grey horse in Talbot Road, Notting Hill—Acting Sergeant Hannah came up and posted me in the area of 28, Colville Square, but nothing came of it—I remained there till I was relieved by Sergeant Brennan—we were watching the cart anticipating that somebody would come for it—it was standing in the Talbot Road and no one was with it—I afterwards lifted the rug that was in the cart and saw tin's portmanteau—the cart and horse were taken to the station.</p>

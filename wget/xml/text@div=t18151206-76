On the 8th of November last I went into the City, to settle a little business with a gentleman, and he paid me one hundred and fifteen pounds, which with the deduction of twenty five pounds expences, left me eighty nine pounds odd. I and this gentleman had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060041"></xptr>been drinking together rather freely, and I left him when I was very much intoxicated. On my return towards home, I met with a desperate fall; by what means, I cannot tell; but I believed I was tripped up. I cannot say who picked me up, nor have I any recollection of any thing that happened until I found myself in Newton-court, Chandos-street. I have some recollection of the female prisoner. When I recovered myself, I found the whole of my property was gone. I got the number of the notes, and got them advertised, and the next day I got some information. I then applied to Bow-street, and went with Mr. Donaldson and Westbrock. The notes were not found.</p>

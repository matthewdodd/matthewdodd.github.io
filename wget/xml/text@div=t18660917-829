                  </hi>. I live at 34, Royal Mint Street, and am the widow of the deceased Thomas Sullivan—he was forty-four years of age and was a plasterer—on Saturday, first of September, he returned home about two o'clock—he gave me his wages, 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after he had been some little time at home he sent me for half a gallon of beer—he did not drink any of it—the prisoner and his wife lived in the same house, above me, on the second floor—I cannot say what time the prisoner came home that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170085"></xptr>
               <p>day—he came home before my husband, I think when he got paid—I saw him leave the house, and go out about four o'clock—he was then sober—I think he returned about eight, tipsy—I saw him in the passage as he was going out, partly lying down—me and my husband assisted him on to his feet, and he went upstairs into the room with us—it was then that my husband told me to fetch half a gallon of beer—while the prisoner was in the room he made an offensive remark about me having slept with a man named Murray—it was very bad language that he made use of—he told my husband to kiss his—my husband became angry, and told him to leave the room—that was about a quarter-past eight, or rather better—there was no quarrelling at that time—the prisoner did not leave the room when my husband told him to do so—he remained in the room about a minute, and was then taken up to his own room by his wife and another person—he made use of some bad language on the stairs, and my husband put one foot on the second step, and said, "You scoundrel, if you make use of that language to my wife I will bring you down by the leg," and he kicked my husband over the eye as he was on the stairs—I and my hus<lb></lb>band then went downstairs, and remained there above an hour—I then heard Mrs. Murphy call out, "There is Murphy in Sullivan's room, breaking his things"—my husband said, "My God! breaking my things?" and he turned round and went upstairs very quickly—I followed him in about a minute—when I got up I saw my husband lying down, and Murphy lying on the top of him—my husband's head and shoulders were in his own room, and his legs on the landing—I had not heard any words of quarrelling, or any blows struck before I went up—if there had been any quarrelling I think I should have heard it, as I was coming up the stairs—I took the key out of my door, and struck Murphy in the head with it as well as I was able, to make him let my husband go—I heard my husband say, very slowly, "Murphy, you have bit me; don't bite me"—when I found he would not desist, and let my husband go, I chucked the key away, and I rose Murphy off my husband by the hair of his head—I pulled him off; my husband tried to stand up, but he reeled and fell, and put his hand under his head—he spoke no more—it was about half-past nine at that time—it was dark, but there was a candle on the stairs—my husband was sober when he went upstairs—he had been out at the door before this, but not above two or three minutes—he had drank nothing but his tea whilst he was in the house—I did not find that he was bleeding from a wound in his side until the doctor came—it is a very dark landing where he fell; it is not so narrow—there were other lodgers in the house at the time, and they came up, and I said my husband was dead—a policeman came—I afterwards found a blade of a knife where my husband was killed—I found it next morning when I was wiping the landing—the prisoner went downstairs after my husband fell—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the blade I found—I had seen the prisoner with a four-bladed knife previous to this that had a white handle, but it was dirty, and it had like silver at the bottom of it—it was something like this knife (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>), but not the same handle—I saw the knife in Murphy's pos<lb></lb>session in my room at the time I had a child lying dead about eight weeks ago—I found this blade in the flannel as I was wiping the passage—at that time the crack on it looked quite fresh, but it got wet—I took it to the station-house myself.</p>

I could not exactly say where I struck him, I was very much excited, and I struck him everywhere I could—I had a knife in my hand that night eating my tea with it, cutting some meat; but that was a large table knife—I had that in my own room at my own table—I did not take the knife upstairs when I ran up—I had not taken it downstairs with me—it was in my own room that I had it—I believe there was a bite on my husband's hip—there was no blood there, only very small drops indeed—Mrs. Gale was the person who helped the prisoner's wife to take him upstairs—she was not in my room—there was no one in my room but Murphy, me, and my husband—I do not know whether there is any other person here who saw Murphy with a knife—I found this blade on the landing outside our room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Timothy Donoghue, and live at 34, Royal Mint Street—on the Saturday afternoon in question I was in my shop—Murphy came in at the door about eight o'clock—he was very drunk—a man brought him to the door, and all he could say was, "Thirty-four"—he could not say he lived there, he could only say that—I own the house, and Murphy and Sullivan were lodgers of mine—when Murphy came to the door he fell and retched—I called to his wife and said, "Mr. Murphy has made a mess in the passage"—he was then lying there—Sullivan and his wife came downstairs, and said, "Mr. Murphy, come upstairs"—they got him up, and he went upstairs—he did not want to go, but Sullivan said, "We will have a drop of beer"—Sullivan was not sober, but he was not to say drunk—he had been drinking a little—this was about eight o'clock—Murphy then went upstairs with Sullivan and his wife—he went upstairs by himself as well as he could—they had not been long upstairs when Mrs. Murphy came to the door—she had been out marketing—that was a little before eight, and then the two women began arguing and rowing, and then the two men upstairs began—I saw nothing of what occurred upstairs—I remained in the shop—two of the tenants got Murphy upstairs to his own room, and Sullivan and his wife came downstairs to the door—the next thing I heard was Mrs. Murphy running downstairs saying, "Get a police-man; he is breaking Mr. Sullivan's things; get a policeman"—that was about nine o'clock—I went outside the door then, and Murphy and Sullivan were fighting upstairs—at that time I heard a noise on the first floor—when Mrs. Murphy came down Sullivan ran up, saying, "Will he break my things? will he break my things?"—at that time Mrs. Murphy was on the stairs, hallooing for help and for police—they were then fighting with pokers upstairs—I went outside and called "Police!"—it was some of the tenants who came down and told me they were fighting with pokers—Mrs. Sullivan and Denis Byrne told me—I saw Murphy come downstairs before that and go through my shop to go to the doctor's to get his head dressed—his head and nose were bleeding very much—all was quiet after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons—I was called into the deceased on Saturday, the 1st September, about twenty minutes to eleven—I found him dead—I examined the body externally—there were four wounds, one an incised one, behind the left ear, a contused wound over the right eyebrow, one over the right or left hip, I forget which (that was a lacerated and contused wound; the teeth would have done that),</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170089"></xptr>
               <p>and one on the left side of the chest punctured—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—death was the result of a punctured wound of the heart—that corresponded with the wound on the left side under the nipple—I found the body was otherwise healthy, comparatively speaking—there was a good deal of internal hemorrhage—such an instrument as this knife-blade might have produced that wound—it seemed to correspond with it, as far as length and breadth went—I think a knife similar to this could scarcely cut through the rib without breaking—it had cut through the rib, which is rather unusual—it completely divided the rib—the blow must have been given with considerable force—death would be almost instantaneous—it was the left ventricle of the heart that was punctured. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you expect if it was broken by the collision with the rib that it would be rejected by the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak as to that point—I see no reason why it should be rejected, unless possibly by the heart's action it might be thrown out—it punctured the bony part of the rib, completely dividing it—before the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> I was unable to discover whether the chest had been punctured or not, on account of not being able to penetrate into the rib, as it had closed again—I do not think the rib would be depressed before the knife would go through it—I do not think the rib was elastic enough to allow of that, being in the nature of an arch—there is no doubt it was a punctured wound, and such an instrument as this might have caused it—the knife might possibly be rejected from the wound—the knife might have been broken in withdrawing it.</p>

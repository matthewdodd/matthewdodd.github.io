                  </hi>. I am an accountant—I and my partner were called in to examine the prisoner's books—we commenced in December, 1871—the books were very much in arrear—the prisoner remained in the service for some time—he was employed there in March last—he kept the rough cash-book—I know his handwriting well—this entry of 1st March in the rough cash-book, "T, C. Newsom's journey, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., "is not the prisoner's writing; but the addition of this amount that ought to have been paid into the bank is in his writing—the entry is "T. C. Newsom, j. account (that means journey account), N. 20, N. 25, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—"N." means "notes"—the next four items are in the prisoner's writing, also the word "bank" and the total, 162<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I produce the paying-in book—here is the counterfoil of 1st March, it is the prisoner's writing, "1-3-72; N., 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; G., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; S., 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the first addition is 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is crossed through, and another addition made of 162<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be the amount, omitting the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that being added makes it 162<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—immediately below there is the word "Country, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that means country cheques, so they would not go in to the credit, and are not included in the addition—the counterfoil of the paying-in slip is in the prisoner's writing—by that the amount paid in is 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that omits the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the banker's pass-book—the prisoner would have access to that—I have frequently seen him with it, both when examining the accounts and in carrying on the business—there is an entry of 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. credited to the firm on that day—in the rough cash-book of 22nd March there are several entries, the amount added up consists of three items, and the addition amounts to 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the prisoner's writing—the entry is "22. S. Bradford, N. 30; W. Briscomb, N. 5"—that is not the prisoner's writing—then there is "William Sentence exchanged 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is the prisoner's writing, as well as the addition, 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and "Bank, 22-3" written against it—the counterfoil of the paying-in slip of that day is in the prisoner's writing; it is "22-3-72, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; C. N., 30; N. 5: 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—"C. N." means country notes—I have the paying-in slip of that date—it is the prisoner's writing—it is "22 March, '72. Credit, Newsom, Burke, and Co., 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is omitted in the pass-book; the firm is credited with 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no alteration there, or any obliteration or additional amount, and no alteration in the addition—the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not appear on the slip at all—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in as a separate sum—there are two other items, but those, I believe, are country items, previously paid in—we have traced those; they are represented by the counterfoils—we have traced every item in the books from beginning to end—the books are now balanced day by day; unfortunately, they were not at the time the prisoner kept them—at</p>

               <p>that time the addition in the rough cash-book would show the money to be paid in—the counterfoil would contain those, and the paying-in slip ought to do the same—after finding out these two sums there was some conversa<lb></lb>tion in my presence between the prisoner and his employers on 8th April—Mr. Newsom was present—the prisoner was asked to account for those two specific sums—he said "I cannot do so"—he was told that he must do so, and after a great deal of conversation he said "Well, I suppose I must have had the money, "and then he went on to explain why he had on a previous occasion called God to witness that he never had any of the money—he said that what he meant by that was that he thought he had paid back all the money he had abstracted from the firm from time to time—I have gone into the state of the accounts, showing the deficiency from 11th December' last up to 8th April—including these two sums, it amounts to 570<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—that does not include the deficiency up to 11th December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not try to get the numbers of the notes—the entry of the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in the writing of Mr. Finch, who is a clerk in the office—I don't know whether he is here—I have not tried to get the numbers of the notes from him—the entry of the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is also Mr. Finch's, I believe; several of the clerks write so alike that I could not be sure; undoubtedly it is Mr. Finch's writing—Mr. Burke is still in the firm—I' don't know whether he is here—I got these slips from the bank—I got other slips, not with me—I have not got the slip of 2nd March, or of 28th or 29th February, or of 21st or 23rd March—the cash payments of the firm were made by cheques, not by cash; simply petty cash—I find entries in this green-book of cash paid by the prisoner, not paid for tea warrants—I have gone through every item in the books from 1st November, 1870, to 31st May, 1872, to see whether he paid cash or not—I find that he has paid petty cash—that includes wages and small disbursements—I find cash payments for duty on account of the firm—they are very trifling, altogether probably 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think not 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are not frequent payments for duty—it is a very extensive business—the payments for duty would not be once a week—I should say, without referring to the ledger, that over the whole period the number of payments made irregularly, through cash and not by cheque, would be about six or seven—that would not amount to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; not the half of it—there are not payments for warrants, duty, and petty cash amounting to very large sums; they are carried out into the ledger—there is a debtor and creditor account of the petty cash—I have not got the ledger here; I never understood that it was necessary to be here—this is the fair cash-book—there is, no doubt, an entry on 21st March "Customs, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I say that was paid by cheque, and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 22nd March—perhaps I may save you some trouble if I tell you that all the entries in the outside column are paid by cheque at the particular period you are looking at—"Petty cash, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." was paid by cheque—the entries in the inner column are either payments by cash or contra payments of amounts credited from travellers on the other side—"Salary, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "would be paid by cheque—this, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., would be charged by the bankers as discount of bills—"Journey expenses, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "is simply a contra entry; on the other side you will find a credit of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the same individual—those items are carried forward into the fair cash-book; not by the prisoner, because he did not make up the fair cash-book at that period.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Newsom, Burke &amp; Co., wholesale tea merchants, in Great Tower Street—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in our service as confidential clerk and ledger keeper—he kept the books, received money and passed it in to the bank; it was his duty to add up the sums; he had to pay in and enter the particulars in the coun<lb></lb>terfoils; the credit slip would agree with it, and be sent to the bank with the money—the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sent by Mr. T. C.

(<hi rend="italic">The Court decided that what was said by the prisoner upon this could not be received</hi>).

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Burke is a party to this prosecution—the prisoner's father keeps a small grocer's shop—I went to his house with Mr. Ruther<lb></lb>ford on 13th April, the prisoner had not been to our premises for some few days; we had some communication with the father, and afterwards saw the prisoner in his father's presence—it was at the father's instance that I took the watch and chain, I refused at first—we determined to prosecute the day we gave him into custody, 15th July, from various circumstances which we thought very much aggravated the case.</p>

C. Newsom—no—it would be Mr. Burke—he would open the letter and hand me the money, and I should keep it till the prisoner came—either Mr. Burke or Mr. E. B.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the manager of the "King of Prussia," in Gravel Lane—on 15th December the prisoner came in and asked for a pint of four half—the price was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I gave him his change—he drank the beer and left—I put the shilling in the till—there was no other money there—the tills had been cleared—I went to the till three or four minutes after the prisoner had gone—I looked at the shilling, and bit it with my teeth; it was gritty—I put it in the fire, and it melted—on Tuesday, 20th December, the prisoner came again, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I knew him again—he asked for a pint of four half, and gave me a bad shilling—I broke it in two pieces; I said "This is a bad one, you gave me one last week"—he said "I did not, I have not been in the house before"—I called my husband, a constable was sent for, and the prisoner was given into custody—my husband gave the two pieces of the shilling to the constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was in the evening when he first came in, as far as I can recollect, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening—we were slack that evening—there was no one there except the prisoner—I threw the shilling in the fire, as useless—it was ten days afterwards that the came again—I identified him immediately—I did not say anything to him until he gave me the bad shilling—he was not going to sit down and smoke a pipe—my husband was not in the bar when he came to the house the first time—there was no one else serving in the bar—the prisoner remained in the place till a constable was sent for, and then he went to the station—he was not violent; he merely said he had not been there before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He gave me his address—I discovered it was right—his name is Craven; his father said he had been away from home three months—I know nothing at all against the prisoner.</p>

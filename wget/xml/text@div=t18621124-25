                  </hi>. I am assistant to Charles Lloyd, a tobacconist of 21, Coventry-street—on 18th October, between 11 and 12 o'clock, the prisoner came and laid this paper on the counter—(read: "Please send by bearer 6lbs. of good common shag, 3lbs. of superfine, and 1lb. of cut Cavendish. <hi rend="smallCaps">G. DIBBEN</hi>, October 18/62")—Mr. Dibben is a customer, and the prisoner used occasionally to come for things for him with a written order—I gave him these goods to the value of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist at the corner of Sloane-street—I have occasionally employed the prisoner in little jobs—this order was not written by me or by my authority—it resembles my writing—the goods were never brought to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican—on 16th October the prisoner offered me some tobacco for sale in the public room—I would not buy it—he asked me to lend him five shillings on it—I asked where he got it from, and he said he had to sell it for a tradesman—he said he would call for it presently—he never came, and after waiting six days I gave information to the police.</p>

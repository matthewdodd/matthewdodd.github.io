                  </hi> I live at No. 27, Change-alley, and was clerk to Messrs. Hocking and Co.—the prisoner was a porter in their employ—it was his duty to pay the moneys at the different wharfs and obtain the receipts for them, and at the end of the week it would be his duty to account to me for the sums of money he had disbursed, and received—it would be either deducted from the money paid him before, or</p>

               <p>given to him if he had money paid him afterwards—on the week ending the 9th of Aug. he produced this account to me—he also produced these four receipts as vouchers of that account—the account was settled on the foundation of their accuracy—they make up the exact account.</p>

                  </hi> My employers' names are Richard Hocking, Ridley, and Hitchcock—I know it is Richard Hocking, from the circumstance of a Post-office order coming there, addressed Robert Hocking instead of Richard Hocking—that was how I first became acquainted with if—I have only been there a short time, and should very likely not have known it, if it had not been for that circumstance—I have no doubt of it now.</p>

Hocking's service I was twenty-one months out of employment—I was endeavouring to do business for myself—I went to Messrs. Hocking's on the 9th of Aug.—I am married and have two children—eighteen months or two years ago a warrant was sent up to me from Norwich for neglecting go support an illegitimate child—I know a person in Great Union-street, Borough—I sent 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to her, but she could not be found—I do not recollect sending her a sovereign.</p>

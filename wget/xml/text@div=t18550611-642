                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Lord Mayor's office at the Mansion House. I produce the original information of Louisa Har<lb></lb>rison—it was taken before Sir Robert Carden—it was first given on 13th Jan., but sworn on 22nd Jan.—the warrant was applied for on 13th Jan., by the officers, Finnis and Jarvis—on that day the evidence of the defendant was taken against a person of the name of Taylor—the officer said they knew the person—I asked the particulars of the case—I thought it was better to take the particulars down in writing—I asked, in the prisoner's presence, what it was for, and against whom—I felt a little doubt as to the mode in which the warrant should be granted—I thought it better to take the whole state<lb></lb>ment in writing, and then judge in what manner the warrant should be granted—when I asked the officer who it was for, he said the party had been described to him by the defendant, and the defendant said, "Yes; that is, she acquiesced in that—the officer said he knew a party answering her description—her evidence was then taken, and read in her presence, and in his presence—the information was taken in my own room, privately; then it was taken before the Magistrate, and read by him, and read also to the defendant, and she signed it—a warrant was not granted then—I sug<lb></lb>gested that I had a little doubt on the subject—I felt a little difficulty in administering the oath—the warrant was not granted then—the deposition as read over, in her presence, by me, and handed to Sir Robert Carden—the defendant was brought by the same officers again on the 22nd—I took the same deposition out to her, and said that on the previous occasion I felt</p>

               <p>a great doubt in my own mind as to what was my duty; that, from infor<lb></lb>mation I had received, my own impression was that she was under a delusion or an error—I told her that since the day on which she had been with me before, inquiries had been made, and the result of those inquiries had confirmed the previous opinion that I had entertained, and that I did not believe there was a word of truth in the statement she then made—she was very calm and collected in her manner, and she said every word was true she had previously said that she rather expected her solicitor would come down; and just as she said that, her solicitor, Mr. Levy, came in—I then spoke to him, and handed to him the deposition—I asked him to read it over to her, and then to tell me what the result of his advice was, leaving him and her together in my room—shortly afterwards he called me in, and told me, in her presence, that she stated that the whole of it was fact, and she was quite willing and ready to swear to it—she then returned into Court with her solicitor, and she put a dry pen over her original signature, I and I administered the oath—she had signed it on the former occasion, but the oath had not been administered—the oath was, "You swear that the contents of this your information are true, and that is your name and handwriting, so help you God"—she kissed the book, and a warrant was issued on that occasion—this is the information.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement was here read, as follows</hi>: "The information of Louisa Harrison, taken on oath this 22nd day of Jan., in the year of our I Lord, 1855, before the undersigned Alderman of the City of London, and I one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace in and for the said City, at the Mansion House Justice room, in the said City. The said Louisa Harrison I says on her oath—I am the wife of Edward Harrison, late of No. 2, Bull I Inn-yard, Aldgate, now of No. 6, John's-place, Barron's-place, Waterloo-road, in the county of Surrey, master carpenter. On the evening of Monday, 8th Jan. instant, after dark, I went up stairs to the second floor room I of the house in which I lived to take a jug of water and a hand towel into the front bed room—I know it was after 6 o'clock, as my husband went out I at 5 minutes to 6 o'clock that evening—I left my little girl Louisa asleep on the sofa, and I had my baby under my left arm—when I went up stairs I had a candle in a candlestick in my hand—I left the judge and towel up stairs, and turned down the bed clothes—before I got to the top of the stairs I heard a knock-ing, as if some one was poking my fire—I came down stairs, and as I opened the parlour door, having the candle in my left hand, and the child under my arm, a man struck me on the nose with his fist—this was as I was opes-ing the door—I observed that he had a mask on his face—it was a black mask, and had red lips—I dragged that off his face—it was fastened with a piece of elastic, and that snapped as I pulled it, and I threw it towards the step, inside the passage—I then saw a boy who had not any mask, and the man called out, 'Here, Taylor,' or, I say, Taylor;' and the boy then made two plunges at me with something he had in his hand—it was sharp—I thought it was a knife, and it cut my gown, and cut the skin of my right</p>

               <p>shoulder—my petticoat body was also cut at the shoulder—I ran up stairs I again, the boy followed me—I screamed all the way up—I kept the candle I alight till I got up stairs—the boy overtook me on the top of the stain, I and tried to drag me down—he seized me by the hair of my head, and pulled I my hair down—I kept on my feet, and screamed as loud as I could, and I made to the window of the second floor room; but as I went up stairs, the I window on the staircase was broken by some one from outside, because the I bits of glass flew in my face as I ran past—as soon as I went to the front window, he rushed to the window and struck me on the chest, and knocked I me down—it was with his fist, I believe—he then opened the window, and pat his foot on the box which is under the window, and then put his foot I on the ledge inside, and one foot on the spout which goes level with the window—I saw him stoop double to get out of the window, and I saw no—I thing more of him—I then fainted away, and when I came to my senses, I found Mr. Cook, the doctor, with me—I did not see anything more of the other man—I know that man by sight; it was the same man who had offered me a sovereign not to appear against the man Mallett, and I said to him that I knew him at the time I pulled the mask off—my husband went to work about five minutes to 6 o'clock, and the old lady who lived in the first floor went out about ten minutes afterwards, and I went and put the chain on the door directly she was gone—I put the chain up after my husband went out, and also after the old lady went out—I lighted the old lady out, and she undid the chain of the door, and I put it up after I had shut it—the man must have been in the room when I left it, because my husband went up stairs before he went out, and he also looked into the cellar to see that all was safe before he went out—when I got to my senses, found my husband was in the room, and he informed me that the boxes were broken open, his tool chest, and a small money box of the little girl's—he had given me the key of the money box that afternoon, and I locked it up, and put the key in my pocket; at that time there was 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, all in silver, namely, four half crowns, three shillings, and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I received the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece from the change for the milk in the afternoon—when I went down stairs I found the money box had been broken, the top part was broken off, and the money was gone—a small wooden tool of my husband's was afterwards found in my presence in the top room, which had been taken from the chest—in the lower room was a chest standing upon the tool chest, and from that chest I missed a black cloth coat, like a frock coat, of my husband's—the pockets were behind, and the sleeves very wide—there was no breast pocket—it had been torn in the arm by a saw, and had been darned by me—there was a button off, which I have at home—it was off the bottom of the right side of the front of the coat—I do not know whether there was anything in the pockets—I had put the coat out for my husband to wear on the Sunday morning before, but he did not wear it, and I had put it back on that Monday morning; I also lost two gown pieces—one was a dark red Coburg, and the other was a brown ground, with a green running flower upon it, and was a de laine, and also two yards and a half of printed cotton—when I went down stairs, I saw a bundle of things which had been tied up, consisting of two of the children's hats, some of their clothes, and also an alpaca mantle—after I was in bed that night, I missed my wedding ring from off my finger—it was safe on my finger when I went up stairs with the water—it was a very thick ring—I have searched everywhere for it, but I can<lb></lb>not find it—a parcel of grocery was also taken away from the parlour which 1 had bought on Saturday night at Mf.

                  </hi>. On the 8th Jan. I was living as cook at the Bull Inn tap, at Aldgate—the tap is exactly opposite Harrison's house—between half I past 6 and 7 o'clock that evening, I was in my bed room, which is directly I opposite to Mrs. Harrison's—I heard a scream of "Murder!" and "Police!" and I heard it was the voice of Mrs. Harrison—I was standing at the window of my room, and I immediately opened the window—from that window I could command a view of Harrison's house—I saw there were a great many people at the door, breaking open the door—I know the room she occupied as a bed room—it is up two pair of stairs, the top of the home—from my window I could see the window of that room—I could not see I anybody in her room; it was dark—there was no light in the room—I saw at last the door broken open before I left the window—I continued at the I window from the time I heard the scream till the door was broken open—no person left the house in that interval—as soon as I had seen the door I broken open I went down—I went into the house and up stairs to the second I floor room—Mrs. Johnson went up with me—the defendant was in that I room, and there were the policemen and others, and Mr. Cook, the surgeon—Mrs. Harrison appeared to be fainting away—I afterwards heard her make a statement of what she said had been done to her—she made that statement in a few minutes—she appeared much excited and agitated—in consequence of something she said in that statement Mrs. Johnson and I examined her shoulder—we found a scratch on her right shoulder—it looked like the scratch of a nail or a pin—that part of her shoulder had been under her dress—it would be entirely covered by her dress—she wore a high gown; we had to undo her dress to examine her shoulder—we afterwardi examined her dress; Mrs. Johnson helped me to examine it—we did not I find any mark or cut in the dress—it was a print dress, lilac colour.</p>

"Police!"—I ran to the tap room, which is opposite Mrs. Harrison's, and the screams appeared to come from the window of the top floor of Harrison's house—a man named Romaine ran to the door of Harrison's house—he knocked twice and no one came—on that he and another man broke the door open and went in—when they went in I stood by the side of the door post; no one came out there—no one came out of the window, or from any part of the house—I stood there till the policeman came and went in and searched the house—after the house was searched I went in—the policeman came in a very few minutes indeed—I stood there a quarter of an hour before I went in—from the first moment that ray attention was drawn to that house, it was not possible for any one I to have left it without my seeing them.</p>

I was in the Bull Inn-yard; I took the omnibus there at thirty-five minutes past 6 o'clock, and left it, and was in the tap three minutes afterwards—before I got to the beer engine, I heard the scream "Murder! Police!"—I went out into the yard directly—Har<lb></lb>risson's house is just opposite, right in front of the tap window—I ran and knocked at the door—I looked up, and kept my eye on the front all the I time—I knocked three or four times, nobody came—some other persons had joined me by that time—I burst the door in with my foot, and I fell in with it—I did not notice how the door was fastened then, but I did afterwards—there was a small chain on the door; you could open it about half a foot—the steel thing that the chain goes on was broken, that was the way I got in—when you get in the passage there is only one room, which is on the right hand—the first thing I saw was a child's head looking over the sofa as if it had just awoke up—there was a bundle of things strewed on the floor and two little straw hats or leghorn hats on the top—I saw Pickman, and I asked him to let no one out of the house—I rushed up stairs to the top room—I heard a child screaming; that was the way I found my way to it, as I heard a child screaming at the top of the house—I got another fall—I stumbled upon the person of Mrs. Harrison, just at the top of the stairs—she was just inside the room at the top of the stairs—I saw the child that I had heard scream lying between her legs—I lifted her up, and went to the window—the window was partly opened—it was not wide enough for me to get my head out—I put my head through sideways, and lifted it up with my neck—it went rather stiff—it would not go up but a very little way—I called out for somebody to fetch a doctor—Mrs. Harrison appeared to me to be in a fainting state—I had a light; three or four persons had come in, and had brought a light with them—I searched the room, and under the bed—there was a chimney with no vent—it was papered, and I tore the paper down from there—I remained till Mr. Cook, the doctor, came—after</p>

I was startled by screams of I "Murder!" and "Police!"—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock—my mother lodged at Mrs. Harrison's house—on hearing those screams I ran down stairs directly, and went into the yard—there were several persons standing against the defendant's door—I saw Komaine burst the door open—before I he burst it open he was knocking first—he then put his shoulder to the door—I said he had better not break the door open—I said, "It is up itairs; the woman and her husband may be quarrelling"—he said, "While I we are waiting, the woman may be murdered," and he burst it open, and Went in—I staid outside, and no one went out of the house, or in—I took care nobody should go in or out, for fear they should rob the house—I bhould say I remained outside about half an hour—I never went into the house till it was thoroughly searched from top to bottom—I saw it at the door—the door was open—I saw persons go down into the cellar, and find the cellar door right—I went in, and went up stairs to the second floor, to Mrs. Harrison's room—I saw her sitting on the floor, leaning against Ptomaine's knee, and a piece of wood lying on the bed—my mother was not in the house; she had gone out before this—my mother's room was fastened—the door was broken open, and I went into it after I had been up stairs—I was coming down about five or ten minutes after I went in—the room was searched—there was nobody there—I saw Mrs. Harrison's dress that</p>

On 8th Jan., I was lodging in Mr. Harrison's—I occupied the middle floor room—on that Monday evening I went out a few minutes past 6 o'clock—I left no one in my room—I locked my room door, add took the key with me—when I came down to the street door, the chain was on the door—I said, "Hang this chain," and Mrs. Harrison came out of the ground-floor room—I took the chain down and let myself out, and I heard her put up the chain after me—I have no recollection of seeing any light; I did I not turn my head—1 saw her with the corner of my eye, bat took no par<lb></lb>ticular notice of her—it was my practice to go out every Monday evening about that time, all the time I was there—I had gone out en former Men day evenings for several weeks—I told Mrs. Harrison that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon I was sent for to the Bull Inn-yard that evening, between half-past 6 and 7 o'clock—I saw the defendant—when I got to the house she was sitting on the floor—there were several persons there—she seemed aware what was going on when I got there—I spoke to her; she made no reply, but she nodded assent—I observed she had blood on her upper lip—there was no cut; nothing to be seen out<lb></lb>wardly—I ordered a little brandy and water—I bathed her face—there appeared no incised wound on her face; nothing external—the blood I saw might be occasioned by her nose bleeding—I examined her nostril—I could not perceive any wound—I wiped the blood away several times, and it bled again—it stopped bleeding in three or four minutes after I got there—this took place upstairs—she was afterwards removed downstairs she said she had been cut in the right shoulder—she pointed out the place I observed her dress; it was a high dress—it came over her shoulder—I did not observe any cut on her dress—I removed the dress and examined the shoulder I observed three scratches, just such as you may make with a pin—the blood was coagulated—the scratch was about an inch and half long, and jagged it was very superficial—there was no cut on her shoulder—I examined her dress—I said, "If you have been cut on your shoulder, of gourde there ia a corresponding cut on your gown"—I begin immediately looking for that cut and I found none—I do not think she made any remark when I said that to her—the gown was shown to me again not on the next morning but on the second morning, by Finnis the officer, in presence of the defendant—it was the same gown—I looked at the shoulder of the same gown, and then there was a out—if there had been a cut on that shoulder of the gown the first time I examined it, I certainly must have observed it—she put the gown on that second morning; this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—this is the out that I observed two days after—a cut made at this part of the gown would not have made any mark on the part of the shoulder where I saw the scratches—it is in a different direction to where I saw the scratches—I made her put the gown on—the out in the gown was at the back part of the shoulder—the scratch on the shoulder was downwards and forwards—the cut on the dress was at the back downwards and backwards—if an instrument were applied to it when the gown was on, it would not have been a mere</p>

               <p>scratch; it would have been a cut—it would have made an incision in the flesh—there was no injury on the defendant's person, except the nose bleed<lb></lb>ing and these scratches, and she might have done either of them or both of them herself, most decidedly—her husband came home, and came into the room where she was—he said, in her presence, that she said before he went out, that something was going to happen that night, and in consequence of that he had searched the house thoroughly—I have seen the defendant several times—from what I have seen of her, I considered her a very self-possessed woman, a woman of strong nerve.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you intend to convey by that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have visited her a great many times, and always found her perfectly reason<lb></lb>able in what she said, which led me to conclude that she was a woman of strong mind—it is not conclusive that great apprehension arises from a strong state of nerve—my impression is that it is so—I attended her after this second affair—I found she was a woman of strong nerve, and requiring no medical attention—I went to watch her, and see that there was nothing particular the matter with her—I did not watch the case with respect to legal proceedings, but I watched her after she had said this about the cut—the cut in the dress is behind, and the scratch is in front—she did not exhibit any apprehensions of any kind as to this story that she would not be believed—I had to her "If you have any misgivings about Mallett, it is a very horrible thing for a man to be transported; if you have any misgiving you had better communicate it to me," and she said she had no doubt about it—my notion was that she might have been mistaken in the identity of the person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing there had been really this sort of attack made on her, would it be likely to act on her nervous system very materially? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On some females it would—anything that has a great effect on the waking mind would be apt to recur at night—impressions that have been fixed on the brain become re-produced in sleep, or partial sleep, or a sort of demi-sleep—if the nose had been once cut, and bleeding had occurred, that bleeding may occur again on any excitement—on this occasion I did not discover any marks of violence on the nose—I have known of a person by terror having the nose burst out bleeding—the defendant was about four months and a half in the family way on this occasion—I was anxious to come here to convey any conclusion that I might arrive at—I went to see her, and she did not discover the slightest indisposition to talk to me, certainly not—there was no evasion whatever—there was a readiness and a determination in everything she said—her manner to me was truthful—my suspicions were roused certainly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you call the defendant's attention to the coat having been taken from the pawnbroker's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was after the pro<lb></lb>duction of this coat that she gave her evidence—I was not present when she swore to the statement.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). In the course of Monday evening, I went to Harrison's house—I saw the prisoner, and she made a statement to me—her husband was there when I got there, and he and I went round the house—I examined the staircase window—the opening of glass was about a foot I and a half long, and better than a foot wide; it was a sort of angular shape—I adjoining the pane of glass was a wooden panel, which was not moveable; it was screwed up with two screws—no one could have got in or out of that I window.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 136). About a quarter-past 5 o'clock, on Tuesday evening, 20th Jan., I saw the prisoner in Beech-street—I had seen him before—I watched him, and saw him take this piece of leaden pipe from the door of 7, Beech-street—the door was open, and this pipe was inside, leaning against the door—he walked away as fast as he could—I followed him into Beech-lane, and asked him what he was going to do with the pipe—he said, "Don't take me; you will ruin me"—I took him into custody—he walked into Whitecross-street, and then laid down, and fought very much—I held him, sent for another constable, and took him to the station—he was searched, and two duplicates found on him—this is the pipe—the prisoner appeared to be drunk when I first saw him, but, in watching him, he was not so drunk as he appeared to be—he did not take the lead in the first instance; he made two attempts, and took it the third time—it weighs 31lbs.</p>

I had been in his company all day from about half-past 11 o'clock till, I think, about a quarter after four—he got very drunk indeed in my company, both in the Coach and Horses, and in the Paul Tap, Chiswell-street—he was very much intoxicated, not able to walk—I was better than he—I had drunk a great deal of gin, but, my being older than he, I was more substantial—a shoemaker can take more than other persons.</p>

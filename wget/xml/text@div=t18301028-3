            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 23rd of September, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I sat in the shop, close to the window, with my face towards the street, and saw the prisoner come from the edge of the curb-stone; he shoved his hand and elbow through the window; I am sure the rings, seal, and key were in the window at that time, they were attached together - after he broke the window, he put his hand in and took some things out; some things fell on the pavement, and some he took away in his hand - I opened the door, ran out, and laid hold of him about a dozen yards from the shop window; I brought him back into the shop - I did not see him drop the ring myself; I am sure I saw him take something from the window, and informed Mr. Grey; the officer searched him - I saw a seal, a split ring, and key found in his trousers pocket; I am sure they were in the window before he broke it - two rings were gone; they were produced while he was in custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - The piece of pointed iron described. This was not stated in the evidence. and now produced, which was taken out of my waistcoat pocket, together with several other trifling things, is no more than a common centre-punch, and is an instrument which I have occasion to use in my trade, and which accounts for its being found in my possession; any mechanic, or other gentleman in Court, who may think proper to inspect it, can certify the use of it, and that it is not an instrument (as represented) intended solely for the purpose of committing depredation, or assisting me in committing the alledged offence I now stand charged with - had I have used the said instrument to have broken the window, I should have run great hazard in cutting my hands, which was not the case, as there was not even a scratch to be found on my person, and I do humbly beg to state the breaking of the window was quite accidental, owing to my foot slipping, which threw me up against it, when unfortunately my shoulder broke the glass; I therefore trust the above statement will be sufficient to convince your Lordship of my innocence - I humbly beg to state to your Lordship it is the first time I was ever charged with any act of dishonesty, or any other branch of the family, which is respectable; my father,

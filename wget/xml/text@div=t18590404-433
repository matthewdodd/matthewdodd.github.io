                  </hi>. I live at 7, Haydon-square, and am a poulterer carrying on business in Leadenhall-market—on Sunday, 20th March, my birthday, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was returning from my place of busi<lb></lb>ness, and as I was in the Minories passing Messrs. Moses &amp; Sons, the great clothiers, on the opposite side I saw three men—I crossed over—they were on the Aldgate church side, just opposite Bachelor's the cheesemonger's—the moon was shining, and the gas was lighted—knowing that there had been a number of robberies in the neighbourhood, I buttoned up my coat, and quickened my pace—I gave them what you may call a grand trot, five miles an hour—I generally go down Haydon-street, which is the first street on the left—when I came to Swan-street I stood by the corner—I could not see the three men then—after I got about thirty yards down Swan-street I looked back to see if I could see anything of them and I did not—when I got about halfway down the street I felt myself tripped up like a stick—I found myself going up in the air, and down I came—I felt some men pressing upon my back before I was tripped up, and then I went up in the air and came down on the pavement on my rump, and then my head, and it sounded like an</p>

               <p>old, empty tea-chest—I felt a man throttling me, and one on my right breast, and another on my left, attempting to rifle my pockets—I had on my pilot coat, with the collar up to cover my cheeks—the prisoner took hold of me by the throat—they did not unbutton my coat, they attempted to do so, but I gave them the benefit of my "double fives"—the witness Mr. Walters came up from the other end of the street to my assist<lb></lb>ance, after I had had a struggle with them, he assisted me up—the other two men made off as soon as Mr. Walters had assisted me up—I told him that these men had attempted to garrotte and rob me—the prisoner moved off some distance—I and Mr. Walters followed him—a policeman came up from the other end of the street, and I gave the prisoner in charge—I am positive he is the man who seized me by the throat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a custom-house officer, and live at 27, St. Mary-at-hill—On Sunday morning, 20th March, a little before 1, I was going down Swan-street in the Minories, and saw the prosecutor and three men following him—I saw one man raise his arm in the act to strike, and the prosecutor fell on his back—I then saw his head between one of the men's knees—the prisoner had him by the right breast, and he was in the act of putting his left hand into the prosecutor's pocket—I sang out, "Hallo, what is your game?"—the prisoner said, "It is only a drunken man falling"—the other stepped back from the prisoner into the road, and ran away—the prisoner also ran away—I called "Police"—a policeman met him, and I saw him take him into custody—I never lost sight of him from the time of his leaving the prosecutor till he was taken—I am quite certain he is the man whose hand I saw at the prosecutor's pocket.</p>

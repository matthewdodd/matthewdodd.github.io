               <p>I live in Chelsea, I am an engraver; I have known the prisoner ever since last Tuesday, it was an act of humanity that prompted me to be an evidence here, I heard a very venal character in the neighbourhood, of the prosecutor; and that the girl had neither father nor mother, and that they would swear any thing: I was very sorry to hear it. I went to the man, and he told me she had broke open the till; the man said then he had promised he would not hurt her if she would confess; I told him I was her uncle; he said if I would give 3 guineas he would slaw the indictment; he took me to a public-house in the Hay-market to make the matter up; but when we came there, he would have three guineas for himself, 5 s. for the constable, 5 s. for the witnesses, and 3 s. for what he spent at the Rotation-office.</p>
               <p>Court to Whitlow. Do you know any thing of this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is what he says true? - No, this man came with pretences to be a relation, was sorry for the girl, and wanted me to compound the felony, and I said I could not; I never attended to any such proposals at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. Nor you never made any proposals? - None, he called on me two or three times, on the Sunday and Tuesday, he asked me to go with him, I said, I only meant to do justly and honestly by myself, nobody else was present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ray. The publican's name was Wallis, this person took me down there.</p>
               <p>Court. What business had you in the matter at all? - It was an an act of humanity; it was the feelings of my own breast that taught me to do it.</p>

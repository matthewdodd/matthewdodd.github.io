            . The prisoner lodged in my first floor for a week - I have other lodgers, but not in the same room. These articles were kept in the front kitchen, where I sleep - I saw them on Sunday, about nine o'clock, and missed them on Monday, the 6th of March; the drawers they were in were locked, but I cannot say whether the key was left in them - I was present on Wednesday, the 8th, when the prisoner's box was searched in her room; she opened it herself, took the key from her pocket and put it to the key-hole, but whether it was locked or not I do not know - the shawl was the first thing I saw on the box being opened; I knew it to be my wife's - these other things were found in her box; the ring must have been taken off the parlour shelf - I claimed the things in her presence; she gave no account of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is not that a brass curtain ring? A. No - it is brass; I do not know whether this is coloured glass in it - no other person lodged in her room; a young woman lodged with her for a few nights - the prisoner came on the 2nd of March; she was very ill, and my wife had to procure her medicine - she was incapable of helping herself; I cannot say whether the other young woman gave notice before she left - she staid but three days, and paid for a week, as she got a situation, and went to it directly; the prisoner complained of losing a sovereign on the Monday - she desired my wife to take her money from the drawer to pay for her medicine - I do not know how much she had; she was not confined to her bed; I do not know that her box was always open; I saw my things safe after the woman left, but cannot tell when - her box was searched in the officer's presence; she did not desire it should be searched; she was in our room - I said her room must be searched first, as she was a stranger; she went up with us, and produced the keys; she had left her service on account of illness; the caps are of trifling value.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was sent for; Sutherland said, "Now we will have the house searched;" I asked him, in the prisoner's hearing, if he suspected one more than another; he said, "Yes, the prisoner;" we all went up to her room - she opened her box herself, and this shawl laid in it, just by the lock - Sutherland and his wife claimed it; she made no answer; one cap and a collar were found - the other cap and collar were found under a pair of stays, at the foot of the bed - I afterwards overtook her in the New-road, in care of another Policeman - she gave me this cap out of her hand, and said she hoped Mr. Sutherland would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she open the box, or unlock it? A. I cannot say whether she unlocked it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that her box and the room door were always open till the Wednesday, when she looked it, and that the things must have been placed in it by the person who had stolen her sovereign.</p>

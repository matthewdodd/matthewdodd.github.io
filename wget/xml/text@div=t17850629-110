               <p>The first time this Bacharah came to my house, I have seen him before, because Mr. Butts heard this man say, if I would make him a present, he would not hurt the boy, he came to me before I applied to him; and when he came he told me, that the allowance of the Court would be fifteen shillings, or a guinea; I told him it was not in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290143"></xptr> power to give so much; and he told me the least he could take was half a guinea: I had but five shillings , and the five shillings I gave him; well, then, he said, I will take it as you can give it me ; I gave him the five shillings, and he came to me last Thursday was a fortnight, says he, I have been to Hicks's-Hall, and I have been buying a bedstead , says he, I am to give fifteen shillings, and have got but twelve; I said you may have three shillings more of the money if you have a mind, and I gave him three shillings more; says I, I have not the money now, but if you will call again in an hour's time, I can get the money, and he called again; and last Thursday as ever was, he came and had the other half crown; I have a woman by that is a witness of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Bacharah. Is this true? - It is as false as God is true.</p>
               <p>Did you ever receive any thing from her? - I never received a farthing from her to abandon this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any sum from her on any account? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken you never received a farthing of that woman? - I never received a farthing of the woman in my life.</p>

               <p>I know no otherwise than I have seen this man three or four times, and he came in to the prisoner's mother's on Friday last, and said I wish you would let me have that money, and she went and gave him two shillings and sixpence; he said she had no occasion to make herself uneasy at all about it.</p>
               <p>What are you? - My husband is a jeweller, a lodger, I live on Saffron-hill.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - A good while, about four months.</p>
               <p>Was it a half crown piece? - It was two shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Mother. My Lord, yesterday morning this Bacharah came to me, and said, so I find you have told the constable that you have given me half-a-guinea; how could you be so good for nothing woman ; but says he you have no occasion to bring anybody to his character, for so long as I bring the boy off, what is that to you .</p>
               <p>Tilcock. My Lord, she told me she gave him ten shillings and six-pence .</p>
               <p>Court. Let Isaac Bacharah be committed to Newgate, and you must prosecute him for compounding felony : it is a gross misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Bacharah. My Lord, I hope you will send me to Woodstreet Compter , I shall be killed by the prisoners in Newgate, they do not like me.</p>

            , as justly to incur the censure and indignation both of the Court and Jury; there appeared very great reason to suspect that you were guilty at least of the crime of compounding felony, if not of the greater crime of perjury; however, as you expressed at the time a sense of the fault that you had committed, the Court will dismiss you at present with a reprimand, hoping this narrow escape will be a warning to you, and that you will never again presume to enter a Court of Justice , but with the purest motives of public justice, and the strictest regard to truth in the whole of your future deportment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cab-driver of Lisson-grove, Marylebone—on Saturday evening, 18th February, I saw the deceased Mr. Taylor in Manchester-street—I was taking up in Manchester-street, and I saw him at the rank in Dorset-street first—he accompanied me from there to Manchester-street—I had a fare there to take two ladies and two children; one lady and child to Burton-crescent, the other lady and child to Kingsland-road—the deceased asked my permission to ride on the box with me—I left one lady and child at Burton-crescent, and then proceeded to Kingsland-road, up Pentonville<lb></lb>hill by the Angel and the City-road—when I was by the City-road bridge, and just commencing to go up it, I saw a Hansom's cab coming down from the crown of the bridge at a very fast pace, between ten and eleven miles an hour—I was so far on my near side that there was plenty of room for him to pass on his own side without touching me on the off-side—I cannot exactly say how near I was to the kerb stone on the left, as I got shook when I came to the ground—I could not avoid the accident, I thought he would have pulled off me, but he did not—he came right opposite me, and tried to pull in, but not till too late—he had plenty of room—I was driving at about five miles an hour—the Hansom was near my side—his near wheel was in the middle of the road, his off wheel on my right side—he was near the middle, but rather on the near side, the width of his vehicle on my</p>

               <p>side—the collision occurred, and his wheel struck against part of my vehicle—the wheels of his Hansom came between my off fore wheel and spring, and shook deceased and me off the box, and then his wheel went over, struck at my wheel, and stopped between the two wheels of my cab—it strained the spring—the deceased was taken up by some gentlemen—he fell into the near side gutter—he was taken to a doctor's close by—we then got the cabs apart—I pulled my cab closer to the kerb—the doctor came and asked me if I would take the deceased to the hospital—I took him to St. Bartholomew's hospital—allowing a couple of yards for the width of my cab, there were ten yards between my off wheel and the kerb on the opposite side of the road—it was ten yards from the kerb—the road is about fourteen yards wide, a little under or over—I was sober, and the prisoner appeared sober—my near wheel was between three and four yards from the kerb, to the best of my recollection—there was no other vehicle in sight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you say that the Hansom's cabman was going to draw off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I say I thought the four-wheeled cab was drawing off to admit the Hansom's cab—I did not see the collision, and did not see the cabs after they had been separated—I went to look at the men, because I considered that the vehicles could take care of themselves—from the direction in which the Hansom's cab horse was plunging, it was drawing over towards the Macclesfield Arms—that would cause the wheels to <hi rend="italic">skid</hi> more towards the City Arms—it drew the two vehicles, and each time it plunged, it slipped over again—after the horse had plunged some time, the Hansom's cab was at an angle across the road—it was on its wrong side, after being drawn—it had gone over the crown of the bridge about three feet.</p>

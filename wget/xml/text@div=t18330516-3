On the 17th of April, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I opened my shop-door, and saw two men crossng the road - one of them had a great coat on very much resembling a coat which belonged to me, and the other had a bundle - the great coat had a fur collar - whether the first man had a bundle I could not see - I then called to my daughter Sarah, who was in the parlour, to know if our bed-room door was locked; she said, "Yes" - I had left it locked when I was last up there - I ran up stairs, and found the bed-room door, on the first floor, forced open - a box was broken open, and my clothes scattered about, and some things were gone - I ran down stairs, and gave an alarm to my daughter - the lock of the bed-room door was still locked, though it was forced open - it could not have been done with a skeleton-key - I had locked the door myself about two hours before, and hung the key up in the parlour; I then went in pursuit down Drake-street, and down different streets, to see if I could see the two men - I saw a policeman, and then went to the station-house in George-street, and gave information of the robbery, that it might be in the Hue-and-Cry the same night- I then returned home - when I first went into my bed-room, I missed the things out of the box, but did not wait to ascertain what was gone - when I returned home, I re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160004"></xptr>ceived information that a coach had been stopped in Holborn - I then went to Giltspur-street, and from there to the station-house in Bow-street, where I saw part of my property, and the three prisoners had been apprehended; I had not seen them before on that day - I cannot swear whether either of them were the men I had seen crossing the street - I had seen two of the prisoners in my shop on the Saturday week before; that was Guest and Richardson- this was on Wednesday - they came to see if I had got a pair of boots to fit them, but I had not; and Richardson was in the house on the Monday previous to the 17th - I was whitewashing and cleaning my staircase, and he came on the staircase, and I spoke to him - I have a good many lodgers; mine is a double house - he asked me if a young man named Williams was at home? I told him No; he said he wanted a pair of trousers made - Williams is a tailor - I told him Williams was never at home till after eight o'clock at night, and he said he would call on Wednesday evening - my street-door was generally on the spring-latch, for the convenience of the lodgers; a person can let himself in from the outside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you pay the rent and taxes of the house? A. Yes; a dozen of my lodgers might pass my bed-room door to go to their rooms - I locked the door at two o'clock, and at half-past four found it broken open; I cannot say whether any of my family had gone up stairs after I locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q.Might you not have locked the lock, and yet the bolt of the lock miss the catch? A.Never - I cannot swear that I turned round to see if it was fast, but when I took they key out I could tell it was fast, or the door would have fallen back - the street-door is often open - I know the parish my house is in by my tax papers - I missed some of these things when I first went into the room, but did not examine to see what was gone - I had not seen Guest, except when he came to my shop about the boots, to my knowledge - I can swear he is the man who applied for the boots, I have not the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said the door would fall open if not locked? A. Yes, it would fall back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Richardson. Q.Did not you say you saw me after the robbery, before you saw me at Bow-street? A. No, unless it was you that was at the corner of Drake-street, with a bundle under your arm - I will swear you are the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I thought you said you could not be certain who it was? A.He had a blue coat on at Bow-street, and I believe him to be the man I saw with the bundle under his arm in Drake-street, but cannot swear positively.</p>

            . I am the daughter of George Newport - on the 17th of April, about four o'clock, I was at tea in the back parlour; I looked into the yard through the window, and saw a man there; he was a man who I had seen come into my father's shop on the Saturday week previous; I knew him again directly - he had come on the Saturday night as near eight o'clock as possible; it was the Saturday fortnight before - it was two weeks, and part of another week; another man was with him on that night(pointing to Guest) - I am positive it was that man, I made the remark to my father the moment I saw him; he merely looked into the parlour window - the moment I went to Bow-street, I recognised Richardson as having been with him on that Saturday; about ten minutes after I saw the man in the yard my father gave an alarm of robbery, I went up stairs with my father, and found his bed-room door broken open; there were two pieces of wood broken off the door, and the lock was forced out - the lock of the box was forced, and the lid broken - there was a child's money-box in a drawer of a chest of drawers, and I found that broken and laid on the table, with the poker by the side of it; and I found my father's box emptied of the whole of its contents; and the bottom drawer, which belongs to me, but which had not been locked, was opened and emptied - I missed a cloth cloak belonging to me, a black silk frock, a boa, and, I think, a shawl was taken out of that drawer, but can't be certain which drawer it was in; it was in one of the drawers - when I first went up, I did not notice what was missed, but while my father was gone in search of the men, I examined to see what was taken away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. One of the prisoners looked through the window, was it not quite a momentary thing? A.Quite so, but I distinctly saw him, his eye was exactly fixed on mine; and the moment I saw him, I recognised him - I am positive it was Guest, he had the same coat on at Bow-street, but I speak to his face; the coat at first struck me, but the moment I looked in his face, I knew him to be the man I had seen on the Saturday night, for I had left off what I was doing that night, and took notice of them in the shop, that they should not take any thing - I think that was on the Saturday fortnight, but am not certain - I had put all my father's things away in the box on the Monday morning, and I gave him a shirt out of the box on the 17th in the morning and it was in its usual condition.</p>

            . I shall be fourteen years old on the 27th of August; I am the prosecutor's son - on the afternoon of the 17th of April - I heard the alarm of robbery; I was at tea - I went out into the street with my father - I went down several streets, and my father and I met a policeman - I then went home with my father, and was directed to go to my brother's, who lives in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell - I saw my brother, and left him in Exmouth-street - I was then going home, and saw three men at the corner of King's-road, and Gray's-inn-lane, (it was the three prisoners) - I had seen Guest before, crossing our yard, while we were having our tea, that day - I had not seen either of the others before; when I saw the three men - I think it was Richardson who had on a great coat, which I knew to be my father's by the fur collar, and the fur being worn off at the back of the neck; I am sure one of the three had it on - Guest had a pair of trousers rolled up under his arm, and the braces hanging down - Richardson had a bundle - I can't say whether Jones had anything; because he was in the watering-house - I think Jones was first, Guest next, and Richardson last; and the last person had the great coat on - there is a stand of coaches at the bottom of King's-road - I saw a coach drive off the stand to the prisoners; they got into the coach all three of them, and the coach drove down Gray's-inn-lane - I followed it; it went to the bottom of Holborn, and then turned to the right hand - the coach was afterwards stopped; it then turned round to the left; it was then between Middle-row and Southampton-buildings - I saw a policeman, named Bolton, at the corner of Gray's-inn-lane - I said, "Can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160005"></xptr>you take charge of three men in that coach?" he and I followed the coach, the Policeman went in front of the horses, the coachman stopped the coach directly, and then the Policeman opened the coach-door - I then saw Guest put his hand out on the other side, and open that door; Guest and Richardson jumped out on that side, and then Bolton apprehended Guest, and brought him back to the coach; and then Richardson was brought to the coach, and the coach drove to Bow-street - I went with it - Guest and Richardson, and two Policemen and I were in the coach - I don't know what had become of Jones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from them when you saw them in the King's-road? A.Across the road; it is rather wide; there were not many persons passing - the prisoners got into the coach on the same side of the way as I stood, their backs were towards me; there were no persons before them - I am sure I kept sight of the right coach, for I ran behind it, and had hold of it - when I first saw the three men, one walked before the others - one went into the watering-house - I am sure the same persons got into the coach.</p>

I am a Policeman; on the afternoon of the 17th of April, I saw the last witness; he gave me to understand his father had been robbed, and that the parties were in that coach, No. 558 - I went after the coach, and told the coachman to stop; it stopped directly - I opened the door, and saw the three prisoners inside - I saw in the coach a large coat with a fur collar to it, and a good deal of other property, which I have here to produce; I have had it ever since - when I opened the coach-door, the three prisoners began emptying their pockets, and seemed very much confused; one of them then opened the coach-door on the other side, and Guest jumped down first, Richardson next, and 
               <persName id="t18330516-3-person118">Jones</persName>
             the last; I caught him by the skirt of his coat, and part of it came off - they ran away down Holborn; I pursued Guest, and apprehended him in Fetter-lane - I called out for another Policeman, but none were near at the time - when I took Guest, I took him by the coat, and brought him back - I had not lost sight of him - he said he did not know any thing at all about it - when I got back to the coach, I found the property which I have here - Richardson was brought back by another man from the city, and given in charge of the city Policeman - I took Guest and Richardson to Bow-street; another Policeman was with me - the prosecutor's son went with me - when I got to Bow-street, I gave Richardson in charge of another officer, while I searched the coach for the property - I found a coat on Guest, which I marked, and have here - I searched Guest's pocket, and found a handkerchief on him, which was returned by order of the magistrate; it was his own; I also found a halfpenny on him - I searched Richardson, and found 1s. 10 1/2d. in silver and copper, and I found two body coats on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Before you took Guest, had you taken the number of the coach? A. Yes, it was No. 558 - I was quite sober when the witness spoke to me, I had not tasted any thing to drink till after I left Bow-street, at twelve o'clock - the examination was in the evening - I was not reprimanded by the magistrate for being in liquor, I was as sober as I am now, and I have had nothing to-day - I heard the magistrate make no observation, if he had I should have known it - I did not lose sight of Guest when he left the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the coach-door, were the three men getting out on the opposite side? A. No; they were in confusion emptying their pockets - I can speak to Jones as well as the others - I am certain of them all three; they got out of the coach as soon as they could empty their pockets - Jones was on the front seat of the coach - I am positive he is the man, I never expressed a doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Richardson. Q. You say, when you opened the coach, there was a coat with a fur collar? A. Yes, it laid on the cushion of the coach - you said nothing to me when I searched you; another officer searched you first.</p>

            . I am the owner and driver of a hackney-coach. On the 17th of April, in the afternoon, I was on the coach-stand in the King's-road, and was called off the stand by three persons; I drew up, and the waterman let them into the coach; they all three got in, and they had, I believe, a bundle each - I can swear to Richardson, but will not undertake to swear to the others, but believe them to be the men - I was ordered by the waterman to go to Henry-street, Portland-road; I was then on my box - I got down, went to the coach-door, and said, "Gentlemen, there is no such street as Henry-street, Portland-road;" Richardson said, "Coachman, it is Henry-street, Waterloo-road, go over Waterloo-bridge" - I went on in that direction along Gray's-inn-lane into Holborn, and turned to the right to go down Southampton-buildings, when Richardson stopped me, and asked where I was going? I said, according to his direction, over Waterloo-bridge; he ordered me to turn about, and go over Blackfriars-bridge - I turned round, and on proceeding down Holborn near Leather-lane, Bolton called to me to stop - I first saw the prosecutor's son when I was called over to take the prisoners up; he got up on the fore-wheel of my carriage as they were getting into the coach, and asked me if he could ride along with me: I had a conversation with him, and told him to get up behind the coach; I don't know whether he did or not, for I proceeded on.</p>
               <p>Richardson. Q. Did you ever see me before? A. Never to my knowledge, but you were so particular in giving me directions, and you put your head out in Holborn, and told me to go over the other bridge - I am satisfied, on my solemn oath, you are the man who gave me those directions.</p>

            . I am a City policeman. On the afternoon of the 17th of April, between five and six, I was in Holborn, and saw the coach driving down Holborn; Newport and Bolton were pursuing it - I followed, and heard Bolton request the coachman to pull up, which he did just by Leather-lane; Bolton opened the coach-door, and in an instant the three prisoners jumped out of the coach on the other side - I had a side view of them, and I have every reason to believe they are the three - I went in pursuit with the officer who secured Guest, and I assisted him in bringing him back to the coach; I believe him to be one of the men I saw jump out, but I lost sight of him; while I was helping to put him into the coach a man who takes the toll brought another man, and gave him into charge; that was Richardson - I did not recognise him again - I went with him to Bow-street - I staid inside the coach, and gave the property out to Bolton, and brought part of it out myself; I have had that in my charge ever since - while I was putting Richardson into the coach, a respectable person brought me an opera-glass and a ear-ring; he is assistant to Mr. Jones, the optician, in Holborn; I can't say where he got them from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had a very slight opportunity of observing them? A.Very; I don't swear positively to Guest, as several persons got before me for a moment - I believe him to be the man - I gave the property out of the coach to several officers at Bow-street; none of them are here, but what is in my possession I have had ever since.</p>

            . I am a City Policeman. On the afternoon of the 17th of April I was in Holborn - I saw a crowd going down Hatton-garden, and hearing a cry of"Stop thief," I went after the crowd, and took the prisoner Jones into custody in Hatton-garden - I took him from there down to our Station in Giltspur-street, and kept him there till our Inspector came in; while he was in the Station-house, he pulled three coats off his back which are here; I have had them ever since - the one he had on outside the others had the flaps to it torn, but he took the rest of the flaps off at the Station-house; there was a piece wanting to complete the flaps - he asked me to lend him a knife to cut off the flaps - I told him I should not lend him a knife, but he might do as he thought proper, and he then tore them off - I found on him a coin which is stated in the indictment as a 7s. piece. and 2s. 3d. in halfpence, and 1s. in silver, and a knife and a pencil - they were in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Jones' Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen; - I was passing along the street, and met my fellow-prisoners carrying bundles; I had had a slight public-house acquaintance with them, and I consented to carry them. It was suggested that it would be less difficult to carry the coats on our backs than in bundles, and we put them on. I soon found the situation I had placed myself in when the coach we were in was stopped, and being alarmed for my own situation, and the disgrace which my family would suffer, I consequently ran away. I knew nothing of the robbery nor should I have received the property, had I not unfortunately accidentally met my fellow-prisoners. I have witnesses to my character, and hope your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen, will consider my case mercifully.</p>

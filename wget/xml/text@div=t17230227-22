They both shook Hands, and went to their Cloths, which were about twelve Yards off. That the deceased's Knees then began to fail him, and he fell, and the Prisoner came and rais'd him up, saying, He believed he was only sick; but he dy'd on the Spot. That then he laid hold of the Prisoner, who made no Resistance, and beckoning to some Bricklayers, who were at work in sight, they came to him. The Prisoner, in his Defence, pleaded, That being a drinking with the Deceas'd in the Ale-house, he call'd him Scoundrel and Blockhead, and told him, He would strip off his Skin alive. That he desir'd him to be quiet. That then he went out, and the Deceased followed him. He call'd an Evidence, who is their Serjeant, who depos'd, That he, the Prisoner, and the Deceased, were at the Blew Boar's Head, and the Serjeant said to the Prisoner, How could you say, that you spent 8 d. to beg such a Man out of the Savoy? That the Prisoner reply'd, He said no such Thing. That then the Serjeant reply'd, There's the Man that says it, meaning the Deceased. That upon this some Words arose between the Prisoner and the Deceased, and they both went out, but he did not apprehend that they went out to sight. The Prisoner call'd several to his Reputation, who gave him the Character of a quiet, peaceable Person, and among the rest, his Captain gave him a very good Character. <rs id="t17230227-22-verdict133" type="verdictDescription">

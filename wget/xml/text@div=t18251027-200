               <p>MY DEAR WALLIS,</p>
               <p>I shall find a pleasure in speaking with you as quick as possible, at the White-bear, Kennington-road, near the Common.</p>
               <p>I remain your's, for life, J. EASTON.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Wallis, Cow-keeper, Hill-street, Newington.</p>
               <p> I went there, and he said "My dear, I am happy to see you: I have been thinking about taking a public-house in the country;" which he said he thought would be better than my going round with milk; he said he never loved a woman so well in his life, but one, and she died; he talked about taking out three hundred and fifty guineas on the morrow, but he should want money to take it out with; he asked if I had any; I said about ten guineas; he said he would buy a license on the morrow, and be married on the Wednesday; he came to my house and slept with my son, who is about fourteen years of age; the next morning we set off to come to town; he stopped at a public-house, and called for a trunk; I asked what he was going to do with it; he said he had a particular reason for wishing to take it to town, that it contained all his clothes and a roll of parchment - When we got to <placeName id="t18251027-200-crimeloc1160">Doctors' Commons</placeName>

I put my hand into my pocket, and he took it out, and put his hand in, and took out my money; he said "I shall soon return and bring a lawyer's clerk, and sign the papers before you." I did not at the time consider myself as robbed, but waited for him till one o'clock; he did not come; I got a coach and put the trunk in, and went home - I opened it, and there was nothing in it but a frying-pan without a handle, a garden pot, a cheek of a range, and an iron hanger.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Little Manor-street, Clapham. On Friday, the 5th of Aug., I had a donkey turned out on Clapham-common—I saw it safe at nine o'clock in the morning, and missed it about half-past nine—I saw it again about four the same afternoon, in Smithfield—a man named Timson had it there for sale.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Walworth. On the 6th of Aug., about twelve o'clock in the day, I was in Blackfriars-road—I saw a donkey—a little boy was riding it, and the prisoner was walking by the side of it—the prisoner asked me to buy the donkey—he asked 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said I had only 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they went on about forty yards, and then the little boy came run<lb></lb>ing back, and said I should have it—I bought it for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am sure it was the prisoner who offered me the donkey for sale—I took it to my own home, and put it in harness to see if it would be of any use to me, and it would not, it laid down—I sent Timson to sell it for half a guinea—I afterwards heard something, and the prisoner was given in charge.</p>

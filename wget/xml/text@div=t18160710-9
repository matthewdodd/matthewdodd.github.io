               <p>WILLIAM HULM. I lost my seals and key on the day in the indictment; they were fastened to my watch, which was in my pocket; the ribbon was cut in two with a pair of scissors, and the watch was left behind; it was about half past eleven in the morning; I was in <placeName id="t18160710-9-crimeloc42">Aldgate-street</placeName>

While I was in the crowd looking at the ruins, I felt my coat pulled very tight, and on looking down, saw my seals in one of this boy's hands, and the scissors in the other. He immediately threw them on the ground. and I held him fast while I picked them up; they were my seals; the ribbon had been cut. I handed the prisoner and the seals over to an officer.</p>

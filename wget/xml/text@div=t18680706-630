                  </hi>. I am a grocer, in the Commercial Road—on 14th June, about 9.30, I was at the booking-office at the Lea Bridge Station—there were several other persons there—I was going towards the window to get my ticket—as I got just by the barrier, in front of the ticket office, the prisoner pushed against me, and I saw his hand leave my coat—I seized him—he pushed in from the barrier; pushed me on one side, so as to get between me and the barrier, in front of me—I had a waistcoat on with no fob to it, and my watch was in the pocket, and the coat buttoned—I had seen it safe the moment before—I saw the prisoner's hand come from under my coat, looked down, and saw the chain hanging, and the watch gone—no one but the prisoner was near enough to have taken it; he was the only man before me—I immediately took hold of him, and gave him to the station master—there were other persons near enough to him to take the watch from him—he refused his address at the station—he said he travelled in Manchester and Birmingham—he said, sooner than I should prosecute him, he would pay me double the value of the watch—it was a gold hunter, worth twelve guineas—a ring was picked up, which corresponds with the one on my watch.</p>

               <p>of the window of the ticket office—I don't think the prisoner had paid for his ticket; he was going towards the pay place—this was about eight or ten minutes before the train started—five or six people were taking their tickets—I don't think I said, before the Magistrate, that I saw his hand coming from the breast of my coat; I won't be positive, I might have said so—I laid hold of the prisoner at once; and, if I could, I should have laid him on his back, but on account of the barrier I was not able.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station-master at Lea Bridge—I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor pushing the prisoner, and heard him ask for his watch—he was given into my custody—I seized him by the collar of the coat and hand, and handed him out of the office to the policeman—when the prosecutor accused him of taking the watch, he pulled his coat off, and turned up the sleeve, to show that he had no watch there—there were persons near enough to him to have received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then I suppose there were persons near enough to have taken it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there were others in front, but the prisoner was between them and the prosecutor—no man in front of the prisoner could have got to the prosecutor's pocket—there were a great many there—there were several behind the prosecutor—I can't say whether he had passed them—I believe he took his ticket—the prisoner had not taken, his—the booking clerk is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the defendant, William Story; he is a tailor and outfitter in Fleet-street. I have been for some time living at Notting-hill—I have been living away from my husband for some years—there was a decree in the Ecclesiastical Court, about three years since, at my application, for the restitution of conjugal rights, and after that a mutual separation took place between my husband and myself before Mr. Ald. Moon—there was an agreement to separate, and he agreed to allow me a guinea a week—in consideration of that I agreed not to go to my hus<lb></lb>band's house during the time he continued to pay me the guinea, and not to contract any debts, and I never contracted any during that period—after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185701050002"></xptr>
               <p>that arrangement was made the guinea a week was paid to me for some<lb></lb>thing like a year and nine months—during that time I did not go to my husband's house at all, nor did I contract any debts during the time the guinea was paid—Mr. Story then reduced it to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I was then paying just 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my board at a school—that 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. continued for something like six or seven months, or it might have been rather more—he then reduced it to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said he thought of reducing it still further—in conse<lb></lb>quence of his reducing it, I consulted my attorney, and about eight or nine months after that I went back to my husband's house—I was placed in a desti<lb></lb>tute situation—I repeatedly wrote <hi rend="italic">sympathizing</hi> letters to Mr. Story, but I could not induce him to pay me any more, and on 2nd Dec. I went back to the house in Fleet-street—I went through the shop, and up stairs into a room on the first floor, that formerly used to be my sitting room, and there I saw my daughter, who is now in Court—I advanced towards her to embrace her, she looked frightened at me, and said, "Oh! don't touch me," she saw her father come into the room; he dragged me by the arm, and dragged me towards the door, calling to his shopman, Batchelor, and he said to Batchelor, "That woman is not my wife; knock her down"—the room opens into the hall—he dragged me towards the hall, and his friend Batchelor came and pushed me in the back, and pushed me out into the hall—I went to sit down on a chair, and he said to Batchelor, "Drag the chair from under that woman"—he did so—I then took another, and another, and a third, and they were all dragged from under me by the instruction of my husband—he was standing and looking on, and talking; I cannot tell what he said, he talked so very fast, and was in such a rage—he said to Batchelor, "That woman is not my wife, knock her down stairs"—he did so, but I, to save myself, clung hold of the hand rail, and held it with my left hand while Batchelor was knocking my other hand off, and at last he accomplished his purpose, and knocked me down; but before that a policeman came—I cried "Murder!" to save myself from being knocked down stairs in that way, and Mr. Story sent the shopman out to call a policeman, and he was at the bottom of the stairs, and saw me coming down, but he walked down stairs—I was knocked down stairs by Batchelor, I did not tumble down—I clung to the hand rail to save myself from falling—they got me down in that way, I was very thankful that my back was not broken—my husband was calling to Batchelor all the time to knock me down—they ultimately knocked me down stairs, and I was forced out at the side door by Batchelor—a police sergeant was outside, and he advised me to go to Guildhall.</p>

Moon, and you yourself settled it—he never summoned me for assault<lb></lb>ing him except that once, and I did not assault him then; I went home as I went home now; I was as innocent as I am at this very moment, and you know it, because you hushed up the case, and settled it by his allowing me a guinea a week—he does not allow me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week now—there was a proposition between Mr. Lewis, jun., and Mr. Story to pay me a guinea a week during this investigation, instead of which, when I went to Guild<lb></lb>hall, only 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was left for me, and I would not take it—I cannot live on</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 322). On 2nd Dec., I was called in to Mr. Story's house, on to the first floor, I there saw Mr. and Mrs. Story, and their daughter, and Batchelor, standing at the top of the landing—Mrs. Story said she had been struck by some one behind; I did not hear her say by whom—Mr. Story asked me to put her out—I asked him who she was—he said, "Never mind who she is, put her out"—I said, "I believe it is Mrs. Story"—she said, "Yes, I am, I am his wife;" and I said, "Stop here"—I told him I could not put her out, I could not interfere if she was his wife—she then sat down in a chair—he asked Batchelor to put her out—Batchelor took hold of the back of the chair to lift it up, and Mrs. Story got up and sat down in another chair—he took that up in the same way, and took hold of Mrs. Story behind to put her towards the landing—she then caught hold of the banister, and clung to it; and while he was pulling her away I passed to the bottom of the stairs, and left him to put her down stairs—I saw the m come down stairs—I believe he had hold of her behind, pushing her in front of him—when they got to the bottom of the stairs, Mr. Story asked her to go out—she refused—he then opened the door, and told Batchelor to put her out; and he then put her out at the door—I believe she slipped down two or three steps towards the bottom of the stairs—I did not see her down on the ground—I believe Batchelor had hold of her behind, he was behind her; I was then standing at the bottom of the stairs—Batchelor was forcing her down the stairs—she did not come on her back at the bottom of the stairs; she did not tumble at all, nothing more than slipping down; she came on her backside, two or three steps from the bottom—she clung to the banisters at the top of the stairs—I believe Batchelor pulled her hands away; but I passed to the bottom of the stairs before he got them away—I did not see him strike her hands, I can<lb></lb>not tell whether he did or not—I heard a female scream when I entered the shop first, but not after I got on to the stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Anchor and Hope at Shadwell. On Monday last, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner was in my tap-room with some others—I had a goose roasted—my wife had taken it from the spit, and put it into the dripping-pan before the fire—when we were about to sit down to supper, the goose was gone, and the prisoner too—I got information—I got an officer, and took him at another public-house kept by a widow—I do not know the sign—his mouth was all over grease—it appeared as if nobody had taken any of it but himself, and that was by putting it to his mouth and gnawing it—the prisoner was employed by me.</p>

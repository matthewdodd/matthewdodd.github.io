                  </hi>. I am an appraiser, and have lived in Vineyard-gar<lb></lb>dens, Clerkenwell, for many years. On Wednesday, the 29th of July, I was returning from Kensington—I turned into a place directly opposite St. George's Hospital for a necessary purpose, and found the prisoner in another part there—there was accommodation for three people—the prisoner pushed up against me—I asked him what he meant—I had unfastened my clothes—I asked what he meant—he said, "I want money, and money I will have"—I directly left the place—I said I would give him nothing—I did not continue for the pur<lb></lb>pose I went for—I left the place immediately—the prisoner followed me along Piccadilly, demanding money, or else he would charge me with a most shame<lb></lb>ful act—I had got near Park-lane—he said, "If you will not give me money give me beer"—I said, "I will give you in charge of the first policeman I meet"—he said, "If that is the case I will have the first <hi rend="italic">pull</hi>"—I got to Park-lane, and seeing a policeman he said, "Take charge of this man"—I said, "It is a false charge"—I was taken to the station—the prisoner followed me, and gave me in charge—the inspector said he was bound to receive the charge, and could not take bail to any amount—I told the policeman, when he gave me in charge, that he had been trying to extort money from me, and at the station I told the inspector he had been trying to extort money from me, and if he took one charge he ought to take the other, but he did not—I gave him my card of address—I believe the prisoner gave his address.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He has taken a false oath; I went to make water; he was there; he pushed up against me, and passed his hand round, and caught hold of me; I collared him, and said I would give him in charge of the first police<lb></lb>man I met; this was opposite St. George's Hospital; he was taken to the station and locked up; I appeared next morning; three gentlemen gave him a character; he was then discharged, and I was put into the dock; he told the policeman I wanted to extort money; I never asked him for a penny.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did nothing of the kind—I have been married thirteen years, and am the father of eight children—anything of the kind would be abhorrent to my feelings—my wife is now living—he followed me to Park-lane, and said, "If you do not give me money, will you give me beer?"—I said, "I will give you in charge of the first policeman if you do not go away"—he said, "If that is the case I will have the first <hi rend="italic">pull"</hi>—I told the inspector at the station it was a false charge—I gave him my card and address—I have been a liveryman of London sixteen years—I made the statement at the station that I have here, and the inspector told me I could not have bail.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 55.) On the 29th of July, about half-past ten o'clock, I was on duty in Piccadilly between Hamilton-place and Park-lane, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor upwards of 200 yards from St. George's Hospital—it is more than 200 yards from that place to the watering place there—one of the <hi rend="italic">B</hi> division comes up to the watering place—they might walk from there to where I met them without meeting a policeman—they were both together, side by side, on the foot pavement—I was towards the houses—the prisoner was inside the pavement, and the prosecutor outside—the prisoner spoke first—he said, "I give this man in charge"—(pointing to the prosecutor)—I asked what for—he said, "For taking indecent liberties with me"—I asked where it took place—he said, "At the watering-place at Hyde<lb></lb>park-corner"—Mr. Daniel said, "It is a false charge; he demanded money of me; because I would not give him money he asked me for beer; and because I would not give him money or beer, he said he would give me in charge of the first policeman he met, for taking indecent liberties with him"—the prisoner heard all this—I do not recollect his saying anything else, till he got to the station—I went there with them both, and was present when the charge was made—I have not got the charge-sheet—I had never seen the prisoner before, to my knowledge—they both appeared excited—I did not observe whether one held the other by the collar as they came along—they appeared going along in the ordinary way—I should not have noticed them if the prisoner had not spoke—the prisoner was dressed as he is now—the prosecutor had a light tweed wrapper—the prosecutor was locked up all night—he had stated to the inspector what he did to me—the charge was first made by the prisoner—we could not tell which was true—the prisoner attended before the Magistrate next day, and presented himself to be sworn, but a constable in Court knew him, and several people gave Daniel a good character—nobody appeared to give the prisoner a character, or give any account of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was manager to James Reid, linen-draper, of Edgware-road, the prisoner was in his employ, he lived in the house—I left him there on 6th March, and went home to bed—at a little before twelve o'clock I was called to the shop—I went into the prisoner's bed-room, as we missed the street-door key—I found him in bed, intoxicated—his coat was lying on the bed—I saw a shawl and a piece of ribbon in his coat-pocket—next morning a policeman was sent for; the prisoner was still in bed with his clothes on, except his coat and slippers—I told him what had been found in his cost,</p>

               <p>he said he was innocent, and they must have been placed in his pocket for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—I found two shawls and four pieces of ribbon in his pockets—I had not made such a search the night before as to know whether there was one shawl or two in his pocket—Mr. Reid has since become bankrupt.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cashier to Mr. Reid. The prisoner was not quite sober on the night in question—he did not shut the shop—he went to bed—he generally takes care of the key—I wanted it, went up-stairs, and looked in his waistcoat-pocket—I could not see it there—he was in bed—his coat was on the bed—I felt in his coat-pocket—I saw a shawl and a piece of ribbon—I showed them to the female servant who was with me—I told one of the young ladies also—Mr. Bensley was sent for, and I went up with him—I only saw one shawl that night, and one piece of ribbon—the next morn<lb></lb>ing I went to the coat, and saw two shawls and four pieces of ribbon—the shawl that I saw the night before was in the same pocket with the four pieces of ribbon—the other shawl was in another pocket—I did not see that the night before, because I was rather frightened, and went down-stairs—Bensley told the prisoner where they were found—he said he knew nothing about them, they must have been put in for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—he is in the habit of being drunk—he was more drunk than usual that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this a great coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Mr. Reid was away at that time, and the shop was left in Bensley's care—there was not a great deal of confusion; all was going on straight—I was not having a bit of fun with the young ladies—they have not said that I have been impertinent to them—the prisoner beat me, and threw me down, and kicked me—it was not for being saucy—he wanted a bolt, and I could not find it—he said I had hid it—he was intoxicated almost every night—one night I and one of the other boys were going to frighten the servant, and we put some salt in a cheese-plate, with a drain of turpentine—we thought it would burn as well as spirits, but it would not burn—it was in a place called the dark hole, where all the boots were—I have never been told that I have been saucy to the young ladies—I never tried to frighten them—on this night the servant, two young ladies, and Miss Reid were in the house—I went up with the girl; I would not go up by myself.</p>

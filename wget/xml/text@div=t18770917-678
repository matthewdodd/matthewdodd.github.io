                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Gathorne Hardy, of 17, Grosvenor Crescent, and am a customer of Madame Elise, a milliner, of 170, Regent Street—on 23rd July I received this letter "21st July, 1877. Madam,—We beg to enclose your account, and as we have some heavy accounts to remit to the Continent on Monday next, we should feel much obliged to be favoured with an open cheque on account through our Mia Rowe, who will have the pleasure of waiting on you for that purpose on Monday next, at 11 a.m. Yours respectfully,—Elise, p.p. F.W." (<hi rend="italic">The paper was embossed</hi> 170, <hi rend="italic">"Regent Street," and the envelope bore the monogram "E"</hi>) A sum of money was due from me to Madame Elise—I received an account that morning, and I concluded from the note that it came in that envelope—I had requested Madame Elise to send in her account—a young woman called that morning at 11 o'clock when I was out, and in the afternoon, when I saw her—she said she had called for the account—I said I thought it very odd that Madame Elise should send her bill in to me so punctually—she said it was equally disagreeable for her to call, but that there was a pressure for money that morning and she had been all round the neighbourhood collecting bills—I could not find my keys and told her that if she would come in the evening I would have a cheque drawn and pay the bill, and she said she would call about 6.45—I have never seen her since—I subsequently went to Madame Elise and paid the cheque, when they said they had never sent, and I found out that it was a fraud—the girl who called on me was a common looking girl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been out of town previously to receiving the letter—my things were sent to the railway station and given up to me in my car<lb></lb>riage, and on my way to Grosvenor Crescent I read some of my letters—my memory does not serve me as to the account coming in the same envelope with the letter, but I thought it probable from reading the note.</p>

At the time this account was sent to Mrs. Gathorne Hardy 1 was book-keeper to Madame Elise—I made out an account amount<lb></lb>ing to about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I put in an envelope and addressed it to 17, Grosvenor Crescent, on 21st July, Saturday—the prisoner was in the employ of Madame Elise as assistant clerk and I asked him to see that the letters were posted on the day in question, and he said he would do so; that was about 5.10, I should think—the envelope produced is not my writing; it has the monogram on it used by Madame Elise—I never saw this letter until it was brought back to me, it is written on paper that bears the address where Madame Elise carries on business—I have no idea whose writing it is.</p>

Hardy for the account, or to ask for an open cheque—subsequently to Mrs. Hardy bringing me the letter a letter came to my premises addressed to the prisoner—our chief clerk brought it to me, and seeing the similarity of writing I opened it and read it—I subsequently re-sealed it and gave it to the chief clerk to give it to the prisoner—these fragments comprise the letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "As soon as you get this, meet me at once in Golden Square as I want to speak to you particularly you must come at once. F.") After the prisoner had received the letter I went to Golden Square where I saw a man and a young woman standing at the corner—the prisoner came up and spoke to them and remained in conversation about five minutes—I went up to the prisoner and asked him to come back to the office—I asked him to show me the letter he had just received and he said he had not got it, that he had torn it up and thrown it in the waste paper basket—I went to the basket and took out these fragments which I have pasted together—I asked him who the people were who he had met and he said the tall man was a friend of his father's, and the young woman he had no knowledge of—he could not give me their names or addresses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had a character with the prisoner, which has turned out to be fictitious—while in our employ he wrote letters to French houses for goods—he had access to the room where the safe was—I thoroughly trusted him—he would draw bills and get my acceptance to them—we originally advertised for a boy; the prisoner applied for the situation, we offered 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I mean to convey that the character was forged; it was in writing—I do not believe the person who wrote it ever employed him—he has not told me that he had not—some people who had employed him before called on us and showed us a character they had received with him—we cannot find the person from whom the character purported to come—when we came back from Golden Square I sent for a constable and asked the prisoner to give the name of the young person who spoke to him—I asked him why he had sent the letter and account to Mrs. Hardy, and he denied having done so—he made no attempt to escape but walked back with me.</p>

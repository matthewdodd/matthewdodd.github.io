Yes; I was certain I had seen him before; I asked him where he lived; he said he lived over the water; I asked him where he had been; he said he had been at his laundress's, she lived in Crown-court, Liquor-pond-street; I thought it looked singular, as he had a dirty shirt on, and no bundle; I went to enquire; he gave several references over the water, where he said he worked, but all false. On Monday, when he was examined, finding all that he had said was false, we sent him down for another examination, where he remained till Thursday; and on Thursday, not giving a good account of himself, he was sent on board the Tender, and between that and Saturday I found that he had returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090035"></xptr>from transportation; I applied to Mr. Leech for an order to fetch him from on board, and they gave him up.</p>

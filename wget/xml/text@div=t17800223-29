On the 7th of this month, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went down in the yard for a pail of water; I lodge up three pair of stairs; I stopped a little at the first pair of stairs; going up to my lodging I heard a noise up stairs, and I met the prisoner coming down. I asked her who she wanted; she said a mantua-maker. I asked her the mantua-maker's name; she said Mrs. Wood. I asked her what she wanted with Mrs. Wood; she said she had got a gown of her's. I said no such person lived in the house, nor in the neighbourhood, that I knew of; then she drew from under her cloak in her hand a dirty towel. I suspected it was mine; at the second look I found it was not mine. Seeing she had a great bundle in a checque apron, I asked her to let me look what she had got in her apron, she willingly let me, and I saw in her apron the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - No. She said she found them in the entry. They were in my drawer when I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether she did not say at the justice's that she took them up in the entry? - She dropped them when the constable came up, and they were upon the landing-place when he came up.</p>

               <p>I live up one pair of stairs in the same house with the prosecutor; Mrs. Fuller called somebody to come up stairs, and said she was robbed. I went up, and saw the prisoner upon her stairs, which are the third pair, near the bottom; she had something in her apron; it was quite full. I put my hand in her apron, and saw they were the prosecutrix's property; I knew them very well, because we had lived in the house many years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The things lay in the entry; Mrs. Fuller wanted me to put them up in my apron, and said if I did not take them up she could not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Did any thing of that sort pass? - Finch. No; not when I was there; she begged to be let go.</p>

               <p>My mistress sent me to ask at this place for one Mrs. Wood, a mantua-maker, to come and try a gown on she was making for her. Going up the second pair of stairs, I met Mrs. Fuller coming down with a pail of water; she asked me where I was going; I said up to the garret to ask for Mrs. Wood, she said no such person lived there. She said I had been to rob her place; she took up a gown and cloak, and said I had been to rob her. She wanted me to take the things; when I would not, she said she would do for me; she called up this woman, and then sent for her husband, who sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>Court. You did not know the person of Peter or Patrick at the time the notes were given? - I do not know that I should have known the brother, though I have seen him with the prisoner two or three times; I took the note to

            , he denied knowing any thing of it; he said he never had joined in any note with his brother. Peter lived in Drury-lane at No. 6; I went with Mr. Wilson to No. 120.</p>
               <p>Who lives there? - Mr. Hardy, I believe, kept the house. When the three notes became due, I heard accidentally that the prisoner lived in Dean-street, Soho; I went there three or four different times to seek for him; I met him one evening at the door, that was I believe in the month of February 1777; he asked me to go into the house with him, I did, it was a publick house, the Green-Man, I think, in Dean-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210035"></xptr> Soho. A good deal of conversation passed between us respecting these notes; I told him he had imposed a person upon Mr. Wilson who was not his brother; he for some time alledged that it was his brother who lived in Drury-lane who had signed the notes with him; I told him I was convinced it was not him, because I had presented a note to him, and he totally denied the fact; and that Mr. Wilson had likewise seen him, who said that was not the person that came and signed the notes; after some further discourse he told me that it was not his brother who lived in Drury-lane that had signed the notes.</p>
               <p>Were those the words that he said, that it was not his brother who lived in Drury-lane that had signed the notes? - I believe those are exactly the words; I asked him then who it was that he had brought that had signed the notes with him, and I said if I had been in the office he could not have imposed another person upon Mr. Wilson, for I should have known his brother; he said he knew that very well, and therefore he had watched the opportunity to see me out of the office. I asked him who the person was, and where he lived; he said he did not know who he was, for he had given him five shillings to come and sign the notes; and that he was then dead or gone to sea, and he could not tell where he was. We had some further discourse upon the impropriety of his conduct; I said he had behaved exceeding ill to Mr. Wilson, who had indulged him so far; he still persisted that he would not pay the money; I came away and he was arrested next morning.</p>

               <p>I had a warrant against the prisoner. I was at Hick's-hall, and he sent to me to come to him hearing I had a warrant against him.</p>
               <p>It was not a warrant for felony? - No. It was for a fraud.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him? - Yes. As we were going along in the coach, I said I have known you a good many years, and never knew that you had a brother Patrick; (for his name was mentioned in the warrant); he said, O yes, you knew Pat Murphy very well; who, said I, Pat that was sent to Dublin upon a charge for murther? yes, said he; why, said I, he is no brother of yours; yes, (said he) he was; I said I have heard him say that he did not belong to your family. I had heard him say that, having had him in custody several times, he humm'd and ha'd, thinking I might know something of the man, and then he said he was not his brother. He did not say that it was not his brother that signed the notes.</p>
               <p>Do you know what is become of that Murphy that went to Dublin? - I have been credibly informed, and believe it to be true, that he has been dead about a twelvemonth.</p>

               <p>Where did he live? - When I first knew him he lived at Islington, another time in Cock-lane; and about the town in different parts.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his ever living in Drury-lane? - No, never; I remember Peter, one of his brother's, he that lives in Drury-lane.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Court. Did he show you the note? - He pulled it out of his pocket, but I never looked at it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not the gentleman ask you whether you had signed a note? - He never asked me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you tell him you had not signed the note? - No, I told him that I knew nothing about it, I told him that my brother Patrick, and brother Daniel, and Singleton had been together to Haberdasher's-hall to give a note.</p>
               <p>Court. You told that to the gentleman, did you? - Yes, and that my brother Patrick was gone from my house; I was in a hurry backwards and forwards, minding my business during the dinner hour, and did not take much notice of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you asked whether your name was Patrick? - Yes, I said my name was Peter; I told him my brother Patrick was gone from my house,</p>

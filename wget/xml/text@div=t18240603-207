On the 21st of May, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner coming out of the passage leading to the stables - the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030074"></xptr>was only latched. I knew him as a tenant of my master's; his premises are at the back of my master's; but he had no business there - he had a right to pass the passage, but not to go into my master's back premises - when he came out he had a truss of hay on his shoulder. I followed him down the New Road, leading to Battle-bridge - he then turned down a place, and pitched the hay. I asked him what he was going to do it - he said he was going to take it to Russell-square, which is quite in a contrary direction. I asked him where he had got it - he said, it was sent him from over the water. I wanted him to bring it back to my master, which he refused to do - he wanted me to go with him and have something to drink, and hush the matter up, and say nothing about it. I told him that I believed it to be my master's hay. I went and examined the place, and there was a vacancy as if a truss of hay had been taken - it appeared to be the same hay, though we did not take it to compare it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner a lodger of your master's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he to go through a part of your premises - A. Yes; but he had no occasion to go through my master's stable or slaughter-house to go to his apartments - he had access to these premises, but had no business there. I went before the Magistrates and told the same tale there to the best of my recollection. I was not asked to swear to the hay - there is a great similarity in it; when the prisoner came out, I followed him two or there hundred yards - he was walking. I wanted to see where he went to - he pitched the hay, but did not sit down upon it - when I accosted him, he said he was going to take it to Russell-square, but he was going towards Battle-bridge; he said he had it from one Jeffries over the water.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he any business whatever in the passage - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Could I get into the kitchen without going through the passage - A. Yes; there was a way through your own room.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Tottenham-court-road - the prisoner rented a shop and parlour of a house of mine in Warren-street - there is a shop-door and a private passage - he has nothing to do with the passage whatever; in consequence of information I went to Warren-street, and found my man and the prisoner with the hay - he appeared much agitated or very drunk; I cannot say which. I said</p>
               <p>"Hickman, I am afraid you have been at this a long while, and other things as well." He said</p>
               <p>"No; I have not." I said,</p>
               <p>"It appears pretty clear, and I shall give you in charge." He said he had had it from a friend. I went to the stable and missed a truss of hay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he behind in his rent - A. I believe he was a week or two behind. I sent him word that if he did not pay better I must seize, and then he paid better.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you not seized his goods since he has been in custody, and turned his wife and seven children out - A. He owed me a bill of 4 l. besides for meat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man of the name of Jeffries came to my house, and I said I wanted a truss of hay for my children to sleep upon, and he sent one. I had it two or three months; my mistress had been confined, and had not an opportunity of making a mattress to put it in for the children to sleep upon - she then said she thought it would not do, and I was going to Russell-mews to sell it, when I was stopped by Sanders.</p>

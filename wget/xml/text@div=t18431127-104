I am the wife of William Hockley—he is coachman to Mr. Elliot M'Naughton, of Old Park-street, Paddington—the prisoner lived there some time since—I had two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes, which I got from Messrs. Hoare's banking-house—I kept them in a locked box on the drawers in my room over the stable, which joined Mr. M'Naughton's house—I kept the key of my box—I lost one of the notes on Tuesday, the 11th of July—about half-past eleven in the morning of the 10th of July, the prisoner came to the stable to see me—I asked her to go with me the next day, the 11th, to</p>

               <p>put a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note into the savings' bank—she was to have come at ten o'clock, and she came between ten and eleven—I had been to the box on the Monday morning before she came, and the notes were safe then—I went to my box, when she came on the Tuesday I found one note, but could not find the other—I had left the box locked—I saw the prisoner go into my room on the Monday—I was not with her—she used so often to come that I trusted her with any thing—I was in the loft—I kept the box in the room I slept in—I saw the prisoner go into the room—she staid there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I spoke to her about missing the note—she looked about, and said it was very odd it should be lost, and seemed surprised—she had seen me go to the box, and saw what I did—she saw me take money out frequently—I went to Messrs. Hoare's, and got the numbers of the notes on paper—I went to Titchbrook on the 15th of August, and saw the prisoner—I asked her to come to London, and she refused.</p>

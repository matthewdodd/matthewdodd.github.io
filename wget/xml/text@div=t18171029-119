I missed a shirt out of a bundle, but did not suspect her-next week I lost two more, and lost the gentleman's custom; the week after that I lost three wet shirts, and accused the prisoner with taking them; she fell on her knees and called God to witness that she was innocent and knew nothing of them; I told her if she had pledged them, to tell me where, as I should lose my bread, being a widow with three children - She still denied it. I lost a brother, which put me in great trouble-the prisoner left my lodgings that week - I could do nothing with her at that time, until he was buried. I then went to her lodgings, and begged of her, if she had taken them, to own it; she insulted me very much, and said she was innocent. I have had no work since; about a fortnight ago, I received information,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290041"></xptr>went to the pawnbroker's, and found one of my shirts; I had her taken up-five more have since been found at different pawnbrokers'.</p>

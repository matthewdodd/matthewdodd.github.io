                  </hi>. I am a wholesale and retail baker, of Holborn-hill. The prisoner came into my service on 29th August—it was his duty to deliver bread to my customers, and receive money—he kept a book in which it was his duty to enter the bread he delivered, with the amount paid to him, and to pay the balance the same night to me, or to Emma Clapp, my shopwoman—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his book—he enters in it, on 13th Jan., eight quarterns of bread delivered, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received for it, of Maslin, of Gilbert-street, Oxford-street; that is all he has accounted for—on 21st Jan. he has entered 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received of Maslin for seventeen loaves, which has been altered to fifteen in the prisoner's writing, and the amount is altered to 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. we take it to be, but there is a blot over it—he paid over 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but not to me—there are two persons on Saturday to book the bread; I book it, and the young person in the shop books the money—seventeen loaves would come to 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., fifteen would come to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; no number would make it 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; sixteen would make it 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my charge is, that he has failed to account for 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the price of the bread was 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;—on the 23rd he accounts for nine loaves, sold to Maslin for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that would be right—he had a week's notice to leave, and at the time he left, I said, "Robert, there is a mistake in Mr. Walker's bill;" he went through the books, and found no entry of it—we then went through Mr. Walker's book, and found errors amounting to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was then given into cus<lb></lb>tody, and I had in Mr. Maslin's book, and found more mistakes—nothing was said between me and the prisoner about these three mistakes.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This matter of Walker's has been explained, has it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but Mr. Bell said that four quarterns of the flour were bought of him—the prisoner had to deliver about 340 loaves daily, and the entries have to be made at the place where they are delivered—he is charged with a certain number when he goes out—it is his duty, when he comes home, to bring money, or loaves, or account for them; but I have been so unwell, and had so much trouble to get him up to book, that the rules have not been complied with—he has gone and left it for a day or two before we have been able to balance—if we have discovered a mistake, we do not deduct it from the salary at the end of the week.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you charge him with the number of loaves he takes every time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We do—if at the end of the week we find a mistake of 500, and look at the book, and find it out, he is not charged—we have had so much trouble to get him up, and I have had such bad health, that I left it to the young person in the shop to complete the booking, and she is not authorised to balance accounts, with the exception of the boy's—he was to pay over the balance either to me or Emma Clapp, but she do not balance the accounts—all we say to our men is this, "Keep your customers as near even as possible"—we do not want customers to have ten quarterns one day, and fifteen on another—upon an average they do not insist on having more one day than another—we never allowance them to two or three quarterns, when it is five or fifteen; it is when we serve sixty or eighty shops—it is a common occurrence for the customers to say they have not</p>

                  </hi>. In January last I was in the service of Mr. Nevill. I never settled up the accounts; it was always left to Mr. Nevill to examine—he sometimes accounted to me for the number of loaves he delivered, and the quantity of money he received—I do not recollect anything particular about 13th Jan.—this book is kept by the prisoner—the other is the one kept by Mr. Nevill and me—I have an entry I made in my own book on 13th Jan. of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he accounted to me for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that day—that was the sum I received from him—he accounted on 21st Jan. for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at one time, and 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. after that—13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the sum he accounted for on 21st—on the 23rd he paid me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman. In the month of Jan. I was a customer of Nevill's—the prisoner was the person delivering the bread to me—I kept a book between me and the prisoner, for him to sign the book every day as he left it—on 13th Jan. I took ten quartern loaves, for which I paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 21st I took seventeen quartern loaves, and paid him 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is his signature; he signed it in my presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not always pay ready money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I have since 3rd Jan.—I owed something to Mr. Nevill for bread received, I believe, through a former servant—I am not quite positive without referring to the books (<hi rend="italic">a book was here handed to Mr. Payne</hi>)—the prisoner wrote on page 23, "10, paid me 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is an alteration in the 21st from 18 to 17; that was done in my presence.</p>

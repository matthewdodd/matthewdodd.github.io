I left some pots just by the rail, and I came and enquired if the lad of another house had took them. I saw the prisoner at the bar look first at one door, and then at another; I saw the prisoner at the bar take a pot, and throw his handkerchief over it; I asked him what he was going to do with it, he said he was going to get milk in it; I said I'd tell him about milk; I then laid hold of him, and took the pot from him, and a quart pot from under his coat; and there was another pot taken out of his pocket. I got assistance, and he was taken to Lichfield-street, and committed.</p>

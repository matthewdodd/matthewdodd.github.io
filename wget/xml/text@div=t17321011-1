On the 23d of September, between 7 and 8 at Night, I took the Prisoner with this Stick of Logwood in his Hand. I call'd for Help, and some of the Porters belonging to the Keys came to my Assistance. A Constable was call'd, and the Prisoner was carried to the Roundhouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I carrying the Logwood off, or only standing by the Pile?</p>
               <p>Cox. He was standing by the Pile, and his Knot was lying on his Foot. I had miss'd Logwood twice before, and therefore I had rectified the Pile, and taken Notice how the Sticks Lay, so that I can be sure that the Stick the Prisoner had in his Hand was taken off the top of the Pile.</p>
               <p>I had been with a Load from Stocks-Market to Tower-Wharf, and coming back over the Keys, I stopt at the Pile of Logwood to make Water. One of the Sticks fell against me, upon which I took it up to put it in its Place again, and while I had it in my Hand, Cox came and charged me with stealing it.

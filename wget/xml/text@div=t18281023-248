            . I received 9s. in shillings and sixpences from Mrs. Seaward on the 2d of October; I was not aware that it was marked; I was sent for nine yards of linen, at 1s. a yard - the prisoner served me; I paid him the same money as I received from Mrs. Seward about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. AUSTEN. I was not at home when this took place; I waited at the witness' house, and went home immediately; I then sent the prisoner out to get sovereigns for silver which I took out of my cash-box; when he was gone I looked into the till and found 7s. of the marked money, and about 2s. or 3s. of other money, or possibly not that; I sent for an officer on the prisoner's return, and said in his presence that I wished to have him searched, and wished to know whether he had any silver in his pocket like this, shewing a private mark on a shilling; 2s. of the marked money was found on him; his box was searched in his presence - he said it was his; two pairs of white stockings, two pairs of half-stockings, and one pair of silk stockings, were found, which I believe to be mine; they had all been worn except the half-hose - the three pair of stockings had S, the maker's mark on them, but no mark of my own; he had one pair on which I found the same mark on; I said if he came down stairs I thought I should be able to produce papers of the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you a lad named Nash in your service? A. Yes; I do not know of the prisoner lending him 2s.; the prisoner told the Magistrate, if my apprentice was there he could state that he had lent him 2s.; I said he should come, and fetched him; all manufacturers mark their stockings; I missed one pair out of one paper.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Austen. The prisoner was in his service - he lent me two shillings on Mr. Austen's account, not for myself, and it was understood he was to pay himself; he never told me he had taken it out of the till.</p>

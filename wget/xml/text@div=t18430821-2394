                  </hi>. I was at the Duke of Clarence public-house, on the 7th of August—I put a half-crown on the bar—the prisoner came and asked for a short pipe—he put his hand on my half-crown—I did not say any thing, as I thought it was a joke—he then went into the tap-room, and came out to the bar—I asked him for the half-crown—he abused me, and said he never had it—he was taken and searched, but nothing was found.</p>

               <p>Q. Could not the ring come off by shaking of hands? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it too big? - A. It was full big, but done round with silk to make it hold tight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive it going? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel the twist to get it off? - A. Yes, I am positive, and a very great one.</p>

             sworn. - I am a weaver, and was passing Valentine, who lives next door but one to me, on the night of the 27th of September; he called out stop thief; I said, have you been robbed; he said, yes, but I saw no other person; he asked me to go in pursuit of the prisoner; I did, and we went to the prisoner's lodging in Webb-square, but did not find him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The place where the prosecutor called is kept by two girls of the town; I lived there then, and he asked me to fetch the pot of beer, which I did and two others, and half a pint of gin; they then asked me to drink along with them at a gin-shop; I did so, and he was flashing his gold ring, a guinea, and a seven-shilling piece to the girls; I never saw it after; one of the girls went back, and the other went to the Golden Key with the prosecutor and me; we walked on till we came to the Green Gate, where he began to dance with a parcel of men and women who sold fish; they would not let him have any liquor there; he was so drunk, when we went out he tumbled down, and had liked to have pulled me down; when I helped him up he missed his ring, and said I must have taken it; I said if he thought I had, I would go back and look where he was dancing; I asked him to take his fish; he refused them, and I dropped them down, saying I would not carry them any farther.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Valentine.) What is the name of your acquaintance? - A. Greenwood, a carver and gilder, whom I have known twenty years; I understand the woman the prisoner lived with is a girl of the town, and she was not part of the company.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there three pots of beer? - A. No, nor did I go into any gin-shop, or make any display of my money or ring, any further than it was on my finger. <rs id="t18021027-70-verdict386" type="verdictDescription">

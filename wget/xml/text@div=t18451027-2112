                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop—the prisoner was in my service—if he received any money he ought to pay it to me when he received it—if he received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 19th of Aug., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., part of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the 24th of Sept., he has not paid me either of those sums.</p>

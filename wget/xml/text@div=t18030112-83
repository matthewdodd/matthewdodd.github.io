               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing on the 6th of December last? - A. About five or six o'clock, in the evening, I lost a diamond ring, and several articles of value, to the amount of about 25l. in all.</p>
               <p>Q. What wre the other articles? - A. Two gold rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they placed? - A. In a tray in the shop window for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that place secured? - A. It lay in the window loose with others. The glass was before it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these panes of glass last? - A. In the course of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How late? - A.Perhaps withing an hour before the circumstance happened.</p>
               <p>Q. They then were all secure? - A. Yes; I was at tea in the parlour, when I was alarmed by a noise in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a noise? - A. My young man's jumping across the counter made a noise; he was endeavouring to open the shop door, and on my going up to him I found it was tied. We succeeded, after some difficulty, in getting it open. The violence of our pulling had loosened the cord a little, so that we could get a hand out. On examining the cord I found it was tied to the railing of the area and to the handle of the door. I suspected the window ws broke, and found it was so, and several things were missing; a mob was collecting round the door, so that I found it necessary to shut up the shop for the evening. I went out and returned about ten o'clock in the evening, when I saw the rings, which were brought to me by the officer.</p>
               <p>JOHN BACON swon. - Q. What are you? - A. I am shopman to Mr. Rogers.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this robbery? - A. I was standing, between five and six o'clock in the evening, in the shop, and heard a noise, and saw a man's hand in the window.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of noise was it? - A. The crashing of glass. I saw him taking the rings, and immeiately jumped over the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing else besides the ring? - A. Not to my knowledge. I proceeded to the door to open it, and found it fast, till such time as Mr. Rogers came up, and we got it open. I observed the cord, but cannot exactly say in what situation it was on the door. I went out and assisted in putting up the shutters, but know nothing more.</p>

             sworn. - What are you? - A. One of the patrol belonging to the Office in Bow-street. On Saturday evening, the 4th of December, I was standing with my brother officers opposite Dyot-street, St. Giles's, when we heard a great noise.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of noise? - A.There was a mob collected; we went up and saw the prisoner in the coustody of a watchman, named Kelly; there was a great scuffle between the prisoner and the watchman, but we got the prisoner to the watch-house. On searching him, in his fob pocket I found those two rings (producing them) wrapped up in this bit of paper, which I have kept ever since; the prisoner was very obstreperous indeed; we had the hardest matter in the world to get him to the watch-house. I then went to Mr. Rogers and shewed him the rings which he owned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time did you take me? - A. Between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>ROGER KELLY sworn. - Q.What are You? - A. A watchman. Between eight and nine o'clock as I was walking about my beat in St. Giles, a boy was sent after me by Mr. March, a salesman and goldsmith. I went to him and he gave me and prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it - in High-street, St. Giles's?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120052"></xptr>- A. Yes. I laid hold of the prisoner, who asked me what I meant to do with him. I told him that by the account Mr. March gave me I would take him to the watch-house, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with the patrol then? - A. No; the prisoner was very desperate, and said he would not go along with me. I made an attmept to spring my rattle, and he laid hold of it; then I called Hogan, my brother watchman, who came up, and we took him with great difficulty. Going along he made several grabs at his pocket, as if to take something out; I made a grab to prevent him, and every grab I made he gave me a rap on the head for it. I was afraid it was a knife he was going to draw. Going along I met some Bow-street officers, and was very gald to see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver him up to them? - A. No, I stuck to him as well as they did; he was very resolute. When he was searched I saw them take the rings out; I was nearly out of breath with him.</p>
               <p>What pocket was it? - A. I think the right hand fob pocket.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER JONES sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. A conductor of the patrol of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you know of this? - A. I was along with Crocker, and saw the prisoner searched and the rings found.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LIMBRICK sworn. - I am one of the patrol, and was present in the watch-house when Crocker took the two rings out of the prisoner's pocket.(The rings produed and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was going up High-street, St. Giles's, I picked up the rings and went to a shop, where there was a light, to look what they were; I put them in my pocket, and the watchman immediatley came up and began to beat me with a stick without my knowing what it was for <rs id="t18030112-83-verdict458" type="verdictDescription">

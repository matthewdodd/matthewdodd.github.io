I am in the service of the last witness—on Monday, 9th March, two men came to the house; one of them was the prisoner—they said they came to look for furnished lodgings—the other man carried a black bag—they were about ten minutes looking through the apartments—I had seen this watch safe that day in the room I slept in—I showed them that room, because that was the sleeping room—I had also seen two gold watches in Miss Humphrey's room, and a gold ring—I missed this watch about five minutes' after the prisoner and the other man had inspected the lodgings—I did not observe whether the bag was empty or not—the other man stayed below—I thought he was going to follow me up, but he stayed behind—the prisoner went into my room, and the other went into my mistress's room, where the other two watches were.</p>

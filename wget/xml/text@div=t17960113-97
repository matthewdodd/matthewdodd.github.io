               <p>I am a shopman to Mr. Fuller, a hardwareman, at Smithfield-bars: On the 24th of December, between nine and ten in the evening, the prisoner came into our shop and pointed to the window; I thought he wanted some buckles, I shewed him some, and he shook his head; he then pointed up higher to the watches, and I took down three or four watches and shewed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. No, I never saw him before; he opened some of the watches and then pointed to some more, and while I was turning about to get another, he ran away with a silver one; I ran under the counter as fast as I could, and cried out stop thief; I ran across Smithfield, and just before I came up to him, he chucked it down as hard as he could; it was a moonlight night, and I was very near him, and somebody picked it up, I don't know who, and gave it to me; I did not stop to pick it up, because I was determined to catch him; here is a mark in it where he threw it down; I delivered him to the constable, and he was taken before a Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Binks, a stationer, of 85, Aldersgate-street. On 27th March the prisoner came for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—I do not sell it, and he said a cigar would do—I gave him one; it came to 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid me with a bad shilling—I gave him 10 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—after he left, I discovered the shilling was bad—I put it in the till—there was no other shilling there—in half an hour another man came in, and I then tried the shilling with the detector, and it bent—it was the same shilling the prisoner gave me—there was no other in the till—I laid it in the back compartment of the till, and told my daughter it should lie there for a warning—on 3rd April the prisoner came again—my daughter was in the shop—I recognised him immediately he came in, and I went and fastened the shop door—my daughter served him with half a quire of writing paper, and he gave her a half-crown—she rang it, and looked at it, and was about to give him change, but she tried it with the detector, and found it was bad—she laid it on the counter—the prisoner said, "There is your paper," and he took up the half-crown—I snatched it out of his hand, sent for an officer, and gave him into custody, with the shilling and half-crown.</p>

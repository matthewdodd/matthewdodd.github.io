The prisoner came to my shop on the 7th of September, at a little before eight o'clock in the morning - I was called down - he asked to see some mourning rings; I showed him a tray, and observed that he took up two, and returned but one to the tray - he said we had none to fit him, and was going out; I told him he had stolen a ring; I closed the door, and sent for a constable - he had then had the ring in his possession about five minutes - he was searched - his coat and waistcoat were taken off, and I saw a ring between his fingers, which I supposed to be mine, but it was not; we then ceased searching him - he was taken to the Compter; I swore to the ring before the Magistrate - it was a fac-simile of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any ring? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. And yet you swore to this? A. Yes - I believed it was mine then, but now know it was not; I told the Grand Jury so, and am surprised they have found the bill.</p>

On the 30th of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was standing about five yards from the door, looking towards it, and saw the prisoner come up and take a cap from inside the shopdoor - he reached it without coming in; I ran out, and overtook him about seven yards from the door - he had not got it then; I saw a man running away, about ten yards from him, but had not seen any body in his company - the cap has not been found; I am quite positive I saw the prisoner take it - our shop front is rather dark, and the man might be secreted - I had seen the cap shortly before.</p>

There was a young man before me- I saw him snatch the cap and run away, and as I walked by the door, the gentleman flew out, laid hold of me, and said, "Have you taken a cap?" I said, No; he let go of me, and ran after the other as far as the grocer's, then returned, and said I took it.</p>

            . I let go of him to pursue the man - I ran about two yards, and then returned, as I thought I should not secure the other man - I returned and took the prisoner, who was then going towards Skinner-street, but before he was going towards Field-lane, which way the man was going; I am certain I saw him take the cap.</p>

             sworn. - I am the brother of the last witness; I am his journeyman; I came into the shop a little before two o'clock, on Monday the 13th of December; the prisoner said, he was going to get half a pint of beer; soon after that one of the smiths came in, and I went after the prisoner to see whether he went for beer or not; I followed him through several alleys into Petticoat-lane, and saw him go into the prisoner, Robinson's shop; then I left him, and went back, and told my master he had a thief about him; the prisoner came in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and my master asked him what he did in the shop in Petticoat-lane; he told him he had not been in any shop; I then went with the prisoner to the shop, to fetch the iron away: the prisoner, Robinson, was in the shop; I told her I had come for the iron this man had been selling; I said it was my master's property, and she said, there it is; it laid upon the floor; the prisoner brought it back in his apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You talk about Mrs. Robinson's shop, do you not know it is Mr. Croker's shop? - A. I don't know that it is; I saw her there.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name over the door? - A. I never looked; she paid the prisoner for the iron.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see that? - A. No; but I desired him to give her the money back, and he gave her seventeen pence halfpenny; I think she said it weighed seventeen pounds and a half, it was new hand railing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it all new? - A. No, not all; when I went to her, she said, he was the man that she bought the iron of, and she did not know it was stolen; he scrupled it's weighing seventeen pounds and a half, and she said, if you don't like my scales and weights, I will get some others.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner carried the iron home himself? - A. Yes, and I came home with him, and when I weighed it, it weighed twenty-two pounds within a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is one penny a pound a fair full price for it? - A. I cannot tell the value.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Was the iron that was brought back your iron? - A. Yes, I know two or three of the pieces to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. It is worth more than one penny a pound? - A. Yes, it is worth one penny halfpenny, at least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know Mr. Croker is the master of the house? - A. I do not know, the prisoner called herself Mrs. Croker, at that time, we found him up stairs in bed; she afterwards said, before the Lord-Mayor, that she was not married to him, and that her name was Robinson.</p>
               <p>WOLFE SOLOMON sworn. - I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe you know Mr. Croker is the master of this house? - A. Yes, he is ill in bed, his name is in the parish-books for that house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mercer's defence. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Robinson left her defence to her Counsel, and called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

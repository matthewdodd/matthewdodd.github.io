               <p>Owen. After he was pardoned to be transported for life, there was another pardon made out for him, to serve in the West-Indies as a soldier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was placed upon the island of Martinique, having three hundred and upwards of emigrants there; I was afterwards pressed by the Grampus's boat's crew, and brought to England; we arrived on the 27th of July, and laid at Spithead for the space of a month, when an order came from the Admiralty for the ship to be paid off; the ship's crew was made over to the Ardent, and we sailed with Admiral Duncan to the North Seas.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you in possession of this pardon; it is now alledged there was a subsequent pardon, on condition of your serving in the army?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing but what the Sheriff produced and read before us, that we were pardoned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. I have the pardon; I sent the prisoner, with forty-two more, down to Southampton.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prisoner.) This subsequent pardon was, that in case you served in a regiment abroad, transportation for life should be removed: Now, it is necessary for you to give evidence, that you complied with that subsequent pardon, and that you were compelled to come to this country by some force which you could not resist; unless you can establish those facts I have mentioned, the original sentence upon the first part remains, you have not got the benefit of the other, unless you can prove you were brought here by force.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is an officer that can testify I was pressed from the place where I was destined.</p>

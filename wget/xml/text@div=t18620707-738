               <p>said that his wife had come on the previous Wednesday, saying that he was not able to attend, he had been prevented by business, and in consequence of that I entered it into a book of "sums allowed without notice," and authorized the clerk to write off 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave the book to Mr. Ham—shortly afterwards Mr. Biggs brought me the receipt in the signature-book—I compared the signatures and said to the prisoner, "Are you the depo<lb></lb>sitor?"—he said "No," but that the depositor was very busy and had authorized him to come and withdraw the money—the woman then stepped forward and said, "It is all right," and produced a marriage certificate—I knew that it was Mrs. Dillett, the depositor's wife—the prisoner was then given in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Edward-street, York-road, and am a depositor in the Provident Institution Savings Bank—this is my deposit-book—I signed one of the books of the Institution when I deposited the money—I did not authorize the prisoner to receive any money for me; I never saw him before—I never gave any authority to my wife to draw out the money—I never told anybody to say that I was too busy to attend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On or about 12th June, I became acquainted with a lady, whose name not having been mentioned it is scarcely worth while to bring forward, more especially as I do not know whether she is a party to the deception practised upon me; she, in a few days, introduced me to Mrs. Dillett, and I met her once or twice. Mrs. Dillett afterwards came to my place of business in a great hurry, and asked me if I had any objections to go to her husband's deposit bank and sign his name, and she gave me his book which she had had given to her for the express purpose of my copying it. She said he wanted the money so particularly and could not leave, and did not mind giving anybody a sovereign for it. I said that I could not think of taking a recompense for it, and I started off without any intention of going to the bank, but I led her to believe I had been, and when I returned, I gave her to understand that the bank had closed, and advised her to give me a written order to receive the money. I thought the matter had dropped; when, on the 26th June, I received a letter from the friend I have mentioned, in which she stated that Mrs. Dillett would be at St. Martin's Church at 2 o'clock; I went and waited for her till a quarter-past 2; she said that she had been waiting for a signal from her husband whether he could attend, that she could see his place of business from there, and that he appeared and gave her a negative signal, and would I sign her husband's name. I said I had no proof that she was the wife of Jonas Dillett, she produced her marriage certificate, and I accompanied her to the bank and signed the receipt. To prove that there was no premeditated act of forgery, I signed the surname incorrectly. I was not asked the question whether I was Jonas Dillett till after I had signed the receipt, when I said that I was not, and immediately despatched Mrs. Dillett, believing that her husband would appear and extricate me, and even if I had received the money I should have placed it all in her hands. It will be suspected that there was an improper intimacy subsisting between Mrs. Dillett and myself, such, however, was not the case, nor anything approaching the case, so that I had no inducement to act as I did. This it a truthful statement, and I trust, when you come to look at all the circumstances, you will believe that, how<lb></lb>ever foolishly I may have acted, I was not intending to defraud either Jonas Dillett or the Provident Institution.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live at Hammersmith. On the 6th of July, I was at the Nag's Head, in King-street, Hammersmith, near eleven o'clock in the morning, playing at skittles with some others—there were six persons—the prisoner was one—the other persons went away—the prisoner remained—he said he had lost all his money at skittles, but he had something about him that could make money, and he would show it to me if I would not tell—I said I would not tell—he produced a piece of dirty rag from his left hand trowsers pocket, containing a plaster of Paris mould—he took it apart, and opened it, and showed it to me—it was in two parts—I observed the Queen's Head on one side, and the words, "One shilling" on the other—the same as a shilling—I said it was a curiosity, I had never seen such a thing before in my life—he said he had paid a sovereign for the mak<lb></lb>ing of it, or learning to make it, and he could make 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week by it—as he was rolling up the mould, he said he could buy as many shillings as he liked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece—I walked out of the public-house, and gave inform<lb></lb>ation to a policeman directly, but he did not take him—I continued to watch the Nag's Head—I afterwards saw the prisoner come out, and gave him in charge to Sullivan—I saw the prisoner with his hand in his left trowsers</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint—this is a plaster of Paris mould, and bears the impression of the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling of the present reign, and appears intended to cast counter<lb></lb>feit shillings—it does not appear to have been used—it requires a very trifling alteration, which would not take a minute to do—the channel wants less than the sixteenth part of an inch cut away, to communicate with the impression.</p>

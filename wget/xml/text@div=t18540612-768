                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Duke of Lancaster's own militia, which is permanently embodied. On 13th May, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was trying to get into the station at Woolwich—there was a great crowd—it was shortly after the launch of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Albert</hi>—I had a gold watch in my left hand waistcoat pocket, fastened by a bar at the end of a chain to a button hole in my waistcoat—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I felt a pull at the chain, put down my hand, and caught the hand of the prisoner, within two or three inches of my side—I saw his hand doubled, and when I seized it he let go my watch, which dropped into my hand—the chain dropped at my side—it was separated from the watch then, but they had been together—I know the watch was safe the minute before I felt it pulled out of my pocket—I just looked at the watch, and passed it to the inspector—the loop of the watch was broken or cut asunder, so that it quite dropped from the chain—it cost between seventy and ninety guineas.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Three Goafs Head, Wandsworth-read. On Wednesday night, 22nd Dec., I went to bed about half-past 12 o'clock—I saw the house closed up safe; the window adjoining the garden was fastened with a regular sash fastening, and an additional thumb-screw by the side—I was not disturbed in the night,. I got up about 5 o'clock in the morning, and found the till open—I found everything secure but the back parlour, the window of which had been broken, and the sash pulled to the top—there were dirty marks under the window, which were not there before, and I observed footmarks in the garden or yard—there had been taken from the till 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, two sixpences, and a quantity of farthings—I afterwards saw the constable place a boot alongside the footmarks, and it corresponded; one boot was worn very much on one side, and it pressed in on one side very much, and very slightly touched the other—there was no bole in the boot I saw.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On 25th Dec. I apprehended the prisoner in a yard at the back of the Southampton Arms—I took these boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him, and compared them with some marks which I discovered—they corresponded—here is only one large nail in the heel of this boot, and that I found in the impression in the garden; here is a hole through the sole at the toe, and there was a print where that hole was—I have not seen the prisoner latterly at the Goat's Head—I found nothing on him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is strange that he was thirty or forty hours before he took my boots away. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I took him on the 25th, at 5 o'clock in the morning, and compared his boots with the footmarks on Sunday, the 26th—I did not take his boots off at once, as J did not know that there were any footmarks then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> There is a wall, which has been knocked down lately, and there was free admission from three or four bouses for people to run all over the yard; if he had had any suspicion against me, why should not he have taken me and made me tread in the same footmark; there is only his hare word against me.</p>

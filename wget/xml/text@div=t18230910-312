On the 11th of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came in and had three pennyworth of oysters. Sullivan came first, and said, wait until my sister comes; and then Donovan came in, and they eat the oysters between them, and left the shop together. They returned in a quarter of an hour, and when they were gone I missed a gown-piece of five yards and a quarter of printed cotton out of a band-box on the counter. I had not left the shop. They were behind me, and so was the cotton. They examined the gown whilst they were in the shop, and said they liked it very much. I pursued them directly. I had put it in the box again. Nobody but them were there till I missed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Another woman was in the shop - A. No; one came in after they were gone, and asked to see it. I looked, and it was gone. I had drank three glasses of gin and part of a pot of beer, but knew what I was about, and drank with the prisoners in the shop. When they were taken, they acknowledged to taking it and pawning it. They said for God's sake be merciful to us - we will never do such a thing again - we did it out of a lark, and said they had torn the duplicate up.</p>
               <p>W - B - TOMLINSON. I am a pawnbroker in of Lower Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square. On the 11th of September, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came and pawned this cotton. They said they gave 2 s. 6 d. for it. Price was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe many people buy goods at tally-shops and pawn them - A. Yes.</p>

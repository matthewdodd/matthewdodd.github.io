                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 110 <hi rend="italic">N</hi>). On 22nd March, about four o'clock, I was on duty in the Hackney Road, and saw two men running down the street—I saw the prisoner come out of No. 29—I followed him and took him in custody—I asked him what he had been doing, and where he came from—I heard shouts of robbery, knocked at the door of No. 29, and found there had been a robbery by three men—I told the prisoner I should take him to the station—on the way he struck me several blows on the head with a piece of iron ten inches long—I became senseless and he escaped, but was apprehended by another constable and brought to the station—I am sure he is the man; the instrument was not found—here is my helmet where he cut it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). I was on duty in the Hackney Road, and saw the prisoner running; I stopped him and asked him what he was running for—he said that he had had a few words with his wife, gave her a smack, and had to run away—I had a struggle with him, he got away once, and I took him again—I found on him a screw driver, four keys, some matches, and two coats, which were identified—the house No. 29 had been opened by the outer door, on which I found marks of a screw driver.</p>

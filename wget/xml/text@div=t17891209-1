               <p>I was robbed on the 5th of July last, on the highway; I left Lincoln's-inn a little before eleven o'clock; I was going into the north; there was another gentleman with me in a post chaise; it was a very rainy morning; nothing particular happened till we got to <placeName id="t17891209-1-crimeloc4">Finchley Common</placeName>

I said something to him, that I was surprised at such a thing happening at that time of day; he immediately said, no talk, your purse I immediately gave him my purse, in which there were six guineas in gold, and some silver; I cannot say exactly the quantity; but I remember there was six guineas in gold, and some silver; as soon as he had my purse, he said, your watches gentlemen, your watches; the other man had taken my companion's watch; I told him I had no watch; he said, no watch! and I said, no, I never travel with a watch? and he said, pho, pho, I know who you are very well; I know you do travel with a watch, give it me; I thought before I denied having a watch any more, that I would look down, to see if it was visible; and I looked down, and saw the seals hanging on my thigh; then I said, if you know so much about the matter, you must have the watch; and I gave him my watch; there were four seals, three cornelian, and one white chrystal set in gold; then he said, now Sir, your rings; and I said, rings, Sir, we have no rings; he seemed to be satisfied with that; he said, your pocket books; he said, you must have pocket books; and I pulled out a red morocco tweezer case, and said, you; surely will not take it? and he said, no; and I was going to put it back; and he said, yes, I will take it too, and there was an imperial farthing in the tweezer case, a pen knife, and a pair of scissars; I mentioned that in my examination at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, and tell the gentlemen of the jury whether you can swear positively that he was the person that committed this robbery? - I do verily believe the prisoner to be the man that committed the robbery; I had seen him before, and I was very much struck with the circumstance of his saying, that he knew me; and when he was gone I began to recollect what highwayman it was likely I should know; and seeing the prisoner at York, which I once or twice had the pleasure of doing; I said to the gentleman that was with me, if I was not sure that

             was out of the kingdom, I should be sure it was him; I knew that considerable pains had been taken by myself, and others to get him out of the kingdom; I did at that time think he was abroad: I had some reason to think it; I have mentioned to you, that while he was arguing with me about my watch, he held the pistol to my head, and I said, Sir, we are totally unarmed, and can make no defence, therefore I should be obliged to you to point the pistol another way; upon which he turned his horse a little, and either by accident or the wind, the crape flew up, and I saw the lower part of his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090004"></xptr>face very distinctly, about as far as his nose; I saw across his face, and I saw the lower part of his face very distinctly.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot positively say the prisoner was the person? - Whatever strong belief I might have in my own mind, as I did not see his face, I certainly would only chuse to say what I have said, that I do believe him to be the man, but I did not see his face; he has a pretty strong Irish brogue, as you will hear, if you hear him speak.</p>
               <p>You had some knowledge of the prisoner before? - Yes, my lord, he was at York some time, and during one summer assize, I saw him repeatedly at Mr. Sinclair's house, that was four or five years ago; he lived at Mr. Sinclair's house then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Heywood, I am very glad that in the latter part of your examination, a circumstance has come out, as it explains what you said of knowing the prisoner at York, because, when Barristers talk of knowing a prisoner at York, it makes impressions; I believe when you knew him, it was in the character of a gentleman visiting at a very respectable house in the country of York? - Certainly, it was, and very respectably he behaved; I thought him a very agreeable young gentleman; I know he was introduced by a very respectable gentleman; I believe he is of an excessive good family in Ireland.</p>
               <p>You have given your evidence, as all of us, who know you, expected you would, with great candour and fairness; is not the appearance of the prisoner exceedingly altered from that which you remember to have seen of him at York? - Yes, he is grown much larger and stouter.</p>
               <p>But the opinion you took up was from the circumstance of having known him before? - Yes, and which circumstance, I am told, made a much greater impression upon me than it should; for I am told it is a very common thing for them to say that they know people: I never saw him since the robbery, till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Heywood, I must ask you a question, which we frequently ask witnesses, to discredit their testimony; you will do me the justice to believe that I do not ask it you with that intention; soon after the robbery did you meet nobody on the common that you might have communicated this to? - I had the pleasure to meet you, Sir, on the common soon after.</p>
               <p>And very kindly let me go on to be robbed, I believe? - I had no idea that you would be robbed.</p>
               <p>I had the good fortune to escape your kind wishes? - I dare say you had; I do not think you was in any danger of being robbed.</p>
               <p>Court. Would the prisoner say any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. No, my lord, I would not advise him to say any thing on this occasion.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. No.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 272.) At a quarter to 4 o'clock, on the morning of 17th Feb., I heard a noise in Christopher-court, St. Martin's-le-Grand—I listened, and heard some more noise—I went in the court and watched, and saw the prisoner come from No. 5, Christopher-court, on to the top of another house—I asked him what business he had there—he made no answer—I saw him go in at a window there—I went into the house—I looked out of a window and saw 85lbs. of lead on the roof of a coach-house—I examined the house, and when I was at the top of the house I heard a noise in the prisoner's room—I found some lead had been removed from No. 8, Four Dove-court—there is a communication from that house to the house where the prisoner was—I told the prisoner to let me into the room—he would not, and I burst the door in—I found the prisoner on the bed with his trowsers and shirt on, and as black as a sweep, as I was myself after I had searched the house—I took the prisoner into custody—I compared the lead I found with the place where the lead had been removed from; it exactly corresponded with the place it was taken from—I know the prisoner lived at the house I found him in No. 5—I found this old knife in his coat-pocket.</p>

I went into the prisoner's house—I went to the third floor—the door had been burst open; I went in, and saw the prisoner lying on the bed—I told him to rise; he made no answer—I took hold of him, and pulled him up—he had his trowsers on—I do not know whether he had his waistcoat on—before I went in the room, I heard something fall very heavy at the back of the premises, No. 8—I went to the spot, and found this lead; I took it to the station—I found this knife in the window in the prisoner's room—I looked out of the window, and saw some mortar rubbed down, and several tiles broken.</p>

               <p>the 22d of January last, I believe it was, our house was broke open; it was done about one in the morning; I locked the doors that night myself; I heard the watch cry all the hours, and every half hour, except the hour one, and half past three; from thence I conclude that this fact was committed about one, or half past three; I got up at about seven in the morning to let my husband out, who is a military man; I did not perceive but that the lower part of the house was in the same situation I had left it in the preceding evening, for the persons that had stole the things had got in at the one pair of stairs window; I had at eleven o'clock the preceding night put a quantity of linen on the lines to dry, in the one pair of stairs room; I went to look for this linen at about eleven in the morning; then I for the first time perceived that the linen was gone, and the sashes were thrown up; I am certain I had put down those sashes the preceding evening; I had come out of the room without putting the shutters to, and I returned afterwards and shut them, but without fastening, and I am well assured that the windows were down. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) they were, together, of the value of 5 l. the prisoners were taken on the Monday three weeks afterwards, and were carried before Justice Welch; a great quantity of linen was found in their lodgings. Having information of their being taken up, I went to the Justice's; I saw there a couple of neckcloths of mine, which were found in the prisoners lodgings.</p>

I was with Mrs. Elliot at the Justice's; she described the marks on the neckcloths; upon being examined the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180038"></xptr> marks she had mentioned appeared to be upon them; Ramsay desired much to be admitted an evidence.</p>

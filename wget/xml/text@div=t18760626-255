                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 359). On Friday morning, 28th April, about 1.30, I was on duty in Dickenson's Lane, Crouch Hill, in uniform—I heard a noise, as if a door was broken open, proceeding from a hay shed at the bottom of a field belonging to Holland House, Mr. Underhay's, and I saw a light proceeding from the same place—I went to see what it was, I had to leave the road and go across a field to the shed—I saw the shed door standing a little way open, I opened it and looked in, and turned my light on to the prisoner—I found him crouched up in a corner—I asked what he was doing there—he said "I have only got here out of the rain," that he did not know where to go to—I told him he had no right there, it was private property, and he would have to go to Highgate police-station with me—he began to cry and said he hoped I should not take him there—he came out of the place as far as an iron fence, Be tried to get over that, I told him there was a gate close by and he had no occasion to get over the fence—he said "I tell you I am going over here;" he tried to get hold of my throat, I had hold of him—he then got hold of my whiskers and held me tight; he then slipped his that and his coat off that he had got tied on the top of his other coat* and started off running away, leaving them behind; I followed him up the field and overtook him, he then turned Sharp round and went back to the fence again, in going over the hedge I caught him by the leg and struck him on the leg with my truncheon—I did that to detain him—he drew his leg from me and fell head foremost—I'had hold of him and had a struggle with him—he got over the hedge and struck me on the head with a short ladder that was there—I got over the hedge after him and there we had a struggle on the' ground, I got' him on the ground, we had a long struggle—I then asked him if he would go quietly—he said yes, if I would let him get up—I let him get up and he then caught hold of me, first by the privates, and tried to kick me after, and then I hit him on the head with my truncheon, and then asked him if he would go quietly—he said no, he was not going to lose all that blood for nothing—he was bleeding a little—with that he took out his pocket knife and stabbed me three times—I did not see the knife; he stabbed me once in the neck, just over the bone, once on the left arm, just in the thickness of the arm, and once on the right side of the head—those stabs wounded me through my clothes—the prisoner had got hold of one end of my truncheon and he took it away—I was obliged to release him after he had stabbed me, because I felt the blood running down and I was getting weak</p>

               <p>from loss of blood—he walked away, taking ray truncheon with him—I walked to the Crouch End Railway Station, and there saw two constables, who assisted me to Highgate police-station—the inspector at once sent for Dr. Forshall, who came and examined my wounds—I was taken in a carriage to the hospital, where I have been six weeks all but two days—the prisoner was brought to the hospital the same morning—I am sure he is the man—the inspector examined my clothes—I did not feel more than three stabs—I was scratched a good bit about the face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon of the police at Highgate—on the 28th April, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, I was called by a constable to Highgate police station to see Bullamore—he was faint and pulseless and soaked in blood from his neck down to his hips—I found three wounds—on removing his underclothing I found a large mass of clotted blood in front of the chest and abdomen—the hemorrhage proceeded from three wounds, one on the right aide of the head about three-quarters of an inch long, dividing the scalp and going down to the bone, that was not dangerous in itself, if erysipelas had intervened it would have been serious—the second wound was on the left upper arm, at the back part, a little above the elbow; that was not in itself serious—the third wound was in the neck, at the junction of the sternum and clavicle, on the right side, immediately over the caroted artery and the jugular vein; that was very serious and in a most dangerous vicinity, it possibly touched the artery—he was faint, his head could not be raised for some time—there was an enormous quantity of blood—I afterwards took him to St. Bartho<lb></lb>lomew's Hospital—he was too weak to be taken that night; I left him in charge of the surgeon at the hospital—I then went with Sergeant Hughes to the spot where this occurred in front of the hen-house or shed I found this large screw driver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); on the grass close by I found a piece of cloth, which Sergeant Hughes picked up, it was just on the opposite of the hen-house, where there was a gap and where there was a ladder lying; on the further side of the hedge from the lane beyond where the ladder was and where the grass showed signs of a struggle—the door of the hen-house had been forced and a portion of the wood was lying on the ground—I tried the screw driver with it—I afterwards went to the Holloway police-station and there found the prisoner in custody—I examined him—he was bleeding from a wound in the head, he had very severe bruises on the back part of the arm and elbow and upper arm, there was also a bruise on the leg and on the forehead, blood was running down his face—the bruises were all freshly inflicted, and they corresponded with the injuries which the constable previously told me he had inflicted on the prisoner—I was present at the first examination of the prisoner before the Magistrate—I then examined his thumb—there were wounds at the base of the thumb, such as might have been inflicted by teeth—the prisoner asked me if they were not like bites; I said they were—I gave the piece of cloth to Detective Webb.</p>

On the morning of the 28th August, I was at the Holloway police-station, Dr. Forshall then gave me this piece of black cloth, I compared that with the prisoner's trousers, and it exactly corresponded with a torn part on the right leg—I told the prisoner there was a constable in St. Barthalomew Hospital who had been stabbed, and I should take him to the hospital to the constable, and if he was identified by him he would be charged with stabbing him—he-made no answer—I took him to the hospital, and the constable identified him—I asked him if he had any doubt—he said "No, not the slightest."</p>

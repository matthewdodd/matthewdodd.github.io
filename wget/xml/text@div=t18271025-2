On the 12th of October, about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, I was at home - the prisoners were brought into my shop by the witnesses, who charged them with breaking my glass and taking a pair of shoes out of the window; the shoes were produced - I knew them to be mine: I had not particularly noticed them in the window that day, as I had a quantity there; the pane of glass had been cracked before, but was puttied up quite secure. I had not particularly noticed the window before the robbery.</p>

            . I am a porter, and live at No. 59, Tottenham-court-road. On the 12th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was on the opposite side of the way to Mr. Jackman's house, in company with Roberts, and saw the two prisoners in company, standing near the window; I observed Barry press his thumb against the window several times - he left, and Griffiths remained at the window; Barry returned, and I heard the glass shoved in; Griffiths took something out - Barry ran down the street, and they joined each other at the end of Denmark-street; we laid hold of them, and out of Griffiths' apron I took these shoes; they had only got to the bottom of the street; when Barry pressed his thumb I heard the glass fall inside - I found on Griffiths a little bit of iron, sharp at the end, and a knife all over putty.</p>

            . I was with Boston. I am a painter and glazier. I heard the glass fall; we watched them; I assisted in apprehending them, and saw the shoes found in Griffiths' apron - they were in company together. Boston's evidence is correct; a knife and a broken nail was found on Griffiths - they were both together.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JACKMAN. I have no doubt of these shoes being mine.</p>
               <p>BARRY'S Defence (written.) At the time the robbery was committed I was playing with my little sister in Denmark-street; Griffiths came up, and spoke to me, but I saw no shoes in his hand, nor did I know he had committed the robbery. I am innocent; I unfortunately was committed to the House of Correction for three months, and had only been out a week; the constable who took me thought I must be guilty, because I spoke to Griffiths, who had also been in the House of Correction with me, in the same yard; but I am innocent, and have kept myself innocent of robbery ever since I have been out of prison.</p>

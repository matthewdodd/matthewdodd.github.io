                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Ellingham, we live at Rickmansworth. About eleven or twelve o'clock, on the 19th of Dec., I was going along the road with a bundle, containing the articles stated—the prisoner was driving a cart, and asked me if I would ride—I got into the cart with my bundle, and rode a considerable distance—he behaved very ill to me, and I said, "I shall not ride any further, I ahall get out"—he said, "Get out, I shall not charge you anything for riding yourself, but I shall for your bundle;"—I said, "How much? "—he said, "Fourpence"—I got four penny-pieces in my hand to give him—I threw the bundle out on the bank, and got out—he jumped out, and threw the bundle into the cart, and it fell into the road—I went to pick it up, and he said, "You shan't have it with<lb></lb>out you pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—I said, "Very well;" but he rode on with it—I had not known him before.</p>

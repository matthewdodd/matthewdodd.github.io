            . I am an officer; on Sunday morning, the 18th of April, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Houndsditch with this lead in a bag. I asked what he had got, he said lead, that he had brought it from Deptford, and was going to take it to Clark, a plumber, in Sun-street. I tried, but could find no such person; and in the evening I found Mr. Wilson's house had been stripped of lead. I applied it to his premises on Monday morning, and it fitted exactly; about 1/2 a cwt. was still missing; it had been cut with a knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It had been daylight for some time - A. Yes. He was about three minutes walk from the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going from Crutchetfriars to the corner of George-street, and turned up behind a hoard for a necessary purpose, I saw this bag of lead behind some planks, and was going to sell it in Long-alley.</p>

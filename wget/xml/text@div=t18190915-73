                  William

            . I left him in the fair about half-past eight o'clock, came down the fair, and bought 1 lb. of gingerbread nuts - it was then a quarter before nine o'clock, and quite light. I came about thirty yards from the stall, through a gap into the field, and the prisoner seized me by the collar. Another young man in a snuff coloured coat and slouch hat, came up on my left-hand - the prisoner was on my right side. Then fifteen or sixteen others, men and boys, came up, surrounded me, ripped my waistcoat right open, undid my breeches, and took a pen-knife out of my breeches pocket; they took away my hat and handkerchief, also a 1 l. note from my breeches pocket, and 14 s. in silver from my waistcoat pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any blows - A. One of them, whom I should know again, said</p>
               <p>"Rip his entrails out." They beat me and knocked me down with this weapon - (Here the witness produced a bludgeon four or five inches thick, and pointed at one end.) - while the prisoner held me, another man knocked me down with this bludgeon; I fell into the ditch, and the bludgeon laid under me. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"We have killed the b - g - r, let him lay in the ditch." I received a cut on my body with some instrument, but what it was I do not know. I remained about ten minutes in the ditch, then got into the fair, and made my complaint. I took a coach, and was carried to Mr. Batty's public-house, at Kilburn, very much bruised with the blows I had received. I was very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner again, and say if you are certain he is the man who collared you - A. Yes, I am convinced he is the man; I saw him again at Bow-street about one o'clock next morning among a great many others, I pointed him out immediately, and have not the least doubt in the world about him. As soon as he saw me at Bow-street, he appeared as if he remembered me - he told the magistrate he did not know that he had ever seen me. I have kept this bludgeon ever since.</p>

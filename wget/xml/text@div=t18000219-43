               <p>Q. Did you find your hay? - A. They would not let me in to see it; it was but five o'clock in the morning; I did not know but I might be knocked on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the hay that came out of your yards was hay? - A. It was two different sorts of hay, one was clover hay, and the other marshy hay; I followed it to Mile-end, along-side the carts, all the way, for it was a very dark morning; they drove as fast as they could well drive, it is about a mile and three quarters, or near two miles; I saw some hay that same day, at Stepney, that I believe was mine, it was sold to a man that keeps a cow there (it was a particular kind of hay, marshy hay, with flags like, in it), about half a mile from the Coach and Horses, or scarcely so much.</p>

             sworn. - I was servant to Mr. Clements: On the 6th of January, the carter, Shepherd, set me to take these horses to Mile end-road, with two trusses of hay belonging to Mr. Clements; I went to get the money for the grains and wash, while he drove the horses out of the yard; and when I had received the money, I ran after the carrier; I met with him in the Hackney-road, past the George; he says to me, come along, and when he got to the Coach and Horses at Mileend-road, he called out, will, to the offer, and he came out and took the hay, and gave us one shilling and sixpence a-piece for those two trusses of hay; and we went into the public-house and had a pennyworth of purl and a pennyworth of gin in it; he put the hay into a shed, and we went on to go to Bromley, and came back again, and had some more liquor there; and asked Mr. Holloway to be so good as to send a man home with the horses and carts; that was, as nigh as I can guess, between eleven and twelve o'clock; and then we ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to run away? - A. Because I was frightened, never having done any thing before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you of it at the public-house? - A. Mr. Holloway told me my master had been there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He sent me out with the hay; he was the first that gave the hay out to the ostler, and whether the ostler gave him any money I can not say; I never received a farthing of it.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called his master, who gave him a good character.</p>

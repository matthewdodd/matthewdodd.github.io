                  </hi>. On the 4th August I went into a house with the female prisoner—she took my hat off and went into the house, and I followed her and asked her to give it me—she said she would not until I paid her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I offered her a shilling—after a time the male prisoner came into the room, and an old woman at the same time with a candle—I told him all that had occurred, and he told Harley to give me my hat and let me go—she said she would not until she broke it, and she threw it down and broke it—I then picked up my hat to go, but before I could get hardly outside the street-door I was seized by the female prisoner—she put her hand into my left-hand trousers pocket—I laid hold of her hand and shoved her down—I was directly laid hold of by the male prisoner—the female came to his assistance, and they both got me down—the man knelt on my chest while the female kept my right hand, and turned my fingers back—the male prisoner took the watch from me—I laid hold of the chain, but he pulled the watch out of the swivel—I saw him undo the swivel—he then ran down the passage—I followed him, but could not see him—I went into the parlour, but could not see him—I then went into Victoria Street, and I had scarcely got into the passage again, when I met the female prisoner, and she hit me on the head with a stick or a portion of a bedstead—I gave an alarm to the police—they searched the place, but could not find either of the prisoners—about an hour and a half afterwards we went back to the same house, and there found the prisoners with about half a dozen more women talking over the affair—directly the male prisoner saw me he attempted to get out of the window—the police laid hold of him and asked if that was the man, and I said, "That is the man and that is the woman; I have not the least doubt of it"—he said nothing—he went quietly to the station.</p>

Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A modeller—I live at No.1, Pier Terrace, Pimlico—I met the female in Pall Mall about five minutes to twelve—she asked where I was going—I said, "Home." She said, "Where is that?" I said, "Pimlico." She said, "I live at Pimlico, and if you do not mind we will go home together." I said, "Very well"—I did not mean to take her to my home—I am a single man and rent apart<lb></lb>ments—she asked me for something to eat—I did not give her anything, or anything to drink—the houses were shut—she did not ask me for any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130030"></xptr>
               <p>Money—I walked with her from Pall Mall to Victoria Street—we went up a dark turning—she said it was the nearest way, and so it would have been if we had gone through, but she took off my hat and ran into the house and locked it in a cupboard, and put the key in her pocket—I seized hold of her to get the key of the cupboard from her—I did not try to throw her down—she threw herself down on a chair and screamed out, "Charley"—when I was going she said, "You are not going away like that, after bring<lb></lb>ing me from the West End?"—I gave her a florin and asked her for a shilling change out of it—I did not throw her down then—I threw her down outside the door when she attempted to rob me of my watch—she cried for help when I was trying to get the key—it was then that the male prisoner came in with the old woman—he did not touch me till I threw the woman down—he then came up and seized me and knocked me down—she helped to keep me down, and held my left hand while he robbed me of my watch—there was a lamp just outside the door—there was no light in the passage—he knelt on my chest and took the watch.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman B 312). On the 4th August I was on duty in Victoria Street about three o'clock in the morning—I saw the prosecutor there, and accompanied him to a house of ill-fame in Union Court, Orchard Street—he had stated the particulars and given me a full description of the prisoners—that was an accurate description—I knew them—we went into the house, and as soon as the male prisoner saw me he made a move towards the window to get out—I seized him and asked the prosecutor if it was the man who robbed him—he said, "Yes; take him into custody." I said, "Is this the woman?" He said, "Yes"—I took them to the station, and charged them with stealing the watch and assault<lb></lb>ing the prosecutor—Constable said he did not take it—I found nothing on him relating to the robbery—the prosecutor handed me this chain, which he retained in his hand.</p>

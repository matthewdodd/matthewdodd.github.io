R. B.," and two bottles of sherry—I took the the things out of the portmanteau and sent it back to the Midland Hotel, giving instructions to Thorogood—about 7 o'clock on the evening of the 5th August, Howell was brought to my office—I asked him his name and address—he took this card from the portmanteau and wrote this on it, Fern Lodge, Althorpe Road—I found there a quantity of property, which is here—his wife was there.</p>

I am a detective officer in the service of the Great Northern Railway Campany—on Monday morning, 2nd August, I received instructions from Mr. Williams, in consequence of which I watched the cloak-room of the Midland Hotel, where I had previously seen the port-manteau deposited—on the evening of 5th August, about 6.40, Howell came there; I saw this portmanteau and another one given to him—I asked him if the two portmanteaus belonged to him—he said "Yes"—I said "Will you look at them again, and be quite sure that they are your property"—he looked at them again and said "Oh yes, they belong to me—I said "I am an officer of the Great Northern Railway, you must con<lb></lb>sider yourself in custody, and you will be charged with stealing this brown leather portmanteau—he said "Oh nonsense, I did not steal it"—I said "There is another portmanteau"—he said "Yes, you are quite right, there were two"—he said that he had bought them of a man at Nottingham in the race week, for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not know the man's name or address, but he knew him very well by meeting him at different races—he said he had been a cattle dealer—I took him to Mr. Williams' office and gave him into custody—on Saturday 7th August, I watched the House of Detention where Howell was—I saw his wife and another woman come first and enter, and soon after I saw Granville; I said to her "Are you waiting to go and see Howell?"—she said "Yes"—I said "You will not be able to see him to day, because his wife has just gone in"—I then asked where she was stop<lb></lb>ping—she said at No. 9, Derby Street—I told her if she would go to the top of the Street and wait there for a few minutes, I would come and speak to her—about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I went to where I told her to wait, but she was gone—I then went to No. 9, Derby Street, in a cab—I saw the landlady, went upstairs and found Granville—I saw a port<lb></lb>manteau—I asked Granville who it belonged to—she said it belonged to her husband—I had previously told her who I was, and said "I shall have to take these portmanteaus away, for I have every reason to believe they have been stolen, and she said "Oh dear me no, I am sure you have made a great mistake, for he is no thief, it is his own portmanteau"—the port<lb></lb>manteau was locked—I asked Granville if that was the only room they occupied; she said "Yes"—I asked her if there was any more property in the room besides these portmanteaus belonging to Howell—she said "In that chest of drawers you will find his underclothing, and it all belongs to him, that I know"—I searched the drawers and found some under clothing belonging to Howell and some under clothing belonging to a Mr. Arden and Colonel Adair—I called Granville's attention to the fact of those names</p>

               <p>ROBERT GUTHERIDGE. I am a servant to Richard Birch, a fishmonger in the Strand. On the 15th of August, between the hours of nine and ten in the morning, I saw these two men standing at the corner of Chancery-lane, near Middleton's and Jones's shop, knowing them to be suspicious characters I stood and watched them, I saw them go to the shop window and stop, then they went on again; when they got a few yards from the place I went up and saw a piece of glass out of the pane, I immediately went in and gave information; I came out and crossed the opposite side of the way, I saw these two men make a turn to come back again, when they saw a person inside taking away the goods from where the window was broken they walked on as fast as they could as far as Temple-bar, and I went about my business. In the evening I saw them in custody, I am quite sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>- BATES. On the 15th of August I was coming from my work I saw the prisoner in the brown jacket (Francis) go up to the window, I saw him pull something from his waistcoat pocket, it appeared to me to be some sharp instrument, he shoved his hand to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190063"></xptr>window, afterwards he walked away; he came back again and then I saw the window was broke; I watched the men; after that they went up to the window again; I saw the prisoner in the brown jacket take some handkerchiefs out and tuck them inside of his waistcoat. I am quite sure of it; the other prisoner was by the side of him.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I could not state whether they took five shillings or fifty poundworth of silk handkerchiefs; I have so many, or whether they took any; I cannot recollect missing any particular pattern.</p>

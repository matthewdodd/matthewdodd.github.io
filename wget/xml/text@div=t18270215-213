               <p>HENRY COOPER. Last Wednesday the prisoner slept in the same bed with me; my money was in my trousers pocket, which laid on the table - he came to bed between two and three o'clock; I got up before him, and missed my money - I got an officer, who came and made him put on his clothes; he found five shillings, a penny, and a farthing on him - before that he was asked if he had any money; he said Yes, his own, but he could not tell how much silver he had; there was a mark on each of the shillings and the farthing, which I knew them by - here it is.</p>

            . I am an officer. I made the prisoner get up; he said he could not tell how much money he had; I said I must search me - he squared at me, and said, "You shall take me before your betters first;" I then tied his hands, and found this money on him; he began to cry at the office, and said, "If the prosecutor will let me go, will you?" I said I could not; he said, "It is hard I should be transported for stealing a shilling or two - if you will let me go I will go on board an Indiaman this very day." I find he bears a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Joseph Miller and three others—the prisoner was in their service, and worked under me, at Poplar. At a quarter-past five o'clock in the evening of the 4th of Feb. I saw this piece of copper safe—I missed it—it is Mr. Miller's and others—there is the mark of a splash of lead on it, and I know it by the size of it.</p>

I was on duty at half-past five o'clock this evening—I saw the prisoner coming up Robin Hood-lane—he looked hard at me, and passed me—I heard some one opposite give a sort of whistle—I turned round, and saw the prisoner turn from the door of a marine store shop, to which he had got—I followed, and asked what he had got; he said, nothing—I took him into the marine store shop, and was about to search him—he pulled this out of his right-hand trowsers pocket, and said, this is all I have got—he said he found it—I asked where he worked; he said at Mr. Pitching's—I went, and found it was not true—I afterwards found that he worked for the prosecutors.</p>

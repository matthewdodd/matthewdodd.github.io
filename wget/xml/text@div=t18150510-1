I went on as far as Old street, then crossing the road, this gentleman tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody tapped you on the shoulder - A. Yes. He said, my man, you must go along with me to your master, for he had got something to tell me; my master is going out, and he wants the things directly; I said, very well, sir. He said, you may as well give me the bundle to carry, we shall then go on the quicker; I said, no, sir. I am much obliged to you; I can carry it very well myself. He said, you must give it me, I want to go directly back to my master, for he wants to go out of town; you can deliver the message. He then put his legs between mine, knocked me down, and forced the bundle out of my hand; there was a gentleman, officer, near, that saw the transaction. The prisoner ran away with the bundle. A gentleman that saw the transaction, came over, and picked me up; I did not see which way the man that knocked me down went.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that gentleman is - A. I have seen him since at Hatton Garden.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That person is my witness; I wish him to be here; he speaks in favour of me; I wish to put my trial off to get him here.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you go to the Justice - A. Mr. Lamprell sent his man, Nash, to the officer Hancock, and when I saw Hancock, I told him what had happened; Hancock took me the same night to a place, where I saw some men, it was at a public-house up a court in Whitecross-street; the first time I pointed out no person; I went several times afterwards to other houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you first saw the man that you thought robbed you - A. At a public-house by Hatton Garden; this was about a fortnight ago; Hancock, the officer, went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many persons in the room - A. Yes, about eight or nine; among these I saw the prisoner at the bar was one; I knew him as soon as I saw him; I singled the prisoner out from among the rest. He said, mind what you say, you are certain that I am the man; I said, I am certain. He put his hand to his head, and appeared agitated. I am sure the prisoner at the bar is the person that robbed me.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after you had any information was it that you apprehended the prisoner - A. On the 9th of April, I apprehended him in Great Shire-lane; a man of the name of Day gave me an information; I went into a shop in Great Shire-lane and went up stairs; as soon as the prisoner saw me, he asked me what I wanted with him; he asked me if I wanted him about a snow; I said, no; I wanted him about something else. Whilst going along with him to the office, I told him I wanted him for a highway robbery; he said, he did not care about that, or words to that effect. I put him into a room by the office with several others; Barnes came; I cautioned Barnes to be correct. He pointed him out directly; he made no hesitation at all. The prisoner then said, look at me again, be sure that I am the man; he said, I am sure you are the man that tripped me down; the prisoner was then take before the magistrate.</p>

On the 1st of April last, between four and five in the afternoon, I met him by accident, in Lincoln's-inn-fields, I had known him four or five years before. We talked about respectable trades; and his conversation led me to believe he got his living by thieving. He informed me that he was in danger of being apprehended every minute, and that he apprehended that Garnan, the Westminster police officer, had two warrants against him; I asked him what they were for; he said, one or two pieces of Irish linen, out of Barbican. I asked him how he got it, and whether by a croke! croke is a slang word for house-breaking; he said no; from a boy. I asked him what the other was for; he said; from Peter-street, Westminster. I asked him how he got that; he gave an account how he got it; this conversation was on the 1st of April. I afterwards saw Hancock, and gave him some information; in consequence of which, the prisoner was apprehended; I saw Roberts again on the Saturday following; on the Sunday following the Saturday he was apprehended; he was not apprehended until the 9th of April.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you ever in custody - A. I am not come here to convict myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. To Nash. Are the things here - A. We never found the things; they were never traced afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Day about the 1st of April, he asked me what I had been about, and what I was doing now; I said, I am looking out for bread in Shire-lane. He said he had been taken up on suspicion of stealing a watch, in Pickett-street. I asked him if he had a lodging to go home to; he said, no; so I gave him a shilling to got one. I wished to put off my trial until Monday, when I hoped to have this butcher here. I therefore throw myself entirely on the mercy of the court.</p>

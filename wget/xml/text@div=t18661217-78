                  </hi>. I am a wholesale manufacturing jeweller, of 23, Wilderness Row, Clerkenwell—in October last I had a traveller named George Owen—he was with me six or seven months—on the 18th October I entrusted him with between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery to take out to customers to effect sales if he could—he ought to have re<lb></lb>turned the same evening with the property, but did not—I communicated with the police, and issued the handbill—his father, who is a very honest man, came to me on the following evening, and made a communication to me as to what his son had done, and restored to me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was all I saw either of the jewellery or the proceeds until the police found these gold chains (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are thirty eight gold chains, and a piece of a chain which has been cut in two—these are some of the property which the lad Owen took out—they correspond in pattern, weight, and in every respect—he had many more than these—he had about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of gold chains—we generally weigh them before sending them out—the value of these is about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are there any numbers upon them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were, but the tickets have been taken off; they were not on them when I first identified them—I am in the habit of sending out chains of this de<lb></lb>scription; and others—I can't say how many of this description I had sent out within six months of this transaction—I don't think I ever sold any of this particular pattern; one is a lady's chain—this piece of chain I cut myself—I have the invoice of it; it is not a very common pattern—I had no other of that pattern—I bought it second-hand of a manufacturing jeweller, Mr. Newman, of Birmingham—the others are common patterns—I know them by their general appearance and the weight—I never let that quality go out of my hands till that morning—there were fourteen alberts and nine guards of that quality in the parcel—I weighed them—there were others, altogether about fifty-three or fifty-five—I did not count them—I am not the maker of any of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Britannia Street, Gray's Inn Road—I am now a milk carrier—on the 18th October I was in the service of Mr. Humphreys—I carried out a quantity of jewellery of his that day on foot—I met with a man I had known some little time, and he induced me to go away with him—he said he knew a party in London that would buy it—I met him at a music hall in John Street—he had said that to me several times before I took notice of it—he knew in whose service I was—in con<lb></lb>sequence of what he said to me some little time afterwards I went with him to his house where he lodged, and he made an arrangement with two men—they came there while we were there—I should know them again—they had weights—one came in first while the other waited outside—the one that came in first weighed all the jewellery, and gave 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he called in the other man from outside, and he had the money—the man that induced me to go away took up half of the money—his name is Curran—I took the other half—the man that weighed the jewellery took it away—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186612170012"></xptr>
               <p>Curran went and got a cab, and we went to Ludgate Hill Station and went by train to Dover—when we got there Curran made some excuse, and got out of the train, and I have never seen him since—I stayed at Dover that night, and thought it over, and made up my mind to come back next morning, and go to my master—I went to my father first, and he went to my master—I restored the.50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a quantity of chains among the fifty I had—I know them, because there was one that I wore myself—this is it (<hi rend="italic">selecting it</hi>)—I am quite sure this was among those I sold—when I went to Dover it was with the idea of going to New Zealand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I found these chains in a safe at 30, Gravel Lane, Houndsditch—a key was found on the prisoner—there was other property in the safe, consisting of jewellery—we also found some books there, but there are no entries in them—I have them here—I have never seen any books by the prisoner as a marine-store dealer; there were no books at all at the warehouse—these are very old—there are some entries before he was convicted in 1852, but no recent ones—he has not given me any account whatever of these chains that were in his pos<lb></lb>session—I did not call his attention to them when I found them, he was then in custody—as I conveyed him to the station from Black Horse Yard he tried to get rid of the keys, and secreted them behind him on the cushion—I found that he was doing something, and took them from him—he had particularly requested that he might be allowed to walk.</p>

Things having been repeatedly taken from the officers' lockers, on the morning of the 2nd of Dec. I hid myself in the area adjoining the kitchen, and watched the prisoner—I saw him force open locker No. 3, belonging to Morty O'Sullivan—he took nothing out, but went to a locker of George Douglas, and forced that open with a knife, but, hearing footsteps, he closed it again, opened it again, and took out a loaf of bread, cut off two slices, and put it into his own locker—he then went to O'Sullivan's locker, opened it, cut off a slice of bacon, and put that into his own locker—he then went to his own locker, and began eating the bacon and bread—I went in, said I had been watching him, and he must come up to the charge-room—he said, "Me, what do you mean?"—I took him up to the inspector, and he admitted he had done it—this is the bread and the bacon—there are as many as forty officers at the station—each has a locker, and a separate key to it.</p>

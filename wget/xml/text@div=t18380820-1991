                  </hi>. I am a Customs gate-keeper at the London Dock. I was on duty at the west entrance, on the afternoon of Saturday, the 4th of August—I saw the prisoner coming out, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of something I observed, I stopped him about half-past four o'clock—I asked him what he had in his hat—he said, "A little tea"—I then asked what he had in his pockets—he said, "A little tea"—I searched him, and found in his hat about 1 1/2 lbs. weight of tea, and in his pockets two packets of tea, about 1/4 lb.—they were wrapped up in whitey-brown paper—I then asked what he had got in his stomach—he said, "Apiece of tortoiseshell, "and he gave me this piece of tortoiseshell from between his shirt and trowsers—I asked where he got the tea and tortoiseshell—he said the mate of a ship, from China, gave them him—I asked if he could show us the ship—he said, "Yes, and it appeared to have tea in the hold"—I went with him, and when we got to the East quay, he said, "It is no use tak<lb></lb>ing you any farther; to tell you the truth, one Mr. Avery gave it me".</p>

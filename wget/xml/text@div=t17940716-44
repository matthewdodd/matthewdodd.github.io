               <p>Q. Was you drunk at all? - No, I was not, I went home and throwed the breeches on the chair, the two pair as I thought, but when I got to them I missed the kerseymere, which was in the middle of the thickset; I ran back immediately, then down to the Hay-market, to the same place, and meeting a young man at the door. an acquaintance of mine, I asked him to come into the house with me, when we came into the tap-room there they were sitting in the tap-room, the prisoner was one; then the young man asked me if I knew them people? I said, I never knew the min my life before. I found the breeches again, the Wednesday following, they were at a pawnbroker's; I took the prisoner up the Thursday following, just a week after, at the same public house; I found my breeches a fortnight after; I took the prisoner before I found the breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take him? - Because the young man that was with me heard him say that he went with them to pawn them.</p>

               <p>- WILLIAMS sworn. - I took charge of the prisoner and this pistol; in searching him, I found this knife in his waistcoat pocket; I asked him what he did with it, and he said, he kept it to cut his corns with.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I delivered the purse to Edwards; this is the same purse that the prisoner took from me; it contains just the money that I was robbed of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to Kentish-town, and I met that gentleman upon the bridge; I told him I was very much distrest, and asked him to give me a trisle; he said he had no halfpence, and then I stopped him; he cried out stop thief, and that young man came up; I went very quietly with him, and never offered to meddle with his watch; I had just burried my wife, and got two children; I was very much distrest; the spring of the pistol is broke; I had it to mount; I little thought of doing such a thing as I have done.</p>

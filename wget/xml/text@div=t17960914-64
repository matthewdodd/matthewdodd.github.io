               <p>Q. Was there as much lead as covered all the vacancy,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140104"></xptr> or was any taken away? - A. We spread it and tried it, and it as nearly covered the place as could be; and the joints fitted exactly, and then I marked it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. Where did this lead belong to? - A. Green's-alley, over a cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons are interested in this place? - A. Twelve; but men and their wives are one, I take it, and so I take it six are responsible; they hold it by lease under the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this lead was got from that place? - A. I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. We old men are very apt to be positive-that is not very thick lead? - A. No. nor very thin; it is neither milled lead nor cast lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that it is cut off from the gutter cross-ways? - A. It is almost staight in some parts, and angular in others; it seemed to be cut with a saw and a hatchet.</p>
               <p>Q. The impressions that the saw and the hatchet made would not easily correipond as if it was cut with a plumber's knife? - A. I cannot say any thing about the saw and the hatchet; they were found upon the premises, that is all I know of it; there is a shop in the market, where is for his use, as he is watchman of the market, where he keeps his brooms to sweep and clean the market.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Describe how this gutter is situated? - A. It is within about a foot of the bottom of the cellar-floor, and takes the water through the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is it fixed? - A. In a vault underneath the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it under cover? - A. It was under cover, and a padlock upon it when I left it; the padlock was broke open some time in the night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Q. This gutter is of a common size? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In another gutter the beating in with the hammer would have had much the same appear ance? - A. No; it could not because it fitted the place.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I cannot positively say, the first time I knew him was, when I came from camp.</p>

               <p>Q. But you have had a comrade in the custody of the prisoner for a little mistake? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never was in his custody? - A. No, nor any body else's, thank God.</p>
               <p>Q. You never used any angry expressions to him upon any occasion? - A. No, nor him to me.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a lock and key of this place you speak of? - A. Yes; he puts his brooms there.</p>
               <p>Q. And it is therefore a handy place to put any thing in that he may pick up in the market? - A. Yes; as far as I know.</p>

               <p>Q. Any other piece of lead might have been hammered into the same shape? - A. Lead is a thing that may be beat into any form.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of St. Margaret's parish, Westminster: On the 17th of July, I was sent for by Mr. Hardmeat, to Westminster Market, to apprehend the prisoner; I took him into custody with a parcel of lead that he had in his possession in the Market. (Produces the lead, a hatchet, and saw).</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by that hatchet and saw? - A. I had him in custody on the Sunday, and the hatchet and saw were given me on Monday by Mr. Hardmeat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. They were given you by another witness? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The lead was given you in the state in which it is now? - A. No; the three under pieces the plumber beat out the next day, it was all taken by me to the place, and these three pieces matched; I have kept it from that time till now.</p>
               <p>- SILESTER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am carpenter of the Market; I went on the Monday morning about ten o'clock to the Market, and I met Mr. Hardmeat; I went on the roof of the house, between eleven and twelve, with Mr. Hardmeat; there is one piece which was hollowed for the water to run out, and it fitted within five inches in length. (The piece was shewn to the Jury).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. peat. Q. You handed a piece of lead to the Jury just now that was doubled at the end of the wall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It matched within five inches in the length? - A. I first found the two ends, and I laid it all along, and it matched within five inches, which I allowed for by the hacking of the lead, I defy it to fit any other gutter; it fitted by the soil in the gutter, which was two inches deep, and by the width of it; the two ends that went into the wall I will swear to.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; I was going my rounds about a quarter after ten on Saturday night, the 16th of July, I saw this cellar door open, and the patroles came up, and desired me to make it fast, which I did; about four o'clock on the Sunday morning, I was coming round, and the door was wide open again, and I saw the prisoner come down the steps into the Market, and go to his shop with a barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hardmeat.) Where did you get the hatchet? - A. Out of the shop, on the Monday, it is called a shed, I opened the door and found that saw, about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door locked or open? - A. The door was locked, the constable gave me the key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Q. I believe you have seen saws and hatchets like these? - A. I have seen many saws and many axes, but I am sure I took them out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, as I was going to see my father about five o'clock, going along, I saw something lying, it was this lead, in Green's-alley, near the Market, going into the Market; I unlocked the door, and wheeled the barrow out, and put it in; and when I wheeled it into the shop, before I took it there, Mr. Hardmeat took me up; the lead laid for any body to see it.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140106"></xptr>(The prisoner called five witnesses, who said he was an bonest industrious young man).</p>

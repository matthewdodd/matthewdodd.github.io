I am a plasterer of 8, Sturdy Road, Peckham—on Satur<lb></lb>day night, 20th March, I was in the parlour of the Sailor Prince in Gordon Road, Peckham—I sat at a table and saw the prisoner in the parlour—I knew him before—I did not enter into conversation with him—a conversation was going on and I joined in it—after I had been talking for some time the prisoner laid hold of the back of my head with one hand and pegged at me with the other—I felt a sharp prick in my face and I was flowing with blood in a moment, I could scarcely see—the landlord, and one or two more took him from me and put me in</p>

I live at 8, Sturdy Road, Peckham—I was in the parlour of the Sailor Prince on this Saturday night—I saw the prisoner get Room up against the table and punch him in the face with his fist, and he was covered with blood—I afterwards saw a white-handled knife in the prisoner's hand, when he was taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor did nothing, he was powerless—there were six of us in the room—none of us interfered—I got on the table and said, "That is enough of it"—I did not want to get knocked about or get into trouble—I did not see a knife in the prisoner's hand at the time the assault was committed; not till some one said, "The man has got a knife"—I should say it was a white-handled knife by the look of it when I saw it.</p>

I live at 127, Gordon Road, Peckham—I went into the parlour as the disturbance was just about finishing; I caught hold of the prisoner's arm, and somebody took hold of him by the other arm—his hand was closed, and I saw something sticking out of it which looked like the blade of a knife—somebody called out, "He has got a knife! Bun for a policeman!" and I let go of him, and went for a policeman.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 4, Queen's Road, Peckham—on the Sunday morning after this occurrence I saw the prosecutor and examined his face—he was suffering from two black eyes and a cut beneath the right eye and also beneath the left, and a punctured wound in the forehead and incised wounds in the right and left eyes—they were such wounds as would be caused by a sharp-pointed instrument.</p>

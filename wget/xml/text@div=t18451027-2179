On the evening of the 24th of Sept., I was at the top of Tooley-street—I had been speaking to the prosecutor, and saw the prisoners go behind him—I had not noticed a handkerchief in Keefe's hand previous to his going there, but I saw him after he went there hand a handkerchief to Bryan, which Bryan made his escape with.</p>

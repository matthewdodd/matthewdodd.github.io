                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Wooding, a chandler, in Frith-street. About a fortnight before the 14th of June, the prisoner, who was a stranger, called, and asked if I would buy some butter—he said it was very excellent Dorset butter—I told him to call again, which he did in a week or fortnight, and on the 14th he brought a pan of butter into the shop—the top of it looked very good—I was busy, and did not examine it further—I bought it on the strength of his assurance, and paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I cut it next morn<lb></lb>ing, and found the top was very good Dorset, but underneath was very bad—I cannot call it any thing but cart grease—we made no use of it—the good butter did not extend above half an inch—I was obliged to throw it away—it smelt very had, and was quite a different colour.</p>

I gave her board and lodging to be my servant till she could get a place. I had 75 l. in half-crowns, in a paper box, which was locked in a bookcase in my bed-room. I often noticed that she had a great deal of money. On the 6th of September I saw about ten half-crowns, tied up in one corner of her handkerchief, which gave me suspicion. She took one out, and sent my boy to buy something. I went to my box, and missed 10 l. worth of half-crowns and a crown-piece. I came down, and said I had been robbed, but did not say of what - she immediately said,</p>
               <p>"I declare to G - d, I have not touched your money!" I said,</p>
               <p>"I did not say, I had lost money," and told my husband to secure her. We got an officer, who searched her. Nobody but her and my two children had access to my bed-room. She could see the box through the glass door of the bookcase.</p>

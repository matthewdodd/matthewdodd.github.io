In 1829, I had a warehouse in White-lion-street, Spitalfields - the prisoner applied to me to purchase some silk, and purchased one thousand and eighty-one yards, value 209l. 10s. he proposed paying me according to the terms of a note he had written to me a few days previous - that if I would sell him the goods he would give me half the amount in money, and an approved bill for the other half, which bill was to be delivered to me on the Saturday following - the sale was made on Monday, the 29th of June, 1829, the goods were delivered, and he gave a cheque for 104l. on a house, in Lombard-street, which cheque was paid - in consequence of information, I afterwards received, I saw him on the following Wednesday -(that was two days after) I saw him at his warehouse, in Gutter-lane - I went there and said to him, "Richmond, the goods I sold you last Monday, you have offered for sale at Swan &amp; Co.'s Regent-street, at a price much less than you bought them of me for; I evidently see a fraud is intended - I give you your choice of two things, send me back my goods and I will return the 104l., or if that is not done, I shall apply to the Lord Mayor, and charge you with defrauding me out of the goods; the goods have been offered to Swan &amp; Co. for 20l. less than the invoice" - he denied it, but said, the goods he had offered the night before to Swan &amp; Co. were not the goods he had bought of me, but goods he had got at another house, and which he could afford to sell at that price - I left the warehouse, for two strangers to me were present - and when I returned home, I wrote him a note, and received an answer to that note, which answer, I have here - I know his hand-writing - it is in his handwriting.

I have bitherto fulfilled my engagements, by paying you half the amount in cash - I shall give you the remainder in indorsed papers, on Saturday, which is the day I promised.</p>

Wadden White-lion-street, Spitalfields;" this is the bill that was inside it - the moment I received this bill, before I acknowledged the receipt of it, or placed it to the credit of his account - I immediately proceeded to No. 12, Commercial Chambers, Minories; I inquired there for

Clark - I have seen him write two or three times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you see him write? A. An assignment which I prepared - I saw him sign it - he signed it, "George Delianson Clark," at the same time I saw him write some letters or memorandums; I read them - that was in 1831, when he was in custody.</p>

            . My husband's name was Robert, he is the drawer of this bill; and that in his signature - my husband died on the 25th of January, 1831.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This is your husband's signature? A. Yes - I know nothing about the bill - I never saw or heard of it before - the indorsement is my husband's also- I knew Mr. Richmond when my husband was living - when he lived in Gutter-lane - between four and five years ago - I did not know him myself long before he left - my husband knew him - my husband was brought up as a lawyer and practised as such in the country, but had not taken his certificate out in the city - he lived in Trinity-street, Borough - he practised in the north.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he do when he lived in Southwark? A. He was not doing anything - I cannot exactly tell how long it was since he practised - he was not doing anything in 1829 - he was not living in the rules of the King's Bench - he was living in Trinity-street, Trinity-square, over London-bridge, nearly opposite Union-hall, leading out of High-street - he got his living with the assistance of my friends.</p>

            . I am a sadler, living at Star-corner, Bermondsey. I knew Robert Wilson - I have seen him write - I believe this signature to be his hand writing - I believe this indorsement to be his hand writing - I have frequently seen him write - he used to write for me frequently.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago? A. I suppose about four years ago - he was a solicitor - he used frequently to make out my accounts - he had nothing to do at that time - I have not seen him write his name, or accept a bill - he wrote in my books - I have not looked at those books for three or four years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you receive any letters from him? A. No - he mostly made out my bills - he wrote not only figures but words - I paid him for it - he assisted as a kind of clerk.</p>
               <p>MR. PARK. I knew Delianson Clark, he frequently called on me - he did not to my knowledge live at No. 12, Commercial-chambers - I have chambers there - Clark came backwards and forwards doing business - he never held chambers there - he never came there except to me - to my knowledge; I never authorised him to make bills payable there.</p>

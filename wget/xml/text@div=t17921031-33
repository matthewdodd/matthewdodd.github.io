I said not the least; I never saw him before in my life, to the best of my knowledge; on Monday he was taken before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Would you have parted with this money if it had not been through fear? - I am not subject to fear; if he had stopped me on the highway I should not have thought any thing of it; but to attack my character!</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you come past me three or four times and look in my face? he says never mind, you are not a native of England; what countryman are you? I said of Holland; I said I am going to Holland next Monday; he said what kind of country is that; he asked me many questions; he asked me to have some Burton and a bowl of bunch. - Not a word of the sort.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said you are rather low spirited, is there any thing in my power that I can serve you? - Never a word passed between us but what I have related.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then he laid hold of my arm, as we were walking along. - By no means, he attempted several times to take hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I should not be afraid of him, he was a true Englishman and could afford to spend a thousand guineas. - I, thinking the man was drunk, said I wish you good night, Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you gave me the guinea and a half, did not you appoint me to call upon you on Monday? - By no means; before the Lord Mayor he said it was Sunday, but that was false.</p>

On the 11th of March, I and Mrs. Brice spent the evening at Mrs. Johnson's, in Holywell-street, Westminster: she is Mrs. Brice's mother, and gave us a cake for our children, rolled up in a piece of paper; upon which Mrs. Johnson's address was written. On our return home, about half-past nine, I saw the cake put into the side board drawer - it still had the paper on it; we went to bed a little after ten o'clock; I was not the last person up; the cook fastened the house up - I was alarmed a little before three o'clock by Mrs. Brice - I got up, opened my bed room door, and distinctly heard some persons in the house - I returned, threw up the window and called the watchman; I found eight or nine watchmen had assembled round the house. I then directed them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070058"></xptr>the back of the house, as I had heard a noise there - I opened the hall door and let the watchmen in, on to the lead flats - I remained in the house and examined the ground floor; I found a square of glass taken out of the scullery window; the door leading from the scullery to the kitchen was bored through, and the bars undone, so that they could open the door; all the closets in the kitchen were broken open, also the wine cellar. The sideboard in the dining room was broken open, and several articles, which were in it, scattered about the dining room floor, and also in the kitchen; there was wine, rum, and jellies on the kitchen table - we had a drum of figs in the side-board; I found that nearly empty, and some scattered about the floor - the plumb cake and the paper were both gone; I saw all the prisoners in the watch-house that morning; I did not find any of them in the house; I saw marks of blood in the passage leading from the back yard to the stable, and where all the windows were broken, as if the parties had been endeavouring to escape there; the shutters of the stair-case window, and the glass was also broken; I had heard somebody escaping out that way, and have no doubt that is the way they did escape. The articles stated in the indictment were missing; there was a silver cruet stand, a coat, some cruet tops, and other things shewn to me when they were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you any other Christian name? A. None; when I gave the alarm, the watchmen were collected; there must have been an alarm before I gave any - the virander prevented my seeing into the street - I cannot say whether there were other persons besides watchmen; there were two other persons at the watch-house, in the morning, after breakfast when I went there - they were spectators, and were taken at the watch-house, about half-past nine in the morning; I have heard nothing of them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. It was a very dark night? A. Not very dark.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and was stationed near Euston-square - Mr. Brice lives at No. 17. On the morning of the 12th of March, I was attracted to his house by hearing a noise in the kitchen; I listened against the rails, and presently heard it again, and heard a noise as if a door creaked - I was convinced some persons were in the house - I ran up the steps - rang the bell - sprang my rattle, and other watchmen collected - there were no strangers about the house at that time; two men came up and asked me what o'clock it was - they went away. In consequence of what Mr. Brice said, I went to the back part of the premises with other watchmen; the other watchmen got on the leads of the stable of No. 22, with a ladder and torch; I staid at the end of the mews to prevent an escape, and I saw two of the prisoners come off the leads of No. 28, jump down into a garden; the leads were about twenty feet high - I think, they let themselves down by the boughs of a poplar tree; I was put over the wall into the garden, and found Dunn and Crawley there; they stood up concealed in one corner - I am positive they are the men who I had seen drop down by the poplar tree; no other men were in the garden - I secured and took them to the watch-house - returned to Mr. Brice's house, went on the leads and found a silver cruet stand, two cruet tops, a sugar spoon, and a dark lantern - I found a crow bar just under the staircase window; I found a chisel in the front kitchen, and a toast rack in the kitchen or pantry - it was bent; I saw some figs found in Crawley's pocket - I had heard a window break when I was listening in the street; I did not examine their hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How many watchmen were collected? A. Five or six; there might be fifty people collected in the course of the time - two persons came up while I was listening to the noise; they asked me what o'clock it was - there is a mews at the back of the houses, with coach-houses and stables, and a garden wall at the back of the house; it is very high, a person could not get over without assistance - I was heaved up: there is a space of about thirty-feet between the wall and the flats; there is not a garden to all the houses, only to No. 28.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a space between the house and stables? A. Yes, I saw the two persons on the stables - watchmen do not carry dark lantern's - I returned from taking them to the watch-house in about a quarter of an hour; it is very near.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. When Mr. Brice gave an alarm at the front window the watchman ran round behind? A. Yes, there was nobody assembled round the house but the watchmen - there were about fifty persons in the mews after the prisoners were taken; Mr. Brice called out to me that they were escaping at the back - there were no persons round then; I saw the prisoners on the flats - I was not ten yards from the wall.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Though there is a space between the flats and the wall, there is a tree by which they got down? A. Yes, the two men asked me the time, before I heard glass break in the house - the crowd assembled after the prisoners were taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The first thing you did on hearing the noise, was to ring the bell and spring your rattle, then the watchmen came, and Mr. Brice opened the window? A. Yes; the watchmen collected before I went to the back of the premises, but no other persons; when I got to the mews there were no persons collected that I saw, but I stopped at the end.</p>

            . I am a watchman. My attention was directed to Mr. Brice's house and the mews; I saw the heads of two persons going along the top of the stables, towards the end of the square; I saw one of them climb up the tree; a servant let me through into the garden of No. 28; I found Crawley and Dunn there; they are the men I had seen on the leads, I believe; there were no other men there; Hooper and I took them to the watch-house; they were searched in my presence by Cousins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you come up on Hooper's springing his rattle? A. Yes, I only found Hooper there; another watchman or two came up before I went round to the back; Mr. Brice hallooed out of window that they were escaping backward; I went round - Hooper followed me, I believe; I found nobody in the mews that I recollect, but in a minute or two a watchman came along at the end of the street, with a prisoner, and said</p>
               <p>"We have got one, and there are two more behind," but they did not come along the mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went into the garden of No. 28, how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070059"></xptr>many persons had collected? A. There was a watchman of two coming up, and there might have been a person or two; I went to the front for the servant to let me into the garden - about ten minutes had elapsed before I took the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Were you in the square when Mr. Brice gave the alarm? A. Yes; I got to the door of No. 28, about ten minutes after that - it was not a quarter of an hour; I found the two prisoners in the garden; the other watchman came over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say it was the prisoners whom you saw running over the leads? A. I believe it to be them, for I saw them go down into the garden, and there was nobody else there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find a number of persons in the the mews? A. No, I saw nobody there - I had not been there two minutes before I saw the men running on the leads.</p>

            . I am footman to Mr. Roxborough, No. 28, Euston-square. On the morning of the 12th of March, at six o'clock, I went into master's garden, and found the stock of a center bit, a cake, a pot of jelly, some Turkey figs, and the top of a cruet frame. I was at home when the alarm was given, and let the watchman in; I had been in the garden at ten o'clock the night before; there was nothing of the sort there then; the prisoners had no business there; I saw the watchman find them in the garden, concealed in the area under the window; there is a poplar tree behind the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. At what time did you let the watchman in? A. About three o'clock - I heard windows break - I opened the window, hearing an alarm, and thought I heard a man jump down by the tree - I let Finch and another person in in front - there might be half a dozen persons standing in the street at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in the garden altogether? A. I cannot say, but there were not more than three or four, besides the two I let in; I have not seen the person since, who came in with the watchman; the prisoners were found in three minutes. I then shut the garden up and went to bed without looking about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Though you did not look about, if a piece of white paper had laid on the ground you probably would have seen it? Yes; I should think the garden wall is twelve feet high; I am not certain of the height.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You let Finch and another person in? A. Yes; they were both watchmen; I let nobody else in; another watchman was put over the wall; I let nobody else in and saw nobody else but the prisoners - they were taken through the house to the watch-house - I shut the door when I admitted the watchmen - nobody but them and the prisoners could be in the garden without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How many did you let out at the front door? A. Five - three watchmen and the two prisoners.</p>

            . I am a watch-house-keeper. On the 12th of March, Crawley and Dunn were brought to the watch-house; Crawley's hand was cut and bloody; it was quite a fresh cut; he washed it in the morning, and while he was washing it I said, he had made a bad job of it; he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I don't care if I get off for life." Dunn did not hear this conversation - I searched Crawley and found some figs in his pocket; I went to Mr. Brice's house with a crow bar and implements which were brought to me by the different watchmen; I applied the crow bar to a lock which had been broken open, and the wide end of it corresponded exactly with it; Goff was brought to the watch-house before the other two; I examined his hand - it was cut; he said he had knocked his hands by some means or other, a day or two before; but it was a fresh cut, and appeared to have been grazed with glass, or something sharp; there was blood all round his finger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What do you mean by being grazed? A. I suppose it was cut by glass or something; there was blood on it; I consider it a cut - it might be done by his running against any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. If a man had got over a wall he might have grazed it? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Euston-square on the night in question, and in consequence of information I went on the flats of the stables, and found Goff laying down in a gutter on the top of the stable - he was awake and laying on his belly - I laid hold of him and took him through No. 21, to the watch-house, with Liers' assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How many watchmen were there in the street? A. I do not know; Liers and I were the only two who went on the flats. I saw Hooper in front of the house; Liers and I were the two first who got to the mews - we left Hooper at the end; we went round as Mr. Brice said they were escaping behind; I went round in three or four minutes: I got on the flats with a lamplighter's ladder; we called to him to bring his ladder. I saw nobody in the mews till the prisoners were secured; I might have seen half a dozen people in the mews when I went into the stables; I found Goff in the gutter on the stables of No. 21.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in the same position as a man would be who fell? A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Mr. Brice's back window broken? A. Yes; there is a landing leading from the window to the flats. Goff said nothing about tumbling down, but laughed when I laid hold of him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Pancras new-church. On the 12th of March I went on the flats of these stables, with Beeton, and found Goff laying on his belly; he made no resistance: I asked him no question.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was he in liquor? A. Not that I observed; I believe the servant of No. 21 got up when we brought him down - there might be four or five persons about the mews. I got on the flats by the lamplighter's ladder; there were persons looking out of their windows. I went first to the front of the house - there were only two watchmen there then; I ran behind directly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the gentleman's servant on the leads after you took Goff? A. Yes, not before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. People were running in all directions? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am cook to Mr. Brice. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070060"></xptr>night of the 11th of March I shut the house up - I fastened the scullery window, and the door leading from the scullery to the kitchen; the glass was entire: I fastened the house all up, and was the last person up. I heard glass breaking in the morning, and got up - I found the window leading to the leads broken; it was secure when I went to bed. I left no jelly pots on the table; I left a cloth and jug there. When I got up I found the drawers open, and the doors broken open, the store closets broken open, two bottles, two candles, and several pots of preserves were on the dresser - a square of glass was cut out of the scullery window; the back kitchen window was broken: a door leading to the safe had a square of glass broken: the cellar was also broken open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is there any shutter to the scullery window? A. No, it looks into the front area; the window does not open. The glass was secure the night before. (Looking at the property,) here is a toast-rack, which was left on the kitchen table - this cruet frame was quite perfect the night before - these spoons are master's, they were found on the leads; this cruet top is his. The chisel was not in the house the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far is the house from the stables? A. It is no distance; there is only an area between them - it is not more than half the length of this place.</p>

            . I took the prisoners through Drummond-street in the way to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>MR. BRICE. Here is the direction on the paper containing the cake,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Johnson, No. 43, Holywell-street, Westminster;" it is the paper which inclosed it when she gave it to me. All the property produced is mine - I value it at about 5 l. The cruet frame is silver, and cost me 16 l. When I gave the alarm I heard glass break; that window is on the first floor landing-place, and leads to the lead flat, which communicates with the stables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is there a communication from your stair-case window to the flats? A. Yes; my yard is not above six feet wide; the stable is not above nine or ten feet from the house, and a flat leads from the window to the roof of it. The girl is mistaken in there being a yard half the length of this Court.</p>
               <p>GOFF'S Defence. I had been to Highgate to take a pair of shoes home to a young woman - I supped there, and got rather intoxicated, and as I came through this square I heard an alarm - several people ran down the stable yard; they put a ladder up, and I, being intoxicated, ran up the ladder, fell down, and was immediately seized by two watchmen; several people saw me go up the ladder, but I was so drunk I had not power to speak for them to be here to prove it.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Goff a good character, and three deposed the same for Crawley.</p>

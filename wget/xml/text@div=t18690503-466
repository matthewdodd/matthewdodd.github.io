I live at 6, Brown's Lane, Spitalfields, and am a cap maker—on 17th April I was in Artillery Street—two men came up to me all of a sudden, one on one side and one on the other—Barratt was the one on my left—he snatched my chain—it broke, and he ran away—this is part of the chain, the other part is gone—I saw him in custody after.</p>

I was in Artillery Street on this night, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw Barratt running—I ran after him along Dorset Street into French Alley—when he got to the top he turned round and walked back, and struck me on the cheek as hard as he could; I struck him back—he kicked me, and I kicked him and said if he kicked me I would kick his legs off—Mr. Osborne came up, and I took him to the station—at the station he said, if he had taken any of the chain, he had not got it; he did not know where it was—he also said, "I don't think you ought to say anything about the assault, I think you have hurt me as much as I have you"—I had charged him with stealing the chain.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 23d of June, at a quarter to twelve o'clock, I met the prisoner. I had just before counted my money in Tottenham court-road—she asked me to give her something to drink—I declined, it being so late—she said she did not mind, she had got the key, I could go with her—I went on to Gordon-square, and was standing there a minute—she took two good half-crowns and one bad one from me—she turned the corner—I turned, and gave her to the policeman—she produced the bad half-crown, and said I gave her that; but I had given her none.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you give me a bad half-crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had nothing to drink—I never treated you to any gin and cloves, nor went into any public-house after I left my friends—I did not say that I wanted to speak to you alone—she said she would cross the road to speak to her friend—I thought something was not right—I then missed my money, and pursued her, and overtook her about three hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I showed the bad half-crown to the policeman—he gave it to me back—you came and said "You have robbed me"—I said "I have not got any thing but five shillings of my own. "Witness. No.</p>
               <p>W. <hi rend="smallCaps">GLADDEN</hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 133.) I was on duty in Torrington-place, and was called by the prosecutor—he said he wanted to give the prisoner in charge for robbing him of three half-crowns, tow good and one bad one—she said that the prosecutor gave her the bad half-crown; but denied having any other money—I searched her at the station-house, and found two good half-crowns between her bonnet and the lining.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> In going to the station-house, there were a lot of persons who told me if I did not give the five shillings to my friend they would take it from me—I told the man that I had five shillings; not this man, but the other man that went up stairs with me—I took the five shillings out of my pocket and put it with my bonnet—I said the bad half-crown was what he gave me—I am not guilty of taking a farthing from him.</p>
               <p>(Eliza Greenwood, of Luck-street, and Rebecca Busby, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

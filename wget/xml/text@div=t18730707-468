                  </hi>. I am a carter, in the service of Mr. Johnson, of the Rectory Farm, Heston—I know John Humphreys, he was also a carter in Mr. Johnson's service—he and I lived on the farm, in a cottage adjoining the stables—on Sunday, 25th May, Humphreys breakfasted with me a little after 9 o'clock; we stayed together till about 11 o'clock, and then went into Cranford Lane to get some cabbages that I had had given me; that is about a mile from the farm—I got the cabbages, and at 12.30 we went into the Rising Sun public-house, in Cranford Lane, with Horton, the man who gave me the cabbages—there might have been a dozen persons there—I did not notice the prisoner there—Humphreys and I sat together the best part of the time—we stayed there till about 2.30—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for beer, which would be three pints, and the other man, I suppose, spent about the same; I don't know that he spent any more—I did not notice whether Horton paid for anything; he drank some of my beer—at 2.30 the house was cleared—Horton went indoors to his own house, and I saw nothing more of him that day—I bought some periwinkles—Humphreys did not like to see anybody eat winkles; he went on the road home, a little distance in front of me—he started three or four minutes before I did—I did not take any notice of him till I overtook him, which was about 200 yards from the public-house—there were some men standing against the railings which join the public-house—I don't know who they were—I heard no words pass between them and Humphreys—I did not notice the prisoner until he over<lb></lb>took us—I was then walking with Humphreys; he came behind us—I did not notice his state; he could walk very well—I and Humphreys were sober—the prisoner had his jacket on his left arm when he came up—the prisoner said something to Humphreys about a pretty shirt; that was all I heard—Humphreys said it was a pretty one, or some such words; I heard nothing else—the prisoner then knocked Humphreys down; he struck him in the face, in front of him; it was a blow that knocked him down, it was a blew between the eyes; he fell backwards—I might have been three or four yards away from Humphreys at the time—after striking Humphreys, the prisoner came and struck me—I had not said anything to him; he struck me under the eye, and again on the nose—at the time he struck me I had one hand in my pocket—I had not known the prisoner before; I am a stranger about there—when he struck me something fell from his hands, but the blood was running fast, and I never stopped to see what it was—it might have been a stone; it cut two places here, and one on the nose—I got over the gate, and walked across the field, wiping the blood off—Humphreys was lying in the road, where he was knocked down—he after<lb></lb>wards overtook me, and we walked across together—I dare say he overtook me in five or ten minutes, because he did not get over the same way that I did, he came over another gate—I saw blood running down from his nose and eye—we then walked home together—on arriving at the farm I did my horses, and I believe Humphreys did his—I did not see him again till between 5 and 6 o'clock on Monday night, when they came home with the horses—he was then in the stable—he was going to do his horses, but he was sitting down on the chaff-box, resting his arm on the corn bin—I and Cook spoke to him, but he never spoke to us—I could see he looked bad—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined at the inquest—I had never seen the prisoner before, that I know of—I believe his father and mother live some<lb></lb>where handy—I believe Horton is brother to the man who keeps the public-house—the landlord was there that day—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for three pints of beer, I don't suppose Humphreys paid for any more, we drank three pots between us three—I could not swear that the prisoner was not in the public-houses, or that he was, I can't swear who was in there—I did not hear the prisoner order a pint of beer for himself and a pot to take home to his father and mother, it might have been said, I never heard it—I did not see Humphreys take the pot of beer and drink it—he did not hand the pot to me that was bought for the prisoner, and for which he had paid—I don't know who paid for it, I don't know that I drank anything except what was paid for; I won't swear I did not, if he gave any other pot to me I might have drunk out of it, but not that I know of; nobody offered it to me that I know of, no more than what Humphreys offered me—Humphreys did not drink out of any other pot that I know of; I did not have my eye on him all the time; I did not hear Humphreys speak to anybody—I did not hear anybody say to Humphreys "Don't touch that, I am going to take it home "I did not hear Humphreys answer "You won't take this home, I shall drink it now I have got it"—the prisoner came behind us, struck Humphreys and knocked him down; I don't know what for, I was not knocked down—I did not ask him what he struck me for, I got over the gate and walked across the fields—Humphreys was a taller man than I, not quite so stout—I heard nothing more pass between the prisoner and Humphreys than I have stated, I was about three or four yards from them, nothing more could have passed without my hearing it; the prisoner immediately struck him and knocked him down—Humphreys joined me about ten minutes afterwards and we walked quietly home—we had no conversation about the man that struck us; we never mentioned a word about it going across the fields—we went about our ordinary work that evening—I saw Mr. Asbury, the foreman, in the afternoon, I did not tell him what had happened; I did not mention it to anybody—I did not live in the same house with Humphreys, he lodged in a house for the single carters and the boys—I was not drunk, nor was Humphreys.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Cranford Lane, and am a labourer, working for Messrs.

               <p>down—the prisoner had his jacket off at the time—after he had done this he turned round and came back towards home—I did not see him strike Parrant—I met the prisoner and told him he was a b----coward, and that for two pins I should slip into him for being such a coward—he did not say anything that I heard; I went on to Humphreys, he was lying on the ground, on the flat of his back—when I picked him up he did not know me for a second or two—Meads helped me pick him up, and then he turned round and said "Is that you <hi rend="italic">Nat</hi>" I said "It is me, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, my boy"—he turned round towards Church as he was going away and said "That man with the red shirt on has hit me"—I said "Never mind, go straight on home and I will see that no one interferes with you," and as he went on home he over<lb></lb>took Parrant and they went home together—when the prisoner struck Humphreys he did not strike back again, he fell and there he laid—I never saw him again after that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner passed within about 5 yards of me, in the road; I had a full opportunity of seeing him, he was not carrying anything that I saw, he had nothing in his hand—Humphreys was not in my sight then, he had gone round the corner of the hedge—at the time I first caught sight of Humphreys, the prisoner was not a yard from him—Parrant was then over in the field, going towards the farm where he lived—I was not near enough to hear anything pass between the prisoner and Humphreys; after the prisoner struck Humphreys, he turned back to meet me and passed me—Humphreys was then lying on his back, on the ground—I am certain that the prisoner never went back to him or to Parrant—Humphreys was a large-framed man, but not over and above powerful; he was apparently much stronger than the prisoner—I have known the prisoner eleven years, he is about twenty or twenty-one—his father and mother live near me, he works in a brickfield at Heston—I don't know that he is in the habit of coming over on a Sunday to see his parents, I had not seen him over there all the summer till this Sunday; every other summer he has been at home; he worked with his father for several years—I know the landlord of the.

                  </hi>. I was fellow-carter with Humphreys, in the employ<lb></lb>ment of Mrs. Johnson—on Monday, 26th, he was at work—I asked him how he was, and he said his head was very bad where they kicked him—he was very bad on the Monday evening—I sat with him by his bed till he died, at 10. 15 on the Monday night—he died in my arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was not in the habit of drinking, that I know of—he has had a little sometimes—I have not seen him drunk above once or twice—I did not see him at all on the Sunday—I was at the farm on the Sunday, and did my horses at 12 o'clock and again at 4 o'clock—I did not notice whether Humphreys was there or not, I was over at the other side of the yard—I did not hear of what had happened to him on the Sunday afternoon—I slept in the same room with him on the Sunday night—he went to bed as usual—I don't know but what he was sober when he went to bed—I did not see anything the matter with him—I called him up at 4 o'clock on the Monday morning—he got up soon after and went about his work as usual, and drove two horses harrowing—he worked along with another carter up to 1 o'clock, when he came home—it was then he said his head was very bad—that was the first time he said anything to me about his head.</p>

I am a labourer—on 25th May I saw Humphreys and Parrant going towards Cranford and the prisoner following them, walking at a good rate, as if to overtake them—I followed about 200 yards from them—I saw nothing of the transaction—Humphreys was on the ground when I came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, and live at Spring Grove, Isleworth—on 27th May I was requested to make <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body of the deceased—he appeared to have been a healthy man—I examined the head—exter<lb></lb>nally I found an extravasated wound, extending about 3 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187307070033"></xptr>
               <p>above and rather behind the ear—there was no contusion, simply a bruise—on opening the head I found blood extravasated beneath the cellular tissues—I found a fracture of the skull, extending from the petrous portion of the temporal bone, just above the external meatus, corresponding with the external injury—blood was extensively extravasated in the interstices of the bone, and also within the skull, pressing on the brain—the piece of skull was not knocked out, but the fracture had a triangular form, so that the piece of bone was, as it were, tesselated; although it was detached it could not be moved or shaken, it was tight—the injuries I discovered in the head were sufficient to cause death—I should say the fracture was caused by a blow inflicted by some blunt instrument, probably by a kick; a kick would do it, but whatever it was it must have been a very powerful blow—that portion of the skull is one of the thickest and hardest, a little above that it is thinnest—if a man received such a blow he would not necessarily feel the consequences directly, he might go about for some time afterwards—I think he might go about his work, and be in the condition that the witnesses have described on the Monday—the way in which I should explain it would be thus: in all probability the injury ruptured a vessel slightly, but that that dosed up again, and, owing to the motion, whether it was by working or jolting, or some other cause, the vessel re<lb></lb>opened, and after a time blood was poured out in a sufficient quantity to press upon the brain, and so cause death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The skull was extensively fractured; not all round the head, it did not go to the back part of the skull—the fracture was only just where the injury was inflicted—I had not heard any account of the transac<lb></lb>tion before I gave my evidence—I had heard some of the witnesses say he was kicked—I should scarcely say a simple fall was sufficient to have caused such an extensive fracture—it might have been caused by his falling on some hard substance, but less likely than a kick—I think he might go about his work after receiving the injury—I have known a case of the kind—I remember one when I was a student in the hospital, the man had sustained fracture of the skull, and had gone about his work for some hours afterwards—that is some years ago—that is the only case that has come under my personal treatment—I should not think it unlikely or improbable that a man could go about his work without complaining for hours after the injury—it would be an exceptional case, I admit, because, as a general rule, blood would be poured out immediately, in a sufficient quantity to cause death, but in this case it was not so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the man was struck violently, or fell heavily against a stone, that might cause the injury, but until the blood began to press on the brain he might go about—I observed some marks on the bridge of his nose, as if from a blow—it was not an injury of much moment; the bones were not injured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am an M. D.—I was called in on Monday night by Mr. John<lb></lb>son's foreman, about 8 o'clock—I saw the deceased; he was propped up in bed, and dying—I ordered something for him, but before the messenger arrived he was dead—I at once saw that he was suffering from effusion on</p>

               <p>the brain, through blood or serum, but it was impossible to decide without a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I was present at the examination—I saw the fracture—I am in partnership with Dr. Granville, and I agree with his evidence that the fracture caused death, and it is distinctly laid down that you may fracture your skull and go about for two days, unless there is injury to the brain itself—it may not be detected even for five mouths afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The way in which I explain it is this: that the man, when he fractured his skull, also ruptured a small vessel, that nature caused that small vessel to retract, and only a very small portion of blood was thrown out; if a larger quantity had been thrown out insensibility would have come on at once, but there being only a small quantity effused he was able to go about his ordinary duty; having had no contusion, he was perfectly sensible; but I imagine that the exertion of getting up in the morning and going out with the horses caused the little clot in the vessel, which nature had supplied to close it up, to be disturbed—if that had con<lb></lb>tinued he would probably have been alive now—I agree with Mr. Glanville that a man may fracture his skull and go about his ordinary duty, provided there is no effusion—if a large vessel had been ruptured, probably he would have died in ten minutes, but this was a minute vessel—I had heard an account of the case when the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was made—if I had heard nothing about it I should have considered that the injury had been inflicted some twenty-four hours before, or something of that sort—I believe it might have been caused by a kick, and quite as likely by a fall—there must have been very great violence—I should say a violent kick would stun the man—I should say it would be very unlikely that he would be able to walk away in ten minutes, as if nothing had happened—it would all depend on the amount of concussion—I should not necessarily expect a longer interval—I should in the majority of cases, but this was an exceptional one, and we are surprised at so many things now-a-days.</p>

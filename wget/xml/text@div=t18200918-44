On the 18th of August, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was going home, up Fish-street-hill, the prisoner laid hold of my arm, took her scarf from her neck, and gave it to a young woman who was with her; she continued with me, and in <placeName id="t18200918-44-crimeloc240">King's Head-court</placeName>

I felt her hand in my pocket, and missed my pocket-book, I charged her with it, she denied it. I suppose she gave it to the other woman as she returned and gave her the scarf. I called the watchman and gave her in charge. I am sure it was safe when she met me.</p>

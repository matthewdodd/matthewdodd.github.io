                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). I went down to Leicester and saw the prisoners—I saw Cotton first—I asked him his name—he said, "Daniel Cotton"—I asked him if he had consigned two quarters of beef to Mrs. H. Matthews, of Newgate-market—he said he had, and had been for the account—I told him the meat had been seized and condemned as unfit for human food, that I was a detective officer of London, and had come to make inquiries for the purposes of the prosecution; that he could give me any explanation he chose, but that if he did do so I should use it against him—he had not been served with a condemnation note; I found it in the office of Messrs. Chaplin and Horne, and handed it to him—he said at first he would not take it, but afterwards he said that I had served it, and he might as well have it—I asked him from whom he had the meat—he refused to tell me—he said he did not have the other side, and refused to say whether it was sold for human food—he said he considered it fit for human food; it had been killed fairly, slaughtered, and that was enough—I saw Hill on Monday—I told him he need not tell me anything unless he liked—he is a jobbing butcher; Cotton is a labourer, but he buys meat at a slaughter-house in Leicester—I took down in writing what Hill said to me, and he signed it afterwards—this is it—he said, "On 27th March, Daniel Cotton, who lives near Russell-square, Leicester, asked me to send a side of beef to H. Matthews, Newgate-market," here showing the tally on the hamper—I pro<lb></lb>duced this label to him—he said, "I am obliged to go out of town, will you oblige me by giving the beef to Robert Denns, Chaplin and Horne's man?" that he stated it was a young bullock, and looked as if it had been slaughtered—he said he could eat such beef, but he should not like to do so, it was a bit wet on the back—it looked as if it had been cast in the straw-yard, but was stuck in time—sometimes they are cast and cannot get up again, and struggle till they are in a dying state—he said "Robert Denns, one of the porters at the railway, came for the beef, and he let me have it"—the tally was on the hamper when Cotton asked him to send it—he said, "I think I wrote D. Cotton on it?"—I was a butcher originally—"a bit wet" means that it is rotten; but when it is wet on the back it is very bad—he said it was wet on the back—I asked what he meant directly.</p>

I am in the employment of Chaplin and Horne, carriers, at Leicester—I know the prisoners—on 27th March I called at the Black Lion slaughter-house, Belgrave-gate, Leicester, to know if there was any meat to be sent to London—some of the butchers in the town use that slaughter-house; not all—I saw Hill—he said he wanted a hamper and cloth to send some meat to London—I procured them, and put the side of beef into the hamper—Hill wrote this, "D. Cotton, Leicester," on the bill—I sent it to London by the railway that night—a few days afterwards Cotton came to the office of Chaplin and Horne—I did not see him in the office; I saw</p>

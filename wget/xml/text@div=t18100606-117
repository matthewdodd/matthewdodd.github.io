I told him I would call up at breakfast time, and look at it, my son and I went at eight o'clock, it was a frame saw, I bought it of him for fifteen shillings, the next day he shewed me the other saw, it was a long saw, I gave him fifteen shillings for that, he told me the saws belonged to Thomas Hill he was gone to sea, his wife wanted him to sell them. On the 30th of May, an acquaintance of Awbrey's came by; and saw the saws, my son, and I were taken and committed to prison, and on the second hearing before the magistrate, we were discharged.</p>

            . The Foxe's were given into my custody. They said, they bought the saws of a man in Featherstone-street, young Fox went with me and shewed me the place; after he was committed, to No. 14, Featherstone-street. In a back room these men were kept in custody pretty nigh a week, I went twice with Fox to the prisoner's lodgings, I saw the wife, and she gave me evasive answers; I left word with the wife that these two men were going into the country to cut some deals for me, and that if he would meet me at the Jacob's Well, and bring the saw box that belonged to the long saw, I would advance the money for them, as they were short of money that bait took; I waited there till about half past ten, the prisoner came to the Jacob's Well, I laid hold of him; I asked him if he did not sell two saws to Fox; he said, no, it was a friend of his that sold them that would be there presently; he denied his name being Birt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that friend ever arrive - A. No, I took him into the kitchen, and told him he had led two innocent men into an error though his bad conduct; he said, that he had them of a woman to sell, her husband was gone to sea; I asked him where that woman lived; he said, he should not tell me, then I immediately handcuffed him and brought him away.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that woman here - A. No, they were brought to me where I live.</p>

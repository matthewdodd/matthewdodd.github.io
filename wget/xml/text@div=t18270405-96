I met the prisoner under the Piazza; he came up to me, and snatched at my watch; the chain broke, and he took the two seals, the key and ring. I picked up one of the rings, and the officer the other; he made off across Covent-garden, and was stopped there - he was not out of my sight. I did not see him drop the seals, but I picked up one at his feet; I am satisfied he is the man who took them - I only lost sight of him while he passed the pillar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where had you been spending your day? A. At different places; I had had two glasses of porter, and a share of two bottles of wine, between four or five of us, after dinner; I had not taken any supper - I considered myself sober; it was the act of an instant - he passed round one of the columns,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050055"></xptr>and between the coaches. I did not produce my watch before the Magistrate, but I showed the ring and seals.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty between eleven and twelve o'clock - I saw the prisoner run from the Piazza, through the rank of coaches, into the carriage-way, where I was standing; I secured him, and heard something fall on the stones. Wilson came up at the time, and I gave the prisoner to him; I picked up this seal and ring - the prosecutor appeared quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see it drop? A. No, I heard it - there was not a strong light; it was a very boisterous night, and the gas did not burn strong. I searched him, and only found a handkerchief on him.</p>

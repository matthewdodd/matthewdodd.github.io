                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—I remember the morning of 9th Oct.—William and Edward Jarrett, my brothers in law, had slept there, and William had breakfasted there—I do not remember whether the door of the breakfast room was open or shut that morning; it was usually left open—after breakfast my brother William asked me to let the prisoner go with him, to show him the Downham-road—after her return I went with her up to the bed-room, after she had had her breakfast—it was then about a quarter before 10 o'clock—I smelt a disagreeable smell, and opened the window—I then proceeded with the prisoner to strip the bed, and I saw scorches on the bed, on the opposite side to the door—I went round to that side to look, and found the edge of the mattress had been burnt which had been principally underneath—while I had been at breakfast that morning the prisoner had an opportunity of going up-stairs—I know that she had not filled the water jugs up to the middle of the day, and she had not emptied the slops at the time we went up—when the fire was discovered she said there had been a fire in the back-part of a house in the Downham-road; that a servant had set it on fire—I asked her how that was—she said it might be with a candle—I said, "Suppose these new things had been burnt, and we were not insured, what a pity!"—the prisoner said, "0, you are not insured?"—I then examined all the bedclothes very minutely, and there was no stain or spot of anything on them—I took the counterpane, one sheet, and two blankets from the bed, and put them on a chair at the bottom of the bed—I am quite sure there was no mark of any turpentine or anything on them—the sheets had been put on clean, on the day before—I then went in the next room and dressed—I then went down-stairs, and the prisoner too—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270123"></xptr>
               <p>afterwards sent her up stairs to fetch a letter, which had come while we were up stairs—about 12 I smelt something—I asked the prisoner if she smelt anything—she said, "Yes;" she supposed it was next door; they were burning old boots or shoes, for they were always burning some rubbish or another—I told her to look about, and she said there was a smoke—I went up stairs, and about one yard of the sheet was burning away—it was not flaming, but smouldering away very fast, and I discovered spots of oil in different parts—in my opinion it was oil from a lamp—the prisoner had been dressing the lamp just before—I staid in the room then till my brothers came, and they examined the room with me—after they were gone I examined the prisoner's dress, and found some oil on her dress—I rubbed the sheet against her frock, to see if it would leave a mark, it did leave a mark, but not such a one as I saw on the sheet before—the prisoner said it must be set on fire, and perhaps some one was up the chimney—about a quarter before 3 I sent the prisoner up to see if all was right—I had told her seven or eight times to go up, and just about five minutes before I smelt the fire the third time I sent her up, and she said all was safe, but previous to that she said they had burnt a pair of shoes at the next house—I said, "How was that?"—she said, "By putting them too near the fire the toes were burnt"—she laughed, and I thought she laughed at me for being nervous about it—when I went up stairs to the bed-room I found the side of the bedstead nearest to the door in flames, and the sheets were burning—I called for help, and took the burning sheets in my hand and threw them out of the back window—the prisoner came to the room—I called for water; there was none in the room—I told the prisoner to go for water—she left the room, and in the meantime I was calling for help, and the neighbours were knock<lb></lb>ing at the door—the prisoner did not open it, and I could not leave the room, for I was afraid the fire would get much higher, till I got the most inflammable things out of the room—I then went down to open the door and let the neighbours in—I do not know where the prisoner was then—she did not bring any water—she was asked several times to go for water, but she did not bring it—the door of the bed-room was red-hot when I went in the room, but being moved from the flames it went black immediately, in taking away the bed things that were burning, it went out—when I first went into the room the door was open towards the bed—when the prisoner came to the bed-room I heard a chuckle, as I thought—she was putting her apron or pinafore in her mouth, to prevent laughing, and I said to her, "What are you laughing at? is this a time for laughing?"—she said, "I was not laughing, but the smoke stifled me"—there had been no one in that room that morning but the prisoner, after William Garratt left, till my two brothers came home, at half-past 12, and left at I; that was after the second fire—the prisoner was to leave my employ on the following Saturday, and a girl was to succeed her whom I had had before; her name was Jemima—I know there was a jealousy between them—I had told the other girl that if Mary did not mind I should turn her away, and she had told Mary that if she did not mind she should have her place—I traced spots of oil on the sheets—I tasted the blankets afterwards, and found there was turpentine on them, but on the first occasion it was lamp-oil on the sheet, and on the other occasion turpentine on the blankets—the prisoner had told me throughout that it was not with her will that she left me, but her father did not like her being so far from home.</p>

               <p>the back-room—one of my brothers had been sleeping in the back-room for five weeks—then the other brother came, and those two had our room that night—I was in the habit of going to make the bed every morning—there was no particular work to be done that morning more than usual—my brothers were to sleep there again that night—we always breakfasted in the front kitchen—the water-jugs were filled in the morning, when the slops were taken down—I never filled them once that I remember—there is a small garden at our house—I might have gone into the garden about 10 o'clock but I do not remember it—the first time that I went up and smelt anything was about a quarter before 10—that was after the prisoner had been to the Downham-road with my brother—she was about twenty minutes gone—when I went up-stairs, at a quarter before 10, I found a disagreeable smell, and marks that the tick of the wool mattress had been burning—that was in the middle, between the palliasse and the horse-hair mattrass, on the top—I am in the habit of turning the bed up to air it, but not moving it—when I came down, I did not go up again till I smelt the second fire, which was at 12—I then found the sheet over the chair smouldering away very fast—it was not in a flame, but burning as fast as it could—of course I put that out—at a quarter before 3, I went up again, and found the sheets burning, and the door, and the palliasse, and bolster, and mattrass, and bedstead—it was the prisoner's duty to trim the lamp—she did so that morning—she was trimming the lamp while I was reading a letter, about half past 11—it was a large patch that I found on her dress, the size of my two hands—this was an upper room—I have two kitchens, two parlours, and two bed-rooms—I have known the prisoner since January—she appeared very careless and indifferent while all this was going on—she stood about, I thought she was calm and quiet because she was very much frightened, just as I was myself—I sent her to my husband after the fire—that must have been past 4.</p>

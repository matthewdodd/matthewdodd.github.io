When the constable came, I gave him charge of the prisoner, and he took every thing out of his bag; there were four or five pounds worth of clothes in the bag, and there was nothing more than my tobacco. That is all I have got to say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have told us all, I dare say? - A. All that I have got to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you told us all that belongs to this transaction? - A.Everything.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nobody in the box but himself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor in the room? - A. Yes, five others.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no quarrel in the tap-room? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any soldiers? - A. Two, one I have brought as a witness; they were as still as any thing could be; there was no fun going forward.</p>
               <p>Q. No abuse of the Jewish nation? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You expected to find it in the bag? - A. When I went out of the house, I was sure to find it in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he go to the fire? - A.Upon my oath he never left the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his beer warmed? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath will you swear he did not go to the fire, while his beer was warming? - A. I never saw him; he never left the box, as I told you before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him that he had better confess what he knew about it? - A. I said nothing at all; I said, let the consequence be what it would, he should go to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.This tobacco was for Mr. King? - A. Yes, I have got the permit.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Mr. King's, for the purpose of delivering the tobacco, why did you not deliver it? - A. Mrs. King was busy in the bar; she said, sit down, and I will pay for it by and by.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know the reason why; it might have been delivered, and paid for afterwards? - A.Because Mrs. King was busy at the time.</p>

             sworn. - I am a soldier belonging to the Coldstream regiment; I was drinking a pot of beer at Mr. King's, in Brewer-street, Golden-square, about one o'clock, when the prisoner came in, and went out again; about two minutes after the prisoner came back; he called for a pint of porter; he took the box to himself where this parcel laid, fronting the bar-door; he changed sixpence, and asked Mrs. King for his change; he then went out, and this gentleman got up, and asked Mrs. King whether she had seen his parcel.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was Mrs. King about all this time? - A.She was in the bar, and walking about the tap-room about her business; she did not seem to be busy about any thing in particular, only serving the Jew with a pint of porter; there were about five people in company.</p>
               <p>Q. There was not a throng of business just at the moment? - A. No, there was not; they draw the beer in the bar; as soon as the prisoner was gone, the prosecutor asked Mrs. King whether she had the parcel, and she said, no; he said he was certain that the Jew must have got it; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200104"></xptr>went out, and brought the prisoner back; that is all I saw of it; he said, I will give you any thing to make it up, for consider my wife and family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The poor fellow had a feeling for his wife and family, and begged the prosecutor to have mercy on him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know a little what we mean by skylarking? - A. Yes, some soldiers are fond of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many soldiers were in the room? - A. There was only one, of the name of Dawson; the prisoner went out at first, and then came in again, and called for his beer; he was out about two minutes; his bag was full of clothes; I saw him come in with his bag.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner went out the first time, did neither of you, or Dawson, say, it would be a good thing to skylark the Jew? - A. No, never was a word of the kind spoken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see a hat produced? - A. He never shewed a hat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you remember the man coming in with the tobacco? - A. He was in before I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a box between him and his tobacco? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by skylarking? - A. Sometimes persons play the rogue with each other, making a derision, or joke of a man.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hutchinson.) I should like to look at your permit; you say this happened on Tuesday the 5th of March, and I see this permit bears date the 4th, and was to be in use only one hour - how came you not to go on the 4th? - A.Because I had not an opportunity.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to deceive me, and say it was all right, when the permit was nothing but waste paper? - A.Because I had not an opportunity to take it before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been in this country for forty years, and I never wronged any body of a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18030420-93-verdict498" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Kingsland-road. On Saturday, the 26th of November, I proceeded to Woolwich, with a person named Brown, to inquire about my son, who had left home—we went to the barracks of the sappers and miners, and to the Edinburgh Castle—we were about Woolwich two or three hours—we left the Edinburgh Castle be<lb></lb>tween eight and nine o'clock, and proceeded on the high-road to London; and after proceeding for about twenty minutes, we were knocked down in the road, near the toll-bar, by two men—I had hold of Brown's arm at the time and we were both knocked down together—Robert Taylor is the man who struck me—I did not see the other man—I did not hear him say a word—I was quite sober—Robert came behind me, the other man came in front—one hit Brown, the other hit me, at the same time—we were both down newly at the same time—I cannot tell whether he struck me with his hand or with any<lb></lb>thing in it—I felt a blow, first on the back part of my neck, and next on the temple—I received several blows—I do not know how many, I was down twice in the road—I did not observe where the men came from—they came on me of a sudden—I was on the opposite side at the time—I fell down, and got up again, and the second time Robert Taylor fell on me—I think I was up again as soon as he was—then we took hold of one another—he ran, and I ran with him—I had hold of him—he ran into the White Horse public-house—I called out for protection—I do not know what he said or did—he went away in a few minutes—I got some water, and washed one of my eyes in a tub that stood on the counter—I was smothered all over with blood—I could not see out of either eye—I ran in the dark—I did not search my pockets then—I did not see Robert Taylor again till he was in the station—at the time this took place I had eight sovereigns in my trowsers' pocket, and two loose in my coat pocket—they were so when I went out—I had no occasion to spend any part of those while out, nor yet of the two, till I got to the doctor's—I had a few shillings in the pocket with the two sovereigns—I did not examine my pocket at Woolwich—I had the two sovereigns there—I had them after the men went away—I did not lose them at all—I never took notice of the eight sovereign after I left London till I got to the station, after this was over—I then searched my pockets, and missed the eight sovereigns—I had not given these people any occasion for what was done to me—I never spoke to them, or to any in<lb></lb>dividual, from the time I left the Edinburgh Castle—I had never seen them before—I never was in that road before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, living in Cumberland-street, Hackney-road. On the 26th of Nov. I accompanied Carter to Woolwich—we went from the Blackwall railway at a quarter-past one o'clock—we left Woolwich a little after eight—we came from the Edinburgh Castle down the street to a small avenue, and Sergeant Stanley showed us the way to the Lower Road to go to Greenwich—we were in the middle of the high-road, arm-in-arm—we were perfectly sober—about fifty yards before we arrived at the turnpike-gate, we Were walking in the middle of the road, not noticing anybody—the two prisoners were by the side on the foot-path—one of them, which I cannot say, jumped from the left side of the road—I was walking on the side on which they were—one of them said, "Here are the two b—'s," or something of that kind—the prisoner Edward hit me in the neck, and then knocked me down, I believe with his fist—I believe Robert attacked Mr. Carter, but being knocked down, I can only remember getting on my hands and knees to get up again, endeavouring to rise, when Edward Taylor kicked me above the left eye—here are the marks—I became insen<lb></lb>sible, and was also kicked in my back very dreadfully—when I came to my senses, I had been dragged to the road-side by a person named Smith, who was standing by me—I then partly recovered, and immediately called out "Murder! Police!" several times—I followed up the road the way Edward Taylor had gone—Smith pointed out the way to me—I overtook him—Smith was there at the time, but whether by me at the moment I cannot say—I knew Edward Taylor again—I have no doubt he is the person—he ad<lb></lb>mitted at the very moment he was the person who struck me—I then said I would never leave him with my life—I charged him with assaulting me without any cause, and attempting to commit a robbery—the policeman came up and took him to the station—he did not do anything when he struck me—I had not spoken to any person at all previous to their rushing on me—I had never seen them before to my knowledge—I lost nothing—I do not remember anything being done to my person while on the ground—I found my waistcoat open, and my handkerchief torn from my neck when I came to my senses.</p>

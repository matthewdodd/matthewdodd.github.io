               <p>You must speak out more plain what you mean by motions? - I saw him put his hands upon the cow's back, and wriggle himself about; he was about ten minutes in that posture, I believe it might be more; I did not see him go away from the cow; I got out of the hayloft, and ran in doors to get somebody to come and take him.</p>
               <p>Did you stand watching him ten minutes? - Yes: I called this young man

               <p>What posture was he in then? - His trowsers were down and he was doing up his breeches; I seized hold of him, and this young man came and laid hold of him directly; he asked what we were going to do with him; I charged him with the fact, and he said he was guilty; he said it was the first time, but he said he would do so no more: we then took him to the justice; when we were taking him up the yard, he strove to get away from us, but two other witnesses came and assisted us; we took him into a public house.</p>

I have known the prisoner two years and a half or three years—he has used my house occasionally—on Saturday evening, the 5th of January, I saw him—he said he was in the army, in the 90th regiment of foot, and produced me an army order—I believed it to be genuine, and advance dhim, at his request, six sovereigns—he went away, leaving me in possession of this order—he called again, and wanted 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I got an officer, and took him into custody—I parted with my money, believing the representa<lb></lb>tion he made to be true.</p>

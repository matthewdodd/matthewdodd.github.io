               <p>I am a labourer belonging to the East India Company, on the 3d of this month the prisoner was at work in the cellars, and he came up and told us it was time to come to work; we told him we would go down by and by, then he went away towards a vault, the vault is two yards off; going before we observed he had a vast great lump here behind, his breeches were out so that he could scarce walk; he stood in the vault about three minutes, and we watched him if he came out with this lump behind, and he did, and he went down Cree Church Lane; I followed him just behind him, and at the bottom of Cree Church Lane, I lost sight of him; I turned short round the corner, I went under an arch, and there were a couple of women standing, and I went three doors beyond the arch, and there I saw the prisoner in a chandler's shop, then I retreated back, and I saw him go by with the lump gone out of his breeches; the other witnesses and I ran immediately to the chandler's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150072"></xptr> shop, and I went to the man and said, says I, do you buy pepper? no, says the man, I cannot say I do; I saw it lay in the scale, and the woman threw it down off the counter, and she pulled and I pulled; the master ran away immediately, and never said a word; we did not stop the prisoner then, but when the constable seized him, he said I know of no offence, and when he came to the India-house he said it was his property, and he sold it to a Jew for one shilling a pound; he said he bought it at Blackwall the day before, which was a red letter day, and gave one shilling a pound for it; then he was ordered in before the Committee; I was not there: then he was ordered in before the Solicitor, and the Solicitor said, undo your breeches, and he did, and there came out five pepper corns.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose pepper it was? - It is black pepper.</p>
               <p>I know that, but who does it belong to? - I cannot say whether he did not buy it at Blackwall.</p>
               <p>What quantity is there generally in a package? - Sometimes two hundred and three quarters, or three hundred.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any of those packages cut open or broke? - We should never have looked in that hole unless we had cleared the hole out; it is very hard to swear to pepper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. I believe all black pepper is pretty much alike.</p>
               <p>Court. What were you in the pepper warehouse? - I was employed in sifting, and putting it forward for sale.</p>
               <p>That was your employment and his at the time? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Are there any of the people belonging to the shop here? - No, they are absconded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Pray what character had the prisoner? - I never knew him but to be an honest man.</p>
               <p>Is it at all common to have some of the pepper corns about your person when you go home at night? - I will not disannul that, you do not hear me say he stole pepper; he may have pepper come out of his knees, and his stockings and shoes too.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not he say, when he was examined, that he bought it as smuggled pepper? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he ever deny having sold it? - No; he said he sold it to a Jew over night; as soon as he saw the bag going from Billiter-lane he said it was his property, for he bought it yesterday, and sold it to a Jew.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not he superintend you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court. You see, Gentlemen, here is no evidence at all against the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, in the employ of the North London Railway. On Monday, 8th Dec., a communication was made to me between 12 and 1 o'clock—in consequence of that I went to a bridge that crosses the railway, and saw the prisoners there, and five more boys—I watched them for some time; I saw Williams place 2 bricks, and M'Carthy three bricks, on two of the rails, one of the up rails, and one of the down rails, in a place where there is a very sharp curve in the line—this brick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is what is called a clinker—I went down to the rail and took the prisoners into custody—M'Carthy said, "It was not me; it was the other boy, he put more on than I did"—Williams said, "No, it was you; you know you put nine on, and I only put seven"—what I saw them put on was five pieces—a train had passed by shortly before—trains run along that line sometimes every quarter of an hour: some trains more frequently—I gave the prisoners into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a guard in the employ of the North London Railway Company. On that Monday I was acting as guard to a train—I passed that spot about 12.33—we struck against a lot of brickbats on the line—we threw them about in different directions—there is a life guard in front of the engine, which struck the bricks—they flew into pieces—I do not know whether they were bricks of this kind—I did not see them when they were on the line—they were broken in all directions, some pieces flew into the train, and some into the engine—we had passengers in the train—it was between Highbury and Kingsland, at a very sharp curve of the line—that was a very dangerous place to put them.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 1st of July, about half past eight o'clock in the evening: I was opposite Baising-house court, Kingsland-road - I saw the prisoner come from the direction of that court, with a load on his head; I asked what he had there, he said cotton, and that he had it from Mr. Blackmore, Backhill, Billingsgate - I asked where he was going to take it; he and a man who was with him both said to Mr. Walker's, Norfolk-place, Curtain-road - I said they must go with me to the station-house; they turned and went about one hundred yards, and some persons said they were fools to carry the cotton - let the Policeman carry it; they then threw down the cotton, and the other man walked away - the prisoner attempted to go another way, but I seized and kept him till assistance came; he said he was carrying it for London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. There was another man with him? A. Yes, who turned out to be a servant of the prosecutors' - the prisoner did not say London had employed him till he got to the station; I ascertained the next morning, that the prisoner and London both worked at one cotton factory.</p>

The prisoner was in our employ for about five days; he had access to the warehouse - the greater part of this cotton has been through a process of manufacture and we cannot tell it so well as in its raw state, but this part is raw, and I know it to be ours; it is a rare description of cotton, we had bought about one hundred bags of it at Christmas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a man named London in your employ? A. Yes, we have lost sight of him; I believe this cotton to be ours, but I would not swear to it - we have two manufactories, but only one for the manufacture of wadding; I expect this was taken from Cooper-street, City-road - London had access to the property.</p>
               <p>THOMAS METCALFE. I am foreman to the prosecutors. I have examined the cotton, and believe it to be theirs; I suspected that some cotton was missing - this bag, in which it was found, is similar to ours, and I believe is one of ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose in bulk, your masters had a great deal of this cotton? A. Yes; I found the bales reduced faster than I expected, from what was manufactured; we employ forty persons or more - I generally give out the cotton, and it is open to all up stairs; London and the prisoner both knew the premises.</p>

            . I am a cotton-merchant, and live at No. 64, Tower-street - I used to reside near Billingsgate; there is no such place as Back-hill there - I do not know the prisoner; I never employed him to carry cotton to Mr. Walker - there is no other cottonmerchant of my name.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that London had employed him to carry the cotton, which he informed him he had bought of Mr. Blackmore.</p>

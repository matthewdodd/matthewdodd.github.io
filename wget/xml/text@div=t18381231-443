                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Royal Hospital-row, and am the wife of John Hughes. On Saturday night, the 22nd of December, at half-past eight o'clock, I was at Mr. Thompson's, the pawnbroker's, stand<lb></lb>ing in the first box—I had one shilling and one half-crown in my pocket, which was mostly behind me, but rather to my right side—no one but the prisoner was behind me—there was a young person in front of me, in the box—the prisoner left the box first—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my hand and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In my pocket—they were both lion shillings, and both old half-crowns—I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 71/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

               <p>was there young man came round to open the door—I am sure the prisoner is the person that was behind me—I saw him on the step of Mr. Thompson's door, three minutes after I went out, and accused him of robbing me of a shilling and a half-crown—he gave me a push and ran away—I followed him, calling "Stop thief" he ran round Union-street, and was taken at the corner of Westborn-street—he was searched in my presence, and the shilling and half-crown found in his right shoe—he said his sister gave it him—he told many different stories—he said, when he was taken, that he had not got one farthing, that he meant to pledge his handkerchief off his neck to get some victuals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach proprietor. The prisoner has been in my service about seven months—I gave him warning to quit last Mon<lb></lb>day-week, I think it was the 7th of December—he was employed last Satur<lb></lb>day-week in clipping a gelding belonging to me—he was generally employed about my horses during the whole month—I did not myself set him to clip the gelding—he left my service last Saturday, but he said he had be<lb></lb>gan to clip the gelding, and should like to finish it, if it was agreeable to me—I said, "Well, you may come on Monday, and I will pay you"—he did not come on Monday, but on Tuesday I saw him clipping the gelding about twelve o'clock, and I saw the gelding dead about five o'clock that after<lb></lb>noon—no person was employed in clipping it besides the prisoner—two lads were employed to hold it—I saw the prisoner the same afternoon with the officer—I used no threat or promise to induce him to confess—I asked how he came to do it—he said he had killed my house, and he was ex<lb></lb>tremely sorry for it, and that he had done it in agitation of passion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How old is he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe about nineteen years—he worked for me seven months—I found him a very quiet lad till within the last three or four weeks, and then he did not come to work as usual—that was the reason I parted with him—I asked why he neglected his business, he gave me no answer—I said, "I am afraid you have given way to a party"—he said, "I have, to a singing party"—I said, "If that is the case, you cannot attend to my business"—I liked him very much—he was a very quiet lad—It was an omnibus gelding—I gave sixteen guineas for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Clipping a horse's belly it is a very delicate operation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than clipping the hoof—he told me he had clipped horses before—he never did one for me before—I do not think he was there was there on Monday—he was constantly about the horses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had been of a malicious disposition he might have killed horses before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt of it—the boys who held the horse are young—It was a quiet horse, and did not want much holding—I did not engage the boys to do it—I did not say, if the prisoner's friends compensated me for the loss of the horse I would settle the matter—they came to me—I do not recollect saying so—I will not positively say I did not—I said I did not want to hurt him—they came with his mother crying—I did not say I liked him very much—I might say I did not want to hurt him—I saw his uncle, aunt, mother in a public-house, in Redcross-street—I know it was his mother—I do not know who the other two were—I did not say I should be satisfied if I could have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to me—they offered me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would not take it—I never said I would take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not say I was agreeable to come to terms, and would take 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and a bill for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months—I said there were the lawyer's expenses; if they liked to give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and give me security I should be satis<lb></lb>fied if they would give me the value of the horse—I said I would take it at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month if they would give security for it—they said they could give no security at all—I do not know whether Bradley was present when the prisoner said he had killed the horse in the "agitation of passion"—I heard</p>

               <p>him, (Bradley,) tell the Magistrate that he said he had done it in the heat of the moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the boy state that he was clipping the belly of the horse, when the horse reared, and plunged on the scissors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard such a thing—I never said I did not believe he stabbed it maliciously, but that he might have hurt it with the scissors, thinking he was using one end of the scissors instead of the other—I did not say any thing of the sort—I do not know that he clipped the belly—It certainly is about the most delicaate part of the horse.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the wound in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between the ribs just behind the near fore leg—his words were, "Master I am extremely sorry for what I have done, but I done it in the heat of passion, and am ex<lb></lb>tremely sorry for it"—I discharged him on Saturday, the 5th of December—my son gave him a week's warning before—during that week he had been at work as usual.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farrier. I was sent for last Tuesday week, and saw the house dead—I saw it opened afterwards—there was a hole between two ribs, which went through the skirts, and caused a deal of blood—the wound was four of five inches deep, and about an inch or an inch and a half wide—I think that wound was the cause of its death, as it was perfectly sound in its inside—It had the appearance of being made with sharp scissors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the horse appear as if it had been clipped about the belly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not particularly notice—It had been clipped nearly all over—I had seen the horse before—In general a horse stands quiet to be clipped—I am not in the habit of seeing them clipped—I have seen two or three people hold them when being clipped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beadle. I was present when the prose<lb></lb>cutor had a conversation with the prisoner—I used no promise or threat—he said he had killed the horse, and was very sorry for it, that it was done in the hurry of the moment, and he would sooner have given 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if he had it, then it should have happened—his words were, "It was done in the agitation," or, "hurry of the moment, "one or the other—and at the time I apprehended him on Tuesday evening, the 8th of December (the prosecutor's son pointed him out to me) I asked if he was the party who caused the death of the horse—he said, "Yes" he was very sorry for it—his expression was, "It it was done in the irritation," or, "hurry, of the moment," I will not say which.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there a <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> somebody in the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he called out for <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> to come—I have not been living with Mr. Morrison since—I do not recollect saying before the Magistrate that the horse plunged, and ran on he scissors—It was very restive, and plunged—the prisoner was at that moment engaged in clipping the belly—the hours plunged, and got away from me—I do not recollect saying, "It ran on the scissors," and I did not believe the prisoner ran the scissors into the horse—I do not recollect it—I remember Mr. Starling attending for the prisoner—he did not put any questions to me to my knowledge—he asked if it might have happened from the horse's plunging on the scissors; and I said, "Yes.

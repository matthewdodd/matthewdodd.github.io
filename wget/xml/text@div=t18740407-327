                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 1, Pear Tree Street, Lambeth—on Saturday night, the 21st March last, I was in the prisoner's company in a little beer-shop at the corner of Pear Tree Street—I went after some biscuits for a gentleman, and when I came back she was drinking with another man—he went out, and I said "You had better go along with that man for good"—words ensued, and I left her—next Sunday I saw her and would not speak to her—on the Monday she came running up to me, just as I was going to step on to brewer's dray, and struck a knife into my shoulder—I saw the knife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is my own knife—I have lost it now for sometime—there was no person at all there when she stabbed me—she ran away afterwards—I was taken to the police station and my wounds were attended to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not work for anybody now—it is about six months since I did any work—I have known this young woman a long time—she lives with her father, and is a very hard working girl—for the last six months she has not been supporting</p>

               <p>me—she has given me money for a bit of <hi rend="italic">bacca</hi> several times—on my oath I have not gone to her house and demanded money from her—she has given me money, but not at her house—I have been to her house and asked her to come out with me—I never beat her because she has not given me money, but I own I have hit her—I was what they call courting her—I do not know whether she wanted to get rid of me—I have never threatened to be the death or her if she did not give me money—I did not stab her on the 7th March—I caught her with my left knuckle on the eye, and it raised this lump, as you see—I do not know whether she had to go to the hospital for it—I was sorry for what I had done to her afterwards—it was one Saturday night when I cut her in the eye about a fortnight or three weeks before she stabbed me—we had been together before she stabbed me all right and quiet—I had not knocked her down and kicked her that day—it was on a Saturday when I struck her—she came in to row with me—I had not said before the affair happened "If she did not give me money I would knock her down"—I do not know whether there was a woman named Donohoo there at the time—I was going out of the beershop when it was done—I will swear I did not knock her down with the knife in my hand and fall upon her—she did not catch hold of me and I dropped the knife from my hand—I swore before the magistrates that there was a gentleman present, but there was no woman.</p>

On Monday, 23rd March, I was on duty near the Victoria Theatre, Lambeth—I saw the prisoner throw a knife away, and I pursued her—she stopped when I got within about a dozen yards of her, and picked it up again 'and closed a blade—she had the knife in her left hand when I took her—she said she wished she had cut his throat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in Blackfriars Road—on 23rd March I was called to the police-station to see the prosecutor—I found him suffering from a contused wound on the shoulder, which might have been inflicted by this knife.</p>

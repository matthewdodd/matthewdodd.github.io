When I was there the old gentleman said, go to your old bed where you used to sleep before, my lodgers all will not be in to-night. I went to sleep in the bed; the prisoner came in and laid alongside of me. I had about four pound in silver in my pocket. I pulled my waistcoat off, and laid it by the bed side, and then the next morning I asked the landlord what o'clock it was; he said it was almost five o'clock; I said I am in time. We work on Sunday morning in mackarel time. I asked the landlord if any body had been at home while I was asleep; he said his lodger came home at half past twelve. As I was going to my work I met one of my fellow servants: he asked me where I was going; I said, down to the Gate; he said, there is nothing to do there, there are no beans come up. I returned home. Coming up the Minories I met the prisoner; I did not know then that he was the lodger of the old gentleman's. The prisoner told me he lodged with old Mr. Tiller. I said to the prisoner, I'll take a drop with you at the next public-house; he said he did not like to go there. I then said, suppose we treat old Mr. Tiller with a drop; he said he would not be up. The patrol met me; he said he would see me home. He came with me to the top of the alley. I told the patrol I had been robbed in the night, and I thought this was the man that robbed me. He searched him, and could find nothing upon him but a crown paper of halfpence and eighteen pence in silver. The constable came; he said he had a bag of silver in the watchhouse. The constable coming down stairs picked up a bag of silver. He said he would swear that was the bag of silver he had in the watchhouse. The officer asked him where he got that money; the prisoner said he had no occasion to take any trouble about it, it was Green's money, he dare say Green would not hurt him. He asked me to take one pound fifteen shillings, and he would try to make it up with me. I said I would leave it all to the officer. The officer said he must bring it before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober - A. He was half and half. He said it was Green's money; Green would not hurt him. I have worked many a day with him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday morning I was sent for. Previous to that I had seen the prisoner with a bag of silver; he gave one or two shillings away. Mr. Green made me strip him naked. I could find no silver about him. I said he had some silver about him; I had seen some in his hand, and coming down stairs I looked in a crevice on the stairs, I found a bag with this silver; I said, I have got the money. I asked the prisoner how he came by this money; he said he took ten shillings of one and a pound of another. As soon as he found I was going to the parties to see whether it was true, he then said the silver is Mr. Green's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received of Mr. Harris, of Tower-street, on Saturday morning for watching, one pound; and ten shillings of another man for labour. The sum taken from me by the officer is thirty-seven shillings and sixpence.</p>

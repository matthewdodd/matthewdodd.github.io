The prisoner came to my house on the 7th of October, between five and six in the evening; he said he wanted a single room for him and his property. I told him I had no room; I told him I would go out and get him a bed. I went out to the public house, and left him in my parlour with my wife and my sister; I returned, told him I could get no lodging for him. I went out again to get a lodging for him, and when I came back, from information, I seized him and took him to the watchhouse on the charge of stealing my watch. He said in the watchouse that he had not stolen it, he only took it to show it my wife at the door.</p>
               <p>MARY BONISH. While my husband went to get a bed for this man, he sat down in my nursing chair; my servant saw him take the watch down; she is not here, she will not come. I sent the servant to fetch my sister, because I thought this man took too much liberty in siting in my nursing chair. There was a piece of work opposite of my door, the prisoner put his hat on and asked me what was the matter; the servant then said what watch is that you took. I pushed him in, and took the watch out of his right hand waistcoat pocket. I asked him what he took my husbands watch for, he said he was coming to shew me what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Defence. My watch did not go right, the persecutor's watch hung up at the fire place, I took his watch down to set my own right.</p>

On the evening of the 7th of September, I was on duty in Black-horse-fields, near Kingsland-road, and saw the prisoner going along the road with a bundle under his arm—I asked him what it was—he said a dish that he was going to take home but on questioning him further, he said he had two or three pieces of silk handkerchief he had brought from a warehouse, and was going to take to a silk-mercer's at Newington—I asked him for the bill of parcels—he</p>

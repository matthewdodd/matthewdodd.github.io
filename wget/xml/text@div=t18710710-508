I am a brush maker, of 405 A, Kentish Town Road—on Thursday, May 5, between 7 and 8 o'clock, Williams (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>) came in for a tooth brush, which cost him 3rf.—he gave me a florin, I tried it, a detector took a piece out of it, and I told him it was bad—he said that he had been to the Derby and had taken it there—he gave me a good one, saying, "Try that"—I gave him the charge of the larger piece of the florin, and gave the smaller piece to <hi rend="italic">Y</hi> 428; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—and this is the tooth brush I sold.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Barnes, a chemist, of 323, Kentish Town Road—on 25th May, about 8.30, p.m., I served Williams with some capsules, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were not in a box—I wrapped them in paper—he gave me a florin, I tried it, it bent easily, and I told him it was bad—he said "A bad one, is it?"—I tested it with caustic, and it turned black—he gave me a good florin, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and returned him the bad florin—that is Williams in the dock—I saw him next at the Police Court, with the police, and charged him—I was shown a dozen capsules at the station, they were in a box, they were like what I sold—my porter, Sewell, came in before Williams left.</p>

I am porter to Mr. Barnes—I came in and saw Williams in the shop about 8.30—the prisoner was then on the other side of the street—Mr. Strickland was testing coin when I went in—Williams left shortly afterwards—I followed him, and the prisoner walked on the opposite side, in the same direction, and when they got to Layton Road, Williams crossed and joined the prisoner, and they went on to Leverton Road together—I went to the station, got a constable, and gave Williams in custody—I then went with the constable, found the prisoner in Kentish Town Road, and gave him in custody—the constable caught him by the right arm, and with his left hand he put something into his mouth which nearly choked him—I seized him—we had a struggle, and I got him to the station with assistance—some capsules were taken from him in a box.</p>

In consequence of information from Sewell, I went with him and a constable in search of the prisoner—Sewell pointed out Williams at the corner of Leverton Street—I took him in custody and charged him with uttering counterfeit coin at Mr. Barnes', the chemist—he said he was not the man, and knew nothing about it—I took him to the station, but had some trouble to do so—I found on him two pocket books, a bunch of keys, a pencil, one shilling, two eggs, a six-pence, a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a tooth brush—I also assisted in taking the prisoner, and had some difficulty—I found on him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, a pocket-book, and two boxes, one of which was empty, and the other contained a dozen capsules, which were shown to Mr. Strickland, and returned to the prisoner, as he said that he required them.</p>

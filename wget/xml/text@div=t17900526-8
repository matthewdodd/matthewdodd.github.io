               <p>ANN BOND sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife to the last witness. I met these two men in the afternoon with two baskets of wool on their shoulders, near Threadneedle-street; I followed them.</p>
               <p>Where did this wool go from? - From Crutched-friars. Hill got away: I told Pate it was my property, and asked him where the other man was? he said he would go and fetch him: he left the basket, and went away; he was not taken till some days afterwards; I know the basket; it is marked S. B.; I am sure they are the men. Hill was my servant some years; he drove<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260016"></xptr>one of the carts; he was not taken till after the other was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long was it till they were taken? - I cannot recollect exactly; it might be about two or three weeks.</p>
               <p>They were not taken till the indictment was preferred? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon did you take your carman up, who had the care of this load? - Next day.</p>
               <p>Where is he? - He was tried here, and cleared.</p>
               <p>When you came up to Pate, what did he say? - He said either cotton or wool: Mitchell is gone off.</p>
               <p>How long had Hill lived with you? - Five or six years.</p>
               <p>He had been trusted to a considerable amount? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the quantity that Pate left with you? - Thirteen pounds, I understand.</p>
               <p>Is the person that weighed it, here? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk to the broker who weighed off this wool; I can only speak to the weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mrs. Bond. What was the colour? - The same colour: all Spanish wool is white.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear to it? - No.</p>
               <p>Martin. I have seen the wool: the officer had it in his possession; I compared it with the other; it looks like it; I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Court. It turns more upon the baskets than the wool.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They were their hay-baskets; they had a lawful right to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bond. The baskets are worth eighteen-pence; the man had the baskets in his custody.</p>
               <p>Martin. I saw the wool weighed; I took the weight down: the warehouseman put it it in the scales; I never saw the bags weighed again; I cannot tell whether the wool was deficient.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Bond. Did Hill return as usual to work? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mitchell had the care of this load? - Yes; and he is off.</p>
               <p>Court. Mitchell being the carman, and having been tried, and gone away, he might have given it these men: we certainly cannot make any thing of this case; for if he had been an honest man, he would not have gone away.</p>

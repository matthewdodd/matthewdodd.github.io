On the day stated in the indictment I saw Timms and Blackwell go to the stable; Blackwell opened the door. Timms had a large stick in his hand; he laid it against the door. Timms then took up a basket, and Blackwell filled it out of master's corn bin. Timms laid a large handkerchief on the top of the basket, and put corn into the handkerchief, and tied the corn up. The handkerchief was inclosed in the basket between the handles. He came out of the stable after he had got the corn, the oats. He put the stick through the handles, and put the basket and handkerchief on his shoulder. I came up to them; I asked them what they had got there; they said they had got anything what they could catch. I said, that is my master's property, you had better take it back again. I took a sample of it; they were black and white oats. I said, no wonder my master's horses die on the road, and that they deserved hanging.</p>
               <p>JAMES HART. I am a proprietor of coaches; I live at High Wickham; I have stables at Uxbridge. In consequence of Rolland's information I had the two prisoners taken before the magistrate. The prisoner, Timms, said Mimford gave him the corn.</p>
               <p>- MIMFORD. I am a corn and coal porter; I live about a mile from Uxbridge. I never gave Timms any corn in all my life. I never had any to give him.</p>

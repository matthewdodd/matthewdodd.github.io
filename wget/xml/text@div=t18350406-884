On the night of the 16th of March, about seven o'clock, I was sitting in the shop—my attention was attracted by the cry of "Stop thief"—I went to the door, and found the window of the shop was cut or broken—it was whole a few minutes before—the policeman almost immediately brought the prisoner into the shop, and a piece of silk handkerchiefs, containing fire—I knew them to be ours—they had been taken out of our window just opposite the broken square, off a pile of gloves—the hole was large enough for a person to put a hand through, but very little larger—Mr. Levy after<lb></lb>wards</p>

On Friday the 30th of January the prisoner came into my shop, under pretence of changing a pair of stockings he had bought the night before; I suspected he had no good design and watched him; I changed the stockings, and wrapped another pair up in a paper for him; there were some parcels on the counter; as I suspected him, I gave him an opportunity, and watched to see if he would take any thing; he took a parcel of stockings, and went out; I followed him, and found the parcel of stockings upon him.</p>

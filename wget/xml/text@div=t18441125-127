I em<lb></lb>ployed the prisoner to sell books on my account among my customers—he called on Mr. Young, who ordered half a dozen Prayer-books—I sent them by the prisoner, with some other things for him to look at—I made out the invoice for the half dozen Prayer-books, and Mr. Young selected half a dozen Bibles, which made the amount 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner did not come back—I saw no more of him from Thursday till the Monday.</p>

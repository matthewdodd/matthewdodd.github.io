                  </hi>. I am a butcher, the prisoner is my wife. I have been separated from her rather better than three months ago, allowing her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week maintenance—I do not know where she has resided since that—I live at Exeter-place, Great Dover-road—we have been married rather better than two years, and have one child about eighteen months old—she came to me about a month after we had been separated, and wished to come back—I refused to take her back on account of her temper being so violent—she came again after that—she said nothing then about coming back, but was constantly annoying me in my business—on the 26th of March she was to receive her allowance—she generally had it on Satur<lb></lb>day—she came, but did not receive her money—I usually sent it by my lad</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184205090278"></xptr>
               <p>—on Sunday, the 27th, about ten o'clock at night, she came and knocked at the side shutters—I was then getting my supper—I went to the front door and saw ray wife—I am sure it was her—she asked me for the money which she did not receive on the Saturday night—I gave it to her, and as she parted away from the door, she said, "I would have you be careful, or I will have my revenge yet"—I made no reply—she went away—I went in and got my supper, after which, I changed my coat, as it was raining, and went to the Bull to get half a pint of ale—I think it must have been half-past ten or a quarter to eleven—I met her about twenty yards from my door—on seeing me, she turned, and walked in an oppo<lb></lb>site direction, crossed the road, and went on the opposite side of the way towards Eaton-place, which is opposite to the Bull—she was walking backwards and forwards there—I went into the Bull, at the private en<lb></lb>trance, the passage being rather dark, I thought she would not see me enter that door—I got half a pint of ale there—I remained in the Bull, I think not more than two minutes—as I came out she met me at the door and asked me if I was going to stand any gin—I made no reply, and while I was going away, homewards, I saw her draw her hand from under her cloak, she threw a liquid in my face, and exclaimed, "That is what I have long wished for, and now I have got my revenge"—the liquid gave me great pain, almost as if I had been scalded with hot water, a burning pain, it went into both eyes—I was obliged to shut my eyes instantly, since that I have lost the sight of one, and partly of the other—one is getting better—I was taken to Guy's Hospital—I did not see what the liquid was in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Guy's Hospital—the pro<lb></lb>secutor was brought there—his face was very much inflamed, and both eyes injured—it was produced by some acid—if a liquid thrown in his face produced it, I should say it was some corrosive acid—I cannot say what it was, probably nitric acid—I am certain it was some corrosive fluid—he has entirely lost the sight of one eye—the other is likely to recover, but he will never have the perfect use of it—it will be partially restored.</p>

               <p>"I must examine it;" she objected to my opening it, but opened it herself - she took out these things of mine, and put them on the floor; they are marked and all old. I should not have taken notice of them but she had some money in her hand - she did not say how she got them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. She had left her box behind? A. Yes; these things were in her care - they were not dirty - she lived seven months with me - I had asked her for the waiter several times.</p>

            . I live at Limehouse. I was at Upton's house - I saw the prisoner come into the bed-room, where the prosecutrix's daughter was in bed, with her box - she had not got the key - she went out and fatched it, threw the towels on the ground, and burst out crying.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She brought her box in herself? A. Yes, as her mistress would not let her take it out; she cried bitterly, and fetched the key and opened it - the constable was there. I saw her turn to go down stairs, but her mistress made her bring it into the bed-room.</p>

            . I was sent for. When I entered the bed-room the things had been taken from the box - Mrs. Upton said she thought she had got things which did not belong to her; I took them up and Mrs. Upton claimed them - the towels and apron were marked.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had the towel for my own use - I did not cry - I gave the things out to her - I had nine sovereigns in my hand, which a young man had given to me - she asked how I got them, and said the officer should have them.</p>

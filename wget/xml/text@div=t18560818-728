                  </hi>. I live at No. 14, Peckham-grove, Camberwell. On 16th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was in King William-streetr—there was a crowd, and I stopped to look—I saw the prisoner on my right, just by Deane's, he had a mackintosh coat on his arm—I felt a tug at my waistcoat pocket, looked down, and saw my chain hanging, and he was just drawing his two forefingers under his mackintosh—my watch was gone—I caught hold of the prisoner by his wrist, he struggled with me, and I asked him for my watch—instead of looking round towards me, he looked to his right—he said, "Let me go," broke away from me, and ran up Fish-streefc<lb></lb>hill—I followed him, and he was stopped by an officer—the hook of my watch was wrenched off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, of No. 29, Old-street, St. Luke's. I was at the crowd in Arthur-street, close to Mr. Davis—the prisoner was on his right—in a few minutes I saw the prisoner draw his hand from wider Mr. Davis's arm—he seized him directly, and said, "You have stolen my watch"—the prisoner said, "I have not seen your watch"—there was a struggle, the prosecutor held him for some few minutes, and a man with a cap on, like a drayman, brought him his watch—the prisoner gave a Hidden jerk, and ran up Fish-street-hill—I followed him, and another witness stopped him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of No. 40, Little Bartholomew-close. I was near the Monument, looking at the crowd, and saw the prisoner run—the prosecutor pursued him—he broke loose from some person, and was followed by the prosecutor and several others, crying, "Stop thief!"—I caught him, and held him till an officer came up—he said, "Let me go, he has hit me;" I said, "Stop till he comes up, and see if he will hit you again"—I handed him over to an officer.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the custody of the last witness—he had a reversible coat on his arm—he said that he lived at some coffee house in High-street, Whitechapel, that he had left Birmingham about a month, and did not know London, having been here a very short time—I inquired at every coffee house there, but could not learn anything about him.</p>

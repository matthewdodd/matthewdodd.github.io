                  </hi>. My husband is a baker, of Bermondsey-square. On 31st March the prisoner, James, came to the shop, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—he said he was a baker, and came after a place—he bought a penny cake, and he gave me in payment a sixpence, which I put in the till; there was no other sixpence there—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change; he left and said he would come again at half past 8 o'clock, to engage the place—when he left the shop a constable came in—I took the sixpence out of the till, marked it, and gave it to the constable—the prisoner Smith came in in about five minutes after the constable was gone, and wanted a pennyworth</p>

I was on duty in the Old Kent-road on 31st March, between 5 and 6 o'clock, in company with Hunt, another constable—I saw the prisoners walking together down the Old Kent road—I followed them to Bermondsey-square, which is a mile and a half or two miles—I saw them stop opposite Mr. Reed's shop, at the corner of Bermondsey-square—James went in, and Smith went a few yards beyond, and stood still—I saw James come out of the shop in about five minutes, and join Smith—I went into the shop, and Mrs. Reed gave me a bad sixpence, which she took out of the till—I looked in the till at the time, and there were no other sixpences—she marked the sixpence, and gave it me—I have had it ever since—I came out again, and saw the prisoners about twenty yards away from the shop, they were together—I then saw Smith come back and go into the shop—I was standing right in front of the shop, and I could see into it from where I was—I saw Smith receive some bread, and put down something, apparently some money—I went into the shop, and Mrs. Reed gave me another bad sixpence—she marked it previous to my receiving it, in my presence—I took Smith into custody—I found on him one good sixpence, nothing else.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 247). I was with the last witness that evening—we were both in plain clothes—I saw both the prisoners in Bermondsey-square in company—I saw James go into Mr. Reed's shop, and come out—I took him into custody twelve or fourteen yards from the shop—I took him after Smith went in—when I took James he got his right hand into his coat pocket—I wrenched his band out of his pocket, and saw a paper drop from his hand—it contained two counterfeit sixpences, and another one laid close to the paper, which came out of the paper in its fall—I saw the paper drop from his hand—I searched his pockets, and found a counterfeit shilling in his right hand trowsers pocket and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of halfpence—I have the three sixpences and the shilling.</p>

            . I was going on a Sunday, which was St. Thomas's Day, to Mr. Hughes's in the Borough, and I overtook the prisoner and her husband; they asked me to go to a church with them, to which I said it would do me no good; on which Mr. Walker said, yes it will, I'll make it worth your while. I think there was a charity sermon there that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they give you any reason why they were to go to that particular church?</p>

               <p>Yates. They said it was to a church where a great many good people came, and they might do some business worth while there, and these were the words as well as I can remember which were spoke; accordingly I went with them, and it was to a church in Old Fish-street, and I remember we went by St. Paul's.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is that the church he mentions ?</p>

               <p>E. Riley. It is the same church.</p>

               <p>Yates. We stood the time of the sermon, and afterwards coming out, Mr. Walker and I were close together; he said to his wife, the person coming along here is a fine lady or a fine woman, she said Gammon.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she mean by that?</p>

               <p>Yates. That was for us to get before the lady, it is a cant term, made use of by pick pockets, and it meant that she should not go too fast while she took her watch; accordingly we got both before Mrs. Riley, and were just got out at the church door when the lady call'd out she had lost her watch; upon that Mrs. Walker the prisoner and I walked away directly as fast as we could to her house near Cripplegate Church, where she pulled out the watch she had taken, and which I saw before in her hand just after she had taken it away from Mrs. Riley, and I saw the chain hang down when she shew'd it me in the street just after she had taken it from Mrs. Riley at the church door; after she got home she put by the watch, and when Mr. Walker got home about an hour afterwards she embraced him, saying that she had got safe off, and asked him how he got away; on which he told her that he had been stop'd, but that on shewing his licence as an excise officer, and his pocket book with a bank note therein, he was discharged; and then she fetch'd the watch to shew him, and he look'd at it, and then I desired to see it in my hands, but he said no, we never suffer such things.</p>

            . I was at St. Nicholas Coleabby Church, and near Mrs. Riley when she came out of the church, and heard her cry out she had lost her watch; a gentleman by me, pointing to Mr. Walker, who was well dress'd, said that is the person that assisted in taking the watch, on which I ran up to him and charg'd him with taking it; he said he was not the person, he was a very honest man; whereupon I took him into an alehouse near the church, and he there said he was an excise-man, and shew'd me a bank note and a pocket book; I am sure the prisoner is the man, and I fixt upon him at first sight on seeing him here.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to discharge him?</p>

               <p>De Poutu. I thought by his genteel appearance, and a 20 l. bank note about him, he was not a pick pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there?</p>

               <p>De Poutu. I can't recollect her?</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular to occasion a crowd there that day?</p>

               <p>De Poutu. There was my Lord-mayor there that day at a charity sermon.</p>

               <p>Q. to Yates. Describe how you and Walker placed yourselves at the time the watch was taken?</p>

               <p>Yates. Mr. Walker was at the side of me, and Mrs. Walker behind me, but she and I were before her husband when he was laid hold of.</p>

               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence, but call'd to her character -</p>

               <p>Jam es Mackall. I have known the prisoner about a year, I have liv'd next door but one to her and her husband for that time, and I never knew any harm by her.</p>

               <p>Q. What way of life does she follow?</p>

               <p>Mackall. Really I can't give any account of that. I believe her husband deals sometimes in horses, and goes to horse races, and I believe he lets horses out.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

               <p>Mackall. I am a peruke maker.</p>

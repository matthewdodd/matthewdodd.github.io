                  </hi>. I am clerk in the house of Messrs. Bartley, Southwood, and Barclay, solicitor of Somerset-street, Portman-square; they have a client named Seth Smith. On Saturday, 20th April, when I arrived at the office, about ten o'clock in the morning, I found a person wait<lb></lb>ing at the office door—he was quite a stranger to me—he said something to me about meeting a person, in consequence of which I made an appointment—I said I should leave the office at six, and would see the person—when I left the office at six, I saw the prisoner and the young man I had before, standing at the bottom of Somerset-street, Duke-street—the young man introduced me to the prisoner, by saying, "This is Mr. Bartley's clerk"—we walked to Oxford-street, and when we got opposite the Noah's Ark public-house, the prisoner said "Here is a house we can go into"—we went into the parlour, sat down, and had a pint of ale—the prisoner said to me "You do a great deal of business for Mr. Smith"—I said "Yes, we do"—he said, "Well, what I want you to do for me is to get a counterpart lease away from your office; and if you will get it me, I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l."</hi>—I said, "If I can get it, how shall 1 let you know?"—previous to that I said, "Give me the particulars of it," and the prisoner asked the young man for a piece of paper, and the prisoner took the paper and wrote on it—Hardwick, the officer, has that paper—I gave it to him—I have not seen it since.</p>

               <p>the public-house, at half-past six o'clock this evening, punctually"—that was addressed to J.

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> On Thursday, 25th April, about a quarter to six o'clock, I went to the Noah's Ark, in Oxford-street, in conse<lb></lb>quence of an arrangement with Mr. Southwood and Jones—I was dressed in private clothes—I went into the parlour—there were several persons there—the prisoner came in, after I was there, with Jones, who had this deed in his hand, tied up in brown paper—the prisoner had a little basket in his hand—they were in close conversation, and sat down, in a little box partitioned off, by themselves—I saw the prisoner with the deed in his hand, with the cover off, looking at it, and I saw him roll it up and put it by his side—I could not hear what was said, for the other people were talking so loud—I heard a rattling, apparently of gold—they drank a pint of ale, which the prisoner called for, and then left the room together, and parted at the door—the prisoner took this with him, wrapped up in brown paper—I do not know who wrapped it up—I followed the prisoner, overtook him, and asked what he had got—he said he really did not know—I said, "How did you come by it?"—he said, "Well, I do not know the party:" I think those were the words—I told him I must take him to the station, and took him and the parcel—when we got there I opened the parcel, and found it contained this deed—I searched him, and found this letter which hat been produced, and some money on him.</p>

               <p>persons there—I could not hear what the prisoner and Jones said, because of the louder talking of the other persons; they were talking about business; I expect they were publicans—I was at the far-side of the room, about as for from the prisoner and Jones as I am from you—the other persons sat on part of the settle alongside the prisoner and Jones; only the partitions divided them—I do not think they could hear what Jones and the prisoner said, for they were speaking very low indeed—there were two persons there who I know were not publicans; a man named Hewlett was one—I took him there more for company than anything else—I do not know the other person's name, but I know him by sight—I had received instructions from Mr. South<lb></lb>wood on the subject—I was to use my own discretion about overhearing what was said—it was left entirely to me—he did not say anything to me about overhearing anything that passed—it was arranged that I should go and see the prisoner take the deed—he said it would be well for me to go to the house, and be there a little before the time appointed, to see them come in, because I was aware the house was appointed for the meeting—I did not see him take the deed; the settle was between us—I could not have seen unless I was in the same box—I did not like to get too near, for fear the prisoner should know me—I went there for one thing, to overbear the conversation—that was not by Mr. Southwood's instructions; nothing was said about seeing and hearing—Mr. Southwood said he should send the clerk with the deed according to the appointment, and would I be there—I said I would be there before, and I was—he told me to take him into custody—I swear be did not tell me to go and hear what passed, nor did Jones—I did listen, but I could not hear what passed—Hewlett sat by me—he is a master coach-trimmer, and lives in the neighbourhood of St. George's, Hanover-square, a mile or more from Motcombe-street—he did not know my business till it was over—I took him for company, to have somebody to talk to while I was there—we had a pint of ale, which he paid for—that was before Jones and the prisoner had their pint of ale—the waiter was in and out of the room—they had the ale as soon as they sat down—they began to talk as soon as they came in—when the waiter took the ale, they were talking with their heads close to each other, leaning on the table—I rose up from my seat to see that—they put themselves more apart when he put the ale down—the deed was not on the table at that time; it was between the two on the form I suppose, or else on the ground for what I know—it was out of sight—the other man who I knew sat opposite them—he did not stay all the while; he left shortly before the prisoner—there was nothing to prevent him from seeing them—Hewlett sat close by me—he did not go near to them.</p>

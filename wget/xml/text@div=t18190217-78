            . I live in Aldermanbury, in the parish of St. Mary, the Virgin; I let out the warehouse, which are under the same roof as my house. On Saturday, the 9th of January, the house was secured at eleven o'clock, when I went to bed - I sleep in the house. I did not discover that the house had been robbed until Monday morning, when I went down with Mr. Evans, and found one of the rails over his warehouse door had been cut, by which means a person could unbolt the door, and get over the top-door into the warehouse; it must have been broken open on the Saturday night, because the front-door was not opened at all on the Sunday. I came home about half-past five o'clock on the Saturday evening, and saw a man standing in the passage - it was dark; I asked him what he wanted? he said he wanted to see Mr. Evans; I went up stairs and left him. I went out again about six o'clock - there was nobody in the passage then; the street-door was put to, but not shut.</p>

            . I deal in Welch flannels, and occupy a warehouse in Stone's house. On Saturday, about five o'clock I left my warehouse in the care of my brother William - every thing was then safe. I returned on Monday morning, and missed two pieces of flannel, containing about 146 yards each - it was worth 40 l. I found a piece at Mr. Purse's, London-wall that night. On the 19th of January I saw the prisoner in Aldersgate-street; I laid hold of him, and said he was the man who had robbed my warehouse - he denied it. I gave him in charge of Taylor, who took him to the Compter; 13 s. 6 d., and three knives were found on him - one was a very strong knife. The prisoner had been to me on the 7th of January, and brought an order for some flannels - I gave him 6 s. as a reward. I afterwards thought it was not a genuine order - I made no appointment to meet him on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you give him the 6 s. all at one time - A. No, but I am certain I gave it all to him before the Saturday.</p>

            . My brother left me in charge of his warehouse. A few minutes after my brother was gone I locked the door, took the key, and left - every thing was then safe; the warehouse is on the ground-floor. We both went there together, and missed the flannel.</p>
               <p>Q. How could they have got in - A. A piece of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170043"></xptr>railing over the door was cut, a hand could then be put in, and the bolt drawn aside - the bolt was drawn from the upper door - there is one door over the other. I have since seen a piece of the flannel. On Saturday, after securing the warehouse, I came out, and shut the passage-door also; I saw the prisoner by the door, he asked me if I had shut up for the night? I said Yes; I went away, leaving him there - I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. You go through Stone's passage to the warehouse.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Purse, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in London-wall. On the 9th of January, a little after six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and said he wanted some money to take up a bill, and wished to pledge two pieces of flannel, which he produced. I advanced him 10 l. on one piece; he gave me the name of Thompson - I am certain he is the man - I took notice of him. Evans claimed it on Monday.</p>

I asked him what he wanted? he said Mr. Evans; I said he was not there, he said he knew that - I was cleaning the stairs. He kept walking up and down, as if he was waiting for somebody - I went up stairs, leaving him in the passage - I am sure he is the man; it was nearly dark. A person must come into the passage to cut the door. I came down, and told him if he wanted Mr. Evans he must go to his lodgings - he said Mr. Evans had made an appointment to meet him at six o'clock, and he would wait for him - I left him in the passage.

I found the warehouse had been entered by a wooden bar being cut, and a little bolt over the door unbolted - the door is inside the passage.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got the two pieces of flannel from a man named Thomas, who comes from Montgomery - I sell them on commission. I pledged one, and gave the duplicate to Thomas.

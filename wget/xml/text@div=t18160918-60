            . On the 14th of September, at about ten o'clock at night the two female prisoners came to my shop, and asked for a save-all, they stood in a direction between me and the door so that I could not see the door. While they were in the shop, the prisoner Colbin was laid hold of and brought into the shop with the saucepans in question.</p>
               <p>DAVID WILLIAMSON. I was going by Mr. Griffith's shop, and I saw the prisoner Colbin lying on the steps of the door with a saucepan in his right hand and another in his left; I did not at that time see the two women, but when I did see them they were in the shop, and by the direction in which they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180052"></xptr>stood, it was impossible for a person in the shop to see what was doing at the door. Colbin handed one of the saucepans to the other man prisoner, and dropped the other. I secured Colbin and both the saucepans were secured; Bowl walked away I believe. I am sure he is the man to whom Colbin was handing one of the saucepans; Colbin said he was shewing the saucepan to Bowl, and he said he was wagering five shillings, that one was a three pint saucepan; Bowl however did not stay to see that wager decided; Colbin too wished to walk off with himself, and as I was stopping him, he made a blow at me; I immediately collared him, and seized him by the throat; then the two females were stopped.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHESTERMAN. Colbin was brought to the watchhouse first; Wood followed him, and when she came to the watchhouse, she was taken into custody.</p>

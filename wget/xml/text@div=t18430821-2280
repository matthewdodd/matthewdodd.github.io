                  </hi>. I am private watchman to Messrs. Cory and Son. I had used some warp on the barges at the wharf, at Lambeth on the 14th of August—the prisoner had some boats lying off there—about half-past nine o'clock that night he and three or four others came across my barges to get ashore—the prisoner asked me if the yard gate was unlocked, as he was going for some beer—I said it was, and he went—I afterwards heard them return, but did not see them—I then locked the gate—at three o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing I missed the warp—I followed the prisoner's boats to Brentford, told the policeman, and met him in the street at Old Brentford, just before I got to the bridge, with the warp on his shoulder—he said he knew whose it was; he found it in the barge, covered over with hay, and he would be d—if he was not going to fetch it back again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) Hooper applied to me at Brentford, and we met the prisoner at the foot of the bridge, about a hundred yards from where his boat was lying—when charged with stealing the warp, he said, "Yes, I know it is your warp; I was going to bring it home to you; we found it in the boat, hid under some hay," pointing towards his boat—he was hired to work the boat up—the prosecutor said, "This is the way you serve me for my kindness to you," and gave him into custody.</p>

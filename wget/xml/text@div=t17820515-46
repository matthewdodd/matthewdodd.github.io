               <p>I am a constable. I had a warrant to search the house of M'Millan, in Cartwright-street, No. 12, East-Smithfield. We went about a quarter after seven in the morning in search of drugs, opium, and bark, and some other things. When we came there, M'Millan was not up; we knocked at the door, and he came and opened it in his shirt. When we were in the house, we told him we had got a search-warrant, to search for stolen goods. He said he had no stolen goods that he knew of. He said he did not know that there were any drugs, or any thing else in his house.</p>

We told him we should find it if it was in the house, for we had a warrant to search. He then said there was a bag in the closet, pointing to the door. We went to the closet, and took the bag out. We asked him what there was in the bag. He said he did not know, but that

Morant and another officer went first, and knocked at the door. The prisoner came in his shirt, and opened it. I followed them into the house, and said, we were come to search for stolen drugs. He denied having any stolen goods in his house. Upon being told that his house would be searched thoroughly, that we knew there were stolen goods in the house, and he had better not expose himself to his neighbours, but tell where they were, he pointed to a closet, and said, there they were. The officers searched the house, but found nothing else. They took the prisoner with the goods, as produced in court, to the Public Office, in Bow-street. We attended between eleven and twelve o'clock. The prisoner was examined by Justice Wright. He said that Tinnent had thrown the goods into the house, and he did not know what they were. Mr. Wright telling him that he knew more of the matter than the prisoner thought he did, he confessed he received two parcels of goods; that one parcel he had sold for 36 guineas, and retained a small premium for himself. It was with difficulty Mr. Wright got out of him who he sold them to. He did not mention any persons names, but said it was a druggist between the Post-office and the Mansion-house. He said he delivered Tinnent 36 guineas for the first parcel, and kept a small sum for himself; the second parcel, which came, I think, to 13 l. 9 s. the prisoner said he had delivered 10 l. of it to

               <p>The first that I saw of the prisoner was after the goods were taken, and he was carried into Bow-street. I heard his examination. When he was first put to the bar, he pretended great ignorance, was exceedingly backward, and would say nothing; at last Mr. Wright said he knew the circumstances, and where the drugs were sold; upon which he said, I have done a very bad thing, but now I will tell the truth. He acknowledged that he had received two parcels of drugs of our porter, Tinnent, and sold them to a druggist, in Lombard-street; he sold the first parcel for 36 guineas, which he gave Tinnent, and that he kept only half-a crown for himself; and 36 guineas was the sum found in Tinnent's box: he said he sold the other parcel for 13 l. 9 s. that he gave Tinnent a 10 l. note, and kept the 3 l. 9 s. for himself. We had received three chests from Ostend, weighing near 1000 lb. we weighed two of the three chests; one wanted between 12 and 13 lb. of the weight. It is impossible to swear to the opium; it is lapped up in the way our opium generally is.</p>
               <p>Other people have their opium lapped up in the same way? - Very probably they have. We have the bills and receipts, with M'Millan's name to them.</p>

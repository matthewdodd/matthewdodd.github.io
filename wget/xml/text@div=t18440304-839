On the 21st of Feb., about eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, I was sitting down in the kitchen, and heard a step on the grating, the front parlour shutters open, and the window thrown up—I had put the shutters to as I came in from work, but did not fasten them—the window was shut down, but not fastened—I ran up stairs, opened the street door, and the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the act of rolling something up in his arms—I called "Halloo"—he directly ran off—I followed, calling "Stop thief"—he directly threw some<lb></lb>thing down in Spencer-street—I still followed, and did not take my eye off him till he was taken—Frederick Ckarmson, my father-in-law, keeps the house—this table-cloth and bed-gown belong to my mother, and was on the front parlour table, a quarter of a yard from the window—he could reach them with his arm.</p>

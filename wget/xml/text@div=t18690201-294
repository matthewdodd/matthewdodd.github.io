                  </hi>. I am manager to Christopher Walton, of 8, Ludgate Hill, in the parish of St. Gregory, by St. Paul—on 25th January, about 2.45, a gentleman was in the shop, and the prisoner came in and asked to be shown a diamond ring in the window, marked eight guineas—I took one out marked eight guineas—I asked him if that was the one—he looked at it and said that it was not—I got another out marked the same, and asked him if that was it—he said, "That is it, but it is not large enough—I took another out marked nine guineas, which was a little larger—he said, that is more the size, but he should like to see one with two or three stones in it—I took the two eight guinea ones back, leaving the nine guinea one in his hand, and while putting them in the window, he opened the door and rushed out with the nine guinea ring—I went to the door and halloaed, "Stop thief!" which created an alarm—and I saw some people pursue him—the shop lad ran out, and as soon as I found the shop was in safe custody, I ran out my<lb></lb>self, and found a mob at the bottom of Creed Lane, and the prisoner in a constable's hands.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, St. Mark's Crescent, Notting Hill—on 25th January, about 2.45, I was in Mr. Walton's shop—the prisoner came in, and asked Mr. Fisk to show him a ring which was in the window, at eight guineas—he did so, and the prisoner asked him to show him a second—he did so, and that was too small, and would not fit, and he asked to see a third—while Fisk was putting back the other two, the prisoner ran out with the ring in his hand—I ran across the street, but could not see him; but he was pursued and taken—I saw two diamond rings and a black enamel ring.</p>

He said at the Police Court that he had a private mark on the ring. I want to know what it is. I only saw two rings, and they were put back.</p>

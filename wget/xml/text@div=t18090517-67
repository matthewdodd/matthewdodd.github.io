In the morning of the 17th of April, I was informed that my house would be down, as the props that supported it were taken away. It is necessary for me to tell you that this house is against a common shore, called the Fleet river, to that house and the other opposite of it, there were props put up of an equal support, from one house to the other; I saw these three props were gone. I was informed by a neighbour who had taken them away.</p>

            . I live at No. 10, in Fleet-row. I saw Thomas Usher drive the props along the water, as he was in the shore the water was very low; the other prisoner and he were together; I did not see where they took them from; they were not far from the place. I am sure they were taken from Mr. Rankin's houses.</p>

               <p>Usher's Defence. On Saturday the 17th of April, the water was about six feet in the shore; it was impossible for a man to get up. On that same day we caught three or four planks, we delivered them up to Mr. Wood's carpenter. On the Monday following we went to see whether there were any more lodged in the creek.</p>
               <p>Manning's Defence. On Monday the 17th of April we could not work, the water was so high; the bricklayer took me to Clerkenwell-Green, and there I worked with him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ROOKE. I am a bricklayer, I was employed by the same master; they were employed to work on the shore.

I took the prisoner Manning with me at twelve o'clock, to No. 4, Clerkenwell-Green; he continued working with me there till six o'clock.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PARIS. I belong to the yard where these men were at work. On the day mentioned, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw five or six men there; I said why are not you at work; I went to look at the water, it was five or six feet deep, it was impossible to get up to these premises at ten in the day time.</p>

                  </hi>. On 29th April I went with Inspector Brannan, Fife, and other officers, to King Street, Long Acre—I posted the officers at different parts—I was at the corner of King Street when the prisoner was brought to me in custody of Hines, Miller, and Windsor—he called across the road and said "God strike me dead, Mr. Brannan, I have not had that bad money"—I said "What bad money? we do not know that it is bad yet, stay till we get to the station"—he said "That b—y Hines put it into my pocket"—I said "What, persecuted again, Bob?"—he said "No, when you had me before it was all right then, though I said it was not, but so help me God, that b—y Hines put it into my pocket"—he was taken to the station, and I received from Hines this paper packet, containing two packets, one of which contains six bad half-crowns, and the other five bad florins, separately wrapped with paper between each coin—they had under-gone the process of <hi rend="italic">slumming</hi> with lamp black and grease, to give them the appearance of having been in circulation—I said "You will have to account for the possession of these, they are bad"—he repeated the same words, and made use of most horrible expressions, saying that he would kill b—y Hines when he got out.</p>

               <p>him also at the door—I asked him what he had about him, and said that he had better give it to me, for I was going to search him—he thrust his hand into his breast pocket, and Miller seized it—I put my hand into that pocket, and took out six half-crowns and five florins, all counterfeit, and wrapped in separate papers—Miller searched him afterwards, and gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in good money, from his waistcoat pocket—he was violent; it was as much as we could do to hold him—when at the top of King Street, he told Mr. Brannan that he was <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> again—Brannan asked what he meant, and he said that I had put the money into his pocket—he said to Brannan "When you had me before, you had me right, though I said it was wrong; when I get out I will settle that b—Hines," meaning me—in a purse found on him I found a piece of paper which had the mark of coin upon it; it was newspaper, and corresponded with that in which the florins and half-crowns were wrapped.</p>

I did not see it, I was so fixed by the two women.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe that to be a man's arm? - Because there were no others but these three at that time near me. They having secured me in this kind of way, I observed

               <p>Q. Your watch went, did it? - It did; my fob is very deep, and it went very hard, it went away very gradually, and I had an opportunity of seeing who did it. After they had my watch I began to be a little released, not much, and then I felt a hand go down to my pocket where I had six guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it the same man? - It was; I believe it to be about the size of the prisoner.

               <p>Q. Was your brother in company with you while you was pinioned? - He went for the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. He went while the women held your arms? - Yes, but he did not go till I had lost my watch; we proceeded to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080104"></xptr>watch house, and delivered the two women into charge there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said we, who do you mean by we? - The watchman and myself, and my brother was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think it was from the time that you was pinioned up, to the time that your brother went and called the watchman? - My brother did not go to call the watch until after the watch was out of my sob, and the watch was out of my sob in about three minutes after the first transaction, then I began to cry out watch, and he run away for the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had conducted these two women to the watch-house, what did you do? - We then gave a description of the man, myself and my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done in consequence of that description? - How was the man dressed? - I believe the man at that time to he dressed in a drab kind of a coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What height was he? - He answered to the height of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured hair? - I do not pretend to say to his hair or face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to take him? - I did not, the watchman did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner at the bar after that? - The very next day, the two women were delivered into custody, and they were all three brought up together.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see the man till the next day at Bow-street? - Not till the next day, I think it was near upon twelve o'clock when I saw him come into Bow-street, and my little brother pointed him out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were with you? - There was the patrol of the night, the watchman and my little brother.</p>
               <p>Q.

            , pointed out to your brother? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he six on him without any body saying any thing to him? - He did; when Lamb was coming into the front part of the office, I was in the office before the runners brought Lamb up; when I was in the office I perceived a parcel of people coming to Bow-street, to the office door, and the man, the prisoner, came up right to my face, and said, sir, do you know me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if any person had pointed to you, before that man came up to you, and spoke to you, as to that man? - No, he appeared to me instantly saying do you know me? - I said no; he turned himself about with an air, and said, then I may take myself about my business; then the little boy said, that is the man that robbed you last night, and then the little boy proceeded to state before the watchman, before me and the patrol, what I have stated to you before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got your property again? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This was eleven o'clock at night? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great number of persons in the street? - There were some.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think there were in the street; you say there were a great number at the corner of Essex-street? What number do you think there were at the corner of Essex-street? - Altogether there might be ten or twelve, among whom I believe there were only one man.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a fair night, or a rainy night? - I believe it was wet, and I believe it was misty.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this before you got ot Essex-street? - There is a cutler's at the corner, and I was got half way by their shutters, just opposite that passage that leads through to go to St. Clement's-inn; it was very near the lamp, I was not in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners at the bar you told me just now, that you never see either of them before; did the crowd encrease or disperse on your being pinioned as you have described? - It increased, but considering there were very few people about.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps there were forty or fifty people about you? - I do not think there were twenty about me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is a watchman's stand to this place where the robbery was said to be committed? - I believe the nearest stand was in St. Clement's Church-yard, which was a good bit off me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the watch-house is pretty nearly opposite to the Church in the passage? - I do not know; if there was a watch-house there nobody proceeded to my assistance from that watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your brother? - He is now about eleven or twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been this evening, Mr. Hill? - I had been in Berry-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Only you and your brother together? - I was there alone by myself, all the afternoon, my brother was sent to fetch me home by my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had a watch out with you that afternoon? - I particularly remember I had, it was a silver hunting watch; I had the seal in my hand not many minutes before I was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to do that? - I cannot say what led me to do it. I mean positively to swear that I put my hand to my seal two minutes before I was stopped.</p>

               <p>Q. You have stated that as to the person of the man, that there was only one man, you will not swear to the prisoner being that man. I understand you to say you would not swear to what his hair was, nor his face, but his size you think you could swear to? - Just so.</p>

               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you do not swear to him only by his size? - I do not say the particular size of him, it was about his size.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Bow-street the next day, your brother was with you of course? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners were brought into custody from the Brown Bear? - I do not know where they were brought from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, upon your oath, that they came from the Brown Bear? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not at the door when they were brought in? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, the man, in irons or was he not? - The first time he was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080106"></xptr>Q. Was the officer of Bow-street with him that brought him in? - Not at that time. When he came to the door at Bow-street he ran directly up to my nose, and said, sir, do you know me? and afterwards I perceived a many people following.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought, just now, you told me you was in the anti-room? - So I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the anti-room opened in the street? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you saw him coming into the door you must see where he came from? - I did not; they came slanting from the Brown Bear to the door of the office, I could not see them in the room as I stood.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not, I believe, till after you had said, no, to him, and after he ran up to you and asked whether you knew him? that your brother said one word to him? - The moment I said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very extraordinary I cannot get an answer? - It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the watchmen there at the time? - I believe they were in with him, or they came in with the two women afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear that watchman say any thing about Lamb? - Not a syllable.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not hear this, he pointing to Lamb, and saying, this is the man, my boy? - I mean to say that the watchman never did any such thing in my presence as that, and it could not be done without my hearing it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there are three forty pound rewards? - I do; but I am very willing to relinquish that all up to the poor of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been alway with Mr. Clarke? - Before I was with him I was with Mr. Priddle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Whatever persons were about the street, were there more than two females and one male about you when the robbery was compleated? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that your brother pointed out that the prisoner at the bar was the man; had any body any where, or in any kind, pointed to him, to shew him? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Hill, just tell me exactly whereabouts it was you lost your watch; you talked just now about the razor shop, was it near that razor shop? - It was against the razor shop, the very corner of Essex-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you saw this crowd of people, the crowd of women of which there was but one man? - At the very corner of Essex-street.</p>
               <p>Q. If there were a great crowd at the corner of Essex-street, and you was robbed at this house, what do you mean when you say there were nobody but these two women and one man about you? you must be very close to the crowd? - About a yard and a half, if there were any.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do not you call people that were within a yard and a half of you, not near you? - They were near me, but not assisting.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us just now, before, that there were not more than two females and one male near you when you was robbed, and now you tell me that there was all this crowd within a yard and a half of you? - I mean to say that they were a yard and a half from me when these people were round me. Your lordship sees that when these people were around me they were a yard and half from the other people.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in Clement's-inn? - A year.</p>
               <p>Q. Were did you live before that? - At Drury-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he withdraw to? - Unto a little distance from them, and Mr. Hill gave me one of the women in charge,

            , while he took care of the other himself, at that time the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080111"></xptr>was swearing very heavy to him, cursing and d-mning his eyes and limbs.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him swear, did you? - Yes, I did, he said d-mn his eyes and limbs if he did not knock the b-gg-r down if he did not let her hands go. Mr. Hill and I conducted the two women to the watch-house, and the man he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man you spoke to, is the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him long? - No, never see him before, only from the severe language he used at that time; if I was to see him I could swear to him, and he followed us to the watch-house swearing.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you whether you saw the man so as to know him again, before you took the women into custody? - No, not till I took the women into custody, and he followed us until we past the Crown and Anchor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face plainly? - Yes, I saw his face so plainly that I can swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt whether the man that was swearing with these women was the man that followed you to the Crown and Anchor? - No; this is the very man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you went to the watch-house? - The constable of the night, who is here, examined the two women, and so the patrol was called, and they were searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any description of the man, which you now say is the prisoner at the bar, to the constable of the night? - I did, and to the patrol both.</p>
               <p>Court. How was he dressed at that time? - I thought he had something of a whitish coat on.</p>

The patrol and the constable of the night after we had left the two women locked up, and he thought that if he could make out this Mr. Lamb he might have the watch and property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner Lamb? - No, it was the patrol, and, I believe, the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. After the time you say you saw him near the Crown and Anchor, where he left you; where was the next place you saw him? - In the watch house, past five o'clock next morning, Saturday morning after the 22d.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to Bow-street? - Yes, I went along with the rest, the constable was there and the patrol was there.</p>

               <p>I live at the Old Swan, Butcher-row, Temple Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live at that house now? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have lived at that house? - Seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner John Lamb at your house any time in November last? - Certainly; I see him almost every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember hearing of the robbery that was committed by St. Clement's church? - I heard of it the next morning, he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at the bar at your house that night? - He was there from eight o'clock till past twelve, and to my knowledge he did not go out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the tap room a good part of that time? - I was in and out several times that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you out at a time? - I was not out except with a pint or a pot of beer to the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you came in again? - Yes. I never missed him out of the room, he has frequented my house for years past.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore I take it for granted, you are sure of his person? - O, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the next morning at Bow-street? - I did, but the examination was over before I came; the prisoner sent for me to go there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. You attended at Bow-street after the examination? - It was over.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house is it you keep? - A respectable house.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you remember the prisoner was at your house the evening of the day a robbery was committed? - Yes, that was Friday night, the 21st, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as to recollect when he came into your house? - I cannot say to a minute, but he was there by eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you think it was eight o'clock? - I am sure he was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Yes, that is very possible, But what makes you recollect it was eight o'clock? - I recollect it very well, because I served him with beer; I am sure it was not nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he sit down when he first came into the house? - He sat down in the tap room; there were two of them that had three pints of beer and a paper of tobacco, who the other man was I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he change his situation while he was in the house? - When he had had these three pints of beer he fell asleep, he put his two hands on the table and fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he fall asleep? - It was past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he asleep? - That I do not know how long he slept.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you from when you saw him go to sleep at nine o'clock, how long it was before you looked at him again and saw him again? - I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect it was eight o'clock when he first came in, and you recollect it was nine o'clock when he fell asleep; it is very odd you cannot recollect when you saw him asleep again. Do you recollect how long he slept before you looked at him? - I cannot recollect the time that he slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sleep an hour? - I will not say that he slept an hour, or half an hour, or whether he was asleep at all, but he had his head down.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080114"></xptr>Q. How long did he keep his head down? - I am sure I cannot tell how long, I saw him there, he was there, he was there past nine o'clock asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you kept your eyes upon him the whole time? - I told you before I did not watch him the whole time.</p>
               <p>Court. He has told you that he had his eyes on him and off him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Recollect the latest hour you saw him asleep? - I cannot tell exactly the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect how long he continued in your house that evening? - I do not recollect that he went out at all till after twelve o'clock, I am sure it was a quarter after twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you are sure that he did not go out till past twelve o'clock. Are you sure he did not go out before and return again? - I could not positively swear, because I was not always in his company.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from your house to Essex-street? - About thirty or forty yards, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say, that in the course of the evening you was several times out with pots of beer to the neighbourhood, more than forty yards from your house? - I do not know that I go so far.</p>
               <p>Q. While you are going out with the beer to your neighbours, whether he was sleeping with his head on the table you do not know? - I cannot say while I was out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at a time when you was carrying beer to any customer? - I might stay five minutes, I might ten, according to where I had to go.</p>
               <p>Q. There is time enough to go to Essex-street, and stay some time, while you was carrying out pots of beer? - I do not think he could go out without my missing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take your oath that you was no one time absent from your house, from eight in the evening till twelve o'clock, that a man could not go to Essex-street in the same time?</p>
               <p>Court. You had better put it another way.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you ever ten minutes out of the house together or five minutes at a time? - I might five minutes, and I might ten.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times do you think you was out that evening? - Perhaps twenty times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You mean this, that between the hours of eight and twelve, except at the time when you went out to carry pots of beer and when you went in again you saw the prisoner there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner stay in your house till past twelve? - He did stay till a quarter past twelve, I shut it up then.</p>

               <p>Q. How long do you think it was? - It might be the value of half an hour, I did not make particular remarks of that.</p>
               <p>Q. That would make it ten o'clock you know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At ten o'clock he was sitting with his pint or pot by himself? - It might be, I did not particularly remark that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then during this was he smoaking his pipe? - Yes, I remember him particularly smoaking, I saw him take a paper of tobacco and his opening it, a fresh paper of tobacco, and he lighted his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. About half past nine? - No, I think it was rather later than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are sure he was not sitting with another person smoaking and drinking? - Not when I first went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Now during the time that you was there he either drank or smoaked one or the other the whole time did not he? - he was, only one time he appeared rather drowsy and laid his head on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - I cannot tell particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he by himself then? - That was the time he was by himself, and I was remarking it to a friend of mine at that same time, I says, Lamb seems to be very sleepy to night, and I suppose he will not speak to night; I had spoke to him, saying, Lamb, how do you do now? and he made me no answer, on that I conceived he was fast asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he light his pipe? - I think he light his pipe about ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. It appeared to you the deceased was about to protect himself, but was taken by surprise by the blow before he had taken his position? A. Yes: the prisoner, immediately he struck the blow, he stopped and picked up his hat, and ran away - the deceased was the worse for liquor - I did not consider him drunk - he was a good deal affected by liquor; and the prisoner was the worse for liquor a goodish bit - both were a good deal the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Mr. McNair, your master, here? A. I have not seen him - I did not see the deceased turn the prisoner out of the house - I had heard talking about it after it was all over - I did not hear him complain of it in the presence of the deceased - I do not know that they had been quarrelling before I saw any thing - this was the first I saw of it.</p>

            . I live in Stephen-street, Lisson-grove. I was in the public-house, and saw the prisoner and Moulton - they tossed for beer, which was brought - payment was asked for - the prisoner refused to pay for it - he had lost his toss - he refused to pay, and was going away - the deceased stood up and placed his back against the tap-room door, and prevented his going away till he paid for the beer - the prisoner challenged him to fight - he would not fight, but kept his hands in his pockets - the prisoner turned himself round from the deceased to sit himself down, and ordered the beer to be brought; and it was brought in a third time - it had been twice taken away because there was a dispute about paying for it - he drank part of it himself, and the rest the company drank - I cannot say whether the deceased had any - he refused to pay for it again - the prisoner got up and left the tap-room, intending, as I supposed, to go home; and in the about five or ten minutes the deceased, myself, and two or three more followed - I saw the prisoner outside - he and the deceased had two or three words in the street - the prisoner challenged him to fight, and before the deceased had sufficient time to raise his arms up for self-defence, the prisoner hit him a blow which knocked him down - I did not observe that his leg was broken - the prisoner ran away - I followed him and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you sober? A. Perfectly - the prisoner was not drunk - I cannot say he was sober - the landlord came into the tap-room with one pot of beer - the prisoner was leaning with his elbows on the iron railing in front of the bar outside - he did not complain of the deceased turning him out of the house in my hearing - he got no blow from any body in my presence.</p>

            . I was house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital. John Moulton was brought in on the 22nd of February, at half-past twelve o'clock at night - he had a very severe compound fracture of the right leg - he got on very well for the first three or four days, but by the third or fourth day erysipelas followed, and ended by suppuration and sloughing, and then exhaustion: in my judgment, the broken leg caused his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he broken a blood vessel? A. I understand, from his friends, he had been troubled with spitting of blood.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the George the Fourth. I stood behind my counter - the prisoner came out of the tap-room, and asked for half a pint of beer - I did not see the quarrel between him and the deceased - I saw the prisoner come from the tap-room to the bar - he stopped there a second or two - then the deceased came out and asked if he was going to pay for the porter he had lsot - he said he was not - the deceased took hold of his collar, pulled him towards the door, and called him a shabby fellow, or something.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the deceased take hold of the prisoner's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100090"></xptr>collar? A. Yes; he opened the door and threw him out - I told the deceased to let him alone, for he was drunk, and I told another man to see if he had fallen down the steps - I went and looked, and found he had not fallen - the deceased went into the tap-room, and came out in a few seconds - they went out into the middle of the street - I saw them both in the attitude of fighting - the prisoner struck the first blow and no more - I saw the deceased with his hands up, and at that very moment he received the blow - I am positive before that, that I had seen the deceased push the prisoner down the steps - the deceased was a stiff set man - not so tall as the prisoner - they were both fresh - the prisoner is a chaff-cutter, and the deceased an omnibus driver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, at 71, Coleman Street—on 13th March the prisoner called upon me, and asked me to advance him 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the security of his stock-in-trade, household furniture, and effects—he is a grocer, at 72, Praed-Street, Paddington—I told him I would do so, provided there was sufficient value, and he had full title, and the goods were free and unencumbered, and he had no bill of sale or claim—I told him he would have to make a declaration—he said, "All right; send up and see "when I asked him about encumberances he said he only owed 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Barrett on a bill of sale, of which I knew—I sent up my clerk, William Gillingham, that evening to Praed Street, and he brought back an inventory which he had taken there—I had arranged with Mr. Jeffreys that if it was all right he was to come down on the Monday morning, and he came on Monday morning the 16th—at that time I had the inventory my clerk had brought—on that day I made an advance to the prisoner, but before that I gave the papers out to be filled up by my clerk—I told the prisoner I should pay Barrett the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., deducting it from the amount—he said, "Oh, no, let me do it, and I shall get something off"—he then made this declaration (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then handed him a cheque—I said, "Now</p>

               <p>there is no claim whatever on these goods, Jeffreys?"—he said, "Is it likely, except the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I owe Barrett"—I said, "Is there any?" and he said, "No"—he then executed the bill of sale, which I produce, and I handed him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., deducting 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses—that included stamps and every<lb></lb>thing—on the following Monday he made a payment of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., off that bill of sale—that was the first instalment, according to the terms of the bill of sale—on the following Monday he paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the second instalment; that was about 30th March—he did not make any farther payment after that—on the 2nd April I sent my clerk to the premises in Praed Street, to take possession, and he returned to me and made a statement—I went up on the Saturday morning and saw the prisoner—the shop was shut up, but I found him there—I asked him what he meant by this, having given a bill of sale a day or two before ours—he said he was very sorry, but he could not help it—he said, "I may as well tell you there is another one," and he mentioned Mr. Wood—I was served with a notice to withdraw by the other holder—that was for 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believed Jeffreys was all right and that he was a respectable man—he seemed to be doing very well—I had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses, including the stamps—the stamps were 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the declaration 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and there would have been the expense of filing only the office was shut—he had to pay 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for four weeks, and as the amount of capital was reduced on the bill of sale so the interest was reduced—he only paid back 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he would have had to pay back about 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made an informa<lb></lb>tion before I got the summons—I said then I inquired of him if the said house<lb></lb>hold furniture and stock in trade was his own and unencumbered and he said it was, and I say so now—I did not say anything about Barrett's bill of sale for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't complain of that—if did not affect the security in any way—I told the prisoner, when I agreed to lend him the money, that he would have to make a declaration, and he was perfectly agreeable to it—I should not have parted with my money if I had known there had been three people before me—I don't know whether there was a forced sale; I came out of possession directly I was served with the notice to withdraw, and I have not interfered in the matter since—I think he had a flourishing business in Praed-Street—I went over the premises for Mr. Barrett, on the prior bill of sale, to see if there was security for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was for Mr. Barrett's 120/.—the valuation was about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I have not got that valuation here, and when I sent my clerk up he went to see that the goods were the same as when I valued them—I have heard that 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid into Court for whoever is entitled to it, and I have been told that that was the proceeds of a forced sale—I don't know it of my own knowledge—I never saw his lease, and I don't know that he has forfeited his lease by reason of a sale on the premises—his assets were put down at 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he filed his petition in liquidation, and his debts, 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The evidence given by this witness in the previous case was read over.</hi>) I was induced to supply the goods on the representation of the prisoner that he was a wealthy gentleman, and that he had an estate in Suffolk—that was mentioned prior to tendering the bill, and before I agreed to deliver him the goods.</p>

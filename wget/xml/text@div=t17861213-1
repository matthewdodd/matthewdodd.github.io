Berkley, Bevan, and Co. Lombard-street; which notes at the time of payment, I saw numbered in the bankers book, No. 6264, 20 l. 4259, 20 l. 8452, 10 l. 1512, 10 l. 8624, 10 l. 3602, 10 l. those notes were all received at Mr. Berkley's; and I had another 10 l. note in my pocket, No. 362, which is not in the indictment; I do not remember the number of guineas; but when it was retaken, there was two pounds eleven shillings wanting; on the 5th of November, between three and four in the morning, I thought I heard a noise in my room, I called out halloo, who is there? nobody answered; upon waking myself more, I thought possibly somebody might have attempted to pick my pocket, and I felt for my breeches, and found my purse was gone; these bank notes were all in the purse; the purse was in my pocket when I went to bed, I am sure of that, and the notes and money were in it; I believe it was a little after twelve when I went to bed; when I perceived my loss, I jumped out of bed and alarmed the house; Mr. Doery<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130003"></xptr> and family got up immediately, and said, do not be uneasy, Sir, nobody can get out of the house; I asked if any body slept in the room adjoining to mine; as in passing, I put my hand on the bed, and found nobody there; and the clothes turned up; Mr. Doery said, the same gentleman that slept there the night before, slept there that night; upon which I said, then that is the man that robbed me; we perceived the sash of the bar was thrown up, and the bar door open, and the door through the bar into the street was also unbolted, which induced us to suppose that the prisoner had made his escape that way; I said, let us lose as little time as possible, and fix a place to meet; we got a constable; and Mr. Doery and his son went out, and they returned and told us the prisoner was taken; I went and saw him at St. James's watch-house; it was then past four o'clock; I asked him how he could do a business of that sort; he went down on his knees, and hoped we would look it over; I told him, I should not wish to hurt him if possible; he was taken before Sir

Mr. Crause said there was 2 l. 7 s. deficient; he was searched, but nothing was found about him besides a knife; I sent home my son, with information, to make my family easy.</p>

On Tuesday, 17th March, I was on duty in Hermitage-street, Paddington—about 2 in the afternoon the prisoner came up to me and said, "I wish to give myself up"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "I have done something very wrong, and I am sorry for it"—I then cautioned him to be careful what he said, for I should mention it again—he then said, "Why, I have set two stacks on fire, belonging to Mr. Smith, at Tanner's-end, Edmonton; I saw them ablaze, and I came away"—I took him to the station and charged him in consequence of what he told me.</p>

I am an inmate of the Edmonton Union Workhouse—the prisoner was there, in the same ward with me—on Sunday, 15th March, in the afternoon, he said he should like to go and do something so that he should get six years, and be sent out of this country, for he was sick of stop<lb></lb>ping about this part—I told him to think better of it, and not think any<lb></lb>thing like that—on Monday morning he said he thought he should discharge himself after dinner—he had asked me on Sunday the way to Mr. Smith's farm—I told him, and on Monday he said he thought he should go and set Mr. Smith's farm on fire—I said he had better not do that—he said, if you don't like to believe me, you look out about 12 or 1 o'clock, end you will see it on fire"—I woke about 1 o'clock on Tuesday morning, and saw the stacks on fire—he did discharge himself from the workhouse on the Monday afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Smith—about a quarter before 2 on this morning, I was called up to my master's farm and found the stacks on fire—at I was running up to the farm I met a person walking away from the farm, very fast—he was dressed in a dark coat; his trousers were rather lighter, and he had a cap on, and was swinging one arm, and the other seemed to me tight by his side—I believe it was the prisoner—I said to him "Hullo, who are you?"—he said, "It's me"—I said, "Who's me; did you not come by the farm?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you not see a fire there?"—he said, "Yes; there are a good many people there," and then he passed on towards Edmonton, and I saw nothing more of him—when I got to the fire there were only two persons there, I think, and three stacks were burning.</p>

I live at 103, Edgeware-road, and am a pawnbroker—I occasionally deal in Irish and Scotch bank notes—on Saturday, 19th April, the prisoner called at my shop with a note in her hand—she asked me if I changed Scotch notes—I said that I did, and gave 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—she said, "Yes, that is right, I have six of them"—she produced the other five from her purse, and placed them on the counter with a half-crown and sixpence—I had had some information, in consequence of which I looked at the notes and asked the prisoner her same—she said Eliza Anderson—I asked her where she lived the said 32, Grafton-place, Camden-town—I asked whose notes they were—she said, "My own"—I asked her where she got them from—she said that they were given to her by a gentleman with whom she had been staying at Windsor for a week—I asked his name—she said, "George"—I asked his other name she said</p>

               <p>she did not know—I asked her what be was—she said that he held a situa<lb></lb>tion in the City, but she did not know what—I had previously sent for a constable, who then arrived—I told him, in her presence, that I had heard there were a number of forged Scotch notes about, and I had reason to believe these formed a part of them—she was then taken to the station, and I handed the notes to the officer.</p>

On 19th April, about 2 o'clock, I was called to Mr. Mills's shop, and found the prisoner in front of the counter—he asked me, in her hearing, if I knew anything concerning some Scotch notes, which had been stolen or forced—I said no—he said that the prisoner came and asked him if he changed Scotch notes; that he told her he did, and offered her 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one, upon which she produced five others, with 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the had the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in her hand—he told me to ask her where she got them, as his modesty forbad him to tell me—I asked her, and she said she had been staying with a man nemed George for a fortnight at Windsor—Mr. Mills said that he was not satisfied with the answer she gave, and I took her to the station, detained her while I made inquiries, first at 37, Haymarket, and then in the City—Mr. Mills then charged her with uttering forged notes—she said that it was very hard that she should be charged—she gave her name Eliza Anderson at first, but six hours afterwards, when I had made the inquiries, and the charge was being taken, she gave the name of Clark—I went to Camden-town, but could not find Grafton-place—I found Grafton-place, Kentish-town, but there was no No. 32; the highest number was 12—I made inquiries about there, but could learn nothing of any woman named Elisabeth Anderson or Clark.</p>

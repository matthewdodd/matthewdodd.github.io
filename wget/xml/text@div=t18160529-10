             was with me. Coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290013"></xptr>through Temple Bar, I said, we will call at the Star and Horse Shoe and have a parting glass, and I did so. We went in, and I saw the two prisoners together at the Star and Horse Shoe. I was rather intoxicated, but not drunk, nor yet sober; I knew very well what I was doing. As we were going in, another young man was coming in; and he and my friend had rum and gin; he did not know my friend; he said, I will drink with you, for you are two taylors; from that he gave the glass to me, and after that to the prisoner; then the strange young man, tossed for half a pint of rum. The prisoners offered to toss to make it up a pint. There was not any particular conversation passed, any other wise then their drinking with us. I believe we all tossed. I tossed and we had the rum between us; five drunk out of a pint and a half; I had only one glass myself. The two prisoners at the bar walked away with me after that; they walked on each side of me. They said we could get some coffee, and we went to a coffee shop in <placeName id="t18160529-10-crimeloc60">Wych-street</placeName>

I went in, but immediately said to the prisoners I don't like the look of this place. I turned out directly, and got about six or seven yards from the door, when the prisoner Colville came up by the side of me, and presently the other prisoner came up. Before I got very little further, I found the prisoner Colville after putting his hand into my pocket. I believe he did not put his hand in, for I think I catched it. I said, you are after robbing me. By holding of him by the hand, I was knocked down, but I don't know by whom. The prisoners had no weapons with them that I perceived. I don't know whether it was with a stick that I was knocked down or how. My head was cut with the fall. It did not make me insensible. I saw nothing of the prisoners after that. As soon as I got up again, I missed my money. I discovered that I had lost between fifteen and sixteen shillings. I saw the prisoners no more, until they were taken to the watch-house. My friend was some distance off. at the farther end of the street, when I was knocked down. I saw the prisoners taken to the watch house in a very little time after. I am sure they were the same men I had been drinking with.</p>
               <p>Colville. Q. Did you ever catch my hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Witness. No; but I caught you putting your hand to it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the Sunday morning, at about half past three o'clock, I saw the two prisoners at the bar, in company with the prosecutor, in Picket-street; there were two more behind, which I did not know at that time. Knowing Chapman, I followed them into Wych-street; they then went into the coffee-shop with the two others; they then came out of the coffee-shop, and I followed them until they came to the corner of Newcastle-street, in Wych-street; they stopped there about ten minutes; they then moved down Wych-street, towards the dark part, which is about the middle; I then crossed over the way. They then stayed there about ten minutes, and I heard some one say, you are robbing me; one of the men fell. I then went down towards them, and the two prisoners ran from the spot by me; I followed them until they got to a coffee-shop in Blackmore-street, Drury-lane. When I saw the prisoners go in there, I told the patrole, who was with me, to go back, and fetch the prosecutor. When he came, we went into the coffee-shop; I went up stairs, and I laid hold of Chapman by the collar, in consequence of what the prosecutor told me. I brought him down; I told him I wanted him; Colville followed down; I told Colville I wanted him also. The moment they came down, the prosecutor laid hold of Colville, and said, that is the man that had his hand in my pocket. I then took them and the prosecutor to St. Clement's watchhouse. I asked Colville what money he had about him, and after some hesitation, he said, fourteen or fifteen shillings; I searched him, and found sixteen shillings and four-pence, with two three-shilling pieces among it. He said, he had changed a one-pound note, when I asked him where he got it. I asked him where he changed it; but he did not know. I searched the other prisoner; but he had nothing at all. When I saw them in the first coffee-shop, I spoke to Chapman; he knew I was an officer; he did not see me in the street after that, because I evaded his sight. I am sure the prosecutor did not join two other men than the prisoners, after he came out of the first coffee-shop in Wych-street. Chapman said to me in the first coffee-shop, how are you Mr. Berry, I hope you will not take any notice of my being here.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. I asked the prisoner Colville, how he got the money, and he said, he had been in Shoe-lane to receive some money for his work. I asked him how much, and he said, he believed a one-pound note. I then asked him where he had changed it, but he could not tell where he got change. I then locked them up, and on the Sunday morning, Colville's mother came, and I asked her in his presence, if she knew any thing of his getting a one-pound note for work; and she said, she did not. Then he said, he received one pound one shilling all in silver. When the prosecutor came to the watchhouse, he was violently bruised, and all over mud.</p>

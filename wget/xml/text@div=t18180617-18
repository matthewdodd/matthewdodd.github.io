               <p>BENJAMIN CRUMP. I live in Castle-lane, York-street, Westminster. On the 11th of May I <rs id="t18180617-18-viclabel100" type="occupation">kept a booth in <placeName id="t18180617-18-crimeloc101">Tothil-fields Fair</placeName>

I laid down to sleep about eleven o'clock at night-there was no door or fastening to the booth; there were five or six candles burning. About three o'clock I was called up by a woman, and found about thirty men breaking the benches, tables, and stools. I went to them, and asked what they were doing? they made no reply, but threw the broken pieces of benches and stools at me, and put out the lights. They struck me, and knocked me down several times-the prisoner, Kelly, was there. I fetched out a sword, and told them if they broke any more I would make use of it. I immediately went into the bar-Kelly and six others rushed in. Kelly caught hold of the sword, and told the others to come on, as he had got it - He only held one end of it, I did not let it go. I turned them all out of the bar again. They went out into the street, and began throwing stones and bricks at me. Four or five of them fell on my wife and beat her sadly. I sent for a watchman. I had to get through the top of the booth to get away-when I got to the top they knocked me down again with stones; I got up again, and jumped into the middle among them, and tried to make the best of my way to the watch-house; they all followed, and Kelly knocked me down with a stick several times. The last time he knocked me down they took all my money out of my right-hand breeches pocket, which was upwards of 2l. in silver. While they were taking it from me, the cry was "Kill him!" or "Murder him! cut his throat!" I got up, and the first that I noticed was Hare; he was close to me, and took half a crown out of my left-hand breeches pocket - They took my handkerchief off my neck. Kelly held me while they searched me. I had the sword in my hand, he took it from me. I lost a bunch of three keys. They unbuttoned my clothes - I do not know who took the money out of my right-hand breeches pocket. They were all apprehended about an hour after.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. This was the second morning of the fair - I was quite sober. My wife took care of the booth while I laid down-there were seven or eight people in it; some of them were dancing-there was neither dancing nor music while the prisoners were there. They made holes in the tarpauling to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the men rush in at first to take the sword out of your hand - A. They had destroyed the booth - I reasoned with them to quiet them. Kelly came into the watch-house with the sword of his own accord - I charged him with being one of them; he had before that made his escape from the watchman. I never said I had no knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner UNDERWOOD. Q. Will you swear that you saw me there - A. Yes; he stood by my side while I was being robbed.</p>

My master was called up by my mother; he drew his sword, and said he would stand in his own defence - They had broken the tables and stools before this. He drove them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170010"></xptr>out-they came in again, rushed into the bar, and tried to take the sword from him; he kept it, and made his escape out of the booth; he sent me for the watchman-they knocked him down.

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty in Totbil-fields-Kimberley fetched me. When I got there I saw the prosecutor getting off the ground, covered with dirt - He was sober; there was a great mob round him. I asked what was the matter? he gave Kelly in charge for robbing him-Kelly heard him, and ran away; I could not overtake him. The prosecutor had no hat on, nor any handkerchief round his neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There might be fifty persons on the spot. I took one of them-he was tried at the Westminster Sessions. The mob fell upon me, and tried to rescue him. Edwards was there, and threw stones at me in order to release him. Kelly afterwards met me with a mob, who tried to rescue the prisoner - he followed me to the watchhouse.</p>

The whole of the prisoners, with several others, threw stones at me to release him - I said I would fire at them. While we were at the watch-house, Kelly came, and said he wanted to come in to say something in behalf of the prisoner - I saw the sword concealed under his coat, behind his back; I pulled it out and detained him-the prosecutor immediately gave him in charge, and said he was one of them. I went to see the prosecutor safe home, and took Edwards and Underwood in a booth. I took Hare at a gambling-house about five o'clock.</p>

I thought they would have killed him - He ran off about twenty yards; Kelly followed, stopped him, and got him against the wall-he cried out Murder! I am sure Kelly was one of those that were upon him. Hare got the prosecutor against the wall, and beat him in a most shocking manner-there were two of them; they got him when he was on the ground.</p>

Norton, stamped with a 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. impressed stamp and a receipt stamp; a name was written over the stamp—as near as I can remember, it was "Lafittau"—I did not notice anything about the figures at the time—on the back was written, "Please pay bearer, as I have not my cheque<lb></lb>book in town"—the prisoner asked me to get it cashed for him—he said he had overdrawn his account, and could not go himself—he said the gentleman was ill; he did not say what gentleman—I took it to the City Bank, and offered it at the counter, and they refused payment—I gave them my address—they wrote on the front of it, "Signature differs"—it was afterwards returned to me, and I gave it back to the prisoner, and said that they had given it me back, taken down my address, and would not pay—he said, "What a pity!"—I left it with him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Victor M. Lafittau's deposition was put in and read as follows</hi>:—"I know the prisoner. I have known him about a year. I did not at any time during September give him a cheque of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to cash for Mr. I did not authorise him or any other person to sign a cheque of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Me. I once lent the prisoner 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some time during the present year. I lent him it to help him in his business. He gave me two acceptances to secure the repayment of the money. My signature appeared on both these acceptances I have returned one of those acceptances to him—Victor M Lafittau."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. When I knew the warrant had been issued against me I had plenty of time to run away, but I did not do so because I was not guilty.

I am ruined by these men for the sake of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The prosecution had not proved that I forged the cheque. I did not know anything of Lafittau; it was not his name. Rosson in his first ex<lb></lb>amination said that the name on the cheque was not Lafittau, but "Safittau"—if I had known it was Lafittau I would have run to him directly, but I never noticed it.</p>

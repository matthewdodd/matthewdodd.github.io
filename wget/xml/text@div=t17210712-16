            , Ostler of the Crown-Inn at Hardest in Suffolk, deposed that the Prisoner came to their House on Whitson-Monday very much in Drink, said he had some Plate of his Master's and desired him to take care of it; that his Master looking over it and finding some of it in the Sleeves of a Livery Coat, suspecting him, and questioning him, he said that he had been to his Master's Tenant for Rent, who having no Money gave him that old Plate. That his Master stopt the Plate, and went to ask Advice what he had best do in the Case: but the Prisoner rode away before he came back; that they got Horses, followed and took him asleep on the Ground beyond Framingham, and his Horse Grasing by him with his Bridle off, and his Fore Legs tied; and that a Ring produc'd in Court and own'd by the Prosecutor, was cut off his Finger, it being swell'd. His Confession before the Justice was read in Court, by which it appeared that he stole the Goods, went to Grays in Essex, there bought a Mare, rode to Hardust, where he was discovered, and afterwards taken as in the foregoing Evidence. The Prisoner being call'd upon to make his Defence, said, that he found the Goods and Money bundled up in the Wash-House, and thought that some of the Washerwomen intended to take them; to prevent which, he took them himself and went away with them.

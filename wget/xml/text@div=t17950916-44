In consequence of some information which you received(I don't ask you what it was) did you go to a house, <placeName id="t17950916-44-crimeloc257">No 11, Windmill-street? - Yes, I did, near Finsbury-square</placeName>

I believe they call them; there was a board put up, and on the window nigh the board, there I found them; I found some of the same sort of things in the front kitchen, a small cutter and three other screws, and one smaller than the other two. I then went up stairs into the garret, and there I found three punches with G. P. and D. on them, and this piece of metal that appears to have been cut out with one of these cutters, one of these small ones. I then found some other little things on a shelf that I am not acquainted with, I found them on a shelf in the back garret. I believe the black ball is to take the deadness off the metal. I then came down stairs, after having searched the other rooms, and at the bottom of the stairs I pulled up a cushion, it appeared to me like a cushion of a one horse chaise, and underneath that was the press. I then went down into the front kitchen, and there I found the fly; and with a candle in the back kitchen, underneath the kitchen stairs, between the stairs and the support of the stairs, I found this leather with these silings, or something to that purpose, and in the shop I found this bottle of aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other man in the house? - No other man was in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160114"></xptr>Mr. Knowlys. On your going into the necessary, you say you asked the man if he was the landlord of the house, he told you immediately? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not make use of any language of this sort, what is that to you, but he told you directly about it. There is one part you have forgot to tell us, part of his dress was unbuttoned? - I believe it was, I cannot positively swear it was or was not, but I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say these things that were found, were some in one place and some in another, no ways collected for the purpose of use? - I described every place where they were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Two of these cutters were laying close by a window, that would catch the eye of any person on the out side of that window? - No, I don't think it could, because it was in the yard, and the window was very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to examine whether there were any marks of chalk on the press at the time? - I did not see any chalks, I did not take any particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say there were none. Now this man kept a broker's shop? - That was our information.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find it so, because I ask you the fact? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a quantity of goods there, such goods as you usually find in a broker's shop? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Q. This man had no apron on? - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have attended trials of this sort? - No, never before.</p>
               <p>Q. His hands had no particular mark on them? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. This thing that you call the press, was laying where? - On the next step going out of the shop, on the first or second step leading up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose other things apparently on sale in that shop, laying close to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Grates and other iron things? - I see no other iron things but grates.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The window you say was close to the back yard? - Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Q. You are one of the officers at Bow-street; you went with Kennedy on the 5th of September, to the house? What time of the day? - About four o'clock in the afternoon; it is an open shop, at the front there is a parlour behind the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you? - Miller, Rivett, and Kennedy, we all went together; I went into the parlour, and there was the wife and servant girl in the parlour, and a child, that was all the people that I first see then.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go then? - I went up stairs; there is only two pair of stairs in the house; I did not find any body there, I came down again; when I came down again Kennedy had got the prisoner in the parlour, I searched him, and tied his hands, and set him down in a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on his person? - Only three shillings and three sixpences, all good; the rest of my brother officers they went to search in the cellar, and different parts of the house, and I stopped with him in the parlour; he whispered something to his wife, which I understood to be the vault, with that I called to one of my brother officers to stop with him, and I went to the vault to search it, and on the floor, by the side of the vault, I found this paper, with these sixpences in it.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is the vault from the house? - About fifteen yards from the house, in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the paper contain the same as it does now? - It did, there are sixty-eight pieces; and then down in the vault I found this scissile.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean on the soil? - Yes, in a paper, tied up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160115"></xptr>Q. When you found these things in the vault, you brought them into the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what circumstances belong to the other piece of metal which you have in your hand? - It was part of the sciffile, we cut it out to try, when we tried the press, the cutting engine.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were the cutters fixed in the press? - Yes, there was only the fly wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the piece of metal in your hand, you cut out of some of the sciffile, with the cutter, as you found it, applying the fly to it? - Yes, just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut it out yourself? - There were several of us together; I held the metal. In the two pair of stairs back room there was a lathe fixed, it is to turn any thing, or to clean any thing with; when we knocked the lathe to pieces, and in knocking the lathe to pieces, there dropped a shilling out of the lathe, Miller picked it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This is a common broker's shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was present at the time the prisoner was apprehended? - No, I came down afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When you see him had he any apron on? - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were his hands dirty or greasy at all? - No, I do not apprehend they were, nothing more than common.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a witness in some of these trials before? - Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the use of some of these articles, would naturally dirty and greasy peoples hands and stain them? - Yes, the aqua fortis would.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the cutting engine was not fixed at all; nothing can be done with that without the assistance of the fly? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The fly I believe was found in a different part of the house? - I understand it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you put the fly to the instrument, in order to cut the shilling, or sixpence? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. You are one of the officers that went to this house with Kennedy and Carpmeal? - Yes; the first that I observed was Kennedy going into the vault after the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before you see Kennedy going towards the vault? - I had not; I see Kennedy bringing the prisoner out of the vault, I took the prisoner into the parlour, and I remained there with him some time; with that, Carpmeal and I went (after we had left another person with the prisoner in the parlour) to the vault, and Carpmeal picked up a paper containing a quantity of sixpences; I took a hatchet and broke open the seat of the privy, and stooping down I picked up a handkerchief with something in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what that handkerchief contained yourself? - I did not; I then remained again some time with the prisoner in the parlour behind the shop; then I went up stairs, in the two pair, there was a lathe, and in searching about I found these plyers and this file in that room, and in knocking the lathe to pieces, to get it from the floor, where it was nailed to, this shilling dropped out of it, and this little bit of scissile; I put a mark on the shilling, that I might know it again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. You searched up stairs I think? - I went to take down the lathe, I did not search there at first.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you found the rooms up stairs full of these kinds of fragments of furniture? - Yes, what commonly is at brokers shops; in the front room there were some glasses and china, and two or three tables.</p>

               <p>Q. You are an officer, you went with the officers on this occasion? - No, I was not at the first search, I was at the second examination, and Mr. Vines, the solicitor for the Mint, was enquiring for some files and things that were missing; some one of the officers answered, there were some files, but they did not bring them with them; and the prisoner said to a man standing very near to me, be off, and get them out of the way; I then desired the doors of the office to be fastened, and put two officers to each door, and Mr. Mac Manus desired me to go to the prisoner's house; I went to the prisoner's house, I found a little girl and a man, who were taking care of the house; I went up into the back garret, where the lathe had been fixed, it is only two pair of stairs high, there I found these two files laying on a chair; I went down into the cellar, and there I found the block which the press is fixed on, it sits exactly this press. In the parlour in the cupboard, I found these two pair of plyers, and this cork, and this set of weights, and some scouring paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. These files you may buy at any broker's shop? - No doubt, one of them appears to have been used very fresh, and the other is rather rusty, and broke.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at an old broker's shop, it is impossible to find things that oftener meet your eye than a pair of plyers? - I have seen them in other shops, but I cannot say in brokers shops.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you one of the officers that went to this house of Tunstall's? - Yes. When we went to the house to make search, I believe I was the first that went up stairs where the lathe was produced from; it was fixed in a manner ready for working, every thing was complete with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing yourself that day? - No, not that day; I went there again on the 9th; we thought there might be something more that was left, that had not been taken away on the 5th. On the block I found this bit of scouring paper, that has been cut by one of the cutters apparently, there is a hole of the bigness of a sixpence in it. In the shop, by the first stair foot going up stairs, where the press and cutter were taken from, I found these two files, they were laying open, by the other things; being disturbed I believe; in the room where the lathe was I found these trowsers, which have been apparently used, underneath a chair; there were several old chairs in the room, packed one in another.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there remarkable in those trowsers? - Being very black. And a waistcoat was found where I found the files, on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there about that? - Nothing but dirt; and here is some more scouring paper. that was found in the shop the second day.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing else there? - No, only the block that was found in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This time that you speak of, going to this house, was four days after the prisoner was in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The scouring paper perhaps you may have seen before in the course of your life? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any grates in this broker's shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably you may know that scouring paper is used to clean grates? - Probably it may.</p>
               <p>Q. The files lay perfectly open? - Just on the step, going out of the shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160117"></xptr>Q. Common files? - They are, but you will see the marks, as if silver had been on them.</p>
               <p>Q. The trowsers have the appearance of being dirty; I think hard working people may have dirty trowsers? - Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. These trowsers laid under the frame of a chair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If they had been under the seat you would not have seen them? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The waistcoat that was laying on the stairs too was open? - That was laying on the first step, close to the files.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you had an opportunity of seeing it? - Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Court to Kennedy. Did you see any of these files when you were there, and why did not you bring them away? - Because it was the first time that ever I was on any thing of this business, and I did not know so well what was necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the files there? - Yes, on the block, and the sand paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any files any where else? - In the window I believe there was one. I am not certain, I know there were some on the block. (The things produced.)</p>
               <p>Dixon. The first is the block, the next is the press, which is fixed on the block; here is a cutter and punch, all fixed ready, and here is the fly.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the cutter for? - To cut blanks out the size of a sixpence, or any other size, by changing the cutter, undoing the screws, and also the same by unscrewing the punch.</p>
               <p>Jury. There are many businesses that use these tools? - Yes, no doubt.</p>

Now let us have the lathe? - This lathe may be applied to many things, it may be used to turn any small article that is to be done quick; they have been used very frequently in edging shillings or sixpences; after the blanks have been cut out they leave a rough edge, and by turning with a small file it takes the roughness of the edge off, and makes the edge smooth.(The shilling shewn him that sell out of the lathe.)</p>
               <p>Q. Does that appear to have been turned by the lathe? - It does; I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the scissile. - There is none here that corresponds to the size of a shilling, but all to the size of a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of the scouring paper? - There does not appear to have been any used. They may use it after they have used the file, if the edges are left a little rough</p>
               <p>Q. Is the file necessary? - Yes, and that file I found in the back garret appears to have been used very lately, for the metal all appears in the teeth of it. The cork is made use of after they are taken out of what they call the pickle; that is, after they are edged and made all ready they throw them into aqua fortis to give them the appearance of silver; that that is produced is aqua fortis without being used; it is called pickle after it has been used. Here are some filings that appear to have been filed off this kind of metal that these blanks are made of. Here is some cream of tartar that is mixed with the aqua fortis in general.</p>
               <p>Q. That piece of blacking, what is the use of it? - I have frequently found it in coiners houses; when they are finished they are generally too bright, and they use such as this to dull the appearance to make them pass; it is bees wax and lamp black, I believe; sometimes it is done with foot, and sometimes with bees wax and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at this parcel of sixpences; take some of them comparing them with the scissile and with the cutter, do they correspond with the size? - Exactly so, allowing for the edging of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160118"></xptr>Jury. Is the metal plated? - No, it is a mixt metal, and when it is put into the aqua fortis it draws the silver outside, what little there is of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Are all the things you have been explaining, a complete set of things to make a shilling or sixpence? - I see nothing wanting to make them in the state they are in. There is no impression, there is nothing else wanting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you never see the press fixed in the way in which you have put it, in the house in the possession of the prisoner? - I was not there when it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. The aqua fortis you have found has never been used? - Certainly not, if it had been used it would have been green.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, of what use is the mixing of cream of tartar with the aqua fortis? - To give them a colour; I have heard so by an accomplice in this court.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that it has ever been given in evidence, that they mix cream of tartar with the aqua fortis? - By an accomplice I have heard so. I have scarcely ever apprehended a coiner but I have found cream of tartar.</p>
               <p>Q. These filings must be whatever a person is engaged in the trade of button making; he must file the blanks that he cuts out? - He must.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore wherever the trade of button making is carried on, there you would be likely to find such filings? - No doubt of it, if it was the same kind of metal.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not analized the filings or the metal that is now produced? - No.</p>

            , a button-maker, and by his not paying me the rent we differed; he owed me almost three months rent, at so much a week, and he had a good many people coming after him, particularly one that I did not like. When I found that I could not get him away, I threatened him with law for four or five different times, till at length I frightened him in such a manner that he did not come any more; he locked up the door and went away, and in two on three weeks after I got into the room, there were three gentlemen in the shop whom I asked to go with me to break the door open, that came to buy something in the shop; I took out the press, and I took it down stairs, and I set it on the stairs of the shop, and a good many more articles I took out of the back room; and the aqua fortis bottle my wife said that she would put into the shop, to try the silver that she took. The fly took up too much room to stand on the press, I took it off and put it down in the cellar and left the frame of the cutter standing on the step of the shop; then this day fortnight, I had been out about some business, and I came home about four o'clock, when I came home I went into the shop, went through the shop, and through the passage into the back yard, to the vault. I did not see any body in the shop, nor any body in the passage, nor any body in the parlour; I heard a noise up stairs, I thought it was my wife felling some goods to some customers. I went backwards to the vault, and there I sat till such-time as I had need get up, and I heard somebody in the shop; I in a hurry put my hand into my pocket to pull out some paper, and my pocket came out some part of it, being in a hurry, I ran to the necessary door with my breeches down, to see who was in the shop, and this gentleman, Mr. Kennedy,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160119"></xptr>came and met me at the door of the necessary, and asked me if I had been throwing any thing away? he looked round the necessary and saw nothing, and brought me out into my own parlour. I have nothing more to say.</p>

               <p>Q. How long is it since he left the lodgings? - Four or five weeks ago, to the best of my knowledge; I cannot say to a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave his lodgings without giving notice or what? - I have heard the landlord say it was for not paying of rent. I have often heard the prisoner ask him for rent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to his room after he went away? - Yes, I have been in his room since. I have seen Hayton shanking buttons in his room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what kind of tools he worked with - No, because I never was in his room; I have stood at the door and see him, but never was in his room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You are an optician. Who do you work with? - One Mr. Linnell, on Snow-hill; I have not been there this fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Then till within this fortnight you have worked with him? - Yes; I have worked with Linnell occasionally these six months.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by occasionally? - Sometimes work was not brisk.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the sixpences. Was that the commodities that Hayton used to deal in? - Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire place in this two pair of stairs room? - I never was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him shanking buttons, and yet you don't know whether there was a fire place in the room - I do not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

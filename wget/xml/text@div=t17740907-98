            . On Sunday the 21st of August I was informed that a suspected person had been seen to carry some bundles into Star-court Shoemaker row; Mr. Clarke and I went there; after waiting there some time I saw the prisoner go into the house with something under his arm; we went into the house and asked for Mr. Robertson (who I knew before); the woman of the house called out Robertson two or three times; Robertson not coming down, Mr. Clarke took a candle and went up stairs; I heard a bustle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177409070048"></xptr> soon after; I went up and found Mr. Clarke had got hold of the prisoner; we found this bunch of picklocks (producing them) in his pocket; the room the prisoner lived in there, with a girl, was locked; I opened the door with one of these picklocks.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he lived there?</p>
               <p>Heley. The landlord of the house, whose name is Nash, told me so; in the closet in that room I found these things; (produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix); he said he knew nothing, of them; there was a box in the room under the bed; I asked him whose box that was, he said it was his; we broke it open and found in it a dark lanthorn, a tinder box and matches, a brace of pistols loaded; we put him in the round house for that night; the next morning the prosecutor came to Sir John Fielding's office to advertise the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was not my lodgings; I went to see the girl that lodged there, as I might go to see any other girl of the town.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge at your house?</p>
               <p>Nash. I believe he used to come backwards and forwards; I seldom saw him come out or in; I let the room ready furnished to a young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at your house the night he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Nash. He was there the day before; I trusted the key to the young woman; what passed I cannot say; he came backwards and forwards to this woman a month or five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Was I in your house from three o'clock that afternoon till the time I came home at night?</p>
               <p>Nash. No, he was out; I saw a person in green clothes bring in a bundle about as big as if it contained two suits of clothes; the girl said he had brought his clothes from his father's; took no further notice of it; I had no suspicions of this.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of this young woman?</p>
               <p>Nash. I really forgot; her christian name is Susannah; I forget her other name; she went away the day after; she used to go by the name of Robertson.</p>

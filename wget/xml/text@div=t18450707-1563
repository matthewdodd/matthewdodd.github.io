                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 88.) On the 23rd of June I was at Hernebolt-pier, Putney, about half-past seven o'clock—there was a crowd of persons looking about at different things—I saw the two prisoners close together—I did not know them before—they were <hi rend="italic">dodging</hi> about round the crowd, which drew my attention—I observed them for about twenty mi<lb></lb>nutes—at last I saw Gayner put his hand into Mr. Boxall's pocket behind, and take a handkerchief out—M'Leod was joining him at the time—Gay<lb></lb>ner's back was across his breast—Gayner slipped the handkerchief between them, and as M'Leod was in the act of putting it into his pocket I took it from his hand, and said I should take them both prisoners—they said, "What for?"—this is the handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, at Stratford. I was staying at Putney at this time—there was a regatta going on, and a great many persons were at the water side looking at it—I did not see the prisoners, or feel the handkerchief go from my pocket—the constable spoke to me—I turned round, and he had my handkerchief in bis hand, and the prisoners in custody—I felt in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—this is it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gayner. Q.</hi> How can you swear to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, By the pattern—there is no mark on it—I can swear I had one of this pattern in my pocket at that time, and missed it directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gayner's Defence</hi>, This is not a clear got up case, for there is nobody but the policeman to give evidence against us; the prosecutor has no mark on the handkerchief; there are plenty of the same pattern; I think it is very hard the policeman alone should be able to convict us</p>

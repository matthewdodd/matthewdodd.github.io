               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons had you in family? A. Seven; myself and wife, my son, his wife, a servant, and two young men: one who attends to the confectionary, and the other is my son's foreman, who is a printer - we occupy two houses; there is an internal communication between them - about six young men are employed in the printing-office; my desk, and my wife's drawer were locked.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it dark between a quarter to four o'clock and half-past six? A. Yes; only one workman was left in the printing-office: the others had left at half-past three - I made the money good to the charity out of my own pocket.</p>

            . I live in Leman-street, next door to the prosecutor, in the house which was to let. The prisoner applied to me on the 31st of October, to look at the house for a beer-shop; he went over the house - I went up to the first floor, and left him to go up higher himself; I heard him up stairs, and when he came down, he asked me if the cellar door opened into the street - I said No; he went into the cellar, put up the flap, and asked me about the fastenings - I told him the rent was 44l.; he said it was 40l., and that he should bring his old woman, or his wife to look at it - he came again on the Friday following, but I was not at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A coachman; I have lived in the house about two months; only my wife lived in the house with me - I drove for Mr. Hill, a stagecoach master, of Highgate; I left him twelve or fourteen years ago - I have been with my son since that, not as a coachman; he is a coach-spring maker, and lives in Mortimer-market.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Friday, the 2nd of November, I was at home when the prisoner and his mother came together, about four or five o'clock: I was at tea; the prisoner said he had been there before, and he knew the way up stairs, and did not wish me to go up - I said I should go too, and went up with them to the top of the house; he came down just before us: the front of the house being shut up, he went forward to the street door to give us some light, as the passage was dark; he went out, and I saw no more of him - his mother and I stopped talking together some time at the street door - I did not see him go out; he could not get up stairs without my seeing him.</p>

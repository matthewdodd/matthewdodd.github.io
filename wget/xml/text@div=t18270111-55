On Tuesday afternoon, the 9th of January, at a quarter past five o'clock, I was in the house; my box was then quite safe; I came home again about half past nine o'clock, and went to bed in the dark - the prisoner had lodged there about four months; I never heard from him that he was going to leave; I was called up at eleven o'clock, found my box broken open, and the property gone - the prisoner did not sleep there that night - he was taken into custody next morning; nobody but him and me lodged in the room, nor were there any other lodgers in the house - I saw my watch at Hatton-garden; there had been another seal added to it since I had lost it - I had had it about six months - when I went out about five o'clock, I left the prisoner in the bake-house; he was employed by me at Ausell's, who is a baker; when he was apprehended, five sovereigns were produced - my watch is worth 2l.; it cost me 3l. 10s. six months ago - two gold seals cost me 25s.</p>

No; I am in Ansell's employ, and have been so for three years, and know his name - he has no partner - nobody lives there but him - he is church-warden, and therefore must be the housekeeper - he always signs his name Thomas - the last time I saw the prisoner was at a quarter past five o'clock; he was then in the bake-house; my box was safe then, for I went up to my room within a minute of the time of my seeing him; I then went out, leaving him in the house, and never saw him afterwards - we work at night; he was not in the house that night; nobody else had business in the room, except the servant - I do not know whether he knew I had the money and watch in the box - he knew I had something there; no wearing apparel was taken - we were not at all intimate; I have seen the name of the parish in letters, but they were not directed to Mr. Ansell.</p>

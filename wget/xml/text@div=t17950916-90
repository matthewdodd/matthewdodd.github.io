I remained in the middle of the road frightened, the shortest thing that I thought was to go and advise with the landlord where I was drinking. Then I went about to all the houses, and there enquired after her, and could not find her. The publican asked me where I lived? I told him at Mr. Bush's; we went to Mr. Bush's, and the publican, and Mr. Bush and me went in pursuit of this girl; after they were in the road they desired me to go back and leave them together; that if in case the girl should perceive me, she might have some suspicion; and I returned to the public house; Mr. Bush and the publican went in search of this girl in different places till they found her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money? - It is impossible to find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the young woman? - Yes. I felt her hand in my pocket. It contained six guineas in gold, and eighteen shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BARE sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Marquis of Cornwallis public house, the corner of Well-street. On Saturday night, between nine and ten, this man came into my house and called for a pot of beer; about ten o'clock he went away; this girl was going out with him; he paid me for a pot of beer out of his purse, and the girl stood close by with him; I see them go out together. A short time after the poor man came in all of a frustration; he could not speak any English, and I could not rightly understand what was the matter with him, till he shewed me that somebody had taken something out of his pocket; I could just make out a few words, that he lodged at Mr. Bush's; I went with him to Mr. Bush's, and I asked Mr. Bush to explain what it was that man meant.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160241"></xptr>Q. What is the prisoner? - I believe she is a girl of the town; she had come in for a pot of ale, but by some means or other she got into acquaintance with this man; they went out in company together posit vely. Then Mr. Bush told me how he was robbed; I went immediately in pursuit along with Mr. Bush, and between eleven and twelve I apprehended the prisoner, the same night; I see her have all these new things in her possession, and a quantity of clothes, which I thought fit to take from her. I found a number of gold rings, which she said she had been purchasing that night. There were eighteen shillings found on her, and six shillings and sixpence that she said she had given to some girl that was along with her. Here is a new pair of shoes, stockings, garters, gown, cap, new shift, and petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she bought all these things? - She was so much in liquor that I could hardly make out what she said. The folks of the house said that she had lost half a guinea out of her hand just before, but which I could not find.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in liquor when she left your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she purchased these things that night? - She had no rings on her fingers when she went out of my house, because she paid me for a pot of ale that night. Here are the gold bobs, the ears had been bored that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bare sent a woman to pull the ear rings out of my ears, and she made my ears bleed. Mr. Bush will be upon his oath that that man had but eighteen pence when he came out. I went in first into Mr. Bare's house, I went in for a pot of ale, for a boatswain of a ship that was at our house; with that this old gentleman was there; he had been there drinking all day, and he spoke to me, and I went out with him, and there were two girls at the door, and he stopped talking to them, About two hours after I was drinking in a public house, and Mr. Bare came and took me over to his house, and searched me all over, and took a locket off my neck, and put me in the watch-house, and on Monday he came and put me in Newgate, and this gentleman came and said that if I would make up the money that I had from him, he would free me of it; I said I had nothing of his; and he gave me some little trisle that he had in his pocket, and bid me good by.</p>

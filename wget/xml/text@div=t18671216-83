                  </hi>. I am clerk at the police-court, Marylebone—a charge of arson was preferred there against the prisoner Edgell on 21st October—on that occasion I think no solicitor appeared for the pro<lb></lb>secution—the prisoner Smith tendered himself as a witness in the ordinary course—I have here the statement that he made. (<hi rend="italic">Reads</hi>:—"Richard Smith, police-constable 302 S. At half-past ten on Saturday night I met the prisoner in Kentish Town Road—I went with him to the Old Farm House, a public-house—we then went to my house in the Maldon Road, and he stayed with me till half-past eleven—the prisoner had gone about three minutes when I went out into my garden to take a bird in, when I heard someone call 'Stop thief!'—I jumped over the garden wall—the prisoner was on the wall—the first witness said he would charge him with setting fire to a house—from the time I let him out of my front door till I apprehended him three minutes only had elapsed—the prisoner said, 'I did not do it'—his trousers were then unbuttoned when I pulled him off the wall—he said, 'I did not do it'—his less and clothes were in a muddy state. He then went down, and another witness, the constable Mar<lb></lb>tin, stood up again and gave his evidence, and after that Smith stood up again and said he had not completed his evidence; he then went on to say, 'Itook the prisoner in the act of getting over the garden wall—I said to the prisoner, 'Bill, don't be a fool, come to the station and settle it'—the prisoner jumped on to a little mound of clay and twisted his hand out of my hand, and ran away—he fell; at that time the prosecutor came up, and we both had hold of him, and Martin then came up—Martin was coming from Collier's Crescent direction, and the prisoner ran away and took a turn round Wellesley Road—I saw him fall about twenty yards from a chemist's shop—I brought him to the bottom of Queen's Crescent, holding him by the arm till Martin came up—the first witness told Martin lie would give the prisoner in charge for setting fire to a house, but he would not give him into my charge, because I was off duty—I was hold<lb></lb>ing the prisoner then; Martin took hold of him, and told me if I did not let him go he should knock me down, he was his prisoner; I told him he was not, he was mine.")</p>

               <p>he was next to the mud then, or in the former part of the evening—I don't think his trousers were covered with mud; there was mud on them—Smith did not throw him down in the mud on taking him into custody—there was mud on his coat when he was in the dock at the police-court—I can't account for how it got there—he never fell while I saw him—the last witness is my sister-in-law.</p>

On the night of 19th October, a few minutes before twelve, I was in the Queen's Crescent—I saw Howell and Edgell standing at the chemist's shop; Howell had hold of Edgell by the collar of his coat; when he came up he said he would give him into custody for setting fire to a house in Wellesley Road—Edgell ran away, I pursued and caught him with Howell—we both had hold of him about the same time—I told him he was charged with setting fire to a house in the Wellesley Road—he said, "I never did it; I have been with Smith all night"—at this time Smith came up, and Edgell addressing him, said "Haven't I been with you all night?" Smith said, "You have." I said, "And not left him the whole of the night? He said "No"—Smith was in his shirt-sleeves; he said, "This is my prisoner, I shall take him"—I refused to allow him to do so, and we had an altercation in the street—Edgell was not buttoning up his trousers when I saw him—when Smith said he should take him Howell said, "No, don't let him take him; he has let him go twice, and don't mean to take him"—Smith said nothing to that; we then went to the station; I searched Edgell and found on him five lucifer matches and this rattle, like a policeman's.</p>

               <p>there is not much traffic there—a person would not get mud on his coat by merely walking along there—during the next week a person was charged with being on these same premises for an unlawful purpose—I believe the houses are the resort of tramps and persons for a night's lodging—I have found one or two there who had taken up their abode there for the night—a person was charged with it subsequent to this fire.</p>

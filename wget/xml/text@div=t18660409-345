I live at 97, Leyton-road, Kentish-town, and keep a chemist's shop—on 21st February, about 2 o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for a pennyworth of pills—she gave me a shilling, which I discovered to be bad—I put it in a cork-press, and, with a very slight pressure, it bent in two—I threw it on the counter, and told her it was bad—she said she had received it in change for half a crown on the previous Saturday—she gave me a good shilling, and I gave her change, and she left—I sent my apprentice to follow her.</p>

I am apprentice to the last witness—I followed the prisoner out of his shop, and saw her join a man—they walked together about a quarter of a mile—they parted, and the prisoner went into Mrs. Newton's shop—I saw her come out, and she again joined the man—I went into Mrs. Newton's shop—afterwards I again saw them walking together—I followed them to the Cock at Highbury, where I saw a constable, and gave her in custody—the man had left her before I saw the constable—I followed them about three miles without seeing a constable.</p>

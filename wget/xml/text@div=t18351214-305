                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. James Piddock, a baker in the Walworth-road. On the 23rd of November, at six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my master's shop, and asked for a penny loaf—he gave me a sixpence—I bit it—I went into the parlour, and spoke to my master—he came into the shop, and told the prisoner he was a very bad boy to give his servant a bad sixpence—my master kept the sixpence, and told him to go along about his business, and he went.</p>

My servant fetched me into the shop—she gave me a sixpence—I made the observation to the prisoner about offering the bad sixpence, and told him to go away, or I would give him in charge—Mr. Viekers afterwards came to me as I stood at my door—he soon after brought back the prisoner—I am quite certain he is the boy—I had kept the sixpence till then, and handed it over to the policeman.</p>

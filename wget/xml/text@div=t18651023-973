                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 142, Lillington street—I had separated from him about six weeks before this, and he lived in Bridge-road, Pimlico, about ten minutes' walk from me—it was his wish that I should leave him—I had always maintained myself—when I had left him a fortnight he found out where I lived—he had threatened me before I left him, and I went to a Magistrate, who advised me to go to him again if the prisoner annoyed me—I summoned him after that before the Magistrate, who bound him over to keep away from me, and he did not follow me about again for a month—he then returned, and said that he would live with me—I said that he should not, left the room, went down stairs, fetched a pail of water, and threw it over him—that was on 29th August, about half-past 8 in the morning—I then went out, and he followed me—I went round the houses so that he should not follow me, and then brought some boys to take my things away, and I left the house altogether—I then went to Rochester-row Police-court, and when I left the prisoner followed me round the corner of Vincent-square—he came close to me, and I pushed him away—he asked me to have sense, and to forgive what had passed, and he would do better—I said, No; I never would live with him again—he still followed me, and I slapped his face—he said, "you shall pay for that presently"—he followed me to Regent-street, Westminster—I leant with my back against the railings—he put his hand in my pocket, pulled out something, and pulled it across my throat—I felt blood running, and sat down on a door-step—I slapped his face two or three times, and this was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards—I cannot remember all that took place—I became insensible—a woman put my gown round my throat, and I was taken to the hospital, where I was six weeks—I could speak plainly before that, but cannot now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Colbourn, of 141, Regent-street, Westminster—on 29th August, about five minutes to 12, I was standing against my door, and saw the prisoner and prosecutrix talking against the railings—I heard her call him a nasty looking wretch—I passed on, and came back in two or three minutes, and saw him as I thought take hold of her throat to give her a good shaking—blood spirted from her throat—he immediately cut himself in front of my face and said, "See, here is another"—the prosecutrix walked some yards, bleeding and holding by the rails—she sat down on a step, and I went into my house—I saw a boy pick up a razor covered with blood—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Westminster College Hospital—I examined the prosecutrix, and found a large wound on her throat five inches long, commencing at the left ear—the muscles were severed—she bled a great deal—we thought it very dangerous for some days, and gave her up once—she would have died unless great care had been taken—the prisoner was afterwards brought in with a similar wound, but larger and deeper—I had no reason to believe he was not sober.</p>

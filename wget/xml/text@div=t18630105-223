                  </hi>. I am a smith's labourer, of No. 1, Gregg's-court, Minories—on 25th December, I was walking in Whitechapel, towards Ald<lb></lb>gate—I looked on the other side of the road, and saw a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> there—I crossed over, and saw Deitz on the top of a man named Murphy, who was on the ground—Deitz was striking him with something which he had in his right hand, like the blade of a knife—I called out, "He has got a knife," and then Henrie ran and attacked me—we had a scuffle—he gave me three or four successive blows on the top of my head, which wounded my head—it bled, and a surgeon was sent for from the police-station to bandage it up—I had not done anything to Henrie—I only hallooed out that Deitz had a knife, and then he attacked me—Deitz did not say anything to me—he did not leave the other man to come to me—my head is not well yet—the sticking-plaister is on it yet—I suffered from it a good long while.</p>

I do not know who; and I crossed over—I did not hear Henrie and Deitz calling "Police"—I do not know how the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> began—I had a bit of a scuffle with Henrie at first, and then he made a blow at my breast, and then he gave me another blow, and sent me on the ground—my wounds were examined by the divisional surgeon—I saw another man have his wounds dressed by him, before mine—the prisoners have been out on bail—I did not go, during the course of the last month, to Henrie's place—I did not see him at all since—I went with another man and saw Deitz, the day after they were committed—I went to know where the other man lived—I did not tell him that if he would give me a guinea I would not proceed against him; nothing of the kind—no police constable was with me, nor was anything said about a police constable—the man who went with me is not here—I wanted Henrie's address because I thought it was no use prosecuting—I should have prose<lb></lb>cuted him even if I had got a guinea; a guinea would not have paid me—I said that if I had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would not have prosecuted him—I did not intimate that I did not intend prosecuting if I was paid—he said he would have nothing to do with me, that the case was altered.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, H 181). On the night in question I heard a cry of "Police" in High-street, about half-past 9 o'clock, in consequence of which I ran to where it came from, and found a small crowd—I saw Henrie and Lynch and another man fighting—I tried to put a stop to it, and Henrie struck me a blow on the head with his fist—I afterwards secured him, and saw Deitz and Murphy struggling together in the street—I caught hold of Deitz, and took these two to the station—I searched them, but found nothing on them—after we had got to the station I saw that Lynch's head was bleeding—I made a closer examination of his skull—there was a small wound in it which seemed to me to have been done by some instrument—I only saw one wound, the one which was bleeding.</p>

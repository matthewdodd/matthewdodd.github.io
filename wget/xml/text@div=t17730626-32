            . I am a silversmith and jeweller, in partnership with Mr. Masquerier: the two prisoners on the 3d or 4th of December came to our shop, and asked for gold watches; before they gave any trouble they desired to know whether I would take a good bill for 100 l. I looked at it, and not knowing Mr. Martin or Mr. Moulson, or the indorser of it. I did not care to take it; upon which Johnson, who was the acting person and principal speaker, said he was very willing to leave the bill for a day or two, that we might enquire about it; they agreed the bill should be left till Saturday; this was Thursday or Friday. On Saturday they called again; in the mean time I made enquiry and had reason to think the bill a very good one; I gave them to understand that I was satisfied; they looked out two gold watches and a gold snuff box, which came to 53 l. 7 s. there was a balance of 46 l. 13 s. I offered them a draught upon my banker for this 46 l. 13 s. Johnson objected to taking the draught, and asked whether he could not have cash; he wished to have cash; I told him if he would call again he should have cash; they appointed an hour when to call again; the prisoner, Gahagan, came alone next time, about four in the afternoon, and wanted to have the watches and the ballance of the cash; I remarked to him I considered him only as the friend of the person who was the real buyer; that I thought the other man was the buyer and wished to see him; Gahagan said he was not well, and could not come; I said it was necessary that he should come because he had not indorsed the bill; Gahagan then said he should come in an hour; both came about seven o'clock in a hackney coach; Johnson seemed not well; I suspected he was in liquor; the things were looked out; Gahagan took them up, and the money as Johnson was not well, and then Johnson indorsed the bill in Gahagan's presence, and wrote upon it

               <p>On his cross examination, he said he thought the indorsement was made before the goods were delivered; that the bill remained in his hands from the time it was left with him; that Gahagan seemed to be a stander by, a sort of an assistant to a man that was not much acquainted with the country; that the occasion of Gahagan's taking the goods was his suspecting Johnson was in liquor; that he called upon him to take the goods of his friend; that he does not know whether Gahagan saw what Johnson wrote, but he remembers he asked Gahagan where Jackson lived, which was a circumstance that he did know what Johnson wrote not having heard the name before.</p>

I went in pursuit of the prisoners from London; I found them at Holyhead, on the 11th or 12th of December, ready to embark for Dublin; I had seen them on the 28th of November; Johnson called himself Jackson; Gahagan called himself by his true name, and said he was a musical instrument maker in Dublin; they told us they had their effects on board the packet; they told me where; I went and brought them on shore. The things were examined in the prisoner's presence; there were gold watches and other things, Mess. Masquerier's and Perigal's among the rest; the snuff box was found in one of the prisoners pockets. They were carried before Mr. Mainwaring, a justice of peace there.

               <p>Miller. I believe not.</p>

               <p>Q. Had not Cranion houses of his own?</p>
               <p>Miller. I know one old one he had of about 18 or 19 l. value. I do not believe he was a man of substance before this fact was committed, because he was not able to pay his rent, and his salary in the office was stopped once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a good place?</p>
               <p>Miller. Eleven shillings a week, and his perquisites might be more.</p>
               <p>Johnson's Defence.</p>
               <p>All I can say is I did not forge it with any intention to defraud Mr. Perrigal or any body else. If I had known there was any thing evil or bad in passing these bills I should not have gone again to Dublin. I told him I should want such and such goods, if he thought proper to examine the goodness of that bill, and I would leave it with him; he had it two days; when I came to him he gave the goods into this man's possession before he ever asked me to indorse it or what my name was. I had no intention to defraud him or any body, as I was only a servant I did not think it material what name was upon the bill, as they were satisfied with the acceptance of it; they said I could not expect any goods upon my own credit being a stranger.</p>
               <p>Gahagan's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Perigal when I went there desired me as being a friend of Mr. Johnson's, to take these things in my possession as Johnson was in liquor; which I did, but had no act or part in any of them. I heard that Mr. How, a gentleman I am particularly acquinted with, was come to England; I thought getting over with Johnson, with regard to these bills, would defray my expence, that I might have the pleasure of seeing my friend; that was my chief motive for coming over. Mr. Perigal must be mistaken; I never changed my name; I said I lodged at the Black Prince Chandos-street; I did not say I owned it; I lodged there eight or nine years ago; I had been there two or three nights drinking, and Mr. Johnson with me.</p>

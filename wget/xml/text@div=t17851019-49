               <p>I am a broker, I had these things of the prisoner, I knew her, I bought things of her which I knew to be her own some years back; here are two curtains, and the valens.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutrix promised upon the word of a woman to take out the things for me, and I was to pay her a shilling a week; I only left the curtains and valens with the broker for a little money;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190086"></xptr> I did not sell them, he promised to return me the curtains if I would let him have connections with me for the seven shillings; I said no, I would not, he swore an oath, and said, I had better think of it; I said you have a wife and family.</p>
               <p>Thompson. I was out in the morning when these curtains were brought to my house, I came to my door, the prisoner was in my shop, and another with her, there was a neighbour's daughter at the door who heard every word, and would have bought them if I had not; I did not know the prisoner at first; I agreed to give her 7 s. for the curtains and valens; however, when she went out one of the neighbours observed something, she said, and the two women whispered together, I heard nothing, I was going to a sale, I went to the stable-yard, and stood at the door of an old acquaintance, and saw the two women come together; my wife said, this woman use to come past our door sometime ago in a miserable condition.</p>
               <p>Is the account she gives true or not? - It is not true, not a word of it.</p>

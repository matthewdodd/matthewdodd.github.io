                  </hi>. I live in John-street, Wigmore-street, and am I shoemaker. The prisoner was my journeyman, and was occasionally em<lb></lb>ployed in the shop to receive money—it was his duty to pay it to me or to my wife—on the morning of the 3rd of September, I told him he had sold a pair of shoes for two half-crowns, and he asserted that he had given my wife all the money he took—I told him he had not, for the man who bought them was there, and said he had given two half-crowns for a pair of shoes—the prisoner said he gave it to his mistress—my wife came in and said he had not—I sent for an officer and gave charge of him—he said he owned he was wrong, and if I would overlook it, he would give me the five shillings.</p>

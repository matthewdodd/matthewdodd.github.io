                  </hi>. I am cashier to Messrs. Coutts, of the Strand—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was presented to me on the 24th of May. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "London, 22nd May, 1876, Messrs. Coutts &amp;Co., Strand, pay Mr. E. Joseph or order one hundred and ten pounds, Elcho.") Lord Elcho keeps an account at our bank—upon that cheque being presented to me I looked at it; I did not like its being on such thin paper, and I knew that Lord Elcho usually used our printed forma, at least that was my impression—I therefore imme<lb></lb>diately said "This cheque is not tilled up by Lord Elcho"—I believe <hi rend="italic">the</hi> prisoner is the person to whom I made that observation—he said "I will tell you about that; there was a sale of pictures on Saturday last, Mr. Joseph purchased some, and Lord Eloho has since bought one of Mr. Joseph"—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080145"></xptr>
               <p>then doubted its being Lord Elcho's writing—I communicated with my principals, and was with them quite a quarter of an hour—afterwards I returned to the prisoner; he was still where I had left him—I said "Well, we cannot pay this cheque; we must communicate with Lord Elcho and Mr. Joseph before we can pay it, we will do so as speedily as possible and send up to Mr. Joseph—he said "Oh, very well," and left—we ascertained that it was not Lord Elcho's signature—I went out of town and did not see the prisoner until the 23rd of June at the Lambeth police-court, with three other prisoners—only one other prisoner was dressed similarly to himself—I picked him out readily; I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not pay the cheque because I doubted the signa<lb></lb>ture—it was not for me to detain the prisoner—I picked him out from three persons besides himself—one of them was shorter. and stouter than the prisoner—I do not think two of them were costermongers; one of them was a rough-looking person; one was a coachman—I cannot say how they were dressed; I think one was dressed much in the sphere of life as the prisoner; the other one was shorter, not much, and the other about the prisoner's own height—the man who presented the forged cheque, I think, had on an overcoat, but I was not very long looking at him, and when I was looking at him I was noticing his face to obtain information from his countenance—he had on a tall bat, and I beblieve an overcoat, and my impression is that it was in colour rather brown than otherwise—when I saw him he was dressed as he is at the present time; he appears to be rather better dressed than at the time he presented the cheque—I said at once, when asked, that I thought he had no whiskers, or if so, very little indeed—the man was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

I am a clerk at Coutts' Bank—on the 24th of May, a cheque was brought there—I saw who presented it—I had an oppor-tunity of observing the man for fully twenty minutes; to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man—I did not hear him speak on that occasion—I was taken to the police-court to identify him; I saw him amongst other men and I identified him.</p>

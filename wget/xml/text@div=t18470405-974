                  </hi> I am shopman to Benjamin Prew, of Holborn. About a fortnight or three weeks ago I saw the prisoners in the shop—Mr. Prew put this check into my hand, which I took to Messrs. Ransom's Bank, in Pall<lb></lb>mall, and presented it, but did not get payment—I brought it back, and gave it to Mr. Prew—I had not seen the prisoners make any purchases—I afterward took a parcel to No. 31, Gray's Inn-lane, to the name of Williamson—I found no such person there—I afterward saw Jenkins, sent for an officer, and he was taken to Bow-street.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clothier and live at No. 295, High Holborn. On 1st March the prisoners came to my shop—one of my young men served them—Jenkins requested to be shows a coat—he bought one—Williamson said he should like a pair of trowsers, which he selected—Jenkins said, "I will have a pair of trowsers also," which he close, and asked for the account, which the young man made out—it was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—Williamson tendered him a check for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—the young man called the cashier, who took the check and brought it to me—I saw all that passed—this is the check—I went to the prisoners and said, "It is not usual to take checks unless we know the parties; do you live in the neighbourhood?"—Williamson said, "I live at</p>

               <p>No. 31, Gray's-inn-lane." And wrote his address himself in pencil on the bill of parcels, which I produce—I said, "I will send the check to the banker's—he said, "Do not do so"—I said, "Oh, yes, I will"—I called Strand to go with it to the Bank, and said, "When I get the change I will send it with the parcel"—Williamson objected, but I told Strand to go, and the prisoners left the shop—about half-an-hour afterwards Jenkins came back and asked for the change and parcel—I said, "I have every reason to believe there is some thing wrong about the check"—I sent for a policeman and gave him in charge—he said he was a respectable man, and gave me his card—I sent him to Bow-street—in about three quarters of an hour Williamson came in—I said, "I have sent your friend to Bow-street, and shall send you with him"—he said he hoped not—I sent for a policeman and sent him to Bow-street.</p>

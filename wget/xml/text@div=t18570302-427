                  </hi>. I live at Tanner's-hill, Deptford. On 18th Feb., from half past 2 to 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was near the Naval School, Deptford, hawking water cresses, and saw Mears, who I had seen twice before, sitting by the road side, and Clayton was about 100 yards off, hawking apples, Mears had a barrow with rabbits, he asked me how I was getting on in trade, I told him very bad; he asked where my brother was, I him he was in Southwark house of correction, for passing bad money—Clayton came up and spoke to Mears, I had never seen him before; Clayton said to me, "Will you buy any bad money?"—I said "Yes," and be produced out of his pocket two florins and a half crown, and told me I might have them—I declined buying it, and told him I had not sufficient money in my pocket, I did not ask the price—Clayton put them into his pocket again, and Mears took the basket of apples, and went towards the Marquis of Granby, Clayton had had it before; he then went to get his barrow, and I went off with my cresses—I went right facing the Marquis of Granby, saw a constable named Farrar, in plain clothes, and told him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on duty in Deptford on 18th Feb., near the Marquis of Granby, in plain clothes, and saw Dunmell hawking water cresses; he made a statement to me, in consequence of which I called another constable to go with me to the Windsor Castle beer shop, which is rather better than fifty yards from the Marquis of Granby; when we got there Mears was sitting outside, with a basket of apples in front of him, and there was a barrow on the opposite side, with some baskets in it, and some rabbits—I went into the beer shop, and saw Clayton skinning a rabbit in front of the bar; there was only one other person there, James Moore—but the land<lb></lb>lord was behind the bar—I asked Clayton what he had got about him, as I was a police officer, and wanted to know; he said that he would not be searched there, if I wanted to search him I must take him to the station house—I told him that I should not, and took hold of him; we struggled together for one or two minutes, during which time Adams brought in Mears—while we were struggling Moore came behind us and said, "What is this?"—I looked round and said, "That is what I am looking for, that is what I want"—I saw either a florin or a half crown lying on the floor, and beside it a piece of blue paper, which was picked up and laid on the counter, it con<lb></lb>tained two florins, and a half crown, or two half crowns, and one florin was loose; I put them in my outside coat pocket, where there was no other money—these are the coins and the paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Clayton took out what he had in his pockets and laid it on the bar, there was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money; two sovereigns, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or. eighteen pence in copper, and about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—he said that he knew nothing at all about the other man or the money, meaning the bad money—I had seen Mears come round the corner of the Marquis of Granby with a basket of apples, and go towards Deptford, a different direction to which I found him; I did not see him come back, but he must have—I had not seen Clayton before.</p>

I looked down, and saw a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece or half crown fall out of the paper; I picked it up, and put it on the counter—I had never seen either of those coins before I kicked against them; I swear that—that was the money that Turner took up—after that I saw a paper with 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it on the floor, six or eight inches from the other place, and near to a crack in the floor—I picked that up and put it on the counter, too—I had never seen it before; I did not open it—I had never seen either of the prisoners before.</p>

After the Councel for the Queen had open'd the Charge, the first Witness, was Mr. Talboy, who depos'd as follows: That going thro' the Temple, he saw some Thousands of People there, that had attended upon Dr. Sacheverell from Westminster-Hall, he heard some of them cry out, That they would pull down Mr. Burges's Meeting-House that Night; others were for pulling it down the ensuing Night, and a third sort not till they had seen the Event of Dr. Sacheverell's Tryal. They all agreed in the Design, tho' they differ'd to the Time of Execution, which however was the next Night, the 1st of March. For the 2d Witness, Capt. Orril depos'd, That about 10 at Night he was at Leonard's Coffee-House, and News was brought there, That the Mob had pull'd down Burges's Meeting-house, he then resolv'd to go about where they were, in order to do what Service he cou'd to the Government, in making Discoveries, &amp;c. That the first Place he went to was Mr. Bradbury's Meeting-house in Fetter-Lane, where he saw the People rifling the same, and was there forc'd to pull off his Hat; And about half an Hour after Ten he went into Lincoln's Inn-Fields, where there was a Bon-fire made with the Materials brought from Mr. Burges's Meeting-house; and he saw at a Distance from him (towards Powis-House) a part of the Mob, headed by a tall Man: That he went up to him, and spoke to him, and found him to be the Prisoner, with the Queen's Coat and Badge on; That he saw him twirl his Hat, and cry, Damn it, I'll lead you on, God Damn ye, we will have all the Meeting-houses down; I'll lead you on. High-Church and Sacheverell, Hazza! He further depos'd, That that part was divided among themselves where to go next, and a Councel of Mob was call'd; some were for going to Wild-street, others objected against that, and said, That was a Hen roost, and propos'd to go into Drury-Lane, for that Meeting was worth ten of that in Wild-street: Upon which they all agreed to go to Drury-Lane, and the Mob not being so quick as their Leader<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="17100418004"></xptr>would have them, cry'd, Damn you, why do not you come along, High-Church and Sacheverell, Huzza!

He observ'd, the Prisoner had been there about two Hours, was positive to the Man, and said, That he was one of the principal Men in exciting the Mob, and went off with part of them to Drury-Lane just before the Guards came up. Several other Witnesses depos'd to the same Effect, That the Prisoner was very active in assisting, animating and exciting the Mob. The Prisoner in his Defence produc'd Evidence to prove, That he had been drinking from 9 in the Morning till 10 at Night, at which time he was very much in Drink; and one Wood depos'd, That he and the Prisoner drinking at an Ale-house in Water-Lane, about 10 at Night, News was brought thither, That there was a Fire in the Strand. The Prisoner then said, That there was a Lady in the Strand that used to buy Coals of him, and he would go to help her.

The Alehouse-keeper depos'd, that the Prisoner went away much in Drink a little after Ten, and being ask'd whether any News of a Fire was brought to his House? reply'd no.

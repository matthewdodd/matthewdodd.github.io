I was in St. George's hospital, I left the coachman behind, because he did stop, he came after me into the hospital, I know his No. 825.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to examine the witnesses separate, (they were examined apart).</p>
               <p>- DICKSON sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of July I went to the prosecutor in the hospital, he told me he could find the man that robbed him, I went to the prisoner's lodging next morning, the prisoner was in bed my Lord, and a girl with him, this pistol, this stick, and these two cutlasses lay by his bed side, I desired him to get out of bed, he asked what he was apprehended for, I told him, he stood for half a minute and then he fainted away in the chair, I took him to the office, and in the office he acknowledged this hanger to be the prosecutor's, he told the other man that was concerned with h im. (Prisoner. You had like to have forgot that I believe.) He told us their names and where they lived, we went after them many times, and could not meet with them; the pistol was loaded with a piece of a picklock key and several other pieces of slugs, here is a charge of powder enough to carry five balls.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I believe that man said, that I said, that the hanger belonged to the prosecutor, that I confessed it in the Office, was you there at the time Mr. Dixon? - I was.</p>
               <p>What did I say when you came into the room to take me? - You said very little to me, because you fainted away.</p>
               <p>Did not I ask you more than once or twice what I was apprehended for, and you told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110012"></xptr> me, the justice would tell me when I came to the office? - Perhaps once or twice while I was putting the things together, I took no notice of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Gentleman said, he had lost a sword, and he did not know his sword, but he believed it was his property; my Lord, consider what this man's character is: I have an evidence that will satisfy you whether I know any thing of these things or not.</p>
               <p>- GRUBB sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the taking of the prisoner. I had an information of this man; and I told Dickson if we went betimes we should find him in bed; Dickson went first and laid laid hold of him, and went round by his bed-side, and found all these things laying by his bed-side.</p>
               <p>Did you see all these things by his bedside? - I did, my Lord: I saw Dickson take them up. The prisoner asked what he was apprehended for? We told him it was for robbing the musician on the Brompton Road, that was cut so; he immediately dropt as dead for the space of two minutes as cuold be; he then begg'd for a little water and came to. Then Dickson examined the pistol, and I saw him draw the charge, it was loaded and primed; it is the same charge my Lord, that was in the pistol, then he was committed. He acknowledged it to be the prosecutor's hanger at the office. We had an information from him of the other men, and where the watch was, but we could not find them, nor get the watch again; it was sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If your Lordship took notice, he said, that Dickson broke the door open in the morning: I opened it myself.</p>
               <p>Dickson. My Lord, I try'd to force the door; I knew it was not safe to stay knocking: but whether it was opened or not I do not know.</p>

About the 19th of July I went to supper with one of my shopmates, at eleven I came away; I met a a young woman that I had some acquaintance with before, we had a glass of liquor; I desired to go home with her, I slept with her that night in a house in Grubb-street, in the morning at six o'clock I was going to get up to go to work; I heard a noise, I opened the door which was near the bed, and in came these two men: they said to me, we want you. I got up, my cloaths laid in a chair, they found no money; they asked me where my cash was, I said I knew nothing of any: they found two swords or cutlasses, and a pistol. The young woman said, gentlemen, I hope you do not take this young man for any of these things that are here, because he knows nothing of them, these things were left by a young man last Sunday. I will call her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Red Lion, Brompton. On Saturday, 28th Jan., the prisoner Hughes came, and I served him with a glass of gin—he gave me a half crown—I bent it with my teeth, cracked it, returned it to him, and asked him if he had any more like that; he said he had not, and that he was a respectable man, working in Curzon-street—he offered me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the trouble I had had in drawing the gin; he did not drink it—I bent the half crown and then straightened it, but it cracked, and I returned it to him—he had 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin, and left.</p>

On Saturday, 28th Jan., about quarter to 6 o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came to the house; Hughes asked for half a quartern of gin, and threw down half a crown—I suspected it, tried it in the detector, and found it was bad—he turned round to Moore, and asked her where she took it; she said, "At a butter shop"—he said, "Why did you take such money?" and asked her if she had sufficient to pay for the gin; she took 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of her pocket, and paid for it—I gave the bad half crown to Hughes; it bent easily; it was soft.</p>

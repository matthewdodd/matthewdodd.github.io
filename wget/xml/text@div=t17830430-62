               <p>Did you put it into the drawer? - It was put in when it was brought home, the last I saw of it, it was pinned on a pettycoat, at the shop door, that was last Thursday week; last Wednesday I missed it; a duplicate was brought to our house, by a person employed by Sir Sampson Wright, and I went to the pawnbroker, Mr. Parker, in Prince's-street, where we found the cloak, which Mr. Parker has; the prisoner was taken up last Tuesday night; I remember the face of the prisoner, but I do not know where I have seen him.</p>

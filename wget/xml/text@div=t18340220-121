On Saturday, the 4th of January, I missed this skittle-ball, at half-past four o'clock, on my return home - I had seen it safe at nine o'clock that morning - in consequence of information, I went to the station-house, and from thence in company with a policeman to the prisoner's lodgings - I did not see him - I saw some children - I received the skittle-ball that evening from the prisoner's father, after I had been to his lodging and could not find it.</p>

            . I was at the public-house that day between one and two o'clock, in company with the prisoner and others, having a pint of beer - the prisoner and a man named Seagram, who is not in custody, wanted to borrow an apron of Morgan - he would not lend it to them - they did not say what they wanted it for - Parry came in with a coat under his arm, and the prisoner and Seagram borrowed that of Parry - Seagram then went into the skittle-ground - the prisoner was in the tap-room; when Seagran came back - he said, "Marshall, go out into the privy, you will find a black bundle, bring it through; and when you come through pretend to have got a pain in your side" - Marshall went, and came by the door with a black bundle, and something wrapped in it - Parry's coat was black - I saw the prisoner with the bundle under his right arm - it was a coat with something wrapped up in it - Seagram persuaded him to take it to his father's house; and Seagram said they could sell it for 3s. or 4s. - they took it home - they both went away together.</p>

I am pot-boy to the prosecutor - I was cleaning pots in the ground, and saw Seagram come out of the place, and Marshall followed after him with the coat under his arm - it appeared larger than it was at first, and Seagram followed him - when my master returned home about five o'clock, the skittle-ball was gone.</p>

            , Esq. I had missed corn several times out of the granary, and having the key in my possession, I knew somebody must enter by a false key; in consequence of that, on the 14th of February, I set Joseph Grover to watch the place, on the top of the hay-mow, opposite the granary; I told him, if he heard any body go into the granary, to call me, which he did, between seven and eight in the evening; I immediately ran into the yard, and saw the prisoner come down the granary stairs with a sack in his hand; I watched him into the stable, and then ran round the garden to the gate, to see if he carried it off the premises or not; in the mean while he made off; I pursued him as far as the King's-arms public-house, and could find nothing of him; I went in pursuit of him, till I met with a man of the name of

            , with a sack on his back; I asked him what he had there, and said, I believed it was my master's property, and insisted upon seeing it; he threw it down in the footpath, and made off; about one hundred yards further, I met with the prisoner, I took him by the collar, I told him he was a rogue, that he had entered my master's granary, and stole some corn out; he said, O pray say nothing about it, O pray, master, say nothing about it; I took him back to where the sack was, and put it on his shoulder, and made him carry it to where he lodged; I sent for a constable, and gave charge of him, and took him before a Magistrate; I took the sack to my master's, and it was delivered to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the sack where you left it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between seven and eight o'clock, how soon after did you meet with the prisoner? - A. About a quarter of an hour after he came out of the granary; the sack is not marked, but I know it to be my master's property, by its having had some flour in it; I had seen it in the granary that day, there was about a bushel of barley in it; I know it to be my master's, it was a particular sort, very much mow-burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you seen barley in the same state of other people's? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not very light when he came out with the sack? - A. No, it was not, but there was light enough to know him; he is a labouring man; he had worked three weeks for my master; when he came out, I saw the sack was a sack that had had flour in it.</p>

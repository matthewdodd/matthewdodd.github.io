I am the daughter of the last witness—Janette Henderson came to live with my father in the middle of August—on Tuesday, 28th September, I went up to turn the bed down with Janette Henderson, and she pointed to the top drawer where mamma kept her money—she said, "Do you know what your mamma keeps in there?" and I said, "She keeps the money and the plate in there"—she asked me the next one, and I said, "That is where mamma keeps her trinkets and handkerchiefs, and all her little things"—she asked me the next one, and I could not tell her—she</p>

               <p>asked me the next one, and I said, that was where the babies clothes were—the next two she asked me, and I could not tell her—she said, "Em, what say you if we go to Scotland?"—I said, "What do you mean by going to Scotland?"—she said, "Me and you"—I said, "I am sure I won't go:" and I said, "We should have no clothes to wear if we were to go"—she said, "I will tell you the way to do it; I will dress in one of your mamma's morning dresses, and you must put on all the dresses you can, and one of my long ones over them, and nobody will know we are daughter and servant"—I said, "I will tell mamma when I see her"—she said, "Don't tell your mamma, and I will give you sixpence when I get my wages"—she did not say how she would go to Scotland—I did not tell my mamma; I forgot all about it—I did not think she meant it—on 1st October, before breakfast, mamma gave me the keys to get some things out for breakfast, and I was mixing some mustard—while I was doing so, Maria took the keys and she locked up the mustard in the cupboard, and took the keys away—I was sent to get the keys from her, and I met her at the bottom of the bedroom stairs—we called the prisoner Maria—she then gave them up to me out of a pocket which she had on—I went and got my breakfast, and took the keys back to mamma—after I had had my break<lb></lb>fast I came out, and the prisoner asked we to put my boots on and get her a pennyworth of apples—I put my boots on, and she gave me the penny—mamma was out in the yard, and the prisoner saw me going to ask mamma if I should go—she said, "You need not ask your mamma, I have got to go with some mangling, I will go with you"—she went out with me—when she got to the mangling place, she said, "Let us have a run while we have got the chance," and then she told me that if I would go with her, she would buy me some new clothes, and she would go to Gravesend, and from there to Margate, and would get a ring on her finger, and another little girl with her, and pass for married—I consented to go, and she went up Woolwich-common, and Shooter's-hill, and she gave me two threepenny bits and a half-crown, and told me to get two pounds of picnics, and if they were 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, I was to give the two threepenny pieces; and if they were 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, I was to change the half-crown—they were 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and I changed the half-crown, and gave the picnics and the money back to her—she said she had got 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which she had from the porter at the union—we went through Greenwich-park, and she bought some things which she paid for herself—she went to the station at Greenwich, and asked whether the trains went from there to Gravesend—they told her that they went from New Cross—we went to New Cross, and one train had just gone, and there was not another for some time—she went into a public-house, and when she came out I saw a sovereign in her hand, and I said, "Maria, you are richer than I thought you to be"—we then went into a haberdasher's shop to buy Rome stockings for her—while she was there in the shop she gave me something rolled up in paper and a purse to hold—she had got some more papers in her pocket—I was sitting with my back to the door, and she was sitting face to the door, so that she could see the officer come in—she then turned pale, and passed me all she had got, and did not know what to do—the policeman asked her whether she had taken the money, and she said she had, and was sorry for it—it was the bank notes she gave me to hold, but I never knew she had any bank notes—she told me she would go to Margate and get a ring, and another little girl, and pass for married—she said she would take the child down to Scotland, and that she had got an aunt there, who</p>

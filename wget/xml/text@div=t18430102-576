                  </hi>. I live at No. 24, Lyon-street, New Kent-road. On the Saturday night, before Christmas-day, I was standing near St. George's-road, between eight and nine o'clock, and saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> No. 1182—I know Mr. Beswick's house—I saw two men and a boy come from towards Mr. Bes<lb></lb>wick's house towards the <hi rend="italic">cap</hi>—the boy was carrying a largeish bundle on his right shoulder—he went towards the last <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on the stand, No. 1182, Which was driven by Collett—I took the number at the time, as I suspected them—they seemed rather suspicious to me—the bundle was first put on the front of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—then the two men went up, opened the door, and put it inside—the two men then came away, and went down a court by the side of me—where the boy went I cannot say, but the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove off directly—I do not know who was in it—I gave information to the polioe—the two men came away directly, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went off—I did not see the boy after—I do not knew the distance of York-street from Mr. Beswick's—I should say it is more than a mile—I did not observe the people to notice them—their heads were down, and their hats over their eyes.</p>

I was left in charge of the house, No. 9, Lock's-fields, on the night of the 24th of Dec.—I was put in charge of it shortly before twelve o'clock, and at half-past twelve Michael and William Guilday came there—I laid hold of Michael, and told him to come with me to the station—he asked what for—I asked if he did not occupy the up-stairs front room—he said he would split me to the ground if I entered it—I waited some considerable time till I got assistance—I kept the door in view, keeping outside myself—I went out, from the threat he used—I after<lb></lb>wards got assistance, and secured them both.</p>

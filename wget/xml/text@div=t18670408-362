                  </hi>. I am a draper at 29, Aldgate—on Friday, 15th March, between five and six in the evening, my attention was called to the prisoner in my shop; she was standing or sitting by the counter at the timez—I saw her return three pieces of ribbon to the counter from under her dress, one piece dropped on the floor—I gave her in charge—she had been near the door in the lobby—she was going out and I stopped her—I told her to come back, and she came from there to the counter, and then put the ribbon on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Lonsdale—I saw the prisoner in the shop—she was looking about a great deal, which made me notice her; she was then by the counter—I saw her take hold of a piece of ribbon from the basket and pull it a little closer to her—I went round to the opposite counter and saw her take a piece of pink ribbon and put it under her dress—I informed Mr. Lonsdale—I afterwards saw her take three pieces and put them on the counter: one fell on the floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were you from her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four yards—when I saw her move the ribbon she was not being served then—Mr. Blackmore, who had been serving her, had gone to another part of the shop—the ribbons were on wooden rollers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did she seem to take them from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From her person somewhere, not from the floor—I was not behind the counter then, I was at the window on the opposite side, and she was between me and the counter—the ribbons could not possibly have dropped on the ground; they were on the counter in a basket—Mr. Lonsdale charged her with stealing them—I think she said, "You are mistaken; I never in<lb></lb>tended to steal them"—she did not say they had dropped on the floor and she had picked them up.</p>

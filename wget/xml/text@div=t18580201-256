I went to the North Briton public house, in Bedford Square, Stepney—I found Barry sitting in the tap room—I called him out, and told him I apprehended him for stealing a quantity of plate from a trunk in No. 2 warehouse, London Docks, in Oct. last—he said, "I did not steal it; a man in Cannon Street asked me to pawn the forks, and told me I should have for myself all I got over 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—on our way to the station, I cautioned him, and told him I would put a question to him; I said, "You told me a man in Cannon Street told you he would give you all for yourself that you got over 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., do you know</p>

               <p>that man?"—he said, "I do not"—he was afterwards examined at the police court, and Rossiter was examined, and during her examination I heard Barry exclaim, "You know you pawned the two gravy spoons and fish-knife at Childs, in the Highway, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get a carpet out of pawn."</p>

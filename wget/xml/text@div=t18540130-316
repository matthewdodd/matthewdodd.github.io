                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Gregory Brown; he keeps the Canteen, in the Artillery-barracks, at Woolwich. On 14th Jan. I had occasion to go into the coal cellar, which is at the back of the house—there is a cow shed at the entrance to the coal cellar—I had to pass through the shed to get to the coal cellar—there is a back door close to the coal cellar—it is used by military men and others to come into the Canteen—it opens into a small passage, where the soldiers go past—a person standing at that door cannot see the entrance of the coal cellar—as I was going into the coal cellar on 14th Jan., I found some bottles in the right hand corner of the coal cellar—the coal cellar was not kept locked—the bottles were wrapped in hay and coals—there was a black mark with ink across the corks of two of the bottles—I did not disturb them—I gave information to Edward Dutton, a lad who works there along with me—he came and looked at them—the policeman was sent for about ten minutes afterwards—the policeman came, and was watching out of one of the windows at the back of the house—I had seen the prisoner in the tap room that morning, eating a mutton chop—about 9 o'clock that morning I had occasion to call to the cellarman about putting some beer into bottles, and at that time I saw the prisoner at the bottom of one flight of stairs—there was one small flight of stairs from where he stood to the cellar door—those stairs do not lead to anything except the cellar.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 340). I was sent for to the Canteen on Saturday, 14th Jan., about half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I placed myself against the window of the second floor, to watch—I could see from there the passage that leads to the coal cellar—I could not see the door that opens into the passage—that passage leads from the back door of the Canteen—it is a way to go out till 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and then that door is locked—about half an hour after I placed myself there I saw the prisoner and an Artilleryman go towards the door, where it was pointed out to me that the bottles were concealed—I knew the prisoner before, but I did not know it was him at the time I saw him go; I had not the oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing his face—after I had seen them go towards the cellar, I saw them come back in about five minutes—the prisoner returned with a soldier's coat and cap on—they had changed clothes—the prisoner came</p>

               <p>back in a military costume—I am sure it was the prisoner—they went in the back way of the Canteen—I left the window, and came on the stairs—I saw them pass the window of the Canteen; I followed them to the barrack yard, about sixty yards from the Canteen—I stopped the prisoner, and told him I took him on suspicion of stealing wine from the Canteen—I called the sergeant to my assistance—the prisoner said, "Very well, that will do"—I found on him three bottles of whisky and two of sherry—he had a large military great coat on, which went over all—two of the bottles were in his trowsers' pockets, and the others in the military great coat—these are them—the corks of the sherry have a black mark on the top—I took the prisoner to the police station—the other man got away then, and was not taken till the Monday following—the Magistrate thought as he had been at work, he might be drawn into it by this man, and he was discharged—his name was Martin—after the prisoner was taken to the station, I went to Martin's room in the Barracks, and found the prisoner's coat there—in the fireplace in that room I found several bottles broken, and the corks marked with black stripes just the same as these are—I found eight men in that room, in bed, drunk—they had all been throwing up from the drink they had taken; and likewise the corporal was drunk—I afterwards identified Martin—I went to the coal cellar on the same evening, about an hour afterwards—I there found a bottle of whisky corresponding with those I found on the prisoner; I also found that the back gate was locked, and had been locked previous to the time that I went to watch, so that no one could come to this back place unless by going through the house—I ascertained it was locked before I went to the watch—it is supposed to be locked by the provost sergeant every afternoon at 4 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cellarman to Mr. Brown. I was in the cellar on 14th Jan., about 1 o'clock—I saw the prisoner about that time coming into the cellar—I met him about half way up the cellar—I spoke to him, and asked him what was the matter—he said, "I saw the flap open, and I thought I would come and look at your cellar"—I said Mr. Brown did not allow any one to come into the cellar—he turned round, and muttered something, and went towards the place where he came down—he stood a second or two, and then went back—the whisky and sherry were kept in a small cellar on the right of the ale cellar; it is close to the bottom of the stairs—I turned into the ale cellar—I was able to see from there the place where the whisky and sherry were kept—the doors are opposite—the door of the cellar where the whisky and sherry was kept was open—there is a passage leads from the ale cellar to the whisky cellar—in going up the stairs he would have passed the place where the whisky was—I could have seen him if he had gone up the stairs, but he did not; he went out the same way be came in, up the flap, and in going that way he would not pass by the whisky—I had seen the whisky and sherry the day before—I did not count it—I believe there was two dozen of whisky, and thirteen bottles of wine, that I had counted—on the Saturday evening I examined them again, about a quarter before 6 o'clock, I found two bottles of whisky, instead of two dozen, and only six bottles of sherry—when I saw the prisoner about 1 o'clock he appeared as if he had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer's assistant in Doctor's-commons. On 1 28th July last, I was in Ludgate-hill and met the prisoner—she addressed me, and followed me—I turned a little way up the Old Bailey and we stopped talking to each other for about two minutes—she then snapped the chain of my watch, and ran away with it down Ludgate-hill—I followed her, and came up with her—I requested her to return me my watch and she did so—I gave her in charge—I had known nothing of her before.</p>

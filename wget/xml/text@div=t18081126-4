               <p>Q. How long after you had been in the top shop did he come there - A. About four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had come in what did he do - A. He put on his coat, and when he had got his coat on he took up a piece of bolt copper and put it in his breeches, below his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been at work in the shop before - A. He had the day before; he usually pulled his coat off and put it there. After he had put the copper into his breeches he went out into the street; I told my father, and my father followed him and brought him back; he came along the yard, and my father catched the bolt copper as he was going to deliver it.</p>

            , SENR. Q. What is your business, Mr. Frost - A. A brass founder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 1st of October, in consequence of what your son told you, go after the prisoner - A. Yes, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I overlook him in St. John's square, Clerkenwell, about four or five hundred yards from my house; I brought him back to my own house; as soon as he got into the premises he made a run to the place where he had put his coat on to the lower shop; there he attempted to deliver the piece of bolt copper; I saw him take it out of his breeches; he attempted to throw it down; I caught his hand, in the scuffle it fell to the ground; but I felt it in his hands and saw it; I took it up myself; this is the piece of copper; I can swear to it being mine. Here it a nick in it here, and being half sawed off, and then broken off, I know it by that; I am sure it is my property. I had it of the copper company the day before; I had two hundred weight and a half to be worked up, for the company.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed these marks the day before - A. No; I observed it when he took it out of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not buy that copper of the company, he had it off a Jew that brings him stolen copper sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Frost, junior. Is that the same sort of shape and sized copper that he put into his breeches - A. It is.</p>

            , fifteen years of age, was servant to Mr. Frost, who had missed a piece of copper as he supposed; he on that day stopped me and had me searched by a constable in his own house; nothing was found upon me; upon which I was permitted to go home as far as St. John's square; when one of the prosecutor's sons came and fetched me back, and brought me into his house, where I underwent a second search; I saw a piece of copper, which I thought was similiar to what the prosecutor lost, and seeing the copper laying there; I picked it up; I then stooped to pick up another piece; when I had so done the prosecutor's son said, oh! you pulled that out of your pocket; whereas I never saw it till I picked it up, thinking it was the piece that was lost; therefore I must have put it into my pocket, after I was brought back, to have taken it out after I came there which inconsistency I beg to lay before your lordship and the court.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Frost. That boy says in his defence, that you having missed some copper you suspected him, and that you had him searched by a constable; that after being searched nothing was found upon him; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260006"></xptr>permitted to go home, he went as far as St. John's square, and was fetched back by your son; - on the 1st of October had he been searched by any constable - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He says that after being searched by a constable, he was allowed to go as far as St. John's square - A. He was allowed to go as far as St. John's square; the constable came afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought back, he thought some pieces of copper were laying there like that which you lost, and he picked it up - was that the case - A. No; there were no pieces of copper in that room, except that piece of copper I caught in his hand as it was tumbling down.</p>
               <p>Q. to Frost, junior. On the 1st of October, the day you have been speaking of, had the prisoner been searched by any constable before he went out - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the lower shop at the time he was brought in with this piece of copper - A. I was in the yard, just behind my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your father take the copper from him - A. Yes, I was just in the entry of the door way of the lower shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the piece of copper came from, immediately before your father took it from him - A. I saw it in his hand: my father make a snap at it; it fell down on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it come out of his breeches - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him stoop to pick up any thing off the ground before your father made a snatch at it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any copper in the place where your father took the copper from him; was there any copper lying on the ground for him to pick up - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a constable sent for afterwards - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

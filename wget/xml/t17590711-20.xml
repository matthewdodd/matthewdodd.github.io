               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Conolly. She had been with me, I believe, two nights; I do not exactly know the time: when her bed-fellow came home, she went to go to bed; she came and told, the sheets were missing; and said, the prisoner was a servant at the Bull-and-Mouth. I went there, and told the man of the house what had happened; and he said, if he met with her he would keep her, and send for me; which he did: I took her to Justice Fielding; going along, in Covent-Garden, she acknowledged to me the taking of the sheets; and said, she would go and pawn her stays, and get them again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she had done with the sheets?</p>
               <p>Conolly. She said she had either sold or pawn'd them, for 2 s. to Mrs Parsons, in Gray's-Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell which it was she said?</p>
               <p>Conolly. I think she said she had sold them: I went with the constable to Mrs Parsons's, and we took Cannon with us, and ask'd for the sheets; Mrs Parsons produc'd them: produc'd in court; I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your wife?</p>

               <p>Q. Did Parson own that she bought them? or that they were pawn'd to her?</p>
               <p>Walker. Parsons said, she gave Cannon 2 s. for them.</p>
               <p>Cannon. She gave me but eighteen-pence for them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Walker. What do you think they are worth?</p>
               <p>Walker. Mr Conolly said they cost him 5 s. at first, and they are not at all worn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lawson. What are those sheets worth?</p>
               <p>Lawson. They are very coarse: they are worth nothing more than to make towels on.</p>

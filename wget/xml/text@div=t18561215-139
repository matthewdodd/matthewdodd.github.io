On 27th Nov. four men were drinking at the middle bar together for about two hours—the prisoners are two of them—there are three bars and three entrances—I had a wooden money tray by the bar parlour door—any person in the bar could see it—there are three doors to each bar—it in partitioned off—I saw Linkson take up the wooden tray, and go out with it—I gave an alarm, and ran after him—I had to go round the bar—Mr. Richard Jones pursued him, and I stopped to pick up the money—he threw the tray down some distance from the door; the drawer came out, and I picked up a quantity of gold and silver—Wilson was by me, picking up the money—I took hold of his hand, took the money out, and put it with the rest.</p>

I turned my head about, to see who it was, and in the heat of my passion, I did not know before then that I was blind: I had received two or three blows on my upper lip, and the blood gushed out at my mouth and nose: then I was turned partly on my right side, and my money was taken from my pocket, which was 2 l. 1 s. 8 d.

I felt my buckles taken out of my shoes, which cost me a guinea about a month before; my papers were taken out of my pocket, but were brought to me the next morning, by a rope-maker, who found them, and by my name on them, found me out. I lost my hat and wig in the robbery; I was confined within for three weeks, by the bruises I received, and my teeth were loose in my head. I sent a message to Sir

Here is a wig, (Produced in court); I cannot pretend to swear to it; the person that made it, has swore it to be my property, but he is not here. The prisoners were taken on the 30th of July, and carried before Justice Berry: I was there; the woman said she found the hat in the path-way; but I should have mentioned before, as soon as I got home that night, I sent two people to look for the hat and wig; they returned, but could not find them. I have no knowledge of the prisoners, neither do I remember seeing them, before I saw them at the justice's: the woman owned she took a gold loop and button from off the hat; here is the cover to the button, which she owns to be the same; (Producing it.)

I said, she looked like a captain of a collier. Her mother and she fell out about the hat and wig, and she went to Bow. She said Robinson and she parted at the Green Dragon, which is within 300 yards of the place where the robbery was committed. Robinson keeps her company.</p>

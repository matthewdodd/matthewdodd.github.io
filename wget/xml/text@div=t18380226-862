                  </hi>. I am a ship-broker, and live at Mile-end. On the 1st of March I was in an omnibus—I got in at Coventry-street, and get to Mile-end-gate at twelve o'clock at night—in my progress I had dropped a half-sovereign—I missed it opposite the London Hospital—when I stopped, I told the conductor I had missed it, and he said, when he got a light he would look for it—a candle was got—we looked, and found the half-sovereign—just as I got through the gate, I missed my handkerchief and returned to the omnibus—I had to put my handkerchief down to kneel on it, to look for the half-sovereign—I went back, and said, generally, that I had lost my handkerchief—I got in, and could not find it; but soon after that, the handkerchief was given to me by the policeman, who is here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant K</hi> 10.) I was on duty, and heard the prosecutor say he had lost a handkerchief—I saw the prisoner come from the omnibus to an unoccupied toll-house—I was not aware there had been a robbery—I saw the prisoner throw something over the half-door—it was something of a soft nature—I could not see what it was—the prisoner passed me, humming a tune—the prosecutor then said he had lost his handkerchief—I went to the place, and found the handkerchief now pro<lb></lb>duced—I gave information—the prisoner went in the direction of the omnibus—I went there, but he was gone—the next morning I appre<lb></lb>hended him in Whitechapel, coming out of his father's stables—I said took him on suspicion of stealing a handkerchief—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I asked him if he was conductor to Mr. Dodd's om nibus—he said he was—I said, did he remember seeing me in the road—he said he did, and that he was going to the toll-house to make out his bill.</p>

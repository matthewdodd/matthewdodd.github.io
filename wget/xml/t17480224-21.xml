               <p>Lee. Because Ann Milner told me it was there: I took the Prisoner up on the seventh of February and carried her before Justice Mussell ; he asked her how she came by it; she said she found it in the clothes; the Prisoner used to wash for me.</p>

             came to my shop, my son was in the shop, and Milner offered to sell the spoon to him. My son seeing a crest on the spoon called me ( he had weighed it); I came into the shop directly , and asked the young woman how she came by it; she told me she had bought it: I asked her what she gave for it; she told me eighteen shillings: Said I , my girl you have been imposed upon, it weighs but two ounces and a quarter, and, at six shillings an ounce, comes but to thirteen shillings and six pence. I asked her where she bought it; she said at a pawnbroker's: I said I would see her righted: Said I, what is his name ? she told me he lived in Somerset Street [by Whitechappel-bars ]. As we were going to the pawnbroker's, she tugged me by the sleeve, and said I will tell you the truth. This spoon is not mine, it is a young woman's who sent me to sell it. I said you should not have told me such a falsity . I went to my neighbour's, and he said there was no such thing taken out that day. (I went for my own satisfaction to know the truth of it) When I came from the pawnbroker's I had her back to my shop, took her name down, and where she lived, and I enquired what the person's name was that she had it from, and she said Calabar; I do not remember the christian name. I said I would take care of the spoon, and told her she must look after Mrs. Calaber, for her own security and character; and I found that Milner's mother went to inform Mr. Lee who had the spoon.</p>

               <p>Elizabeth Stephenson. I have known the Prisoner ever since she was twelve years of age; she is not seventeen now. I have known her father and mother as long as I can remember, and I never knew any harm of her. I hope you will take it into consideration , on account of her years, and because she has nobody to speak for her.</p>

I have produced these three Exchequer bills, one for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 6568: one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 423; and one for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all three dated 15th June, 1848—they are for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per cent. per diem—they expire twelve calendar months from the date—the proper place of deposit for them after the period has expired is the Exchequer-bill Office, from whence they are delivered into the Audit-office for examination—I have never seen any Exchequer-bills of the same date, number, and amount issued at the same time.</p>

The prisoner has been in my service sixteen years; I have been in the habit of losing my articles for some time; I may say some hundreds, and I knew of these things going; I placed a servant below to watch him, as he had the range of all my premises; I marked several potatoes, parsnips, and onions, I kept them below in an hamper; the servant that watched him gave me information; I then called the prisoner into the accompting house, I desired him to take out what he had got in his pockets, and put it on the desk; he said he had got nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him - A. No; he took out a parsnip marked R, and two onions marked R, that is the mark I had put on them; he then took out eleven pieces of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they fire wood - A. Yes; he said he had bought the onions and the parsnips in Clare-market; I told him he had brought them from below.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this all that was found upon him - A. I did not search him, he took them out himself; he came at seven o'clock, his business was to light the fires below. This was all that was found on him. I saw the wood, the onions and parsnip all safe at eleven o'clock the night before; the pieces of wood are worth about a penny. The other articles were taken at some other time.</p>

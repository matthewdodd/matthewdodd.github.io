The next day Herne came to search for another will; I told him to bring the woman, saying, I was ready for her.

               <p>Herne. The prisoner at the bar wrote that.</p>

               <p>Herne. I am positively sure of it.</p>

               <p>Herne. At his own house, in Short's Gardens, next door to the Bull-head ; when it was done, I delivered it to the prisoner, he and I went then to Catherine Gannon's house; this was about the latter end of January, in order to get her to go to the Commons to obtain a probate of the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is her house?</p>
               <p>Herne. She lives in Higin-Lane ; she agreed to it, and went there by the name of the widow of

We were all stop'd on a Saturday morning, it was about the latter end of January or the beginning of February, I cannot be exact as to the day. We were together after we made the will almost every day; the woman knew the prisoner before she knew me; they were both taken before I was; then the people came to me at the Paul's-Head; I had a tankard of purl before me, they took me and carried me before my Lord Mayor, there the prisoner owned the name

               <p>Q. What did the box contain - A. A great deal of value; the articles that I lost were plate and money, more than put in the indictment; there were eighteen guineas and forty pounds all but a shilling, and three large handsome silver cruets, and a great deal of silver coin.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out who had taken it - A. Nobody knew where this box was but the prisoners; they lived opposite of me. They were put in the box ever since October, and they were all safe in the box in October. In April my sister said she had got an old guinea, I said, I would look for an old guinea that I had, and my sister turned pale as ashes. I found my box broken open in May. I left my key with my sister when I went out, no common thief could have taken them things. I had a search warrant. Mr. Read, the officer, searched the prisoner's apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any property upon the prisoner - A. Yes; ten guineas in a little box, and in April she could not pay a quarter's rent; she told me so. There was this silver snuff-box on the table, and a dozen silver-handled knives and forks. In case if it had been a common thief, do you think they would not have taken them; there were nothing taken but from the box under the bed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the premises of Croome and his wife, on the 5th of May, about five o'clock, they were both at home; they lived in a one pair of stairs room, opposite of Mrs. Penn In a box in the cupboard I found these ten guineas; there were dollars in the same box; Mrs. Penn said, she did not think she could swear to them. I did not bring them away. The next day I went for them they were gone. I took the prisoners in custody, the first day this half crown was found in a drawer in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Look at them guineas - A. This is the guinea I swear to. Mr. Penn and I have often looked at it; he thought it was a bad one, as well as me. It is my own. I believe it was him that broke the box open, and not my sister.</p>

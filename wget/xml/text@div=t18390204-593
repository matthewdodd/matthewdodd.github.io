                  </hi>. I am the sister of Mrs. Bell, and assist her at the Duke of York public-house, in York-street, St. James's. I was in the bar-parlour, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, on the 10th of January, and heard a noise in the cellar, I went to the bar and saw the prisoner coming up the cellar steps—he went through the passage and across the mews, near to the stable—I saw he had a bottle in each pocket—he afterwards came back into the tap-room, and I gave information to. my brother-in-law.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the public-house. I went down, and found the staple of the cellar door broken, and the door open—I had left it locked at half-past twelve o'clock the night before—I missed six bottles of sherry wine—I then went to Mr. Hoare's stable in the mews, and found two empty bottles, three full ones, and one partly full—I went into the loft with the policeman, and found the prisoner very much intoxicated, lying on some straw—I knew him from his being about the mews for four or five months—I tasted the wine, and it agreed exactly with what I had in my bin.</p>

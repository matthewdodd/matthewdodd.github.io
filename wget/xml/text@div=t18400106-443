                  </hi>I am gardener to the Rev. Frederick Sandys Wall, of East Acton. On the morning of the 31st of December I saw the prisoner with a person named Thomas Bailey loitering about in East Acton, near Mr. Young's—five geese, the property of Mr. Lovell, were feeding on the green—they drove them about—I went out and followed them—they drove them more than three hundred yards, and drove them down a lane, and the prisoner kicked one of the geese as he drove them down the lane—I told Lovell, and went through my master's premises, as a near way, to stop them, but when I came I found Lovell had got them both—I took one to the officer, but Bailey has since escaped, I understand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was never near the geese, only one flew at me, and I kicked it. I went down the lane to see if it was a thoroughfare. I am innocent of driving them—they were not ten yards from the top of the lane.</p>

                  </hi>I am a labourer at East Acton. In consequence of what Buggy told me I went down Crown-lane, and met the prisoner and Bailey coming up the lane, having left my geese—I collared them, and took them to the head-constable of the village—I found my geese about two hundred yards from the end of the lane—they were going on a strange road, beyond where I met the prisoners—they are not in the habit</p>

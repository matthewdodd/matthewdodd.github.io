               <p>What did you loose? - Fourteen guineas, which were in my trowsers pocket; there were six whole guineas and sixteen half guineas; they were in a leather purse. She kept a disorderly house. We went in there to get some girls; she and I were standing in the middle of the room; she was close to me; she asked me for two shillings for the bed; I gave her a half guinea to change; she went down stairs and then brought my change up; and put the remainder of the silver into my pocket.</p>

The prisoner took my money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you see her do that? - When she took the purse I asked her what she was going to do with that; she said the girls were strangers to her, that they were clean, but she did not know for their honesty, and I had better let her have it till the morning; I told her I did not like such ways as that; she said she was landlady of the house, and her house and goods were good for that, and I should have it in the morning; I told her I did not like that, that I was capable of taking care of my money, and would have it myself; I offered to take it from her, and she went down stairs; I did not go down after her. In the morning when I came down to get my money she was gone from the house.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get any of your money again? - No, I never got a farthing of it. I went that morning and acquainted Justice Sherwood's men of it; they went along with me, and we found her and the man that she used to keep company with in the Borough, at one

             while you was there? did you see him pay for any thing? - He had paid for some liquor that we had had and we had some pork steaks for supper; we were to have a girl a-piece to go to bed with.</p>
               <p>Were you to pay for the bed? - Yes; two shillings a bed.</p>
               <p>Who demanded the money of you? - That girl (the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Did she demand any of Herring? - Yes, two shillings, which he paid; he wanted a guinea changed; she got change and gave him the change.</p>
               <p>From whence did he take his money, was it in a purse or loose in his pocket? - I believe in his pocket loose; I did not observe that; I saw him give her a guinea; she brought him the change, she kept the half guinea and gave him the rest in silver; he had paid for the bed, then he had to pay her for the girl afterwards; then she slipped the purse out of his pocket, saying, what have you got here; he said it was his money; she said I insist upon keeping it till to-morrow; he said no, no, he would keep it himself.</p>

               <p>How came she to see his purse? - I am not sure whether he took the guinea out of his pocket or out of the purse; but I saw him have the guinea in his hand and I saw the purse afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did she give any reason why she would keep it? - She said she would keep it for him; there was no fear of it if it was fifty pounds, she said; no, no, said he, I would rather have my money, and I will have it.</p>
               <p>Did she give any reason why she would take the purse and keep it for him? - No reason but that she would keep it till to-morrow morning; he would not let her have it.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to take it from her again? - He asked for it, she would not let him have it; there were the two girls there at the time; she went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Did he go down after her? - No.</p>
               <p>What became of the half guinea; did she keep that half guinea? - Yes; she kept it all but the silver, she gave him that.</p>
               <p>You do not know what money there was in the purse, or whether there was any? - I know what money was in the purse, she told it down into her own hand.</p>
               <p>What became of it then; did she return the purse? - No; she would not return either purse or money, she put the money into it again.</p>
               <p>How came she to tell it? Did she say any thing of this sort; I desire it to be known how much there is or what? - She told it to herself and said there is fourteen guineas of it.</p>
               <p>Did she speak that out to all the company? - Yes; when she told it over he asked her for it, but she would not let him have it; the money ran in my head all night; I got up about six o'clock, I went down stairs and enquired of the landlady's sister whether the landlady was in the house; she said no; I asked where she was; she made no answer; I ran up and told him she was gone; he put his hand in his pocket and said she has got all my money, I said I know that.</p>

There were three in company, and they all fell a clapping their hands in this manner (describing it).

               <p>Q. Had you any character with her? - A very good character. On the 8th of May, Friday, yesterday fortnight, I got up in the morning towards seven o'clock, to open my shop; when I came down stairs, I found myself fastened into my back room; I could not get out. It is a room that leads from the stair case into the shop, I made a violent push against the door, at last the door flew open; when the door flew open I got admittance into the shop; my shop seemed in disorder, the shutters were half open and half shut. The bar that went across was taken from its place from the shutters; I found it in the middle of the shop. I also found the sash of my glass door taken down and placed about the middle of the shop. When I came to unlock the street door I found there was no key in the lock, but the key taken out of the lock some where else towards the window of the shop; I went up stairs to my wife and asked her if she had sent Mary out for any thing and my wife said, no. I went down into the street and inquired of my neighbours if they see my servant go out that morning? and I was informed that she had gone out; then I went to my wife and the went up stairs in the maid's bed chamoer, and the found all the things gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go up and see the things gone? - I did not. My wife did. My wife went down into her dining room and found there was thirteen shillings and sixpence lost out of a drawer; says she I am robbed. My wife went in search of her, and I went in search; I went and traced the prisoner and found her at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross. About the hour of one or two o'clock; I went into the inn belonging to the Golden Cross, there I found the property booked, going off by the Gosport stage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it booked? - I did not. I charged her with the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you keep her in custody? - Not till the officer got there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your property? - I did. I found it at the inn, in the warehouse, packed up in a box and bundle.</p>
               <p>Q.Were all the property mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200116"></xptr>in this indictment in that box and bundle? - It was. The indictment contains all that was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that box and bundles delivered up to you? - Yes, it was, to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the other prisoner Bryant? - We went and searched with the officer at Bryant's room. I have seen her come different times to my servant with a letter. I found them both together. I found Bryant in the cellar of the Golden Cross afterwards, with the prisoner in the tap room of the Golden Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have her detained too? -Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the book keeper here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is the warehouse from the tap room? - Very little distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to either of these people in that tap room? - I did. I told my servant she was my prisoner; she told me she would not go along with me; I was not a proper officer; and she would be charged by a proper officer; I I went in seach of an officer, and I found one, and I took him to the cellar and I gave charge of them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing? - They said they would not go along with me. but they went with the officer to St. Martin's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any body here from the Golden Cross? - I did not know there was any occasion for them, or else I would have sent for them. The constable had the key and opened the box and found the things.</p>

             to the inn, with my neighbour; she screamed out the minute she saw me and told me that she had wronged me, and that the other prisoner that was with her was the insigation of it, I did not know that she had got the things at the time.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you made her any promise? - No. I was there before my husband; I was down in the cellar when the other prisoner came to set off Ann Batt; I see them in the cellar that they go to wait till the coach sets out. The other prisoner was not with her at first but she came in about three minutes after I came in. I asked Batt how she could think of going off in the morning so before I was up; she told me that she was very sorry that she ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing more when the other prisoner came in? - She said, she had been her ruin, and had persuaded, her to rob her master and mistress; and the other said, that she had never persuaded her to do any such thing. When I was going in pursuit of Ann Batt, I met the other prisoner before I found my servant, and I asked her, what she had done with my servant; that I was informed that they were both gone off together; Bryant told me, that I might go to Hell and seck her, for she had sent her to chapel; and she made many bitter reproaches at me; and she told me, I should never hear of the prisoner no more; and that she had got my property, and patted her pocket, and said, that she had the value of my property in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention what the property was? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that your property was at the Golden Cross? - I only missed a shewl, and thirteen shillings and sixpence, that is all that I knew of. I see the property booked at the inn in the name of Bryant. I see the property in my servant's bundle, and two boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both of these boxes taken to the watch-house? - Yes, both of them, and the bundle likewise.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose boxes were they? - My servant's own property; she bought one, and paid for it honesty, while she lived servant with me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200117"></xptr>Q. Had you seen both of the boxes in her room? - Both of them; I speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. I only want to know the fact. I dare say you speak the truth; one was a bonnet box? - The other box I see her buy it, and it was made out of some tea chests, covered with paper, figured paper, when she bought it, there was a bit of paper tore off at the bottom, so that we could see what it was made off, and I knew it by that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the same boxes that you see at the warehouse? - Yes, they were the boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the same at the watch-house? - Yes, because I was with them all the time. There was nothing of mine in the bundle but two coloured aprons; they are valued sixpence. One box was tied, and the other was locked. They were opened in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are all the articles in the indictment these things that were in the two boxes and bundle? - Not in the two boxes; in one box there was nothing but her bonnet and bat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the locked box that your things were? - Yes, except the apron. I always found her very honest till she got acquainted with this other woman at the bar. I have intrusted her with money and property, and she was always an honest girl.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see the other woman in the house? - I had never seen her in the house. I had seen her at the place whrer we occupy our business, at the Change in Rosemary-lane, coming to my servant, bringing her repeatedly a dirty letter.</p>
               <p>Q. All the property that belonged to you was in Batt's box? - Yes, it was.</p>

             passed my door. I live up one pair of stairs, and Ann Bryant had a bundle in her hand, and she said, as she went by my door, that she would take the girl to her father and have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from Rosemary-lane? - Mine is just next Towerhill, by the king's tobacco warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Not a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Batt. I wish to know, whether, that morning that she see me with this woman, that I told her that my master and mistress had beat me, and ill used me, and that I came away from my place on that occasion? - No, she did not, it was the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. To Bradford. Was it in Bailey's-place that you took the bottle? - Yes, Mr. Cooley took it from there, and delivered it to me. Mr. Cooley said, that is my bottle; I will swear to it; it had some gin in it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was nothing in that woman's room but that bottle. (The bottle, &amp;c. produced) It used to stand continually on the dining room shelf; I have had it eight years. It is not worth owning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss it with the other things? - I missed it the next morning.</p>

               <p>Court. Look at the other things? - These shoes, black spanish, have my own private mark on them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This muslin shawl we were washing, and it is rough dried now; all the things are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Batt. In the morning I went away from the place, this woman advised me to leave the place, and then afterwards she advised me to rob my master, for her to have the money that the things would sell for, and go to Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bryant. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Bryant called four witnesses, who gave her a good character, and said she got her bread by washing.</p>

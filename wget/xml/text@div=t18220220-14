On the 20th of January, I went out at dinner time, and returned a quarter before seven o'clock, I am sure it was after six o'clock, it was very dark - I saw a light in the room as I came up to the door; I knocked at the door, supposing my wife was not gone to church; when I knocked a second time, two young men came down and opened the door - I cannot swear to either of them; they rushed out, and both ran away. I had a bundle under my arm, which I threw into the stable, and pursued, they were then turning Francis-street, and running across towards Tottenham-court-road; I cried Stop thief! the prisoners were stopped and brought back to me - I went back and found two bundles of linen tied up and thrown inside the stable door; I go through the stable to my room; I put them on a box in the stable, and saw Cousins take them away. I missed nothing but the property in the bundles.</p>

            . I was returning from Hampstead-road, on the 20th of January, about seven o'clock, it was quite dark, I had occasion to call in Francis-street, a young man was with me; we had knocked at the door, and heard a loud cry of Stop thief! in Francis-street; two men were then running from the dark part of Francis-street, towards Tottenham-court-road; I pursued one, who passed me, through Francis-street, into Tottenham-court-road, and at the corner of the chapel, I took a crowbar from his hand, as he struck back with it to keep me off; he made off to the other side, but before he could reach there, he was so exhausted, that he stumbled against a stone and fell. I secured him and took him back to Collings - I believe Hatfield to be the man, but I cannot be sure; he very much resembles him. I gave him in the charge of Collings, he was locked in the stable till the officer came - I do not like to swear to him.</p>

            . On the 20th of January, I was in my own house, in Francis-street, and between half-past six and seven o'clock, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I went to the door and saw men run by, I cannot say how many; I believe the first passed just as I opened the door, and a few yards from my door, I saw Parkins stopped, a scuffle ensued, and I collared him; he picked his hat up, which was off, he walked with me to the stable, where Collings lived, he and several others were there. About three or four minutes after, I saw Attfield, I believe him to be the man. Etherington brought him in, Parkins walked very quietly back with me to the stable, and then said, I had taken the wrong man.</p>

            ) What do you know of this Fact?</p>
               <p>Dowland. I lodg'd in the Prisoner's House, up one Pair of Stairs, and I heard her beat the Child several Times, but never saw her beat her but once. I heard the Child cry, and heard the Blows, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lodge?</p>
               <p>Dowland. I lodge in the fore Room, up one Pair of Stairs.</p>

               <p>Dowland. In her back Stairs below.</p>
               <p>Court . You say you heard the Child cry several Times, and heard the Blows, but you once saw her beat her.</p>

               <p>Q. When was the first Time, and when was the last Time you heard her beat the Child so, that it cry'd?</p>
               <p>Dowland. I heard the Child cry on Friday last.</p>

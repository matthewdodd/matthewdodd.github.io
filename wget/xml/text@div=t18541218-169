                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 56). On 10th Dec., about 3 o'clock in the morning, I was in Bishopsgate-street at a fire, and in consequence of information, I went to Sun-street, and saw the outer door of the prose<lb></lb>cutrix's house open—I went in with another officer, and found this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) tied up in the shop, containing the articles stated; it was behind the counter on the ground—it was then a little after 3 o'clock—I searched the house, and found nobody but the family; they were up—I went to No. 19 in the same street, and found the prisoner in a water closet in the back yard—I said, "What do you do here?"—he said, "I came to have a rest, I have no home"—I searched him, and found some matches in his waistcoat pocket—I then went back to the shop, and found some pieces of matches inside the counter—by getting out at the garret window of No. 21, you can go along the parapet, and get in at the garret window of No. 19.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 21, Sun-street—I closed my shop on the night in question at about half-past 12 o'clock—my property was then all right in boxes and on shelves—I found it removed from its proper place, and in a bundle behind the counter—I looked over the fastenings the last thing, and they were all safe—about 3 o'clock in the morning a policeman came; I went down directly, and found my door on the first floor open; it was shut when I went to bed—the four bolts, and the chain on the inside of the street door, were all undone when I came down; they were safe the night before—they must have been opened from the inside—a person could get into my house from No. 19, by going over the roofs, and getting in at the attic window—my house is in the parish of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate.</p>

About 3 o'clock I heard a policeman knocking, and went down to my mistress's room; as I was going down two men pissed me, they were going up stairs, towards the attic—I went into my mistress's room and gave an alarm from the window—the neighbours came, and said that the men were on the roof—I went up stairs, and found the window open in the back attic, where I sleep—it had been shut before.</p>

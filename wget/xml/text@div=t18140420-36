In consequence of information, I watched her; I had been informed that something wrong was going on at my house every evening. On the 15th of March, the man was brought in by the officers, with some meat, veal, beef, and mutton, both dressed and undressed, a bottle of cream, and three large cakes that were not cut or broken, and a bason. Upon my hearing the bell of the door ring, I went to the door. The woman was talking to the other prisoner. I took hold of the man by the collar at the door. The man threw himself off the steps; he got away. The woman said, sir, it was hard that she could not speak to her friend; he was a shoemaker; he had brought her a pair of shoes. It was no such thing; she had brought up the shoes from the kitchen herself, with a bag of meat and bread. Then the constable brought in the man prisoner with the bag. I had not the least doubt what was in the bag was my property.</p>
               <p>The man who was brought back was the man whom you had seized before - A. Yes. Some of the meat was dressed, and some undressed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you go in the kitchen to see what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200019"></xptr>there is in the house - A. No, but I know what is in the house. I hired the cook myself; she was to have eighteen guineas a-year. and none of the dripping without letting her mistress see it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 15th of March, I was watching the prosecutor's house in company with Baruard Gleed I observed Mr. Echalaz's door open; I saw the cook. The woman prisoner gave a bundle to the man prisoner; at that time I did not know what the bundle contained. I heard Mr. Echalaz speak something; the cook said, sir, surely I may give him my slippers. The man immediately ran away. I pursued the man prisoner; he threw what he had in his hand over some railing into Clapton Common. I took him. He had a green bag, which Gleed took. I took him back to Mr. Echalaz's house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him, did you go and take up the bag - A. I did; I picked up that which he had throwed away; it contained mutton, beef, and veal; it was wrapped up in this handkerchief, and tied up; and this bottle of milk. The bottle was not broken. It was a wine quart bottle, with cream in it. I went back to the prosecutor's house. I asked the man how he came by that property; he said it was given him by the cook. The cook said nothing to it; he said it in her presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. It was a common wine bottle I suppose - A. Yes; they are all alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the meat here - A. No, it would not keep.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that this poor man is a shoemaker in that neighbourhood - A. He is, I believe.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, I worked under Mr. Gover, in the building of this house for Mr. Eades.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of March how many deals were taken away - A. Forty-seven boards after they were prepared for flooring, and several trimmers, joists, and riders for steps, and two newells, they were taken to a house that Mr. Gover was building in Green Man's-lane, Islington. They were taken by me, my partner. Mr. Gover, and his son. He shewed me a paper that Mr. Eades was debtor to him, and I fully believed that he might take them. We used these boards in Mr. Gover's house of an evening or morning. There are four floors that I laid there, I told Mr. Eades of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you able to say of your own knowledge how many boards could be produced from the largest deal you have seen in the market - how many of these boards that you conveyed from Eades's house to Gover's could have been made out of one piece of deal - A. Five boards; thirty-five of such as I conveyed away could have been manufactured from seven deals.</p>

            . I worked at this house of Mr. Eades. In the month of March I carried seven boards from Mr. Eades house to Mr. Gover's.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to prosecutor. Did you see these forty-seven boards at Gover's house - A. Yes, Fish pointed them out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they have been manufactured from seven deals - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These seven deals you allowed him in accompt - A. My surveyor did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I wish the court to see the accompt. Mr. Eades was very poor, he got fresh credit over the water on Bank side; I said, Mr. Eades, let me have seven of them deals, I want them. I had the deals on the 2nd of February they were acccompted for; I supplied Mr. Eades with hinges, glue, and every thing that was wanting in the building line; he now swears nothing but nails. Fish is a bad character. When the work was measured I had one surveyor, and Mr. Eades another. I then said there is a few odds and ends of stuff that I have to accompt; I had asked him for them; he said take what you want.</p>

            . I am a Surveyor. I was appointed by Mr. Gover and Lovell by Mr. Eades to measure off the new work done by Eades; we measured the whole of the work, we agreed as to the measure, but not as to the price. After that Mr. Eades said I should like you to take account of the money Gover has had because he had no receipt; Mr. Eades called Gover and asked him what money he had; he said he gave him three pounds, that made one hundred and twenty pounds; I put it down; Eades said, now recollect you had two loads of bats, two guineas, and October 23d Gover had a small piece of timber of Mr. Eades, they agreed that the piece of timber should be eleven shillings; then said he there were seven twelve-feet three-inch deals, cut into half-inch stuff; Gover said, what do you charge for them. Mr. Eades said the deals cost me sixty pound a hundred; they agreed the deals should be with the cutting four pound.</p>

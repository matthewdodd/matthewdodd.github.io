               <p>Q. What Lodgings did you let her?</p>
               <p>Reddish. A Two-Pair of Stairs Room, backward, at two Shillings a Week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it furnished?</p>
               <p>Reddish. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you no Notice of going?</p>
               <p>Reddish. No, my Lord, she left my Lodgings the 25th of November, I had a Suspicion she had taken out my things before I took her up. I found a Pair of Blankets, a Pillow, a Pair of Sheets, and a Looking Glass, gone at the Time that I took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose Goods were all these?</p>
               <p>Reddish. Mine, my Lord. Last Monday I missed two Curtains, they were Cheeny.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when you took her?</p>
               <p>Reddish. When I went before the Justice, she said, if you will have Mercy on me, I will tell you of your things. I said, Mrs Lever you have used me barbarously before, for I have lost a great many things since you have come into my House.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her Husband?</p>
               <p>Reddish. Her Husband has been there, I think I have seen him, but I never saw him there but once.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him there?</p>
               <p>Reddish. I believe about three or four Months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say?</p>
               <p>Reddish. Here is a Paper she gave me as a Direction where she had pawned them; but after I was gone, she said I should not find them there; when I went to the Pawnbroker, he said he could not tell if there was any such things, she must come herself.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, will you ask her any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She lays more to my Charge than I am guilty of. Her Husband broke open the Door upon me - I never left her Lodgings.</p>

             and the Constable; and before the Justice, she (the Prisoner) confessed she had pawned the Blankets for 8 s. the Pillow for 1 s. and Looking-glass for 1 s. and the Pair of Sheets for 2 s. with that the Prisoner at the Bar said to Mr Reddish, you have Children of your own, take Compassion on me, and I'll tell you where the things are; if you will go to the Golden-Ball there you will find these things. I went with Mrs Reddish to that Pawnbroker, but could not find them; we came back again to the Prisoner to know why she had made such a Fool of her: she said they were pawned to another Woman, and she would not tell her without giving her a Discharge.</p>
               <p>Q. to Reddish. Were all these things in your Room?</p>
               <p>Reddish. Yes, my Lord; the same night the Prisoner was taken up, I was with her Husband, I told him the Prisoner at the Bar was about to be sent to Newgate; he said he was sorry for it.</p>

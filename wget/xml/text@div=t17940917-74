               <p>Q. Did you miss them before you heard any account of them at the pawnbrokers? - Yes; and on her being searched the duplicates were found in her apartment, and that they laid at the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to look to her? - Missing a considerable number of things and having had no other reason to suspect any other servant, we suspected her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard John Moscrop, of the Green Man public-house, in Covent Garden-market. The prisoner was our charwoman—on the 18th of April she had been employed, and about four o'clock that afternoon I saw her leave the house to go home—she appeared much stouter than usual—I said to her, "I think you have some things be<lb></lb>longing to me about you, I must see"—she said she had not—I took her into the bar, and I said, "I must see the contents of your pocket"—she then pro<lb></lb>duced some butter and cheese—I said that was not all—she then pulled out these two brass taps—I sent for Mr. Moore, and I saw some starch and a scarf taken from her—these taps are my husband's, and this scarf is my son's—he is eighteen years old—he lives with us, and his father supplies him with clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Lucy Eliza Mackey, at St. Leonard's. She had a house at No. 47, Baker-street, which the pri<lb></lb>soner's mother had charge of at different times—she gave up possession on the 8th of June, 1840—in consequence of another robbery which took place in Sept., 1841, we missed a variety of articles which had principally been kept in a cheffonier at the house in Baker-street—they were not dis<lb></lb>covered to be missing till Sept., 1841—we then missed the property now discovered—I recollect the cheffonier perfectly well—it had remained un<lb></lb>searched from June, 1840, till Sept., 1841—the house had been let part of the time, and another party had been put in charge of it—the cheffonier was in the drawing-room, locked up, and to the best of my belief the principal part of these things were safe in it when the prisoner's mother had charge of the house—this gold seal, set with diamonds and emeralds, is my mother's—this opera-glass this gold-mounted snuff-box, and ivory fan, are my mother's—this necklace, these two miniatures, and some other articles, are my own—all the articles which were in the cheffonier are now present, but some which were in the house are still missing—this minia<lb></lb>ture was missed in June, 1840, but I was not confident whether it had been taken out of town or not, till I went into the country, and not find<lb></lb>ing it there, I knew it was missing—I am sure it had been in the cheffonier—the property which was missed in 1841, was traced to some pawn<lb></lb>broker's, but that had nothing to do with this property or this party—I only knew the prisoner as the daughter of the woman who had charge of the house—I never noticed anything particular about her—I supposed in 1841, that these articles had gone the same way that the other things had.</p>

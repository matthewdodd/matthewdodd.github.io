                  </hi>. My husband keeps the George public-house in Edgeware—about 6 o'clock on 20th November, the prisoner came in for a glass of beer, and put down a shilling—I looked at it, and gave it to my husband—he said it was bad, and said to the prisoner, "I know you; you have been here before. I have not got rid of the last shilling you brought before"—the prisoner said he had not been to Edgeware before—my husband said he had, and he was given into custody with the shilling.</p>

What my wife has said is correct—I had seen the prisoner a week before—I served him with a glass of beer, and he gave me this shilling—it was just between the lights when he came in, and as soon as I lighted the gas, I saw it was bad—I had put it into the till where there was no other silver—I afterwards gave it to the policeman with the other.</p>

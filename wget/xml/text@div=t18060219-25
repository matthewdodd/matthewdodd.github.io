               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. For the copy of a register of a marriage there should be a five shilling stamp; I object to this being read.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they live at Stroud when they were married. - A. No, Mr. Hall lived at Frinsbury, the adjoining parish to Stroud; I cannot undertake to say how long they lived there after they were married, perhaps ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately did you see her. - A. I saw her the day after the date of that register; I saw her and shook hands with her the day after I took that copy of her register; I could not be mistaken in a person that was brought up as one of my own children.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. How far did you live from Mr. Hall. - A. About a mile and a half; he is a potter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I now stand here hardly sensible of the crime I have committed, inasmuch as I was assured by the father saying to me that his daughter had been dead prior to my marriage the second time for more than nine or ten months; it was a current report in the neighbourhood of Stroud; and that was not only announced so by the father himself to me, but also announced so to Mrs. Domily and myself that the fact was so and no otherwise. Had I not had the confirmation of her father of the death of the woman, who had absented herself a long while (I believe her father is in court to say it) I certainly should not have put myself in a situation equal to where I now stand. I certainly did it from a perfect innocence, not knowing I did wrong at the certain moment.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mr. Hall present. - A. He was; his name was announced to be Mr. Wiffin by some persons that were in the room with him and Mr. Hall; I told him I had heard several reports, I said to him is your daughter dead or alive; he assured me that she was dead, and died with the man that she run away with.</p>

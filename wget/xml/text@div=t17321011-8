            . As I was sitting with my Barrow of Oysters in Smithfield, the Prisoner came to me, and said, my Wife wanted me, and I must go. I told her, no Body should make me go to my Wife. Why, say she, I'll tell you what it's about; I have nail'd a Watch, and I shall make my self for ever, if I can find any Body that I can trust to dispose of it for me.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you think she meant by nailing?</p>
               <p>Peirce. I don't understand those Newgate Words.</p>

               <p>Keeper. Not I, my Lord, but I believe some of our People can. I'll ask. Here's one says it signifies stealing.*</p>
               <p>* Nailing, is likewise used metaphorically to signify, securing, taking-hold-of, or apprehending. e.g. Tom Beck says of John Davison, He told me himself that Peter Buck was nail'd out of his Company. Vide, Sessions Paper, Numb. 4. pag. 104.</p>

With all my Heart, says I, and so I did. Well, says he, since you are so civil, I'll make you drink; and so he took me to a Gin-shop, and gave me a Quartern of Brandy; then, says he, I don't much like this Liquor, but if you'll go somewhere else, I'll treat you with a Mug of Ale. And so I carried him to my Landlady's; there she stands. And there he gave me a Shilling to lye with me. I told him, I would not do it for a Shilling. Well, says he, I'll give you a Crown then; but as I have not so much about me, I'll leave you my Watch in Pledge till I bring you the Money, and so he did. Then I went to

On the 19th of Feb., at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the two prisoners at the foot of West<lb></lb>minster-bridge, loitering about, and following first one gentleman, and then another—they appeared to be aiming at picking pockets—I followed them with another officer to Charing-cross, where I saw Burke take a handker<lb></lb>chief from the prosecutor's pocket, and Walker was covering him—he stood at Burke's elbow while he put his right hand into the pocket—I gave notice to the prosecutor, and I took the prisoners—they both struggled—I let Walker go to detain Burke—I left him with another constable, and went after Walker—it was a dark handkerchief, with spots upon it—it happened near a light—I saw it distinctly—when I came back they had brought Burke some dis<lb></lb>tance, and there being a great number of people round, I could not find it—I am certain I saw it in his hand.</p>

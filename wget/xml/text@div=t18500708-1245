                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at 14, Rufford-buildings, Islington. On 3rd April, I saw a man named Ward, a butcher, in Exmouth-street—he asked me to go and take a glass of ale with him, and we went to the Bluecoat Boy—Lawler was there, having some brandy and water at the bar—he and Ward did not appear to know each other—Lawler said that butchering must be a good trade (I was in my butcher's coat), that he could not get a mutton chop under 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he saw by the papers that meat was very cheap—I, in a <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> way, said it must be a pretty good trade—in a short time Bailey came in—he appeared to be drunk—he said he had been waiting for his dear Mary for about two hours at the Angel, and she had disappointed him; that he had been to Sadler's Wells Theatre with her the night before, and bought her a new dress, which he gave six guineas for; that he had a relation died and left him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and he asked me what business he should go into—I said, "If you have got 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should advise you to keep it a little while and get a situation"—he said, "You are a good sort of a fellow; I will treat you to a glass of brandy and water"—I said, "Thank you, but I don't want any now"—Bailey did not appear to know Lawler at that time—Lawler asked Bailey whether he could play at <hi rend="italic">knock-em-downs</hi>—Bailey said, "I don't know what you mean; in my county we play at bowls on the green, with a wooden ball"—Lawler said, "If you can play at that, you can play at <hi rend="italic">knock-em-downs"</hi>—he said, "I don't know what you mean, but I have got plenty of money, and don't mind playing you for a bottle of wine"—I said, "You can't play here; there are no skittles here"—Lawler said, "Oh, I will take you to a place where you can play"—Bailey said, "Put your money down, and I will put a sovereign into the butcher's hands"—Lawler said, "I have but 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, but that is enough for a bottle of wine;" and he put 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my hands—I said, "Where are you going?"—Lawler said, "You follow me; I will take him down to the John Bull"—the prisoners walked arm-in-arm, and I went with Ward to the John Bull, in Brewer-street—we went into the skittle-ground—Lawler and Bailey commenced playing, and Bailey lost—Lawler knocked them all down at one time, and Bailey went about seven or eight times; he threw the ball as though he could not throw it at all—the wine was brought and paid for, and drunk—they then commenced playing for a sovereign, and Bailey kept losing—I said to him, "You had better not play; you will lose all your money"—he said, "Oh, I don't mind losing a hundred or two; I have got plenty of money"—every game he played he lost—the money was handed over as it was lost—a knock came to the door, and another party was let in—Lawler said to him, "This is private; you can't come in here"—he said, "Yes, I can come in here for a minute; you don't mind me," and he let him in—that person went by the name of Johnson then, but he gave me a different name afterwards—Bailey still kept playing, and Johnson betted, and Bailey lost all the time—Johnson betted with Bailey and Bailey paid him—Lawler said to me, "Why don't you have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is a shame that this man (referring to Johnson) should come in and win his money"—I said I did not want his money; I should not bet—he said, "You may as well have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he is sure to lose it all"—I then betted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then Bailey went in and won—he was then playing with Lawler—I betted that Bailey would not get them down in five times—he had got them down in about eight or nine times before, and then he got them down in five times—I paid that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Bailey—I then had the same bet with him again, and lost another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he got them down in four times—he then said, "I will bet you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185007080015"></xptr>
               <p>you can't get them down in nine times"—I said, "No, I can't bet you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for I have not got any money in my pocket"—Lawler and Johnson the came to me and said, "Oh, you can go and get 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it will not be much trouble for you"—I said, "No, I can't; it would not do for me to go home"—they said, "Have you not got anybody in the neighbourhood that would lend you the money?"—Johnson said, "If it was not so late I would go down to my brother, who is a merchant in the city, and he would lend me the money in a minute"—I said, "There was a party in the neighbourhood, if he was at home, that would lend me the money;" and I went with Johnson to Mr. Thorp's, in St. John-street-road—that was about four o'clock in the afternoon—I got 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Thorp, and came back with Johnson to the John Bull—before I went for the money Bailey wanted me to put 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down for a deposit—I said I had but 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I had 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I left home, and I had lost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Johnson said, "Well, I have got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will lend you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I put into Ward's hands, and then I went and borrowed the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which made it 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on our return Bailey said, "Oh, it was for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that we made this bet, and unless you stick to the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or put down 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will not bet"—I said, "Why, you know I have been out to borrow this money, and I have not got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., therefore I cannot stake it; and Ward immediately came up, and gave Bailey his 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Johnson 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the deposit—Bailey then said, "I will play you for 20<hi rend="italic">l."</hi>—I agreed—Lawler and Johnson put up the pins—a party wanted to come into the ground to put them up, but Lawler would not allow him to come in—I said I wished some one else to come in, but Lawler said, "I will put them up for you," and he did—I went first, and got them down in four times; Bailey got them down in three times—I paid him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lawler said he thought Bailey was getting stronger, and he said I was <hi rend="italic">funking;</hi> but he said, "You are sure to beat him next time; go on again"—I went on again for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the result was the same as before—I think I went five times; Bailey went less than I did—I paid that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lawler said, "The landlord thinks we are playing for money, and we must go from here"—I said, "I have lost my money"—he said, "Come along with me, and I will take you to a place where you are sure to win it back again"—I had been drinking at this time—I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Sportsman—Ward, a man whose name I now believe to be Powell; Lawler, Bailey, and Johnson, also went—we had six glasses of brandy and water there, and some cigars—we did not go into the skittle-ground there—we then went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Duke of Bridgwater, near the Haggerstone gas-works—just before we got there Lawler ordered the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to stop, and said he would go and see whether the ground was all clear—he went, and came back and said it was all right—we went into the skittle-ground there, and Bailey and I played—I knocked them down in five times and Bailey in less—I lost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and paid it—I then said I had lost all my money and had not got any more—Bailey said, "Oh, you are a respectable man; you can give me an I O U, or something of that, for anything you like, or a check on your banker"—I said, "No, I "can't do that"—he said, "Oh, I will go and fetch a pen and ink"—he did so, and a piece of paper, and I wrote "Pay to Mr. Stephens;" Bailey went by that name—it was for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I signed it in the name of "William Brand"—Lawler said, "We know that is not your name; you are a respectable man, and we can make you pay another day; we can prove that you wrote it"—Ward said, "Don't, Tom, give them a check," and I said, "I am not such a fool as to sign my own name to anything of the sort"—we played, and I lost—I was then stupid drunk—Bailey kept up the appearance of being intoxi<lb></lb>cated all the time—I put the paper into Powell's hands before that, and when</p>

               <p>I lost he handed it over to Bailey—Bailey then pulled out his watch, and said it was past seven o'clock, and he had got an appointment to meet his dear Mary, and he could not disappoint a lady, and he must be off—Lawler said, "Oh, don't go yet; have another game"—he said, "Well, I will have another game, but I must go outside to make water"—he went out but did not return—I went out, and found he was gone out of the house, and I saw him running down the street—Lawler laid hold of my arm, and said, "Don't you run after him; I can run faster than you; I will fetch him back;" and he prevented me from running, and then he got out of sight—he said, "I will take care you shall have your money back again"—I said they were all a set of sharpers together—Lawler said, "You must mind what you are saying, I am as respectable a man as you are; and if you say so again I will bring an action against you to-morrow for defamation of character"—I asked him his name—he said, "My name is Dixon; I live at 16, York-place, City-road"—I afterwards went there, and could find no such number or any such person—Johnson said his name was John Weston, of 48, Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square—there is no such number, nor any such person living there—I became rather stupified afterwards—this occupied altogether from three o'clock till about seven—I cannot tell exactly how much I had drunk—I had part of the bottle of wine at the John Bull, some brandy and water at the Sportsman, and we had some more brandy and water at the Duke of Biridg<lb></lb>water—I had not drunk any very great deal.</p>

I am a boot-maker, and live at 5, Tavistock-court—I know Lawler—on Wednesday, 3rd April, I went to his mother's house about three o'clock, and staid there till eight—after tea he went and laid down till about eight, and then he came and had a little supper—I have been ten weeks in the hospital—I went in on 1st May, but I was ill three weeks before that.</p>

I know Bailey—I saw him on 3rd April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, at a beer-shop in Old-street—I remained with him about different parts of Bethnal-green, and left him about twenty minutes or a quarter to six, in Whitechapel-road—he left me about two, for twenty minutes, at the Rose, close by the Cemetery at Bethnal-green, and then returned, and we had some dinner—I recollect it was 3rd April, because it was Stepney Fair-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 10, Middle Grove-street, Commercial-road. I know Bailey, by having had the pleasure of being about half a dozen times in his company—I saw him on Wednesday, 3rd April, and was in his company all that day—about half-past ten o'clock on Monday morning I met him at the Fox, in Old-street-road, kept by Mr. Johnson—he was having a pint of ale there, along with two more gentlemen, when I went in—we got into conversation, and he asked me what I would make him a pair of black trowsers and a waistcoat for—I told him—he said, "Well, we may as well take a walk, being such a nice morning," and we went to the Victoria Cemetry, Bethnal-green, as he said he had a relation buried there, and he wished to see a tombstone which was erected—we got there about twelve o'clock—it was on Easter Wednesday, 3rd April—there were two gentlemen with us; Darrah was one—after we walked round the cemetry we went into the Rose and dined, about half-past one—we remained there till three, and then went through Stepney fair, and then into Whitechapel-road, where I parted with him, about twenty minutes past five—he was never out of my company, from half-past ten till three—we were not near the Blue-coat Boy in the City-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I know Bailey very well by sight—I was with him when Collins took him on Sunday evening—I cannot exactly say what he took him for, and did not hear exactly what Bailey said—he said he was innocent, and was astonished that he was taken—I do not believe he said, "I know all about Mr. Bland's business; it is a gambling transaction"—he did not take out any money and offer it to the policeman—he said nothing about giving him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not hear him say "I shall gamble as long as I live."</p>

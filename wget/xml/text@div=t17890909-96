               <p>Did you sleep in any bed with either of these men before? - No, Sir, I never slept in a bed with them of a night, only when they served me so; both these men slept together on the Sunday night, the first night I went there; and I slept in a room by myself; on the Friday night, one of them was gone out, and one was at home; but I slept in one of the beds by myself; there were three rooms up stairs; I slept in one of them every night; the rooms had all beds in them; but there was another boy there; and the boy ran away; one man slept at Mr. Ballard's every night, while the women were there that went away; then there was a married woman and some children; and they used to lay there; and Studbury's sister and me used to lay together; she did not stay in the house long; I believe she staid till the Monday; I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>They, each of them, carried you up stairs to bed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Under which arm? - I cannot tell which arm.</p>
               <p>A good wide large stair-case? - It is not such a very wide one.</p>
               <p>How many people could go up at a time? - It is a good long pair of stairs, and narrowish; Burton took me up in the same way.</p>
               <p>How long was this after Burton had broke his collar bone? - He had his arm out of his sling, when he first served me so; his arm was undone before then; I cannot tell how long; I cannot tell whether one day or two; nor which arm it was.</p>
               <p>Has it ever happened to you, to be ravished by any body but these two men? - No, Sir; I never was laid with by any body but them; I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was not one o'clock? - I am not sure; it was before dinner; that I am positive of.</p>
               <p>And you always said it was before dinner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time used you generally to dine? - I did not dine that day; I had no victuals; it was before two o'clock; I generally dined at two.</p>

               <p>Recollect a little; sure you can recollect. Now I will help your memory a little; first of all, you know Studsbury lay with you on the Thursday; on the Friday you told Mrs. Jarvis; on the Saturday, Burton lay with you; and on the Saturday night, they put you to bed to a lousy boy; and on Sunday, you ran away, and on Monday, you told your aunt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long after you slept at Mrs. Holmes's, was it that you went to the justice? - I staid at my aunt's till the next Thursday; I believe it was above a week after I got to the work-house, before I went to the justice of peace.</p>
               <p>Did you never say this happened between the 8th and 15th of August? - No, Sir; only I said it happened on Thursday; I did not know what day of the month myself; my aunt told the overseers, and they took me to the justice.</p>
               <p>Have you any complaint on you now? - Yes; I have a great deal of complaint.</p>
               <p>You have the foul disease? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You got it then from one of these two people? - Yes.</p>

               <p>When was the boy turned away? - On the Sunday night; that was the lousy boy; the other boy would not stay; he went away of himself; not on the same Sunday.</p>
               <p>What was the lousy boy turned away for? - They said he drank the gin; he only gave me a little drop; there were two men came by, and he gave them two glasses apiece; I had two-pence of my own; and the lousy boy persuaded me to fetch a pint of strong beer; he was turned away, because my master had been jawing him; he said he was quite drunk; and he asked me what was the matter; and the boy had been cutting me with a horsewhip, because I would not fetch a pint of beer; and I told him; I was not drunk, but they said I was drunk; just after, I ran away; and about the same time, the lousy boy was turned away; I was not turned away.</p>
               <p>Do you remember, that before he was turned away, Burton carried the lousy boy, or Johnson, into his room, and asked Johnson how his bed came to be so beastly dirty? - I did not see him take him up; I know nothing of it; Burton asked me how came the sheets so dirty; that was on Sunday, after dinner; just before I ran away; I said, I did not know, for I had not been up stairs; no more I had.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were there any marks on your linen on the Friday? - No; my linen was not bad, but I could hardly walk; the midwife said I must take a dose of salts, and I should find some disorder come from me.</p>
               <p>Then, all the complaint you had before you left their house, was, that you could not walk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was so on the Friday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then, when Burton laid with you on the Saturday, he must hurt you sadly? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>What sort of dirt was it that Burton complained of? - I do not know; I did not go up to see.</p>
               <p>Did not the boy say that you had asked him to go up stairs and lay with you; and that you had done so several times? - He said so when Burton came to ask him the last time.</p>
               <p>Did he charge the lousy boy with it? - Yes; there was but one boy there; that was the lousy boy.</p>
               <p>Then, he asked the lousy boy how it happened? - Yes; and then the boy brought a mane comb, and said I called him up stirs, but I did not.</p>
               <p>What else did he say that you did together, when you got into the bed room? - Sir, he said he had done impudence to me.</p>
               <p>What impudence did he say he did to you? - Sir, he said I was looking the fleas; and he locked the door, and threw me down; I was looking the fleas, and the boy took and threw me down, and got upon me; and clapped his hand on my mouth; and that is the truth; he did all this on the Sunday.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090114"></xptr>Let me see, you was ravished on the Thursday by Studsbury; again on the Saturday by Burton; and then by the boy, on the Sunday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why, the first question I asked you, was whether you ever was ravished but by them? - I said, that nobody had laid with me before this.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are satisfied.</p>

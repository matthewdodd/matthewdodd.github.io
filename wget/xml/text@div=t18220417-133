He took them out, and put in two pins, and said</p>
               <p>"I'll do this, and if he comes back, I will lay him a pot of beer that there is not two needles in it." The prisoner returned, and accused me of picking up the pin case. I said the other man had picked it up; then the other man returned it to him. He shook it, and wanted to lay me 5 s. that there were two needles in it. I said No; there was two pins. The other man then asked what time it was. I pulled out my watch, and he wanted me to lay him the 5 s. I said I had not got 5 s.; and put the watch into the man's hand, holding the seals in my own. The man put the pin case into his pocket, and pulled out another with two needles in it. Then the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I'll have the watch," and took it and ran off with it. I followed crying, Stop thief! and he was stopped with it in Whitechapel, half a mile off. The other man got off.</p>

               <p>"Then" said I,</p>
               <p>"The watch shall be for the 5 s." I can swear he changed the cases, for one was larger than the other.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Jones's-rents. I was in the Minories, and saw Kimber driving his cart, and a man with him; then up came the prisoner; they talked together. I saw the watch in the hands of Kimber, and the other man; the prisoner made a snatch at it, and away he ran; the other man ran the other way. I minded the cart while Kimber pursued. I know that the spot is the city.</p>

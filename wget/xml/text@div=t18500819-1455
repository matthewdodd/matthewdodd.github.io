The deceased, Elizabeth Coleman, was my step-daughter, and lived with me—she was thirteen years of age—her health had been perfectly good up to Saturday, 29th June—she never complained to me of her head, or her ear—she left home about half-past eight o'clock that even<lb></lb>ing—she was then in good health—I saw her again on 3rd July, at Mrs. Beckett's, 2, Hopkins-street, in bed—her eye was then black, and she had a swelling on the left side of her face—the surgeon came about a quarter of an hour after—I left shortly after—I attended her after that at the workhouse for three nights, and stopped up with her till she died—she died in the work-house.</p>

I knew the deceased—on Saturday, 29th June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at my door, and saw a crowd—I went up, and saw the deceased and Margaret Robinson entangled with one another, and pulling one another's hair, fighting—I saw Robinson lay hold of her by the hair of her head, and knock her violently against the wall—the little thing then tried to bite her in the knee, and Robinson, to save herself from the bite, took hold of her, and knocked her down on the ground, and while she was on the ground kicked her over the left ear—she had a great thick boot on—I said to her, "What a shame to beat a poor little thing like that"—she made no reply, but laid hold of her by the hair, and dragged her along into the kennel—there was such a mob came round then, that she went away, and the deceased got away from the crowd, and went over to the step of Mr. Rice's door, crying bitterly—I did not see the other prisoner at that time—she came up between five and ten minutes afterwards, and asked the deceased would she give up the ticket of her sister's gown, and she would not beat her—the deceased stoutly denied having the ticket—Coleman then laid hold of her by the hair of her head, and punched her, with her clenched fist, in the eye, which swelled her eye very much indeed; and after that she struck her a violent blow in the nose, which bled—the deceased then came and sat on the step of my door—I gave her some bread and meat, but she would not eat it—she asked me to feel the side of her head, which I did, and felt a very great lump over her left ear—she stopped a good bit at my house—she complained of violent pain in her head, over her left ear—I believe she slept that night on my stairs—she told me so next morning—I gave her some tea and bread next morning, but she did not eat it—salve still complained—I saw her on the Monday, and she com<lb></lb>plained of violent pain in her head from the beating her sisters had given her—she was then sitting up in Mrs. Beckett's room—she came to my house about twelve, for a piece of flannel, which she put round her head by the side of her ear—she was still complaining of her head—she remained at Mrs. Beckett's some time, and on the Wednesday I helped to take her to the work-house—I cannot say whether the prisoners were sober, I believe they were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in Marlborough-street, West-minster. On 4th July I was called to see the deceased, at 2, Hopkins-street—she was lying on a bed in the parlour—she complained of severe headache, more particularly of the left side—I had her removed to the infirmary at the workhouse, and attended her there until the 21st, when she died—I first of all found a discharge from the ear, subsequently an abscess under the temporal muscle, on the left side of the head, and finally she died in a state of coma—I could not positively say how long previous the injury causing the swelling had been inflicted; it might probably have arisen from violence sustained a few days previously, but it was not necessarily the result of violence at all, from anything that appeared—I mean a person may have an abscess under the temporal muscle arising from other causes than violence, from internal causes possibly—it might possibly arise from constitutional causes, but it is not very probable—the pain never left the side of the head and ear until she became insensible—I made a post-mortem examination on the 22nd—I first examined the abscess under the temporal muscle—that had been emptied; I had cut it before she died, but there was a considerable sac, which had held a large quantity of pus—I also found an abscess in the middle of the brain, which contained about four ounces of pus—that was close to the abscess under the temporal muscle—the abscess on the brain was clearly the cause of death—that might have been caused by external violence—it need not necessarily have been of recent date; but the only opinion I formed of that circumstance was from the account that was given at the inquest—if she had had disease of the ear for two or three years I should have formed a different opinion—it is quite possible that a kick or a blow given three or four days before I first saw her might have caused the abscess—the other organs of the body were all perfectly healthy—there was nothing to account for death but the abscess on the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Viewing her as you first saw her, there was nothing to indicate that the abscess was the result of violence more than of constitu<lb></lb>tional or other causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was not—there was no ecchymosis, nor any abrasions of the skin—an ill-cared-for girl, living on bad food, and sleep<lb></lb>ing out at night, would be liable to disease of the ear, or anything of that kind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far was the abscess under the temporal muscle from that on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bone only intervened, the <hi rend="italic">periosteum</hi> was denuded on both sides, destroyed by disease—my impression was that the two abscesses were connected, that the one depended on the other—I think it quite possible that a degree of violence might have been inflicted on the brain itself, so as to destroy some portion of the bone, and then the part so destroyed might have become the nucleus of an abscess; and in that case, the part exterior to the bone might also become the seat of an abscess—this is mere matter of opinion—on the other hand, it is quite possible that it might be produced by a long-standing disease of the ear—assuming that the girl was well on the morning of the day she received the blows, then I can form no other opinion than that all this mischief depended on the same cause, namely the violence then inflicted—blows of considerable violence do sometimes produce the evils which in this case arose—they commonly leave some external mark to show where they have been inflicted, but not always—some of the most severe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190077"></xptr>
               <p>contusions are not attended with exterior marks—I never knew, in my own experience, of a kick being given without leaving marks, but I know it as a matter of medical history—if the head was knocked against a wall, I should expect that abrasion would be produced, but I know that sometimes bones are broken without the skin being either abrased or ecchymosed—if the girl had received a kick in the head a few days before I saw her, it is quite possible that that might account for the mischief I saw.</p>

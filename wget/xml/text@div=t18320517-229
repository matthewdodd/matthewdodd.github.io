The prisoner came there on the 16th of May, for one ounce of salts, and 2d. worth of assafoetida; I served him and he went away; I went up into the drawing-room; I then saw him come twice to the door and go away - he came a third time and then knocked; I went to him; he said he wanted double the quantity of each article; I said I could serve him with the salts, but I did not know where the other was - while I was doing that he said I must write a direction for him; there then came a knock at the door; he asked if he should answer; I said if he pleased; he went, and I heard him say No; he came in and said it was a young man who wanted to know if any cabinet-maker lived there; my husband then came in, and said the other young man had taken his coat from the hall - I said, "Take this one into custody," but the prisoner got out; I did not miss anything then, but the officer brought him back in about ten minutes, with this spoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. When had you seen this spoon? A. Not two minutes before, in the parlour cupboard; he went looking round while I was serving him.</p>

             (Police-constable B 153). I saw the prisoner running about a quarter of a mile from the house; I suspected all was not right - I took him; he took out his handkerchief, and I saw him clasping something in his hand; I asked what it was, he said "What is that to you?" I found this salt spoon in his hand broken.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

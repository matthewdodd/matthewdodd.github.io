               <p>I have known Underwood two years; she lives in the same neighbourhood; she walks the streets; I know nothing of the other, only I have seen her go backwards and forwards.

               <p>In what manner did they throw you down? - They pulled me down backwards both together; I saw no body but them; I am sure the prisoners are the two women. I was stunned with the fall; I did not know what way they took.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I had an information that two women had committed a robbery; the prosecutor said, one was Underwood, and the other Cut-throat Sall; and he believed they were at a public-house.</p>
               <p>Did she go by the name of Cut-throat Sall before? - Yes, I did not know her other name; I found her sitting with two or three men at the Bull in Whitechapel; he said that was the woman; I asked her what she had done with the man's watch; she said, she had no watch; I searched her; I felt something under her left breast, I said, I thought it was the watch; she said it was only a bit of rag; I put my hand into her bosom and took out the watch; about an hour after that, I heard that Underwood was in Bell-yard, Wentworth-street; I went and took her. The prosecutor described the watch before he saw it.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>The prosecutor offered to make it up for five shillings before the justice.</p>
               <p>Levy. They wanted him to make it up before the justice but he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did you then, or at any other time, offer to make it up? - No, I did not; she said before the justice if I would make it up, she would give me five shillings, I said I would not, she should have the regulation of the law.</p>

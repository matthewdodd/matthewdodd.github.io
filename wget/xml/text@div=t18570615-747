On 4th May, about 12 o'clock, I was sitting in the Earl of Moira public house, and the prisoner and three other artillerymen came in; the prisoner called for half a pint of gin, and another for half a pint of rum—they handed it round for any one who chose to take part of it—they all four made the appearance of going towards the bar to pay for it, but I cannot say who did pay—when they came back, the prisoner took out of his waistcoat pocket some silver and gold together—I saw three sovereigns, with shillings between them—he held them between his fingers, and he told me that that lot was to be spent to-night—they wanted some more to drink, and the landlady would not serve them, as one of them was very drunk—the prisoner and the others were not so bad—they then all went away—I do not think he had any silver coin larger than shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in a booth, in a fair at Barking, about 10 o'clock at night, on 23rd Oct. I had a handkerchief, a pair of gloves, and a tobacco-box in my great-coat pocket, on my right hand side—that pocket opens very much when I sit down—I lost them there, those are them—this handkerchief has no mark, but I can swear to it, and the gloves also—I had a box like this—I had not given these things to any one, nor did I speak to any one.</p>

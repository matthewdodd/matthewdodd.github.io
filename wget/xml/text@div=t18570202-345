                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich. On 19th Jan., I was with a comrade, in Brook-street, about 12 o'clock; we were proceeding to the Thames-tunnel, for the purpose of going to Wool<lb></lb>wich, when we were attacked by the prisoner, and ten or twelve others—the prisoner seized a Crimean medal from my breast—I seized him by the hand<lb></lb>kerchief,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020138"></xptr>
               <p>and held him—a struggle ensued, and we both fell to the ground, I under him—he struck me several blows in the face, his comrades gathered round and kicked me several times in the ribs, trying to rescue him, but I held him—I saw him pass the medal to a man, and that man passed it to a woman, and I saw no more of it—I still kept hold of the prisoner by the handkerchief, but as I had no use of my arms he kept beating me as he liked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bombardier in the Artillery. I was with Costello when he was attacked—I saw the prisoner snatch the medal from his breast, and pass it into the crowd; I could not say whether it was to a man or a woman, I saw some one take it from him—he then took hold of Costello by the handkerchief, threw him to the ground, and hit him several times in the face—several of his comrades kicked him, and I was knocked down and kicked.</p>

On 9th Jan., I heard cries in Brook-street, about half past 12 o'clock; I went to the spot, and saw Ray—he said it was not him that required assistance, it was his comrade on the ground—I saw the prisoner on the top of Costello, beating him in the breast with his hands, as Costello had hold of the prisoner's handkerchief—I laid hold of the prisoner's right hand, he threw himself back, sprang on his feet, and threw me down, and I was kicked three or four times in my right side, and once by the prisoner on my left side—I took him into custody.</p>

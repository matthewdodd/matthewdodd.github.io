            . I am a journeyman painter. On the 1st of January I was at work at Mr. Carter's, which is next door to the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner come out of his house, about twenty minutes after one o'clock, with a great-coat on his back - he was wearing it. I ran to the prosecutor's door, pushed it open, and gave the alarm, but nobody was in the house - the door was just put to. The lock was still locked, though the door was open. I pursued and collared the prisoner. He said,</p>
               <p>"Don't collar me - take the great-coat, and I will give you my quills to let me go." (He had a bundle of quills with him). I had not seen him before he went into the house. I took him back to the shop with the great-coat on his back. There was nobody in the house. He took the coat off, and put it on the counter. Lawrence came in, and I sent him for his master - he fetched him. The coat was given to the beadle with the prisoner.</p>

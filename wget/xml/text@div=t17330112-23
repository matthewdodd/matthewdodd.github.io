About 6 on Friday Night, I made my Doors fast, and went to an Alehouse over the way to Supper; for I am a single Man. About 9 I was told that my House was broke, I went home and found both my back Door and fore Door open, and that I had been robb'd. I was a new Comer, my House was not quite fitted up, nor made so secure as it might be; my back Door was fastened with a wooden Pin that went into a Hole in the Wainscot; my fore Door had a Lock, but between the Lock and the Staple there was a hollow place through which the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120009"></xptr> Lock might be push'd back. Behind my House was a Yard, with a dead Wall 8 Foot high. The hole in the Wainscot where the Pin of the back Door went in was burst, so that I suppose the Entry was made that way.</p>

            . Now, says I, to Mr. Kemp, you may go down and take him; so I went down to Banks, and he ask'd me, if I had deliver'd the Goods as he order'd me? I told him, Yes; for being a naked Woman, I was afraid of some Mischief if I said otherwise, while he and I were alone in the Street. So then we went into a Brandy-Shop that was just by, and presently Mr. Kemp came in, and the Prisoner was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am father in law to Mr. John Locke, a boot maker, of High Street, Woolwich, I assist in the shop. On 27th July last two artillery men were opposite the shop, the prisoner is one of them—he ran over to the shop, went into a recess before the door, pulled down a pair of boots and ran out—I followed him, and cried "Stop thief!" a man named Hole stopped him, and I sent for a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 178). I took the prisoner—his breath did not smell of drink—he appeared perfectly sober as now—he kept the boots in his possession—I asked him how he came by them, he said that he had bought them; I asked him where, he said that that was his business—the prosecutor said to him, "Give them up, and I will have nothing more to do with you;" but he would not—I had the opportunity of seeing him previously—he was walking about the streets all night, he and two more—he had no money when I searched him—the prosecutor would have let him go if he would have given up the boots.</p>

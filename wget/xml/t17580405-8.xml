            . My husband is a soldier, so is the prisoner, I was going on Monday was 7-night to carry his supper in the Tower. I saw the prisoner; he said he wanted me to carry out a sheet to sell or pawn; it was wet, and he desired me to dry it, and gave it me (this is it here produced.) I took it to my own room, I live in Blue-anchor-yard. I went to the Tower next morning to inquire if any body had lost a sheet, and after that to the serjeant-major, and told him of it, and said I should keep it till I heard of an owner for it. The serjeant-major found out the owner.</p>

             came to me, and told me that the prisoner had given her a sheet to sell or pawn, and she thought it not his own, so thought it her duty to acquaint me with it. I went to the prisoner, and told him I heard he had some linnen to sell, he denied it, then I said I could produce a sheet he had given a woman to pawn; then he acknowledged he had given it her to pawn. I asked him how he came by it. first he said his wife had brought it to the Tower to dry, being turned out of her lodgings. I sent a serjeant for his wife, and examined her before her husband's face; she declared she had not a sheet in the world, and had never seen it before then. I put him in prison, and by inquiring, found Mrs. Tanner had lost a sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Tanner. Had you seen the prisoner in your house?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tanner. I never did to my knowledge; my linnen was hanging up in the garret in my own house to dry, and it was very easy to get in at the window, which we have secured since.</p>

               <p>Going to do my exercise on Monday between ten and eleven o'clock, there was a dog that belongs to the drill corporal, that is apt to fetch and carry; somebody threw a stone behind a piece of timber in the tower, the dog ran after it, and made a barking, having something that he could not bring away, so I went to see what it was, and found a sheet lying there, which I took and put under my coat, and brought it away.</p>

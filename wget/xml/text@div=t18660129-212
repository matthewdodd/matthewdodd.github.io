                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of 64, City-road, just across the road at Tabernacle-row—Union-street is a little further down Tabernacle-row—Union-court is a turning out of Tabernacle-row—to get from my shop to Union-court you cross the road, and it is the first turning to the left—it is 120 or 130 yards from my ship to Union-court, which is not very wide—there is a dead wall on one side and eight houses on the other—there is no passage through—there is a lamp just when you turn up the court, and another near Tabernacle-row as you go in—on 18th December, at a quarter to 7, or a little after, I went into my shop, and saw the prisoner at the counter looking at some watches—MR. Riesle was serving him, and Mr. Kreutz stood more at the back of the shop, not behind the counter—I went round the counter, looked in the prisoner's face, and then told my friend, Mr. Kreutz, to come in-doors with me—we went into a back room—I remained there about a minute, when he said something which attracted my attention—I looked through the window between the back door and the shop, and walked out again, and came in front of the prisoner, who had a silver watch in his hand—before I spoke to him, he closed his hand and went to the door—I went round the counter and followed him, crying "Stop thief"—there was a good light in the shop, three, gas lights—they burn powerfully to enable me to examine things—he pulled the door open, and I ran after him across the road, down Tabernacle-row, and I saw him go into Union-place, quite by himself—I am sure that was the same person who</p>

               <p>went out of my shop—I was twelve or fifteen yards from aim, I cannot say exactly—there was plenty of light to enable me to see—I did not run after him directly, because the top of the court is rather dark, I stopped and told my young man, who was behind me, to stop at the bottom to watch, and I would see if I could find him—the door of No. 8, the last house, was open, and a boy, seventeen or eighteen years old, stood at the door with a candle—I asked him if somebody had gone in there—he said "Yes," and I went right through the passage to the water-closet, which is on the ground-floor, on a level with the yard, and found the prisoner sitting on the water-closet, with one hand under him—I caught hold of him and said, "That is him."—he said, "I am not the man who took the watch"—he said this before I said anything about the watch—a neighbour of mine followed me, but I went first into the closet—I got the prisoner up from his sitting position, and his clothes was not disarranged, but his right hand, which was under him, was covered with soil, and there was a little dirt on it as well—he said, "You can search me"—I said, "No, I will wait for a constable"—he gave no reason for being there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Rector of Whitechapel—I was once clergy<lb></lb>man to Holloway goal—on this evening, as near as possible to half-past six, my servant brought me a stick—I do not say that from guess, but circum<lb></lb>stances occurred in the house which enable me to fix the time with some precision—it is simply because we were delayed at tea—I have known the prisoner five years, ever since I have been Rector of Whitechapel—he belongs to my congregation and to a class which I used to conduct—I know him and his parents well—he has borne the character of a well-conducted, honest, moral lad during the whole of that period—I should think it is a full mile from my house to the City-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Union-court, Tabernacle-row—I am a house-decorator and I follow the shoe line when I have nothing to do—on the night the prisoner was taken I was talking to my landlady, in my shirt sleeves, in her room—the street door was open and the back door—I was all in the dark—the prisoner came to me and said, "Would you let me go through, I am taken rather short," pointing with his hands to his stomach—I let him through—I went into the landlady's room again, leaving the street door open, and a second afterwards a gentleman came and asked me if I had let a young man through—I said, "Yes, to the water-closet," and he went through—the prisoner had not passed more than a second, not a moment, I had hardly time to get into the kitchen again—I had shown the prisoner to the yard door and went towards the kitchen again, and before I got there I heard the knock—I did not hear any calling out at the time I let him in—two or three gentlemen were standing at the door—the wall where the closet is, is, I should think, twelve feet high on one side, but on the side leading to the other yard it is only five or six feet—the alms-houses extend to the very end of Union-place—the five feet wall is the one that separates the yard from the next—our house is the last in the row—if a person got over the twelve feet wall he would get into the timber-yard—the wall immediately at the back is the same height, twelve feet—I did not let somebody else go through just before the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could any person get over the twelve feet wall without assist<lb></lb>ance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there is no entrance to the front of the Alms<lb></lb>houses from Tabernacle-row—from the entrance to Union-court to the front of the Alms-houses is only the depth of the houses, which are two rooms deep, fifteen, sixteen, or twenty feet—our house is on the City-road side.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person, instead of turning up the entrance of Union-court, had gone up to the entrance of the Alms-houses, where would he have got to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To Tabernacle-walk—he could then have escaped or gone anywhere—there are some railings at the end, but he could get over them—there is not a proper thoroughfare—the railings at the Tabernacle are six feet at the highest part, and four feet at the lowest.</p>

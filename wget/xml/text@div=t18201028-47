            . On Thursday last, about a quarter before seven o'clock at night, I was walking down Southampton-street towards the Strand; I made a momentary halt at the corner of <placeName id="t18201028-47-crimeloc277">Tavistock-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18201028-47-crimeloc277" type="placeName" value="Tavistock-street"></interp>

I am positive he is the man. As soon as it was disengaged, he made a side movement, and as I thought, gave it to another person - his hat fell off, and he immediately ran away leaving his hat upon the ground. I followed him closely behind, calling Stop thief! and caught him myself immediately, before he had run fifteen yards. At that instant Congdon came up also, and seized him - it was just opposite a chymist's shop - we took him in there. He had only run across the street, and was not out of my sight. The watch was not found. My attention was fixed upon him, there might have been many persons near him, and I not see them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. It was very dark - A. There was a lamp near. After he had got the watch out he pulled, and broke the steel chain which confined it. My hands were in that position that I could not resist; my right hand was twisted round my umbrella. I made no resistance, but the chain held the watch after it was out of my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not under the slightest apprehension - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a considerable degree of force used to break the chain - A. There was, I felt a considerable pull; he broke it, I think, at the second jerk. There could have been time for me to have seized him, but my right hand held my umbrella. The lug occasioned no injury to my person.</p>

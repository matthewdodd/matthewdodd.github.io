             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am brother of the last witness: I was with my brother when he bought these pigs at Rumford, and have seen them many times since; in consequence of information, I went to Lambeth-street Police-office, and got a warrant; I went with Smith, and the two Griffiths's, to Ramshire's house, the sign of the Children in the Wood, in Whitechapel-road; as soon as we went into the kitchen, we saw the three pigs hang up in the coal-hole; the door was open; I have no doubt but they were my brother's pigs; I have seen them a number of times; the officers then sent for Ramshire, and he came down stairs; Smith and Griffiths told him they had had information of three pigs, which they believed were the same that hung up there, and they wished him to produce them the men, or tell where they could find them; he told them he was not there; he had been gone out some time, but as soon as he came in, he would shew them the man; I then told him, that from the information I had had not ten minutes before, the man was in the house; he said he was not, and he did not know what time he would come in; the officers, Smith and Griffiths, then told him they should keep him till such time as he found the man; we sat down in the kitchen, all three of us together, and in a little time the bell rung, and he wanted to go up stairs to his customers; the officers told him he could not go, he must send somebody else; he ordered his wife to go; in the mean time there came a person to the bar for some gin; the bar was adjoining the kitchen; he went into the bar to serve the gin, and I went and looked at the pigs; I took off the sheets, and found that the heads were not scalded; there were all the black hairs round the eyes, some as broad as your hand, and some half as broad, which was very remarkable; while I was in the coal-hole, I heard somebody coming down stairs; I came out, and saw some men coming down stairs; Griffiths, who stood by the bar where Ramshire was, said, are any of those he; he made no reply, till all the men were gone; there were six of them; he said one of them was the man; one of the officers went out directly, but it was so excessively dark, that he returned again; he asked Ramshire if he could tell him what the man's name was, that he might apprehend him; he said, he did not know what his name was; he had been backwards and forwards there for a fortnight; nothing more past; I went and got a coach, and put the pigs in.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon earth that these were your brother's pigs? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From the appearance of the pigs, without any other circumstance? - A. From the marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This coal-cellar, as you call it, was not it a wash-house, with a few coals deposited? - A. I dare say there were ten childrons of coals there, and butts of beer on each side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not a room, through which there was a passage, with windows in it? - A. I cannot say, it was dark then.</p>
               <p>Q. They had had full time and opportunity to have scalded the heads, as well as the bodies? - A. Yes, they might.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you got into the house, you saw the pigs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean, as soon as you got into the house, or as soon as you got into the kitchen? - A. As soon as I got into the kitchen; as soon as you go in at the door, there is the kitchen.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street; I went in company with Smith and Hanson to the Children in the Wood, which is Ramshire's house; we went into the house, and there was the kitchen, and when we went into the kitchen, there was a place with a quantity of coals in, and in that room were three pigs hanging with cloths over them; we sent for Ramshire; he came down stairs; we then took him backwards, and shewed him the hogs; I asked him if he knew any thing of these hogs coming there, as they had been stolen; he said, a man had brought them there; we desired him to point out the man, if the man was in the house; he said the man had been there, but was gone out; I asked him how long he thought it would be before he came in, and we would wait; he said, it might be late before he came in, or it might be the morning; soon after, he went into the bar to serve a glass of gin; there were five or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140015"></xptr>six men came down the stairs which he had come down before; we asked him then if either of there was the man; he made no answer to that, but as the prisoner Brookes had the door in his hand, going out of the passage, I pressed him again, and asked if that was the man; he nodded his head to me, and spoke slowly that that was the man; I immediately followed him out into the passage, but it was so dark, I could not find him.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had told you at once that that was the man, should you have had any difficulty in apprehending him? - A. None at all; I was close by him; I then returned in doors, told him he had behaved very ill, and we should take him into custody; Smith tied his hands; Mr. Hanson looked at the pigs, and said they were his brother's; he put them into a coach, and took them to Lambeth-street: On Sunday the 14th, the next day, in company with Smith, we apprehended Brookes in Darkhouse-lane, Billingsgate; I asked him how he came by those hogs that were at Ramshire's; he told me he had bought them of a man at Bow-bridge on the Saturday morning about four o'clock; I asked him if he knew the man; he said, no; I asked him what he was to give for the three hogs; he said he was to give three guineas and a half for each hog, that was ten guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he was to give that, or had given it? - A. Yes, was to give.</p>
               <p>Q. And that, after he had said he did not know the man? - A. Yes; I asked him, did he pay for them; he said no, he had not, that the man was to come up on Sunday evening for his money, when he had sold them; I then asked him if Ramshire was to have the three hogs; he said no, he was to have one of them for some money that he owed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you told my Lord and the Jury all that passed? - A. All that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps I may remind you; how did you get to apprehend Brookes? - A. Smith can tell you that; I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. What makes you suppose they were knocked on the head? - A. Because, when the head was opened, the blood was settled.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual to kill them by knocking them on the head? - A. Not pigs of that size.</p>

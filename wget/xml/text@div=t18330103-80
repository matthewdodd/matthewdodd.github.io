On the 2nd of December, about a quarter after five o'clock in the afternoon, on going upstairs I found my bed-room door unlocked - I had locked it myself about half-past one o'clock, and on entering the room I found part of my drawers open; they had been rifled - I missed the articles stated in the indictment, and three lace caps, value altogether about 10l. or 12l., which were all safe when I locked the door; I had not been out of the house - I keep a coal and potatoe shop; my private door was kept shut - I do not know the prisoner; the door must have been opened by a false key: the lock was hampered.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I searched the prisoner in St. James' watch-house on the 24th. I noticed that the bosom of his shirt was rather large, and having had information of this robbery, and having seen some of James' shirts, I took his shirt off - I saw the end was cut off it, and a piece put in; I asked him how he came by it - he said he bought it in Moumonth-street; I asked how long he had had it - he told me six months, I am sure he said that; Mrs. James claimed it, and he said to her, "It is very curious if that is your shirt, I have had four months."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to his lodgings? A. I asked where he lodged - he told me first one place and then another; I went to some of the places; I did not see his brother.</p>
               <p>MRS. JAMES. This is my husband's shirt - it is my own making, and the mark is cut out. I swear positively to it; - it is part of the property I lost on the day in question.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you sent any shirts to be washed? A. No - I do not know whether any of these keys would open my bed-room; I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the shirt in Monmouth-street.</p>

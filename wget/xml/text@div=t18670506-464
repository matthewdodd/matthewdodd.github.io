                  </hi>. I am a tin-plate worker, at 69, New Compton Street—about eleven o'clock on the night of 21st April, as I was coming round the corner of Great Russell Street into Bloomsbury Street, I saw the prisoner searching an old gentleman, quite grey-headed—he had him by the waist, and was <hi rend="italic">scrimmaging</hi> about him—I hastened up and was within a yard of them when he wrested the umbrella from out of the old gentle man's hands, and threw him down on the pavement—I gave chase to the</p>

               <p>prisoner through several streets—I could not run as quickly as he did—the constable took him, and I met him and the policeman coming back again—I told the constable what he had done, and he was taken to the station—we went to look for the old gentleman, but could not find him—we found the umbrella in the railings of a false area, in the direction the prisoner ran—he threw it away while I was chasing him—the prisoner said at the station that he had had a quarrel with two chaps, that they wanted to do something to him, and he was running away from them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you lose sight of the man you were running after? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just as you went round the corner I lost sight of you, but before you were at the end of the street I caught you again—I am sure you are the same man, by the <hi rend="italic">billycock</hi> hat and the coat done up in that style, and everything—I was within a yard of you when you threw the old gentle<lb></lb>man down—he was a helpless old man, and you threw him down by sheer strength—I kept sight of you all the way except at the corners of the streets.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 169). On 21st April I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Bloomsbury—I saw the prisoner run by me, he crossed the street—I heard some one call out, "Stop him"—I gave chase to the prisoner, and stopped him in Southampton Street—I said, "What are you running for?"—he said, "I had a quarrel with two men, let me go"—I told him I did not believe him—I was taking him back in the way he ran, and met the last witness, who told me he had thrown an old man down—the prisoner said he did not, he had had a quarrel with two men—I took him back to the place where the witness said the old gentleman was thrown down; he was gone—I took the prisoner to the station, then went and searched the streets in the way he had run, and found this umbrella over some railings in Market Street—next morning the prisoner said, "What a fool I must be to run after that man in front last night!"—there was no man running but the prisoner, the witness was some distance behind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was walking up one of the streets; I had had a drop to drink; I heard a man sing out, "Stop him!" I was running. As for seeing the old gentleman, I did not, nor take any umbrella. I know nothing of it.</p>

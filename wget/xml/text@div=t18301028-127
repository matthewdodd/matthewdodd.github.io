               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you mean that you were perfectly sober? A. No, but I was sufficiently collected to know what took place - I was not laying on the ground; I have always said he broke or cut the guard - he put the watch into my left hand; I do not remember stopping the prisoner, and asking my way to the Commercial-road, but I will not swear I did not - I do not recollect his saying, "I am an apprentice, I cannot go so far, but I will go as far as the Commercial-road;" very probably it might have taken place.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the 18th of September, between nine and twelve o'clock, I observed two persons in an obscure part of Mulberry-street - I went closer, and saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner, but I cannot say how he held him; he charged him with attempting to rob him of his watch; those were the words he used - I took the prisoner, and the prosecutor said he had either cut or broken his watch-guard; he showed me a ribbon in his hand, which he said was part of it - he was quite collected, and gave the same account he does now; at the station-house he took a ribbon off his neck, which corresponded with that he had in his hand - the prisoner, on his way to the watch-house, confessed that he had taken the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he perfectly collected? A. Yes, and gave the same statement he does now at the station-house, and before the Magistrate; I do not recollect the prisoner saying he had asked him to show him to the Commercial-road; the prosecutor said to him, "Confess at once whether you have taken it or not," and I think he used the words "It will be better for you."</p>

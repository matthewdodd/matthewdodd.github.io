                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Drury, and live in Hale-street, Poplar. On the 2nd of May, I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—the front parlour window was down close, and the blinds up, but I cannot say whether the sash was fastened—the street door and two back doors and every other part were fast—we have two lodgers, who have two apartments—we keep three rooms and a kitchen to ourselves—the house belongs to us—Thomas Davis slept in the parlour—I was there when he went to bed to help him off with his jacket, as he had a bad hand—I brushed his trowsers, jacket, and two waistcoats, and put them on a chair by the side of his bed, and put my cloak on the top of them—I came down next morning at a quarter to eight, and found hit things were all gone—I found my cloak next day at Mr. Beaument's, at the corner of the street—this is it.</p>

I know the prisoner—I saw him about a quarter before five o'clock on the 3rd of May, at the corner of Hale-street, laying the cloak down on Mr. Beament's fence, and wrapping it up—he then got up and threw it over the fence into the garden—after he had done so, he saw me and crossed over to the opposite side of the way—I went away without taking notice of it, and was returning home about six and saw the cloak there still—I did not see the prisoner again till the following night at the station—I have often seen his face about Poplar, but never spoke to him—I am quite sure of him—it was quite light.</p>

I said, "No," and went with him. He told me to sit down, and brought in a man and asked if he knew me to be the man; he said, "No;" he went out and brought the boy, and asked if he knew me; he said, "Yes." I had not a jacket or shirt but what I have on; he said the hat I had on was not what I wore; he fetched a hat from my landlord, but I had not worn that for a fortnight; he said my landlord said I was not in bed all night. I know that to be false.</p>

The Council for the King having succinctly opened the Charge against the Prisoner, setting forth the infinite Detriment that such Diminution of the Coin would be to the Publick supported their Charge by the following Evidence. Mr. Edes depos'd, That there having been a Parcel of Guineas paid in at his Shop by a Stranger some few Weeks before, some of which proved to be light, having been filed, he gave Order to his Servants when any Stranger came to pay in Money again, to take particular Care to see that they had not been filed; that thereupon the Prisoner coming the 2d of July, brought the Sum of 303 Guineas, some new some old, desiring a Note for them in the Name of John Smith; that the Guineas having been told, they were brought to him in a Shovel into the back Shop, and having sorted them took ten of them together, rubbing his Finger over the Edges of them, and perceived some Gold Dust like fine Filings come off upon his Finger, and some Particles to lie upon the Board where the Guineas lay; that they weighed them and found 110 of the 303 to be light, wanting about 18 d. per Guinea. Whereupon he went to the Prisoner, who waited for his Note, asking him who recommended him to pay the Guineas to him; the Prisoner answer'd him, one John Smith a Clothier living at Beesely in Gloucestershire; to which he replied he did not know any such Person; to which he made Reply, he must know him, for he had paid Money in to him before. Upon which he told him the Guineas were many of them light and had been filed, and therefore he must detain him till he could give him an Account of himself and Satisfaction how he came by those Guineas. He giving him some unsatisfactory and evasive Answers, and being in some Confusion, was for going, saying he had some Business upon the Exchange; whereupon he told him he must detain him, and if he would not consent to stay, he must charge an Officer with him; Whereupon he did consent to stay; but desired a Porter might he called to send home with a Message to his Wife, which they did permit him; and that he desired him to send for some that could gave an Account of him, but he not doing it, he sent to Mr. Pinkley the

            , who coming to him, they interrogated as to his Circumstances, and how he came by the Guineas, and likewise being told that he had not long before paid in 300 and odd Pound, desired to know to whom he had paid this Note, to which he gave no satisfactory Answer; they carried him before the Lord-Mayor, and there mention being made of the Weight of the light Guineas, he said he did not know what a Guinea should weigh, and had never weigh'd a Guinea in his Life, my Lord asking him the like, Questions, he gave nothing but trifling Answers, where upon he was committed to Newgate: This was confirmed by Mr.

             and Mr. Rogers, who added, that upon Mr. Edes's enquiring of the Prisoner, as has been before related, he appeared to be very dejected, and trembled. Mr. Pinkley depos'd, that then mention being made of going to search his House, he having had the Opportunity of sending home a Porter before, it was most advisable to defer that for some time, till they should think they would probably take no farther Notice; and accordingly deferred the Search for 3 or 4 Days, when taking a Warrant and Officer they went to his House, found it, an House of small Appearance, of about 5 or 6 l. per Annum; that the Window-shutters below Stairs were kept shutt, and that knocking at the Door a Lad came, who talking with them over the Hatch seem'd unwilling on let them come in till he told him he must come in, having a Warrant, and therefore if Opposition was made, must use Violence; whereupon they entring found the Furniture within meaner than the House without, the whole amount of the Inventory of the Furniture in their Opinion not to exceed 5 or 6 l. that going up Stairs there was a Loom or two, and a Lad puddling about something, but could find nothing of what they expected; that there was a Man who pretended to be Brother to the Prisoner, and that being in the Workshop they espy'd a Door that went out of it into another Room, they desired to see it opened; the Brother was very unwilling, saying, they could not, for he had not the Key, whereupon setting his, Foot against it, the Door flew open. And the Room was very dirty and dusty, land some small Parcels of Money lying in several Places, and the Furniture exactly answerable to what they had seen before; that there was in it a Bed, but a very sorry old torn thing, and an old Trunk; they desired the Trunk might be opened, but the Brother saying he had not the Key, they replied then they must break it upon; where upon he fetched a Key, which tho' not the Key of the Trunk they got it open; that in this Trunk in one Parcel was 93 Guineas, in another 193 and a half, in another 187 and a half, then searching about the Bed, there was under the Bed some old Bottles, and the Constable feeling with his Staff felt a Cloth, and found in it 346 Guineas, of which there were 20 that had been filed. And that all these Parcels of Guineas were fresh new Guineas, very fair, and either King George's or Queen Anne's, and that they found a Pair of Gold Scales, and Weights for a Guinea, a half Guinea and Grains, but no other Weights, and that they found a Paper upon which there seemed to appear among some Dust something to shine as if there had been in it some fine Filings of Gold or some other Metal, and that they found likewise a Subpoena in Relation to a Suit of his depending, which he carried on in Forma pauperis. These Circumstances were generally confirm'd by the Officer and those that were present at searching the House. Mr. Pinkley deposed, that afterwards going to him in Newgate, they desired him to give them Satisfaction how he came by the said Parcels of Money, to which he answer'd very evasively he had received it of various Persons in small Sums as 5 or 10 l.&amp;c. and that his way of getting it was by his Employments, sometimes as a Weaver. Sometimes as a Solicitor at Law, and sometimes in Stock-jobbing,&amp;c. But that they suspecting that he had received the Money from some Accomplices who had furnished him with it in order to file, or at least to put off, they promised him if he would discover that he should not be prosecuted, but he refused to make any, saying it was his own Money. Mr. Edes likewise deposed, that in order to inform himself who this John Smith was at Beesely in Gloucestershire, in whose Name he would have taken a Note for the Money, he sent to the Minister of the Place and received from him two Letters, which were produced in Court: The Import of which was, that he had made very diligent Inquiry, and that there was no such Person there. Several of his Neighbours appeared in Court, and deposed, that he had the Repute of a Man in mean Circumstances, among which were the Officers of the Parish, who deposed that about 2 or 3 Years since, the Prisoner being rated 4 d. per Month to the Poor, they could never get any Money, but always when they went found the Doors shut, and some body or another to answer him out of the Window, but when they were a going out of their Office had obtained a Warrant to make Distress, did with much Difficulty get into his House to distrain for 15 s.2 d. but when they came in found not Movables worth their taking, and that he said he was a poor Man and not able to pay, but they resolving to cut a Piece of Stuff out of the Loom, he said it was none of his own; but at last muster'd up 10s. which he said was all that he had, and engaged one of the Officers who was his Neighbour to lay down the 5 s. for him. Others deposed that his Trade he carried on was very inconsiderable; and a Lodger in his House said, that he seemed to be very necessitous, being always very pressing for his Rent as soon as ever Quarter-day was past. Several other Things were deposed that tended to prove that he was reputed a Man of mean Circumstances; so that it was more than probable that he must have Accomplices who had supplied him with this Money, in order either to diminish or utter, or both. This the Council for the Prisoner endeaveor'd to obviate by producing Witnesses how he might come by this Money, and that consequently it was his own, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171709110003"></xptr> it was what he had been scraping together for this 15 to 16 Years by working hard with his Hands, racking his Brains and starving his Belly, and likewise urging that a Man might put away false Money unknowingly. They called a great many Witnesses, some depos'd that they knew about 13 or 14 Years ago he came to Town and brought with him Cloth which he sold here to the Value of 70 l. that he had since that worked Journey-work, and afterwards traded for himself; that he had the Repute of a Mony'd Man; that he had lent Money upon Pawns, to be paid by weekly Payments; that he had discounted Notes: And one said he had lent 100 l. upon Security, which Money was paid again not long before his Apprehension for this Fact: and another particularly testified, that 5 or 6 Years since he' desired him to look out for a Purchase for him worth 5,6 or 700 l. and that he showed him the Money to pay for it. Another said he had offered to buy some Houses for 200 l. that he had the Reputation of an honest fair-dealing Man; that he was very frugal and saving, making Advantages of his Money every way he could, contenting himself with bare Necessaries at home and abroad, and many Things of the like Nature. T o which the Council reply'd, that the Prisoner had produced no such Person as John Smith a Clothier of Beesely in Gloucestershire, who recommended him to pay the 303 Guineas to the said Messieurs Green and Edes; that an honest fair-dealing Man had no occasion to make use of such Falsifications in paying his own Money into a Goldsmith's Hand; that he had yet made no Proof how he came by these Sums of Money, inasmuch as excepting the 100 l. said to be paid to him; the Notes said to be discounted, were most of them some considerable time before, and the Sums themselves but small, and together amounting to no Sum comparable with 1100 l. which Sum of Money was found upon him in Gold. They observed likewise, that this could not be likely to be Money that he had boarded up, because they were all of them new Guineas, sit for filing: They observed likewise, that he had no Proof of any considerable Dealings in this Trade, whereby to procure such a Sum; that he had produce'd no Proof of his dealing in Stocks, Exchequer-Notes, or any thing relating to Publick Credit, no, not so much as his having bought or sold one single Exchequer-Bill. As to his taking in Pawns, they observed likewise, that the Persons who search'd his House had deposed they found no such Pawns (except a Gold Chain of small Value, a Gown and Petticoat,3 or 4 Rings in the Trunk aforesaid) nor no Books of any Account of any such Dealings in any of these Occupations. They likewise observed, that this Action of uttering the Guineas was very unlike an Old Gripe, as his Council had been labouring to prove him, in that no Man that was Convetous in improving Money would pay Money into the Hands of a single Goldsmith upon his bare Note which allows no Interest, when he may for it have Exchequer Notes on Parliament Security,&amp;c, which bear Interest. They observed likewise, that such Persons did not use to leave such a Sum as 470 l. so carelesly as in old Clouts under a Bed. They observed also, that tho' the Prisoner said before the Lord. Mayor that he never weigh'd a Guinea in his Life, yet a Pair of Gold Scales and Weights were found in his Room; and many other Things by which it appear'd highly probable that it was Money he was furnish'd with from some other Persons, for the said fraudulent and pernicious Intent and Porpose: and however, were it his own, the Suspicion was the stronger upon him, in that he had given no Proof of whom, when or where he receiv'd them, or what honest Intent he could have in paying them to Messieurs Green and Edes.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 48). On Saturday night, 13th June, about 12.30, I was on duty in High Street, Borough, and saw a man named John Bryan there with some other men—I was with Constable Gillett 215, on the other side of the road—John Bryan was with four or five other men and three or four females making a noise, holloaing, and singing—I went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187407130055"></xptr>
               <p>across the road and asked them to go away—Bryan said "Who are you? I am a detective; I am doing my duty as well as you," and he refused to go away—I said "You are making a nice noise, go away"—he struck me underneath the chin, and knocked me down against the shutters, and ran up Red Cross Court—I followed close after him, and when he got a little way up the court he said "Come up here, you b----, and I will slaughter you"—I followed him about 60 yards, and he ran up Little' Red Cross Court, which is up two steps, and went into the first door on the right—as the door came to, I made a run at the door and forced it open—when I got inside the place was all in darkness, and he struck me in the breast inside the door—I got hold of him and brought him out of the door; he was struggling and trying to strike me—I got him by both arms and as I got outside the door we both fell together down the steps; he falling on the top of his head—I never drew my staff at all—it was all done in a moment, and I had not time to think of my staff—I did not say in the passage "You b----son, I have been looking for you a long time and I have got you now"—I never knew the man before—I did not make a blow at him with my staff, strike the wall and break it—I fell over him down the steps; the other constable came running up the court, and we took the prisoner to the station—we did not stop in Red Cross Court hardly half-a-minute, being a very bad rough neighbourhood, we never should have got the man out—at the time we were in the hall or the front of the house I did not see the prisoner or any woman come down the stairs with a lighted candle in her hand—not a single person was present that I saw—Bryan did not say "I will go quietly if you will let me" not a word of the sort—I did not strike him in the hall—when we had the struggle outside and fell to the ground there was no one present but Gillett, and he came up and helped me to help the prisoner up—I never saw any one till we got out into the High Street—when we were in the court the prisoner was not at the door with a candle and in her night dress—if anyone had come into the passage with a lighted candle and in their night dress I must have seen that—the court is very dark and if anyone had been looking out of the door I might not have noticed them; but if there had been a candle I must have seen them—the Court is under an arch and the top is very dark, and I should have seen a light—the door of the house opens right into the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The place where the disturbance was, was about 60 yards from the Court—I followed him 60 yards—I was close behind him all the time—he slammed the door, and as it came to I put my shoulder against it and forced it open—the moment you got through the door you were in the room of the house—Bryan had given me an ugly blow in the first instance, without any provocation whatever—it hurt a good deal—when I got into the house he was in the room and he struck me again—there was no step from the Court into the room—there is a little threshold—I struggled with him and dragged him out of the place—I should think it is 3 or 4 yards from the door to the two steps where we fell—it opens into Red Cross Court—you turn to the left out of Red Cross Court, and go up two steps into Little Red Cross Court, and the door opened into the room about 4 feet from the steps—there is a lamp at the end of Red Cross Court but it is not very light there—in Little Red Cross Court there is a lamp at the end, and there is another lamp by the steps—I did not hurt myself when I tumbled down the steps—I fell on the top of Bryan—I was going</p>

On Sunday morning, 14th June, I was with Turner in High Street, Borough—I saw him follow John Bryan—I was about the width of the street behind—there is a passage leading into Red Cross Square, and Red Cross Court is on the left-hand side, up two steps—I did not go into the Court at all—I saw Turner fall over the steps with Bryan—that was just before I got up to them—Bryan's house is in Red Cross Court, as I understand, and they fell down the steps into Red Cross Square, where I was—I went up to them—Bryan was underneath—I assisted him up, and assisted the constable with him to the station—I saw blood trickling over Bryan's hair when he got up on his legs—I could see Bryan's house in Red Cross Court when I went up—I did not see any<lb></lb>one standing at the door—I did not see any woman in her night dress holding a candle at that door—if she had been there I must have noticed her—there was no blow struck as Bryan was getting up from the ground; I am quite sure of that—I swear Turner had not got his staff in his hand, and I swear that he struck no blow—there was a lamp not far distant, a little below the Court—I did not notice that Bryan made any remark what<lb></lb>ever—I will swear that Bryan did not say, in my presence, "I will go quietly"—he appeared stupified when he got up from the ground, and he came quietly to the station.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am divisional surgeon—at the request of Mr. Benson, the Magistrate, I examined John Bryan's head on 15th June, about 2.30 p.m.—I found a large contused wound on the left and rather on the back part of the head, about 2 inches long—it is always a difficult question to say whether such a wound was caused by a blunt instrument or by a fall; but from the position, I am inclined to think it was from the blow of a policeman's truncheon—I should say it was struck from before, backwards—the cut was across the head, not along it—I asked the man to show the position, and he did so—I examined the wound first without asking a question—I was merely asked by the Magistrate's clerk whether it was a truncheon blow or from a fall—that was the only guide I had to it—I examined the wound carefully, without asking a question, and after doing so I asked the man how it was done—my opinion before I asked a question wag that it was from a blow, but yet it might be produced by a fell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen a good many dozen truncheon wounds before—it was very like a truncheon wound—from the position it was more like a truncheon wound than a wound caused by falling on the pavement—I should think it had been bleeding—the place was swollen, and I have no doubt that blood had come from it, although I did not see it—the blow that caused that contusion must have been one of considerable violence—it was from 2 to 3 inches down the head.</p>

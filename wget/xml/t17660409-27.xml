On the 18th of March I came home, a few minutes after my wife missed five guineas; she told me the prisoner had taken it, and shewed me the cupboard broke open. He had carried some loads for me as a porter, and he called to know if I had any thing for him to do. I went after him, but did not meet him till four days after, when I met with him in Tower-street; I seized him and brought him into the Bell ale-house, and charged him with taking my money; he confessed he had taken it, and said he was sorry for it; he owned to five guineas; he told me where he had spent one guinea, he owned he had bought a coat with some of it, he told me where he had lodged some of the money. The man told me he had three guineas and a half in his hands; I bid him to take care of it; that was Mr. Leyborn, at the Shepherd and Dog, Ratcliff-highway.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor: the prisoner was in our house, he had seen me take money out of the corner cupboard. While I and a customer went backwards, he broke my cupboard open, and took out four guineas and two half guineas; he went out, but he returned again, for I heard him talk to my bird, and I know his voice. I did not see him, but I missed the money, and found the lock broke in a few minutes after he was gone, there was nobody there but him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176604090012"></xptr> this was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. I heard him confess the taking the money out of the cupboard; and I heard him confess the same before the Justices in Whitechapel; but said he was drunk when he did it.</p>

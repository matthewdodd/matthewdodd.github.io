               <p>Q. Was Pugh also a horse-keeper - A. He was, during the year 1811.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any great quantity of hay and straw - A. I did not miss it particularly. I thought the consumption large. I should never have known that I was plundered, except from information. I went to the Maidenhead. I taxed Pugh with it. He owned it. I then went and consulted with Rivett and Dowset. I sent for the prisoner to come to London. As soon as he came I charged the officer with him. The prisoner then owned to selling eight trusses. Pugh, the accomplice, was present at the time. I never promised or threatened him. He owned every thing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the hay kept - A. In the loft, over the horses, at Hounslow, in the parish of Isleworth.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he take it to - A. Young took it into his stable.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it - A. About nine at night. It was not very dark. I could see him very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you saw them - A. I was in another loft in the same yard. The stables are in a back lane.</p>

            . I was a servant to Mr. Moodey in 1811. On the 2nd of November the prisoner let Mr. Witney have eight trusses of hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Witney - A. He has destroyed himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you get for this hay - A. Sixteen shillings. I told Mr. Davis of it a twelvemonth ago. I did not tell my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hay was it - A. Mr. Moodey's.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Whereabouts was the value of hay at that time - A. I gave six pounds a load. They were worth about three shillings a truss. It was my property, and no one else.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Davis. Did Pugh tell you this a year ago - A. Yes. I did not mention it for this reason, the prisoner and the landlord came to me, and begged and prayed I would not say anything about it. They said they would take the property back again, and Witney said he would never be guilty of anything of the kind any more.</p>

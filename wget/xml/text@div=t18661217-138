                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Stevenson, of 1, Young's Buildings, Angel Court, Borough—I knew the deceased, Margaret Burke, by coming to see her brother-in-law, who lived in my front room, upstairs—on a Saturday evening in July, about half-past eight, I and the prisoner came up to my door together, just as the deceased did—she called her brother-in-law, who said to her, "You have got a little drop to drink; you had best come home along with me," and he took her up Angel Court—he came back in a very few minutes, and she came back some minutes after—I saw her in the passage on her knees, bleeding at the back of the ear—there was no one else there then—I had not seen anybody strike her—she was taken to a doctor's—some days after that I saw the prisoner near London Bridge—she tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "I was at your place this morning; how is my aunt, that I struck?" (the deceased was her mother's brother's wife)—she said she struck her with a stone, and the stone I had found in my passage was the one she did it with—I said I had heard she was better—she said, "Well, she gave me my blood to drink the week before, and I only gave her hers in return"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the stone I found in my passage—there was some blood on it when I picked it up next morning.</p>

I am a bricklayer's labourer, and live at 1, Young's Buildings—the deceased was my sister-in-law—she came to my place on a Saturday night, between seven and eight—she was not quite sober—I took her to the corner of Angel Court and came back to my own place, and in about a quarter of an hour Mrs. Stevenson told me she was bleeding at the door—I ran down and found her lying on Mrs. Stevenson's doorway with one hand on the step of the door and the other on her head, which was bleeding—I took her up and took her to the doctor and then to the hospital, and then took her home—she was able to walk—I saw no more of her till the week she died.</p>

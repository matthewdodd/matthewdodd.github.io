                  </hi>. I live at East Sunningdale—the pri<lb></lb>soner was coachman to my father, Mr. Robert Hitchings—about 16th Feb<lb></lb>ruary I found him at the police-station—I had instructed the police to arrest him; it was on a charge of taking money—we have sometimes been in the habit of sending him to town to pay bills for us—there was one bill of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some money due to Messrs. Geoghegan and Doucet—I received a bill from them, which I had reason to believe had been paid through the prisoner—I found amongst my receipted bills a copy of that bill, with a re<lb></lb>ceipt at the bottom of it; the sum was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it has never been paid—having found that bill I enclosed it in an envelope, and sent it to Messrs. Geoghegan and Doucet—I received this bill from Miss Medley—I never gave any money for the payment of that bill to anybody, because it was paid with some money of my mother's, which was in the possession of Miss Medley—I made a communication to the prisoner about this bill it the station-house—it bad been shown to him—he said that he had paid it—he did not mention the amount—he mentioned the name of the shop—he said my shirtmaker's in Regent-street—he said he knew nothing about the other bills.</p>

                  </hi>. I am living in the house of Mr. Hitch<lb></lb>ings, of East Dulwich, and was there at the time of this transaction—about the beginning of July last I gave the prisoner this bill and some money—I cannot recollect whether I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or just the amount; if I did he brought me the change back—he was to pay the money at the shop men<lb></lb>tioned on the bill whenever he went to the west-end of the town—he after<lb></lb>wards brought me back the bill receipted, as it is now, with a receipt stamp</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186303020117"></xptr>
               <p>on it—he made no observation to me at that time about it, not till after Christmas, when another bill, for which I gave him the money to pay in October, was sent in again to Mr. Hitchings—he then said to me, "I have been going to ask you two or three times, has Mr. Frederick Hitchings had a second bill from this shop in Regent-street?"—I said, "I can't tell, as be lives in the country; he might have had, but I cannot tell you"—he said, "When I went to pay that bill in Regent street, some one came out and re<lb></lb>ceived the money; I did not get off the box; somebody brought me the bill out receipted, went away, and did not return to the shop"—that conversation had reference to this bill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you have been many years in the establish<lb></lb>ment of Mr. Hitchings, Senior? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, thirty-three years—I was there as governess, and have been there ever since—there are four female servants, a gardener, a labouring-man; no helper in the stables, only a coachman—I generally pay my housekeeping-bills through the cook—no other person in the establishment pays the bills—I never at any time sent any of the female servants; I am quite sure as to that—the cook pays the tradespeople, but they all come to the house—I give her the money, and she pays—sometimes the prisoner would not pay a bill for months together, and sometimes two or three in a week—he may have paid more than two dozen bills in the course of a year—I generally saw him myself personally—I recollect seeing him about this bill of Geoghegan And Doucet's—I handed him the money wrapped up in an envelope—I did not always seal it; I did occasionally—I don't think I did on this occasion—I dare say he had the bill a week in his possession—the housemaid from time to time brought me up bills which the prisoner had paid—I cannot pledge my oath that she did not bring this bill up to me—Mr. Hitchings, Senior, has always been a very kind and liberal master to the prisoner—he has a wife and six children—I should think my attention was called to this subject about five or six weeks before Mr. Frede<lb></lb>rick Hitchings gave the prisoner into custody, as far as I can say—I have not from time to time employed the gardener to pay some bills—he has not paid any since I have had the control, for the last five years and a half—the prisoner was employed to go to the banker's sometimes, and bring home cash—I can't remember when that has been—he did so from time to time—it is within my knowledge that he was entrusted to discharge other amounts on behalf of Mr. Hitchings, such as Mr. Stapleton's, the jobmaster's, and other tradesmen to a considerable amount, but that was by cheques.</p>

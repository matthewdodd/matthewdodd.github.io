I live at 280, Tottenham-court-road, in the parish of St. George's in the Fields. On Saturday the 29th of January, about three in the afternoon, I perceived these two pieces of print taken down from where I put them in the morning. I perceived the two prisoners walking up and down before the house, and I saw these two pieces of print taken off the line where they were put in the morning by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the linen - A. Inside of the shop. They were hanging up inside of the shop. I cannot say who took them down. When I perceived them taken down I went into one corner of the shop and watched, having suspicion. I watched the prisoners walking up and down at one corner of the shop; after the prints were taken down I watched there for a quarter of an hour, and when they had an opportunity the prisoner Roke came in and put one of them on the top of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Roke entered the shop, did he - A. Yes, and put one of the prints on the other; he clapped his apron over them.</p>
               <p>Q. He had an apron on then - A. Yes, he was in the act of taking them away; somebody came past at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he moved them from where they were - A. Yes; he had taken them down from where I put them. Somebody coming past at the time, Thatcher gave him a signal to be off. Thatcher was waiting outside at the door at the time; somebody came by; he gave him a signal to run off. I pursued him; both run off contrary ways. I pursued, and took the prisoner Roke;

            . I was in the shop; as soon as I was disengaged the other witness came up, and told me that the prints were not in the same state as he put them in the morning; that he had seen the prisoners walk by the shop several times. I then went and watched as well as him. I observed the prisoners walk by the shop twice; the third time the prisoner Roke stepped into the shop; he took one piece of print up from a box; he put it on the other; he put his apron over it, and as he was going to take it away the other prisoner gave him a signal that somebody was coming.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the signal - A. He touched him, which I understood to be a signal; then he dropped the print out of his apron, and run away. One of the pieces of print cost Mr. Hughes two shillings and four pence a yard, and the other one shilling and ten pence. They are forty-eight yards; twenty-four yards each. That was the prime cost.</p>

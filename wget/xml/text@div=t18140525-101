             - A. Yes; she was Whittingstall's house-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what she said to you, did you expect any thing - A. Yes; I expected the house to be set on fire. I had great suspicion of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect hearing any conversation between the prisoner and this woman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What separated your room from his - A. My room is separated from his by a wall or partition; but there is a closet, when that is open we can hear what is said in each other's room. A week previous to the fire, I heard a discourse which alarmed me very much I heard it twice, fourteen days before the fire, and a week before the fire, on Sunday night. I heard it on two separate Sunday nights. Jane Sidebottom usually slept at home on Saturday night. She came home on the Sunday night; he asked her why she came home that night. She said, Whittingstall, my husband said I might; why do you object to it; he said, I should be a rich man to-morrow, if you did not come home to me to night. I heard that two Sundays; in consequence of this, it excited my suspicion I packed up a large box of my most valuable articles; I hired a man to take them away to a friend's house.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, on Saturday night, what time did you go to bed - A. I did not go to bed. I, my husband, my daughter, and a friend,

             let him in.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the night, did you hear any thing in the prisoner's room - A. Yes; but being up the night before and that night, I cannot say any thing with respect to time.</p>
               <p>Q. Only tell me what you heard and saw - A. I heard the sound of a box-lid falling down; the next thing appeared to me, like the latch of his door. I cannot tell what time that was. The next thing, I heard something like a flat iron fall, it had not the tingling sound of a poker, it was more heavy; the next thing, I smelled a sulpherous smell, like woollen burning; my room was full of smoke. I said, I think the house is on fire; I was unwilling to make a false alarm. I said, my God, the deed is done; I ran up stairs, and called the old woman and her grand daughter; I said, Mrs. Adams come down, the house is on fire. Whittingstall then called, Mrs. King, for God's sake, help me, I am burning. I said, you wicked rogue, I know you are burning; I have been sitting up two nights to catch you in that burning. He said he did not know what I meaned.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any appearance of being burned at all - A. None at all. He had his shirt on, and waistcoat. He had no appearance of fire about him at all. Mr. Shephard came down stairs to me; he saw the prisoner; he seized the prisoner immediately, and brought him into my apartment, and gave him to George Tiburd.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there any water been prepared for your use - A.Every pail and every vessel was filled that would hold water, they were in the yard, close to the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the bed clothes the next morning - A. Yes. The middle of the blankets appeared to be quite burnt to a cinder, with a flat iron apparently, and the neck part and the sleeves of a night-gown were burnt, and a counterpane was destroyed, the middle and top had been burned, and a black waistcoat had been burnt to a skeleton.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what furniture the prisoner had in his room - A. His room was very slightly furnished with three wooden bottom chairs, and a small toilet table. Last July, he sold the best of his furniture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What the man had in his drawers you cannot say. I believe you mean any thing but kindness to him. How long have you lived in the house - A. Eight or nine weeks.</p>

            . Q.We understand you lodged in the house of the prisoner - A. Yes; the house is in Peter-street. Peter-street leads from Sun-street into Bishopsgate-street, in the city of London. I and my wife and my two children live in the front parlour of this house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived there - A. I went in there the week before Christmas. We all four lodged in that parlour. On the 20th of February, in consequence of what I heard, it excited my suspicion; I filled the pails with water. On the very day the accident happened I filled twelve pails and earthen pans full of water. The prisoner's room was the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q Who was in you room - A. Mrs. Witton, a young man an acquaintance of mine, myself, and wife, and one child. We were all there upon the watch. The prisoner came home about half past ten. I went out in the yard a few minutes before eleven for the purpose of looking into the prisoner's room. In his room there was a fire in the grate, and a candle burning. The prisoner followed me out in the yard, with a tea-kettle in his hand. I told him he could not get any water, the cock was frozen. I said, you are going to get ready for breakfast; no, he said, he was going to have a wash, he should get up soon in the morning; he went back into his room, and I into my room. I stripped part of my clothes off, and laid down on the bed. I did not give credit to what was said. The first thing I heard was a kind of a noise, as if something had dropped from the grate. That was between one and two, or a little after; thereabouts. The next thing I heard them that watched say, there was a light. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250053"></xptr>then saw a great smoke, and a stench as if wool was burning; that was about three o'clock, or a little after. Then the alarm was given; that smoke was coming into my room by Tilburd. I went out for water; I did not see the prisoner laid hold of at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had any appearance of being burnt - A. Not at all. I am quite sure that no part of his clothes were burnt, or singed at all. I got some water into his room, and supplied Shephard in throwing water. I saw the state of the things upon his bed. They are here. Both the over and under clothes were burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner have been in bed without being burnt - A. No, nor no other human being. He was not burnt.</p>

Mrs. Shephard and the girl went out of Mrs. King's room into the passage, and returned into the room again. I think that was between one and two. Soon after they came into the room again, I heard something, like as if the lifting up of the latch of the prisoner's door. I smelled fire just after three; the alarm was then given.

             to see if the fire proceeded from my own room; we ascertained it did not; my fire was out then. On my returning down stairs, I perceived a light over the prisoner's door; I called Mr. Shephard up. He slipped on his clothes, and was coming down. I wished him to go into the prisoner's room, and just as he got upon the stairs, the prisoner opened the door, and cried, for God's sake, help, he was all over burning, or words to that effect. I could see that the prisoner had a waistcoat on. Mrs. Shephard and King went out into the yard to look into the prisoner's window; the light went out then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body living in his room that night but himself - A. Nobody but himself.</p>

            . I am the daughter of Mrs. King, that has been examined in court. I sat up with my father and mother this night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going out any time on this night into the passage - A. I opened the room door; I did not go into the passage; I think it was between one and two. I could see the prisoner's door; at the time that I opened the door I saw there was a light. I returned into the room, and immediately I heard as though a latch was opened. There was nobody in the passage when I looked out.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner after he came out of the room - A. Yes. He had no appearance of being burned upon him; he had only a waistcoat on.</p>

            . I am a chair-carver. I am an acquaintaince of Mrs. King. On the 20th of February, I staid in the house that night. The alarm was given by Mrs. King's daughter first; she and Mrs. Witton went up stairs to see if Mrs. Shephard's fire and her fire were out. Upon our opening the door, the smoke was as much in Mrs. King's room as in the passage. When Mr. Shephard was alarmed, he was coming down stairs, and the prisoner hearing the noise, he came running out of his door, exclaiming, I am on fire, Mrs. King, help me for God's sake. I saw him come out of the room; he was not on fire, nor was any thing upon him; he was dressed in his shirt, night-cap, and waistcoat; his shirt was hanging loose. There was no appearance of fire about him. I entered the prisoner's room with Mr. Shephard; the prisoner ran back into his own room. Mr. Shephard and I after him. We both immediately entered together. He then began scraping the fire about the bed-clothes, with his hands; his bed was on fire; the flames was raising up; as we entered the door, he said, help me to put it out. Mr. Shephard laid hold of him, and gave him to me; I took him into Mr. King's room. The prisoner's bed-clothes were all burnt. If any body had been in the bed, their flesh must have been injured, and the shirt burnt, to lay in that bed as I saw it.</p>

            . I am a brass-founder. I had the front room up one pair of stairs, in the prisoner's house. On Sunday night, the 20th of February, I went to bed; I was awoke in the morning between three and four; they called fire; I came down as fast as I could. It smoked so, I could hardly fetch my breath. I went towards Whitting-stall's room; I heard him screaming out, help me, or I shall be burnt. He then ran into his room. Indeed, as a brass-founder, I am used to all kinds of smoke; I could not stand in the room as he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see much flame - A. I saw the bed all on fire; no other place was on fire than the bed. The prisoner was upon his hands and knees, pretending to put it out; he was clawing it out with his nails, which accumulated it; it made it worse. From the manner in which he acted, it did not seem to me that he was putting it out. I ran and caught him by the neck; I said, you rogue and villian, come out; I pulled him out, and gave him to Mr. Tiburd, who stood in the door-way. They brought me water; I threw a dozen pales of water upon it, that it should be perfectly out. I put the fire out. The fire was in a good blaze; it would soon have taken the house down if I had not done that way. The prisoner was not burnt, neither his shirt, nor any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From what you then saw, could he have been in bed - A. I never think he could be, from the state of the bed; the bed was on fire in the middle. At the time that I seized the prisoner, and called him a rogue and a villain, he said, let me put my clothes on. I said, no; you shall go to prison. He then said, Oh, dear. That is all. He did not assign any reason how the fire happened.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I let the prisoner in; he came in near half past ten. I went with him into his room, and gave him a light.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250054"></xptr>Q. Had he any fire then - A. No. I took particular notice of a gown hanging up, of Mrs. Sidebottom's; the woman he cohabited with. It was hanging upon a line, right over the bed. I knew the gown well; she had washed it on the Friday, and ironed it on the Saturday night. Mrs. Sidebottom was not at home. I had not seen her since the forenoon. I am quite sure she was not at home when I let in the prisoner. There was nobody in the room but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the constable coming after the fire was extinguished - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into the prisoner's room - A. I believe the prisoner was in his room then; I cannot exactly state that. I heard the prisoner ask the watchman's liberty to have his great coat. I saw the watchman had hold of him. He said to the watchman, give me liberty to put on my great coat; the watchman said, yes, by all means. The watchman let go his collar. He went to a corner close by the door; he took up his great coat, which was rolled up in a small compass close to the door, and put it on his back; and the gown that I saw hanging on the line over the bed on Sunday night, in the morning it was taken down, and an old ragged gown of no value whatever was hanging in its place. I saw the other gown the next morning when the gentlemen came from the office to examine the room. The gown that I first saw hanging up was rolled up in Mrs. Sidebottom's box.</p>
               <p>Q. Who used to wash the prisoner's linen - A.

            . I am a constable of Bishopsgate. These premises are in the city of London. I was sent for on the night of the 20th of February. I took the prisoner into custody in his own room. I returned on the Monday morning. I possessed myself of the articles of his bed. I also took a flat iron I found in his room. I produce a counterpane, blanket, sheet, and an old dressing-gown. These were all taken from the bed; and here is an old coat, and a waistcoat. The blanket has every appearance of being burnt by a hot iron, as if the iron had been red hot, and the other things are burnt also, and the sheet is burnt in two places.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Shephard. Did you observe when the fire was put out any preparation for washing, or any tub with water in it - A. No, nor anything that had been washed that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at the Northumberland Arms, Bittle<lb></lb>bridge. On the 10th of March I was sitting at the table making out my bills—the prisoner was sitting near me—I had a gold key attached to my watch, on a ring sewn to a ribbon—it was cut from the ribbon—I missed it in the course of a few minutes—there were many other persons there, but the prisoner was the only one near me—I spoke to him, and one or two others, but could get no information of it—I saw him again nearly every day after—he came to me a fortnight ago, and said if I would give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he would return the property to me—I told the policeman, and he took him, and found the duplicate of the key on him—this is my key.</p>

I live in Weston-street, Pentonville, I never spoke to the prosecutor till last Sunday morning—when I asked him about the transaction of William Smith, whether he thought he was the person who cut it off—he said no, he did not think he was, because he was not the only person that cat beside him, and he should have been the last person, that he suspected had had it, or even the ticket, if he had not said, If you will give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will return it"—he said he had got his fellow-servant to go out to see if he could see William Smith, to tell him him to keep out of the way, as his master intended to have him taken up—he said he had the key cut off, by whom he could pretty well guess, but he did not think it was William Smith.</p>

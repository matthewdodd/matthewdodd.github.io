On the 19th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a disturbance of several persons, as I thought, running down the place, where I live; I opened the door to see who it might be, as there is no thoroughfare. I saw the prisoner at the bar, pursuing his wife; he at that time lived in the court, on the opposite side of the way. I did not at that time see that he had any thing in his hand - I only saw him and his wife; when I opened my door, he turned, came to me, and said "You bl-y rogue, I will murder you," and shoved a knife as I suppose it to be into my left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first word you heard uttered? A. Yes; I found I was stabbed; I put my hand to my arm, and the blood was gushing out; he attempted several times forward with the instrument which he had in his hand to stab me again. I stepped back into the house, and put my hand a little behind me, where I knew there was a yard measure, and took that in my own defence; he did not come in - he was at the door; I struck him with the yard, and drove him back into the court; he still continued thrusting at me, till I broke the yard measure into short pieces, in my hand; he then ran away into his own house. I heard him say he would stab his wife also - he would murder she also. I sent for an officer, who took him, and a surgeon, who dressed my wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060105"></xptr>here to prosecute this man for his life? A. I am come to prosecute him according to law, as he deserves.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known his wife? A. Which way do you mean? I have known her as a woman, apparently for about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not this man forbid you his house? A. I forgot to state that, upon the 6th of October, in a public-house, he threatened to stab me with a dagger; and on the Sunday night previous to this, I heard him threaten my life in his own house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say? A. He said in the public-house, that he had bought a dagger on purpose to run through my heart.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Before the day he struck you with a knife, had he not forbid you his house? A. Yes; on the 8th of October - he struck me on the 19th of November; I had been to his house frequently in his absence, and in his presence, for my washing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not frequently drank tea, and breakfasted with his wife in his absence? A. Yes; and dined there too; she dressed it for me and my family - I have no wife, I have some boys. I dined there in person - the dinner was sent to my house for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did you ever introduce this man's wife as Mrs. Williams, to any one? A. I never did I never called her Mrs. Williams in any body's presence, I swear that. I know Kearsley and his wife; I was at the Red Lion public-house, Shoe-lane, in their company, in the Bartholomew fair week. I did not introduce the prisoner's wife to them as my wife, nor call her Mrs. Williams in their presence. I know Renshaw, she is a married woman; I never called the prisoner's wife Mrs. Williams in her company, nor introduce her as Mrs. Williams. I know a woman named Bosley; I never introduced the prisoner's wife to her as Mrs. Williams - they were all in company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any public-house, in the presence of each and all these people, call her Mrs. Williams; in the Bartholomew fair week? A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How late did you stay at the prisoner's house in his absence? A. Perhaps till ten or eleven o'clock at night, for little odd things I might want. I am not a follower of Mr. Carlile. I believe the book I have been sworn on. I have been to the prisoner's house since he has forbidden me; in hisabsence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not forbid you the house, in consequence of the gross improprieties he had detected, between you and his wife? A. He said he was jealous of me, and his wife - I have known him about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you at Bartholomew fair with the prisoner's wife? A. Yes; the prisoner was not there - I was there about three hours the first day, and about four hours the second - I do not recollect being there more than two days; we went afterwards to a large gin-shop, at the top of Shoe-lane - I do not know the sign; the prisoner did not know we were going there; his wife told him that week, or the next week, when she went to see him, where he was in possession for a Sheriff's officer; she told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say he took it very much amiss? A. No; he was very satisfied.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you know whether you went more than twice? A. I cannot swear - I might have gone three times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you did go the third day, how long were you with her? A. I cannot say that I did go that day; if I knew the truth, I would tell you.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Mark's-place. On the 19th of November I heard a scuffle outside my door - I took a candle to see what was the matter, and saw Grover stabbing at Mr. Williams, and heard him say, "D-n you, I will kill you, I will, by G-d" - I then shut my door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear to be in a violent rage? A. He did not appear so to me; he did not seem in the least passion - I have known Grover and his wife four years; Williams has lived in the court about half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Until he came into the court, did they not live very comfortable together? A. I have heard his wife say, she could not live with him - I never quarrelled with Grover.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You understood they did not live very happily before he came? A. She told me they did not, I cannot say further; they have not lived worse together since, that I know of - I heard a great quarrelling between them, on the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that the wife told you they did not live well together? A. When she was in the court one day - I cannot say how long before; it was repeatedly, and before Bartholomew fair.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to take up the prisoner, who lived on the other side of the court; he was in an agitated state; he said Williams had destroyed his peace of mind, and his wife was taking away her clothes, and was going to live with Mr. Williams; he pulled out the drawers, and showed me that they were empty - I asked if he was aware he had wounded him in that dreadful manner; he said No, he was so agitated he was not aware that he had wounded him, if he had, he could have made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. What, you thought Williams' life in danger? A. Yes - I saw the wound; it appeared to me to be a dreadful one; the prisoner went with me without any resistance.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - Overwhelmed as I am at the deplorable situation in which I now stand before you, will, I am fearful, preclude the possibility of my revealing to you what I have suffered, both in body and mind, in consequence of the treatment I have experienced from the prosecutor, whose conduct towards me, I trust I shall be able to convince you, has been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060106"></xptr>most infamous. Gentlemen, I have invariably had the most ardent affection for my wife, to whom I have been married twelve years and upwards; we have always lived most happily together, until the month of September last, when the prosecutor, by some means or other, began to cultivate her acquaintance; of which I received, from time to time, the most decisive and undoubted proofs; when, of course, that happiness which I had so many years enjoyed in her society, I was deprived of, which affected my spirits to that degree, that I have at times been in a state of distraction; I have, on many occasions, remonstrated with the prosecutor, in consequence of the improper behaviour towards me - indeed, I even found him with my wife, in my own house, which confirmed the reports of my neighbours, as to the criminal intercourse which had been going on for three months between them, - and I feel assured there are several persons in Court who will hear testimony to what I have asserted, and, above all, satisfy you that I have always been considered an honest, sober, diligent, and humane man. I am aware, Gentlemen, I cautioned the prosecutor on one occasion, never to presume to make any overtures to my wife, as he had done before, for the purpose of inducing her to elope with him - otherwise, I held out threats of inflicting that punishment upon him which he richly deserved; but I most solemnly deny that I had any other object in view at the time than that of intimidating or deterring him from visiting my house, and thereby preventing him taking the advantage of my absence from home. At the time, or a few minutes before I was accused of having struck at the prosecutor, I had been taking some refreshment, and the knife I used on the occasion, I could not have been aware I had in my hand, owing to the aggravating conduct of the prosecutor, which so much irritated my feelings as to cause me to strike him, when I must have been in a state of irritation, which was caused by the prosecutor placing himself in my way, laughing and jeering at me, or I could not have committed such a henious offence as that for which I now stand at this bar to answer, and which, should the prosecutor's expectations be realized, will banish me from my native country, or consign me to an ignominious death. Gentlemen, I can only add, that, upon your taking all the previous circumstances to which I have adverted, into your serious consideration, coupled with the evidence which you will hear in support of it, I feel confident that you will say that the injury which the prosecutor has received was not premeditated.</p>

            . I am the wife of George Renshaw, a tailor. I was in the Red Lion, Shoe-lane, during Bartholomew fair; there was a woman there with the prosecutor - I do not know who she was - she went by the name of Mrs. Williams; I drank her health as such, and wished her health and happiness in this world; she appeared as his wife; he sat close by her.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Sheriff of Middlesex. I was at the execution in November last; at that time Grover was in prison; I saw the prosecutor there with Mrs. Grover; I knew them both before, and could not be mistaken in the person of either of them; my wife was with me.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness, and was at the last execution at the Old Bailey, in November, and saw the prosecutor there with Mrs. Grover; she was standing at Mr. Richardson's door, No. 15, and the prosecutor standing by her side; I could not be mistaken in her person.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you make any remark? A. Yes; I said what a shocking thing it was for her to look at such a thing; when she did not know how soon her husband might be in the same situation - I did not speak to her - my husband would not allow me.</p>

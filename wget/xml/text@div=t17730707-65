            . I was going to find out a public house in the Strand; it was between ten and eleven at night of the 15th of June; I was much intoxicated with liquor; I met with the prisoner; she took me to a house; I lay there all night. I found myself alone in the morning, and missed my money out of my breeches pocket; I found my breeches under my head where I had put them over night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss your bed-fellow?</p>
               <p>Blair. Immediately when I awaked.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go to sleep after you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Blair. I suppose directly.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the money?</p>
               <p>Blair. I had received eight guineas for another man; the other three guineas were my own, I had saved them to pay my rent; when I found myself robbed, I came down and interrogated the landlady; she used me very rough, and told me I might go about my business, and the man a-bed with her bid me go along, or said he would bundle me out of the house; the woman said she had seen but 1 s. 6 d. in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was drunk are you sure this was the woman?</p>
               <p>Blair. I am very sure.</p>

             - we afterwards went to the Red Lion, Fleet-lane; that was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - I saw the prisoner there with others; he forced his conversation on us, and prevailed on us to play at skittles; we had only gone there to have a pint of porter being thirsty - about a quarter to nine o'clock we were going away; Jackson, and a companion of the prisoner's, went to the bar to have something to drink for what they had lost - I had my hat and coat on, and was coming out of the ground - I had got part of the way out of the ground, going towards the bar to Jackson, and the prisoner came before me and struck me in the stomach with one hand, and with the other hand pulled out my watch, and broke a strong steel guard which was round my neck - he took the watch and ran through the bar and I after him as fast as I could - Jackson stood at the bar, and I said,"James, that man has ran away with my watch" - Jackson ran and pursued him, and took him - next morning at Guildhall, a man produced my watch - the blow the prisoner gave me pained me all the way home; I should have fallen down, but his pulling the watch, and the resistance of the chain, pulled me up again - it was a severe blow; he left part of the chain round my neck, the rest of it was found on the watch, and was produced the next day with it - this is my watch and chain, (looking at them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you were very much annoyed at being robbed at the skittle-ground? A. Yes; I never went to a skittle-ground before nor since - I went with the policeman to the house to-day to look for a man - I was not put out of the ground; I was told I should not play there, but I was not going to play- I went with my sister, and two, or three, or four policemen, to day - I do not know what I went for I am sure - I went on account of my sister going with the other men - she did not go to the skittle-ground, the others went there to have something to drink - I did not know it was the house in which I had been robbed, till I got there, because I had never been there before that night - I was not exactly sober when I was robbed; I had one glass of gin and a drop of beer; perhaps I drank part of a pot of beer; I did not measure it - I did not pay for above a pint of beer or so; Jackson had some money of me - I paid 4d. or 5d., not more, for what I had - I call myself an apprentice to a surgeon - I had not been in any other public-house that day - I drank nothing at my father's; I was not drunk in the skittle-ground; I was a little worse for what I had, but I did my work when I got home - I was a little sick in the skittle-ground; that was on account of eating some fruit; I had the fruit before I had the beer; I had it at my father's, in King's-place, Regent's-park.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you empty the contents of your stomach in the skittle-ground, and get the pot-boy to clear it up? A. Well, he was paid for it; Jackson, I believe, gave him two or three halfpence - it was not my intoxication caused me to be sick, it was eating the apples - I did not charge anybody with stealing my coat that night; I had pulled it off to play; I did not say it was stolen - Jackson might say it was stolen; he went to the landlady and got it; he said somebody had been playing a lark with it, or something - I paid for part of what was drank with my own hand; Jackson said he wanted some halfpence, and took 4d. out of my coat while it was off, to pay for what he had at the bar with the prisoner's companion - I did not speak to the landlady; I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050004"></xptr>state to her that I had lost my watch outside the street-door - I did not charge anybody with stealing my coat - my brother-in-law, when he found somebody had been playing a lark, said he thought my coat was taken out of a lark; he went to the landlady, and the coat was produced - he did not say the coat was stolen at all in my presence - I eat a few apples at my father's, nothing else, to make me sick; I had them about an hour before I got to the skittle-ground; I only played one game at skittles - nobody is here that saw me attacked, that I know of; there were about twelve persons in the ground.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it before or after the blow that you were sick? A. A long while before; I never went to any skittle-ground before, and not being used to drinking, made it take effect on me - I did not play with the prisoner at all; he sat next to me in the ground all the while - I did not show him my watch; I did not see him before I went to the public-house - I am seventeen years old.</p>
               <p>JAMES JACKSON. I live at No. 33, George-street, Blackfriars-road; I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. I was with him on the day in question, at the Red Lion, he was quite sober when he went there - I had no fruit; he had some apples in my presence; he bought them in the street, and eat them going along the street, not at his father's - he had one glass of gin at the Red Lion, and part of a pot of beer - five drank out of the pot of beer- he is not in the habit of taking spirits; I consider his sickness was on account of the fruit - he appeared rather affected by liquor, but knew what he was doing perfectly well - I went to the bar to have something to drink with the prisoner's companion; we had fallen into their company in the skittle-ground - during the time I went to the bar to have something to drink, the prisoner came running as hard as he could run, out of the house; he came through the bar as fast as he could run;

             was behind him, and cried out,"Stop him, stop him, he has taken my watch" - I ran after him as hard as I could run, and the prisoner ran as hard as he could till he got opposite Mr. Waithman's Obelisk; he ran right across Farringdon-street, and there I detained him till the constable of the night came up, and being certain that he was the man, as I had never lost sight of him, the constable of the night took him to the watch-house - he was searched, but no property found on him; being positive of him, I had him searched again; he was locked up, and we had to appear next morning at Guildhall, and there the watch was produced by a man named

             - the prosecutor complained of his stomach all the way home, and appeared suffering from pain.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you in the habit of frequenting these places? A. Never; we were thirsty, and went in to drink something, not intending to play at skittles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would not gin, beer, and apples, give him a pain in his stomach? A. He never had the pain in his stomach before - he was sick that night, but he did not have the pain in his stomach till after the watch was stolen - the five that drank out of the pot were all strangers, except the prosecutor; they all paid their share- I paid threepence that night; the prosecutor paid about fivepence; he was not in the habit of going to skittle-grounds - his master did not know he was going that night- I have not gone to the skittle-ground since; I did not go into the ground to-day, I went close to it - I was not refused to play there to-day; I did not stop a minute - I went there to have some beer it was the same place as the robbery took place - we were on our road going home from here; and it was the nearest place, when it was proposed to have some porter - neither I nor my brother made any demand to play at skittles there to-day- some of our company played, but I did not hear them refused - I got there just as they had finished playing; I did not stop to hear what the landlady said - I stated, that I did not stay a minute, but I went back afterwards; they were playing then - they were not prevented from playing - the man that found the watch was playing with somebody, I do not know who - none of my company were playing, except Frier; the prosecutor remained in the ground - I left him there when I went away; I was absent about five minutes, and remained there about five minutes, when I came back, the prosecutor was there all that time - I saw my brother that night sick; he was laying on the benches; he was not so drunk as not to know what he was doing; he did lay down on the bench - it was not through drunkenness; he laid down merely to rest himself, I suppose - it was not because he was sick - he did lay down and was sick.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn he laid down to rest - now you say he laid down and was sick? A. He was sick during the time he laid down; the pot-boy was obliged to come and clean up the filth he had vomited - I did not see the benches soiled and dirty by his vomiting; it was on the ground - I saw nothing else soiled; he vomited all on the ground - none of his garments were dirty - the pot-boy was called to clean up the filth; he was paid for it - my brother did not complain that his coat had been stolen, it was me - I could not see his coat any where, I searched all round the ground; I asked the landlady to come and see if she could find it - I did not complain that it was stolen - I did not say my brother had been robbed of his coat; I had drank very little indeed; I was as sober as I am now - I drank no liquor whatever, only porter; there was one pot among five of us - I paid threepence; one man had not got money, and I gave him a penny, which made the threepence I paid.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you go while, your brother, and the rest were in the skittle-ground to-day? A. I came up here to meet my sister; I did not see my brother kicking the pins about in the skittle-ground - I do not know William Bastard, to my knowledge; I did not state to any body, that some persons had stolen my brother's coat - I saw nothing happen to my brother myself; I and the prisoner only ran along Farringdon-street at the same time - six or seven persons did not rush out of the house, they all remained behind; my brother did not give the alarm till he came to me - no one ran from the house but the prisoner; the others did not leave the place.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. It was at the bar you first heard your brother had lost his watch? A. Yes; the skittle-ground is some distance from the bar - I could see the persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050005"></xptr>in the skittle-ground as I stood at the bar, if I had looked - the ground is straight forward, from the bar.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH FRIER. I live at No. 55, Brandon-street, Locks-fields, Walworth. On the morning of the 15th of August, I picked up this watch in Farringdon-street, about a quarter before five o'clock - there is a heap of granite just by the Obelisk, and I saw something laying on the ground; I got up, and looked, and it was a watch out of the case, which laid about a yard from it - the case and the inside of the watch were both bruised, and there was part of the guard, and seal, and chain, on it - any body could have thrown it there running by Mr. Waithman's Obelisk - it was about the middle of Farringdon-street; I heard of the robbery, and told the officer; he advised me to go to Guildhall, and I went and gave it up.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you at the skittle-ground that night? A. No.</p>

I produce the watch, seal, and guard; I received them at Guildhall, in presence of Frier - he gave it up at Guildhall; I heard in the morning a man had found a watch - I sent our patrols to find him out, which they did, and he brought the watch to Guildhall.</p>

            . I am going on for fifteen years of age - I have been a pot-boy thirteen months; I was pot-boy at the skittle-ground when the prosecutor says he was robbed of his watch - Mrs. Marks keeps the house; I saw the prosecutor on the night in question - he was very tipsy, laying on the seat, and he sicked all over the ground - I asked him what he would pay me for cleaning the place up; he said he would pay nothing - he was sober enough to speak; he was sitting down on the stool - I afterwards cleaned the place; I got nothing for cleaning it; there were about a dozen men there, playing at skittles - I saw the prosecutor's brother there; he complained that his brother had been robbed of his coat; he went and fetched mistress, for he said he would see the long and short about the coat, for he had lost it in the ground - I remember the prosecutor coming to the bar about his watch - he ran outside the door; he said he had lost his watch outside the door - I am sure he said it was lost outside the door; he said he lost it on the left hand side of the door, and that is the side going into the street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say he used the word"left side," what did he say? A. He ran out of the yard, and said he had lost the watch outside the door, he did not say he had lost it in the skittle-ground - he said he had lost it outside the door - the skittle-ground is not outside the door - there is a door from the house to the skittle-ground; the skittle-ground is outside that door; he said outside the door in the street in Fleet-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say in the street? A. He said, "outside the door;" he did not say on which side of the door he lost it; he told mistress he had lost it outside the door - I saw him run out into the street; three more besides him ran out of the house into the street, at the same time as he did - I was out of the yard myself, and saw them run down the street; three besides me ran out, I made the fourth - they were strangers to me; I never saw the prisoner in the house above two or three times; he is no acquaintance or friend of mine - I saw the prosecutor at mistress's house to-day; he came about twelve o'clock; four persons were with him; he was going to play at skittles, and mistress would not let him - I saw him play; mistress came and took the ball away from him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you been questioned on this matter before to-day? A. No, not by any body; this is the first time I have given any account of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you not been questioned by the prisoner's attorney? A. Yes; to day; and by my mistress.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the attorney say more to you than to tell the truth? A. No; I told him what I have stated - he wrote it down.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he ask if you had heard the prosecutor say he had lost his watch outside? A. Yes; I do not recollect what passed between us.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear the prosecutor cry "Stop him, he has taken my watch?" A. Yes; I saw three run out.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not you see the prisoner rush out of the house through the bar? A. Yes, he ran out first.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did two men run along with him? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did they run along with him? A. They ran along Farringdon-street with him - I saw Jackson running after the prisoner; the prisoner was running hard; I did not see him caught; I saw the man who drank with Jackson at the bar; he did not run out at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the third man that ran out? A. There was another went out, I do not know who he was - he ran up towards Ludgate-hill; he ran into Farringdon-street down to the corner of the lane - I think the third man kept up with the others - he got to the top of the street by Waithman's monument - I could see as far as that; it was about half-past eight o'clock - I ran to the Fleet, which is about six yards from the monument - I did not see the prisoner stopped - I never knew it till he was in the watch-house; the companion who was with him is a young man who goes with him, and deals at Powell's hardware shop - he was not the third man that ran out.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know the third man? A. No; I had not seen him before, and should not know him again; he was a stranger - he had played two or three games at skittles; he was short and stout, I think- I do not know how he was dressed.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where were you when the prisoner ran out?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050006"></xptr>A. Inside the door in the passage - he ran past me; I saw nothing in his hand - he ran very fast; Murrell called out immediately that he had lost his watch, and ran out.</p>
               <p>MRS. MARKS. I am landlady of the Red Lion. I remember the night the gentleman lost his watch - I saw both the gentlemen there that night - the prosecutor was so drunk that he could not stand; I saw him laying on the bench in the skittle-ground - I did not see him sick; I saw marks that somebody had been sick - he came to the bar and said he had lost his watch outside the door; he was standing outside the door; leaning against the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say he said he was standing outside? A. He said he was leaning against the back of the door, on the threshold of the door, and the man gave him a knock on his stomach, and took his watch out; and he hallooed out to his brother, to run after him, for he had stolen his watch - he said the man snatched his watch, and ran off.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he show you the way he was standing? A. Yes (leaning herself back.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he said he was standing at the door? A. Yes, I am quite sure - I have not witnesses to prove it, but there were two - he showed me the way he was standing, and he said I was standing here, and pointed to the door, and he was at that time standing at the street-door, but this was an hour after it took place; he said, "I was standing here," and he was at that time leaning against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he standing at the time he spoke to you? A. On the threshold of my bar-door in Fleet-lane; that is the street-door - he said he was standing at the door - I am sure he told me that he had been robbed at the street-door - this was an hour, or an hour and a half after the alleged robbery took place; he had at that time in a degree recovered his sobriety - he came to my house to-day; I saw him; he came with some policemen; and they had the ball, and they wanted to play at skittles; I said they were not to play; the boy said he was not playing; I went out, and he was playing; I took the ball from him, and told him I would throw it at his head, for I had had enough of him - I was not in court when the other witness was examined.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were you standing when the alarm was first given of the robbery? A. In the cellar below; I came up directly - I saw no one but the friend of the man who had lost his watch apparently; they were all gone when I came up - the prosecutor was standing in the lane so tipsy he could not run himself - he was standing in Fleet-lane - I have kept the house fourteen months - I had never seen the prisoner at my house - I don't know him now - when the prosecutor's brother-in-law complained that the coat was missing, he was laying on it on the bench (the man himself was) they came to me and said if it was not found we should hear more of it, and when I came in he was laying on it on the bench in the skittle-ground; I told them if they could not agree, they had better give up the ball.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when Murrell lost his watch, give us the exact words he used? A. He said, "I was standing against the door, the man came and gave me a punch on the stomach and snatched my watch, and I directly called to my brother, who was drinking, to run after him, for he had stolen my watch;" he said nothing more - he did not describe the person who had taken his watch.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of frequenting your house to play at skittles? A. No, I don't know him- I never saw him before to my knowledge; I did not see him on the night in question playing in the skittle-ground - the pursuit was directly on the alarm - I never saw the prosecutor before, and never saw him since till to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you threaten to throw the ball at his head to-day - why drive a customer away? A. Because Jackson came with a friend and said, if I did not make good the value of the watch, he would get my license stopped on licensing day - I did not know the man, nor encourage him to steal it - there was nobody left in the skittle-ground when I came up from the cellar - by the prosecutor's brother coming about the watch, I have had an opportunity of knowing him - I don't know the prisoner - a great many hawkers come to my house, as they come to Field-lane to purchase goods.</p>

            . Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of frequenting your mistress' house, have you seen him before playing at skittles two or three times? A. Not playing at skittles; he comes into the house of a morning and has half a pint of beer; I have seen him repeatedly there; I have not seen him there frequently before this occurrence of the watch - I have seen him several times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many times? A. About twice - he has been there about an hour and a half at a time - he did not go to the bar to get what he wanted at those times he was playing at skittles - I take them what they want into the skittle-ground - the door leads into the yard, and the yard to the skittle-ground; you walk through the house, through the bar, into the yard to the skittle-ground- the coat was found on the seat where the prosecutor was laying, under him; his brother-in-law complained of his brother losing his coat - I was in court part of the time that Mrs. Marks was examined - I did not see Jackson at the bar drinking - the young girl was serving in the bar when the cry of "Stop him" was given - my mistress was down in the cellar - I was not in the bar; I could see the young girl at the bar from the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen the prisoner about twice before in the house, how long before it occurred was it? A. About a week; I don't know how long it was before that, that I saw him the first time - I did not know where he lived, nor any of his friends.</p>

               <p>only country people who she was staying with—she had been in the habit of earning money, independently of him; she has been obliged to do so to try and get a living for herself—she was obliged to learn shoebinding and got a trifle in that way—I do apt know where they were in America—she used to write to my other sister, and one letter used to do for us both—the prisoner mentioned to me about the bank breaking, and said that he had lost some money—I know nothing about his being obliged to go to Chicago to work.</p>

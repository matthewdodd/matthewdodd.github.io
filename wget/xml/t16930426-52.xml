Martin denied the Fact, and said he knew nothing of it, behaving himself very morosely and turbulently in Court; for at his Arraignment he would not hold up his Hand till he was forced. Presly pretended that he was not in the Robbery, and called some Witnesses to prove that he was elsewhere; but Tovey positively swore that they were both there with him and Moor; so they were both found <rs id="t16930426-52-verdict245" type="verdictDescription">

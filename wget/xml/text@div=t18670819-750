                  </hi> I am the wife of Henry Edwards, and occupy part of No. 1, West Cottage, Millwall—the prisoner is my brother-in-law; we let him the kitchen—I gave him in custody for striking me on 11th June, between twelve and one at night, to a constable named Feary Wat<lb></lb>kinson, and he then struck me again as before with a chair which he had been sitting on outside—the constable spoke to him, and the prisoner struck him also with the chair—I shut the door and went up stairs; after a few minutes I heard a noise for a moment and then it was still some time, and I came down stairs and saw Watkinson bleeding from more than one wound on his head, and the door, which I had closed, broken open—he was just inside the door—I sent for the police doctor.</p>

                  </hi> I am single, and live at 1, West Cottages, Millwall, in the same house as the last witness—on 11 th June I went to bed about 11.30—I had been up stairs about three-quarters of an hour when Edwards called me down to fetch a policeman—when I got down I saw the prisoner at the door, calling her awful words—there were two or three chairs outside—I went for a policeman and returned with Watkin<lb></lb>son—the prisoner was then sitting outside, and Amelia Edwards was inside the door, on the stairs—she said to the policeman, "I will give this man in charge for insulting me"—the prisoner said, "Give me in charge,</p>

               <p>you b----wh----!" and took up a chair and hit her across the head—the policeman said, "If you ill-use that woman I must interfere with you, governor"—he took no more notice, and she went up stairs—the prisoner was putting the chairs inside the door, and he took up one and hit Wat<lb></lb>kinson across the head—the prisoner's wife was outside, hallooing, "Oh! you will kill my husband! "—they were then struggling outside—at that time Amelia Edwards had gone up stairs; the door was open, the prisoner went into the house, and Watkinson went in after him—the prisoner took up this piece of a fender (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>., which laid by the side of the door, and struck Watkinson three or four blows across the head—he fell, and bled from his head—the prisoner then took his staff away from him and hit him with that while he was lying down, and he put up his arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the business of Thomas John and Joseph Smith, wholesale stationers, 83, Queen Street, City—Crosby has been in their service about two years as light porter and warehouseman—his duties were up stairs on the second floor, in the stock room, where the leather is kept—Krickeldorf has worked for the firm about twelve months out of doors—among other things he made purses and pocket-books—previous to 22nd April the practice was when he received an order he told me what quantity of leather he would require, and if I thought he might have it, I should instruct Crosby to give it him; Crosby would write out an order to the clerk in a book—in consequence of something after 21st April I made more stringent rules—I know those rules were acted upon by Crosby on the morning of 22nd, because he signed tickets for leather he had given out on two different occasions—tins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the tickets—it has my signature and Mr. Astins' to it; both those signatures would be re<lb></lb>quired before the leather was delivered—it would be brought from the second floor, where Crosby was, to the receiving room on the ground-floor, where Astins would deliver it to the workmen—Astins would sign the ticket, bring it to me for signature, and then file it; the file was kept in the receiving room—on 23rd April, about 11 o'clock, I saw Krickeldorf on the ground floor; he brought me a sample purse—I told him I would take three dozen of them, but it would be necessary for him to get better ivory tablets—one skin would have been plenty for those if of one colour; if of two colours, two skins; two half-skins would do, but we do not generally give out half-skins—I did not see Crosby at that time—about 215 that day, I went into the passage that leads to the lobby, and there ob<lb></lb>served Crosby and Krickeldorf in conversation—the moment Crosby saw me, he went up stairs into his room, and Krickeldorf descended with a brown paper parcel in his hand—I asked him to go up stairs to the first floor, where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186805040013"></xptr>
               <p>I was in the habit of receiving him—I noticed that he laid the parcel down in the lobby by the side of the door—while he went up stain I called to Astins, made a communication to him, and followed Krickeldorf up stairs—I kept him in conversation till Astins came up—I then went down and made a communication to Mr. Smith, who I found with the parcel I had seen Krickeldorf with—it was then open, and contained seven skins of leather—I returned to Krickeldorf, and made an excuse to detain him, and then went down again, and found Mr. Smith there with Crosby—Mr. Smith said to Crosby, "Have you given that leather out to anyone?"—he said he had given it to Krickeldorf—Mr. Smith asked him where was his authority for doing so; he said he had written a ticket out, and it was up stairs on the file—I then left Crosby and went up to Krickeldorf—I said to him, "I have given you an order for three dozen purses, you will require some more leather, I suppose?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How much do you want?"—he said, "Two skins"—I said, "Wait a minute then," and I returned down stairs and spoke to Mr. Smith—I then went to Crosby, and the ticket was then lying down stairs—Mr. Smith said, "This is not signed"—I said, "No"—Crosby was there—I did not stop to hear what he said, but went up stairs to Krickeldorf—I said to him, "What are you doing with those skins you had in the parcel down stairs that I saw in your hand?"—he said, "I had not it"—I said, "I saw you with a brown paper parcel in your hand, carrying it down stairs"—his answer was, "No, never"—I repeated it again more emphatically, but he still denied it—he was brought down stairs, in the presence of Mr. Smith and Crosby, and Mr. Smith said to crosby, "Did you give Krickeldorf that parcel of leather?"—he said, "Yes"—I then said to Krickeldorf, "Did Crosby give you that leather?"—he said, "No; he did not"—a policeman was then sent for, and they were given into custody—Crosby had no authority to get leather except through Astins—the piece of paper afterwards found on the file up stairs was not written by my authority, nor was I aware of it; the file up stairs had become use<lb></lb>less—Krickeldorf had no order from us at that time, that I am aware of (<hi rend="italic">leather produced</hi>)—Russia leather would be required for the purses, but not calf—here are five skins of Russia and two of calf—they are worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the parcel Krickeldorf had was not rolled as it should be, but packed square, which made me notice it—it would deteriorate the value of the leathers—no one who understood leather would do it so.</p>

               <p>that I saw him at 2.15—I am not in the habit of going down into the lobby at that time—he knew that my dinner hour was between 2 and 3—he was in the habit of making all sorts of purses for us—calf is used in some purses—all this leather would be used for some sort of purse or other—if he had two or three skins of leather out I used to allow it to go on till he executed the order—the leather was never more than the price of the purses—he would sometimes bring them in a dozen or two at a time, and we should settle when the order was completed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Smith—on 22nd April a new regulation was made as to delivering out materials, and I told Crosby that when he had any leather out he would have to give it to me first, and not to deliver it to the person himself—the following morning two skins of leather were delivered out and he gave me the leather in—that produced is one of the memorandums referring to it—I took it first to Mr. Downs, and he signed it, and then I put my initials to it and put it on the file in the receiving room, where the materials were delivered out—Crosby did not come to me on the 23rd April, with reference to any leather for Krickeldorf—I did not know of his taking these seven skins—I saw Krickeldorf at 11 o'clock that morning, in the lobby on the ground floor—I did not see Crosby there—about 2.15 or 2.20 I saw Krickeldorf in the lobby—I did not see anything with him—I afterwards received a communication from Downs, and found a brown paper parcel in the corner behind the door in the lobby—I brought it inside and tore off a corner to see whether it was leather—I saw that it was, and I went up stairs and communicated to Mr. Downs—the parcel was afterwards opened in Mr. Smith's presence—this is it—I know nothing of the file up stairs, or of the ticket on it—Crosby did not show me this ticket—I did not see it before it was brought down.</p>

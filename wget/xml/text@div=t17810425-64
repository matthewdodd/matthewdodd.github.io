I went from public-house to public-house in pursuit, and I found the prisoner at the Lamb and Flag, the corner of James-street, Oxford-road; when we charged him with stealing the half guinea. A friend of mine, who was there, went to take him, and he beat him in a violent manner, and knocked him down; another person came up, and he was secured.</p>

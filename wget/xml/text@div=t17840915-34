               <p>The prisoner offered a horse for sale, I told him I knew a man that wanted such a horse as that, I went with him three miles, and the horse was too little for that Gentleman, the boy said he would sell him for any money he could get for him; he said three guineas, I told him I would have him; coming back I asked him how he came by the horse, he said his master bought it for him, that it was wages he had saved, I told him I would not buy it, without he would go with me to his master, he refused that, I suspected him, and took him into custody, he told us coming along, it was Mr. Tarlin's horse, and that he lived with Mr. Tarlin, and had stolen it from him.</p>
               <p>Court. What means did you use to prevail upon him? - I told him coming along that in case he would tell the truth, whether he had stole it or not, that we should not take him before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the horse you met him upon was Mr. Tarlin's? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Quite sure of it? - Yes, he had been with Mr. Tarlin a fortnight, Mr. Tarlin lives at Sidcombe, in Kent.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the horse being afterwards stopped at Hammersmith? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>When did you get the horse? - We had the horse home on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Where did you get it from? - We had it from Litchfield-street.</p>

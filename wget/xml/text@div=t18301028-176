            . I am a journeyman bricklayer, and was in the Kent-road - I saw Mr. Wheatley's stage coach coming to town, and the prisoner was driving Mr. Driver's Blackbeath coach, which I think was about forty yards behind the other - they were both coming to town; I did not see the accident happen; but I saw the deceased on the ground, and took him up - I saw a horse and chaise; the coaches had then both pulled up - the deceased was taken to the Five Bells; the chaise was going to town, and was about seven feet from the side of the road, and it was about thirteen feet where I picked up the deceased - the stage the prisoner drove had passed the chaise; the deceased was thrown out on the right-hand side - both the coaches had pulled up, and the cad behind the prisoner's coach stopped the horse of the chaise; that horse did not fall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you first stated that you thought it was ten feet? A. Yes, and then I measured it; I found the inside-wheel of the gig had been seven feet from the side, and the outside eleven or twelve - the prisoner seemed very sorry, and rendered every assistance in his power; I know him by seeing him on the road - he is a very careful driver; every one who knew him gave him a most excellent character.</p>

            . I am in no profession. I was walking with my wife in the Kent-road, and observed two coaches driving towards London; the gig, which turned out to be Mr. Minshull's, was a-head when I first saw it - it seemed to be driving steadily, but being a-head of them it was difficult to tell at what rate it was driving; the coaches were not driving at an unusual pace, certainly not at a pace at which the coachman could not have the command of the houses- the first coach passed on the right side- the next coach then came up, and it appeared that the horses and the fore part of the coach passed the gig without touching, but the hind part in some way, caught the gig - the gig might have been from seven to ten feet from the road, and the middle of the road was gravelled, which would have been an inducement to the coaches to keep near the pain; I have always kept horses, and been used to driving - it appeared to me that a person not used to driving might have been intimidated, and pulled his rein off, which would turn his hind-wheel towards the coach; it appeared to me to be accidental - the moment it happened the prisoner pulled up, seemed very sorry, and rendered every assistance in his power; he had not been going at an outrageous pace, but seemed to be avoiding the gravel, as every coachman would do - I ran up, and Mr. Miller had picked the deceased up; I desired him to take him to the Bells, where he was dressed, and then sent home; the prisoner was one of the most steady and respectable coachman on the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not found that old horses have a habit of boreing to one side? A. Yes, it is the habit of some old horses - I do believe that this was a pure accident; there appeared to me to be no improper conduct.</p>

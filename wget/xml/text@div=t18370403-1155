                  </hi>. I live in Kingsland-road, Shoreditch. I came by the Pimlico omnibus, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 2nd of March, from Ebury-street to the Green-park, Piccadilly, by myself—a gentle man then got in, but he did not sit by me—the two prisoners afterwards sot in. and they sat directly opposite me—I sat in the centre, and no one sat</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030242"></xptr>
               <p>by me—the female prisoner then came from the opposite side, and placed herself close to me on my right side—after that I felt a pull at my pocket—I had 4 shillings and 1 sixpence in a steel purse, and fourpence loose in my pocket—before the prisoners got in, I put my hand into my pocket, with my pocket-handkerchief, and all was then safe in my pocket—a gentle man got out of the omnibus before I did, who sat as near to the door as he could, on my left-hand side—the female prisoner was the only person who sat on my right the whole time—the male prisoner got out first, and the female prisoner next—there was no other female—I cannot say when they got out—I went to the Flower Pot, in Bishopsgate-street—I missed my money before I got there, I think in the Strand—ray cloak and four petticoats were all cut through, and my pocket, and my purse was gone—this must have been done between Piccadilly and the Strand—a gentleman who got in searched in the straw, and picked up a pair of spectacles and a knife—this was one of the omnibuses that has an arm in it—I am certain the prisoners are the persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of this omnibus. I recollect the prosecutrix getting in at bury-street—I remember a male and female getting in at the Green-park—I never saw the male prisoner, to my knowledge, before—it was a dark night, and rained at the time they got in—his appearance was much like the male prisoner's, but I could not swear to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The first person was the old lady in Ebury-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and then a gentleman got in in Eaton-street—a lady and gen tleman then got in, and another gentleman afterwards; were there then three gentlemen and two ladies; that was all the passengers I had—the prosecutrix did not go off with one of the gentlemen—I did not see them get out together—the gentleman got out at the Old Jewry—they did not get out and walk away together.</p>

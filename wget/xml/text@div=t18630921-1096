I did reside at 3, Vere-street, Clare-market, but have left my situation, and am now at home—on the evening of 22d August, between 6 and 7, I was in Lincoln's-inn-fields—I saw the prisoner there, on the left hand side, by the railing, under the trees—she had got four little children—she gave the little girl, Lavinia Baker, a penny, and was taking them away—</p>

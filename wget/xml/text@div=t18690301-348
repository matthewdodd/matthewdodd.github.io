                  </hi>. I occupy the first floor of No. 11, Barking Church Yard, in the parish of All Hallows, Barking—on 23rd February, about 12.30, I heard a noise, got out of bed, and went on to the landing, and saw the prisoner rush from the side door of Mr. Miller's shop, a working jeweller—the side door of his shop leads to the passage—I did not see him more than a second, but that was quite sufficient for me to recognize him—I said, "Who is there?"—the answer was, "All right"—he got outside, and slammed the street door, which has a spring lock, and I never knew it to be left open—I am sure it was closed—I was detained a little time before I could get out, on account of the second lock, which was not usually in action, being locked, the string of it being out—there was an opportunity of cutting that string previous to my Doming down—I followed the prisoner, and gave him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 24). On 23rd February, about 12.50, I was on duty in Great Tower Street, and as I passed Barking Church Yard, I heard a door shut very sharply, and saw the prisoner run down the church yard in the direction of Great Tower Street, into which there are fourteen steps—ho fell down three or four steps into the carriage way—I went to him and asked him what was the matter—he said, "Nothing, it is all night"—I said, "Well, you had better go back with me and see"—I was taking him back, and met Norton in the church yard, calling but, "Stop him"—I said, "He is already stopped," and he identified him—I took him to the station, and then examined the premises, and found a glass bottle with a candle in it, which was nearly burnt out, but was not then alight, some matches, and a piece of paper partially burnt—I examined the bacement, and found some empty boxes and bottles had been disturbed—the door was secured by a very slight padlock—the prisoner said that he had been into the Czar's Head, and treated a woman to a pint of beer, and given her 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to come into Barking Church Yard with him; that he was disturbed, and in pulling her into a doorway he fell into the shop; but that is impossible, because the inspector came one way, and I the other, and if there had been any woman there we must have seen her.</p>

In the beginning of the last year, in the month of February, we purchased the stock in trade of a Mr. Chandler; the prisoner had been in the service of Mr. Chandler; we took him into our service upon having purchased that stock; he remained in our service in the manufactory till the the 5th of January in the present year; he seldom left the manufactory before nine, the other men generally went about eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time he was in your service, did you miss any articles? - A. Yes; we took stock at Christmas, and found a very great decrease, which we could not account for by any means.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages did you pay the prisoner? - A. We paid him by the piece; he was paid up to October upon an average about twenty-nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information received by you, did you go with a search-warrant to any house in Houndsditch? - A. I did, on the 27th of February, to the house of the prisoner, No. 80, a whip-maker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a stock of whips manufactured and unmanufactured, in the usual course of business? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of the whole of that stock? - A. I did not make any calculation, but I think the stock would amount to about 300l. I think rather more than less.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the stock to have been all manufactured, how long would it have taken one man? - A. Many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the stock in that shop? - A. I did; I saw the prisoner, and I asked him how he came by the goods; one article of catgut, he said, he had out of Herefordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at the stock, did you recognize any of the articles as having been your property? - A. Instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular in your manufactory of whips, which enables you to speak to them? - A. Yes, there have been more than one invention of my own applied to these goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him as to any particular articles? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and the constable take possession of any part of the stock? - A. Yes; and while we were doing that, he endeavoured to escape; he did succeed so far as to open the door out of the shop into the passage, and from that passage into the street, and he was brought back by one of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the goods here, which you and the officer took possession of? - A. Yes; they had been in the custody of the officers.</p>
               <p>- CHURCH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. - (Produces the property).</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030036"></xptr>Q. Are those the goods which you brought from the house of the prisoner? - A. Yes, they have been in my custody ever since; I have the keys of the boxes in my pocket. (Opens them).</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Griffiths). First look at the two parcels marked No. 1? I have examined them very minutely; I have spent many hours on different days in the examination of them, and I am perfectly sure they were manufactured in our manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you explain the means of your knowledge to persons who are not in the trade? - A. It is very difficult to do that. Some years ago I invented a method of braiding which was different to what had been practised before, and I have never heard that any other manufacturer does it in the same way.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many years ago did you invent that? - A. Six or seven I should think, I cannot say exactly; I know these whips partly by that difference, and partly by the general appearance of the goods. With regard to these handles, the raised part is occasioned by a piece of packthread being would round the whip handle, which was usually done by hand, but as these handles became more used, this method of making these handles was found to be very tedious, and as there was no particular guide to lay the packthread even, they were frequently raised very uneven, opener in some parts than in others; this induced me to endeavour to invent a method that should expedite this work, and to do it more even and better; I did invent another method of making these handles, and I am perfectly satisfied that these handles are done by means of a machine which I invented.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as far as your knowledge of the trade goes, is there any body else in possession of such a machine? - A. One person has a similar machine, a person who did live with me at the time I invented this machine, and who has lately begun business. These tools (producing one), are a principal part of the machine which I invented; by means of these screw tools, the handles are raised with exactly the same number of rounds in any given length as there are in these tools; for small whips these tools are made use of. (Produces another).</p>
               <p>Q. Do these whips answer to those tools? - A. Most exactly; in the smallest of these tools there are forty-six rounds, I think, in five inches.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But this, you know, is made like the worm of a screw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the other part which you work in this? - A. It is a machine which cannot be used without being fixed, I wish I could have brought it into Court; there are upwards of sixty handles, all of which tally most minutely with these screws.</p>
               <p>Q. These tools you brought from your own house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call that machine? - A. A raising engine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the tools you have now produced made in your shop? - A. No; they were made by my direction, by a man who is a witness here, he is a whip-hook maker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Be so good as open the parcel marked No. 1, is there any thing among them by which you can speak to their having been your's? - A. I have no doubt of their having been made at our manufactory; I can only speak from the general appearance of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now be so good as look at the parcel No. 2? - A. These goods I have examined very minutely, and I am persuaded they were all partly made at our manufactory, they have been finished since; this whip, for instance, was made at our manufactory, but not the handle or the buttons; a great many of this parcel were not finished at our manufactory. This whip I know from a very particular circumstance, the braiding is begun at this end contrary to the usual practice; some time ago, a thought struck me that it might answer the purpose to begin at the large end, the button is worked on after it is finished. By my directions this whip was braided, and one or two more upon that plan; I assisted in braiding the whip, and therefore have not the smallest doubt of the whip being the same; this was the only one of this sort that I had made in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of them in the same state in which they came out of your manufactory? - A. Yes, several of them, (points them out); we never sell whips of this sort without a nail drove in the end of the handle, or very seldom.</p>
               <p>Q. How many may you have sold without nails? - A. I cannot say; not a very great number; here are seven unbraided whips which were made at our manufactory, they are our property, I know them by the general appearance, but more particularly by my own hand-writing upon them; the initials of the man's name that made them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never sell them in that state? - A. Never; I make a rule, on the men bringing their work into the accompting-house, of a Saturday night, to mark one of each parcel with the workman's initials.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you call this? - A. An unbraided jockey whip.</p>
               <p>Q. If I was to ask for a jockey whip, you would not sell me this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If I was to ask you for an unbraided whip you would? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. But still it is a whip though it is unbraided? - A. Certainly it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the five bobbins? - A. One of them has my own hand-writing upon it, the words are "large best sheep," which signifies the gut;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030037"></xptr>here is a piece of whip-cord with my mark upon it; the other bobbins were made for a spindle that I have in Court. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Without going through the whole, do you verily believe that all the rest of the whips were made at your manufactory? - A. I verily do believe them to be so; a great many of them I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that they have been stolen from your shop? - A. I cannot doubt that, because we never sell them in the state that many of these are in.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of all the property produced - it is laid in the indictment at ninety-five pounds eighteen shillings? - A. I should think it is thereabout, but I have not estimated it; here is a whip, which, if it is cut, you will find a groove to correspond exactly with a tool that I have in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was not made with that tool, would it be likely to correspond? - A. Not at all likely, (cuts the handle); it does fit most minutely.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This man worked by the piece, and not by the day? - A. Not by the day, that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. It occurs to me, that the man who works by the piece is likely to get more money by working later than otherwise? - A. Yes; those who work the latest generally earn the most.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to any other person, you would have said, such a man was an industrious and a laudable man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a young man, just set up in business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His stock, you say, amounted to about three hundred pounds? - A. I believe it would amount to that, at a fair valuation.</p>
               <p>Q. Ninety-five pounds is about the value of what is brought into Court? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it occur to you to strip his whole shop by this search-warrant? - A. Certainly we did.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the bare walls? - A. Certainly we did not bring them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of that been returned since? - A. Not that I know of; they were not withheld by my order.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, as to those goods that you have not brought into Court he is deprived of the use of them for the benefit of his relations? - A. They are supposed to be stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any one of them the subject of an indictment? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps this man may have made application for business to some of your customers? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before you took out the search-warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This stock of his being worth three hundred pounds, perhaps it occurred to you, when you first set up business, to furnish your stock, part with credit, and part by the assistance of friends and relations? - A. Yes, as all tradesmen do.</p>
               <p>Q. A man does not furnish his stock out of the money in his pocket only, but he gets credit and assistance from his relations? - A. I have every reason to believe he had no credit. Upon searching, we found some bills of parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. What you seized all his books and papers did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And never sent them back again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find the vouchers for stock in the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever return them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suppose them to be stole? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is soft sugar an article made use of in the whip trade? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The soft sugar belonging to this man was taken, was it not, in this general sweep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He kept house there, did he not? - A. No; he only rented the shop, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the sugar, in the shop? - A. In the shop or the parlour; the shop is divided, and seems to have been part of it used as a parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. These were made in your manufactory? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never worked in your manufactory? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then would it not be likely that he should follow your method? - A. Not the braiding, he could not to answer his purpose, unless it was to a very large extent; he could imitate our method of manufacture, certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. And yet you have seized these things, a great many of them, with no other evidence than their general appearance? - A. Yes; most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, if he chose it, he might manufacture a vast number of hundreds of the same general appearance, with hundreds that are to be found in your shop? - A. If he had men to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, about the means; he had money, had he not? - A. That appears by the receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he had the means, not only of working himself, but getting other men? - A. If he could get men, but men are very scarce in our business.</p>
               <p>Q. There is one bobbin that has got your mark upon it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts do you think is the value of that bobbin? - A. I cannot recollect; it is a very small price.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it never happened, in your manufactory, that a man who worked extra work at home, might have taken a bobbin, and forgot to return it, and yet maintain a very good character? - A. I cannot say, it might.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030038"></xptr>Q. Do not you know that he did work extra hours at his own lodgins, having an expectation of getting into business? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the fact that he did work at home? - A. I apprehend he did, because many of these whips have been finished since he left our service.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it would not be very extraordinary that he should borrow a bobbin for the sake of carrying on that work? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not a great many other workmen in your employ that worked at home? - A. We employ some that work entirely at home; but since the prisoner came to our house the work has never been delivered out.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not your man, Callow, work at home at this moment? - A. Yes; but that is another branch of the business, making whips in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that there is no person in the trade who works that raised work? - A. All persons who make whips, I suppose, raise some.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, they have not raised work as well as you have? - A. No; they have of course.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand that you have employed many hours, amounting to some days, in examining these articles? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have spoke to three or four? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that has been the result of many hours examination of his whole stock? - A. Yes; and I am equally as sure of the rest of the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not the power of making all these from what he learned at your house? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you are certain that they are all your's? - A. No doubt he might have made any pattern that he chose.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it is not an agreeable thing for you to have this invention of your's go abroad? - A. Certainly we do not wish to lose the merits of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It might have roused a little resentment perhaps? - A. I declare I have no resentment whatever towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had learned that he had applied to some of your customers? - A. Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us of any time whatever, when you lost a bundle of whips? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that those finished whips have not been sold by you? - A. The articles, No. 1, I cannot swear that they have not been sold; but the articles, No. 2. I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not now a great many goods which were made by his hands? - A. He makes only a part; the braiding is a distinct branch from any of the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. And he is capable of doing that, is he not? - A. If he has machines he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say he might braid these provided he had materials for the purpose? - A. Yes; there are several machines necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they large and expensive? - A. They are both.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any such machines in his possession? - A. Nothing like it; and there is no one man who makes a whip complete.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. What was the prisoner's branch? - A. Generally in the button part and finishing, and partly making them in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the braiding is not the branch in which he was employed? - A. Certainly not; he had no business even in the shop where the braiding was done; he might understand the general principle of it, but not likely to carry it into practice.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men do you employ upon your premises? - A. I believe the number is one hundred and thirty, including men, women, and boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Your own hands do not make any of the whips? - A. No, I only give out the materials.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men do you employ not upon the premises? - A. I suppose about six or eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men do you employ about the braiding part? - A. We have thirteen machines.</p>
               <p>Q. Any man that knows any thing of the business may use the machine, I suppose? - A. It would take some little time; the strings are frequently knocked out of place, it will want putting to rights frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. The men who are used to do it by hand would be able to do it with the machine without serving a seven years apprenticeship? - A. Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. What part is done by the machine? - A. The raised handles, and the braiding.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man who works by the piece chuses to amuse himself by learning any other part of your business he may do it? - A. Yes; at home, I should rather he was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. It could not make any difference to you if he idled a whole day, you would not pay him a farthing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this an ingenious man while he was with you? - A. He was a very industrious man, and very sober; but I never thought him ingenious, because his work was not done quite so well as it ought to be.</p>
               <p> Q. Now, as to these two whips, do you know any thing of them but by these being no nail in the end of the handle? - A. Yes; one of them, by the braiding being begun at the wrong end.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you assist in the making of it? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to your work? - A. No, I cannot.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030039"></xptr>Q. Cannot your men swear to their own work? - A. Not always.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you mean to say that this man never worked at home? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. And if he had carried this bobbin home with him, it would not have been any great harm, I suppose? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am servant to Messrs. Griffiths, I have been in their employ upwards of twenty-two years: I went to the prisoner's shop on Monday the 25th of February, by my masters orders; I passed by the shop, and saw some whips that I was convinced were manufactured at my master's; I returned again, and looked more stedfastly than before; the prisoner then nodded to me, and I went in; I attempted to reach a whip, and he gave me another, such a one as I never saw in our manufactory, it was bound round with whalebone; he said, it was his brother's buttoning; I took up a whip that laid in the window; and he said, you have come to take away my patterns; I told him I did not want to do that, because I had left off finishing; then I laid the whip down, and he asked me to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those whips, are you able to state that they are manufactured at your master's shop? - A. I examined them in Mr. Church's custody, and I believe the whole of them to be my master's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Church.) Q. These goods, that have been shewn to the last witness, Stanwell, were brought from the prisoner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to execute a search-warrant? - A. Yes, on the 1st of March; we found a great deal of property there belonging to Mr. Griffiths; there was a door leading into the passage, which I tried to open several times, and could not; while I was there, the prisoner rattled at the door, and some person on the other side opened it, and the prisoner attempted to escape; I and my brother officer pursued him, and brought him back again, he had got about fifteen or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - A. He said he was going for his brother.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to take this man's books, you could not suppose he had stole them? - A. We were obliged to shut the shop up; there was nobody belonging to him that we could find.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, has not the man's brother applied to you, and have you not refused to let him see those things, without an order from Mr. Griffiths? - A. I do not know his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know a man applied to you to inspect this property, and you refused? - A. Yes, without an order from Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Q. The Lord-Mayor did not tell you not to let any body see them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did he say he was his brother? - A. No; a man came and asked if he could see the property; I said, I could not suffer him to see them without an order from Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The Lord-Mayor had given you no such order? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the person that applied to you? - A. I cannot say; I did not take particular notice of the gentleman.</p>

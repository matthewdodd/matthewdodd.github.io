             sworn. - I live at No. 8, Little Wild-street: I had been to the Pantheon-chapel; I was walking home by the side of my own daughter, who is one of the charity children belonging to the Free-school; they had been singing an Anthem over the grave of the servant girl of the mistress of the school, that was deceased; we had crossed Gray's Inn-lane, and was coming into Little James-street; I saw the prisoner at the bar at the head of the mourners; I saw him square with his arms up against the mourners, and when he came to the children, he behaved in a very indecent manner, especially to the girls, making use of infamous language, and shoving them off the pavement; upon which I addressed him in the following words:</p>
               <p>"My friend, do not insult the children, let them pass on;" he then made ready to strike me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any offer to strike him? - A. No; I kept off the first blow with an old umbrella I had in my hand; as soon as I dropped my hand by my side, I received a blow from him on the right side of the face, which knocked me from the pavement into the middle of the coach road, but I did not fall to the ground; when I recovered myself, I went to the opposite side of the street, and turning round, I saw Mr. Webb and Mr. Thorn with the prisoner; they seemed as if they were preventing him from following me; I went over, and said it was a pity that I could not pass the street without being insulted by him, or any other person; Mr. Webb and Mr. Thorn said there was a constable just by, and it was a pity but such a man was taken up; upon which, Mr. Hooker asked if there was any man to give charge of him, and I gave charge of him; Mr. Hooker took his staff out of his pocket, and took hold of him; then we proceeded to take him on to St. Andrew's watch-house; Mr. Hooker finding him very strong, and more than he could manage, called on Mr. Dubbledey to assist, and he took hold of him; the prisoner used every effort he could to get away; we had to drag and carry him all the way; in the course of going along, some person sung out, which I judged to be Mr. Hooker, he has got a knife, take care of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after Dubbledey had hold of him? - A. After.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dubbledey do any more than lay hold of him? - A. I did not see that he did; in a little while after Mr. Hooker had called out, he threw the knife from him, and Mr. Webb picked it up; when we got to the top of Bedford-row, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120042"></xptr>Dubbledey's hand running down with blood, and from there we took him to the watch-house in Eagle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it? - A. It was about half past four, it was good light; I could see him perfectly well, or any one else.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dubbledey.) You mentioned being in Theobald's-road; what happened when you were there? - A. I saw the prisoner strike

             with his fist, and knocked him off the pavement; I saw him a long time before cutting capers with Mr. Hooker, and likewise with all the children.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the children? - A. He used very impudent language, he put himself in different postures.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he meddle with their persons at all? - A. Only pushing them about.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he struck Harris, had Harris done any thing at all to him? - A. No further than saying, my friend, let the children alone; Mr. Hooker was the undertaker of the funeral; he left his company, and came to the children; seeing one was one way, and the others another,

             asked whether there was any constable nigh; Mr. Webb and Mr. Thorn said it was a pity such a rascal should go on so; Hooker said he was a constable; he laid hold of the prisoner, and called me to assist; I laid hold of him, and we dragged him along; he was very resolute, and strove to get away from us, and at Theobald's-road he 
               <persName id="t18040912-35-person441">drew</persName>
             a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him draw the knife? - A. No; the constable sung out he had got a knife, going across John-street; I looked round, and saw my hand running with blood; I looked at Mr. Hooker's coat, and saw it cut about a foot; Mr. Webb looked out for the knife, and found it; we dragged him to the watch-house, and there I washed my hand with some water; it was cut deep through the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have been done by a scratch? - A. No, it was done by a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. How many wounds had you on your two fore-fingers? - A. One on each, on the outside of my fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. What length might the wound be? - A. About three quarters of an inch long, each of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What depth? - A. Near the bone, as near as could be; they were both cut at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply for any assistance to have your wound cured? - A. I dressed it myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the examination before the Magistrate, he said he never felt nor saw me cut him; it is not possible that a man having a cut near the bone, should not feel it.</p>
               <p>Dubbledey. In the heat of blood I was in, I did not feel it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I cannot say whether I did it or not, I was not sensible at the time.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dubbledey.) Was he sober or drunk? - He was sober enough to fling away the knife, after the person sung out, he has got a knife.</p>

             interfered, by desiring him to let the children alone; the prisoner then struck him, and the second time I interfered, and said, strike him no more; I thought his conduct deserved some care; I said, was there any constable near, it was a pity but he had charge of him; the undertaker of the funeral said he was a constable, and would take charge if any body would give it; the charge was given by

            ; they had not conveyed the prisoner a great distance, before I heard the people say he had got a knife, but no sooner had I got there, than he had thrown the knife away; as I was going up to the prisoner something struck my eye, I was nigh the spot, I stooped, and picked up the knife.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the wound that Dubbledey received? - A. Yes; the depth of the wound I will not pretend to say, they were sufficient marks of cuts; he was wounded in more than two places.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been to sea in the Zealand; I had an accident of falling between decks, and fractured my scull; I have been home more than two months; I got drinking at the Blue Lion, in Gray's Inn-lane; I was discharged on account of the fracture; when I used to drink, it got into my head, it used to make me intirely out of my senses; whether I did cut or not, I cannot say; I cannot see what intent I could have in doing it.</p>

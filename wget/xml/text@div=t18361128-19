                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Tower-ward. On the after<lb></lb>noon of the 9th of November, I was in King-street, near Guildhall—I saw the prisoner with another—they went from Guildhall towards Cheap-side, following two gentlemen—they crossed from the top of King-street to go up Cheapside—there was a very great crowd there—Mr. Barbour had got in among the crowd—they followed him close up—the prisoner got in amongst the crowd close to Mr. Barbour, he got the handkerchief out of his pocket, and was putting it behind him, as if to give it to some<lb></lb>body, when I took it from his hand, having got in between him and his companion—I collared him and took him to Guildhall, but found nothing but a common handkerchief on him.</p>

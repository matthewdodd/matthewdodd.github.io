                  </hi>. I live at 12, Calthorpe-street, St. Paneras—it is my dwelling-house—I locked the inside door, and bolted it at top and bottom, and the outside door, also, leading into the area, at quarter to 12 on the night of 15th November—I was knocked up by the police at 2 o'clock, and found the area door bad been broken open—there was a mark near the bolt as if it had been prised open with a chisel—I saw the constable find a chisel, a white-handled knife, and a lucifer match on the mat inside the outer door—that door leads into a covered pantry, which leads into a covered beer cellar.</p>

About a quarter past 1 on the morning of 15th November—I saw the prisoner and another man at the bottom of Baker-street—I followed them, but missed them at the corner of Phoenix-place, about twenty minutes or half an hour after I first saw them—I then went to the top of Calthorpe-street, and heard some one whistle—I saw a man looking over the area of No. 12—he ran away, and I ran after him—I saw the prisoner come out at the pantry door, and asked him what he did there—he said, "I have dropped a fourpenny-piece"—I saw him put his hand in his pocket, pull out a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and drop it on the ground in the area—I took him to the station.</p>

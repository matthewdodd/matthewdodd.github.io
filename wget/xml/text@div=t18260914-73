               <p>ELIZABETH NEAM. I am the wife of John Neam. On the 3d of August, about a quarter to nine o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18260914-73-crimeloc438">Devonshire-street, Mile-end</placeName>

               <p>Q. Just look at your deposition? A. I see I there state that he snatched it; but he did it forcibly; I held it tight, as he looked at me viciously - there was no struggle for it.</p>

I was working in their warehouse on the 12th of April; Richard Baker was with me - this wire was deposited in the first floor back room; the prisoner worked on that floor, four or five yards from the room - property has been missed at different times; Baker called me out about four o'clock that afternoon: I saw the prisoner coming down Miles-lane, from the premises - there is a cistern in the room he worked in; we followed him to Princes-street, by the Bank - I then went and asked where he was going; he seemed confused, and said, "Going, going? I am going home;" I said he had something which did not belong to him, and told him to go on with it to where he was going - he went a little way, and then said, "Do you think I have any thing belonging to you?" I said, "I think you have"- I collared him, put my hand in his bosom, and pulled out two pieces of wire, which weighed about 4 lb.; I felt that he had got more, and I said, "You have more - go and take it to where you were going with it;" he would not go on - I said, "If you don't I shall take you to the Mansion-house;" Baker came up, and said, "You scoundrell, you have been robbing Mr. Curtis to a great extent,"- he then said it was the first time; the property was not mine, it was Mr. Matthews', but I have some property on the premises; three parcels of wire were found on him - it was wet; Mr. Matthews and I went to the the cistern in the room where the prisoner worked, and found part of a ring of wire there, corresponding with what he had about him, and about 35 lbs. of copper; the cistern was not the proper place to deposit it - there were 3 cwt. or 4 cwt. of the same kind of wire in that room.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BAKER. I live in Newcastle-court, Strand. I and Curtis followed the prisoner from the premises in Miles'-lane; I saw the wire taken from the cistern - it corresponds with that taken from the prisoner, which was wet.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BARRETT. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody; I found three bundles of wire in his hat, and three about his person; Curtis gave me two.</p>

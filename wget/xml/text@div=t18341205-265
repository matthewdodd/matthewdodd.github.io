                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Godfrey-place, Hackney-road. On the 25th of March last we took the prisoner as servant out of Bethnal-green workhouse; and on the 27th, she was set to clean the door and the passage—I saw her there about nine o'clock that morning—she seemed in a confused state, and my little girl was with her—she was hired as a weekly servant, and slept in the house—she went away that day without notice, and I did not see her again till about a fortnight ago—when she was gone, I missed a silver watch and stand, a pelisse, a shawl, and a pair of half-boots, which had been all safe that morning in the front parlour—I am sure the prisoner is the person—I saw her again when she was in cus<lb></lb>tody—she denied having been my servant, or knowing any thing about me, or having been in the workhouse—here is an apron and shawl which she left at my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner was in our service—I went myself to Bethnal-green workhouse for her—she went by the name of Eliza Smith—I am sure she is the person—she went away on the 27th of March, and we missed the property—I was going to the workhouse that day to settle what I should give her weekly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lodge-keeper at Bethnal-green workhouse, and was 10 in March. The prisoner was then in the workhouse, and had been there before—I remember Mrs. Crudgington coming there for a girl—the mistress asked me, and I called the prisoner to go, and she went the same day or the next—in a day or two the prosecutor came, and said she had left and robbed him—I am certain the prisoner is the girl—she came in the name of Eliza Smith—I went about for a week to look after her, but could not find her—on the 24th of November I met her in Bethnal-green-road—I passed her, and then turned to look after her, and she was looking after me—I turned, and she crossed the road and looked in at a window—I went and asked her if she knew me—she said, "No"—I asked if she knew Bethnal-green workhouse—she said she never saw a brick of it—I then said I should take her—she said I wanted to take liberties with her—I said, no; but I wanted her on this charge—I took her to the work-house, where she was recognised by twenty or thirty persons—I can swear to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, in partnership with others, and live at Stratford, in Essex. On Saturday, the 30th of October, I lost some lead from a storehouse of ours, at the Eastern Counties' Railway, Shoreditch—the prisoner was in our employ—the lead belongs to us, as contractors for the company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, in the prosecutors' employ. On Sa<lb></lb>turday night, about half-past nine o'clock, I was on duty, and saw the prisoner coming out of a stable with this piece of lead under his arm—it was kept about six yards from the stable, in store there—he had no business there—it was under lock and key—he had taken the key from another stable, because I saw him lock the door up where the lead was—he looked about as he came out, put it down, picked it up again, brought it about six yards, then he saw me, and ran away—I know the lead—I had seen it on the Friday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I came through the skittle-ground; I did not come out of the stable; I was going after my shovel. How could he see me unlock the stable through a brick wall? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There was no brick wall to prevent my seeing him—there was a hole in the wall, close by the stable-door—the men are in the habit of going through that to get some-thing to drink, but there was no wall between me and him—I was not more than six yards from him—he had no business on the premises at that time—he had received his wages—the shovel was not there—he ran away for nearly a quarter of a mile.</p>

               <p>DANIEL CARTWRIGHT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a City constable? - A. I am: On the 6th of November, I, in company with Read and other officers, met the prisoner in Upper Thames-street, about six o'clock in the evening, with this basket, containing two pieces of spermaceti, (produces them); I asked him what he had there; he said, spermaceti; he said he brought it from one Weston's, in Bridgwater-gardens, of whom he had bought it; we were not satisfied with that, and took him to the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Weston before the Lord-Mayor? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fit that spermaceti with any block that you afterwards found at Messrs. Enderby's? - A. Yes, and it fitted the block exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner did not conceal it at all, but told you readily it was spermaceti? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are servent to Messrs. Enderby? - A. I am their foreman: On the 7th of November, Read brought some spermaceti to our warehouse; I saw the officers fit it to the block,(produces the block); about three or four days before that I had seen the block whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sell it cut, or broke? - A. Sometimes cut, and sometimes broke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. During those three or four days, did you see whether that block was broke or not? - A. I did not, till the officers cames.</p>
               <p>Q. Will yo venture to swear, that, during that time, this spermaceti might not have been sold in that state? - A. I cannot say we did; I cannot say one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the night of the 6th of November? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-56-person490">A. </persName>
            No; I saw him at our warehouse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020043"></xptr>about a twelvemonth ago; he used to come after out cook.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ENDEREY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you remember the officers bringing you any spermaceti? - A. Yes, two pieces; I fitted them to the block, and found that one of them exactly corresponded; the other I cannot swear to it; it is not usual to sell spermaceti but in whole blocks, or cut into small shreds for the candle-makers or the druggists; I have done it, but it is not usual; I have ho doubt that that piece was stolen from our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You know nothing of the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no access to your house? - A. Not to out knowledge.</p>

            (To Cartwright:) Where is Mr. Enderby's warehouse? - A. At Paul's-wharf.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought it of Weston and pain the full value for it; he said he bought it of Mr. Enderby, and he came forward before the Lord Mayor and said that I bought it of him; I have seen Weston but once since, and I cannot find him now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I think it necessary to inform your Lordship that I understand Weston is now in Court.</p>
               <p>Read. I saw him in Court just before Nixon came to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he in Court now? - A. I do not see him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

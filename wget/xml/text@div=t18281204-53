            . I am a horse-slaughterer, and live in Whitechapel. Sherwood claimed a horse on my premises; it was brought there on Saturday evening, the 1st of November, about seven o'clock, by the prisoner - he offered it for sale; it being dark, and he being a stranger, I put several questions to him, the answers to which confirmed my suspicions; I detained him, and took him before a Magistrate - he was remanded till the following Tuesday, and on the Monday Sherwood claimed it; I had had it led about with a written statement on it - I asked the prisoner if it was his own - he said it was; he gave me his name and address, and said he had had it several months - I asked what he used it for - he said he was a costermonger; I asked where he dealt, and offered to go any where with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along, about six o'clock, looking for a job - a man came and asked if I knew where I could sell the horse; I said I could sell it at the knacker's, at Bethnal-green - he said he had taken it there, and they would not give enough for it; I said I knew a place in Whitechapel - he told me to say it was my own, and to get what I could for it.</p>

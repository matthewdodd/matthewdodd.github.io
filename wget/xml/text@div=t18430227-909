                  </hi>. I am staying at Fromont-lodge, Friern, Barnet, in care of the premises belonging to Sir William Johnson—I had occasion to go into the brewhouse about five o'clock in the afternoon, on the 11th of Feb.—I saw the prisoner on the top of the brewhouse, cutting the lead with some instru<lb></lb>ment which I cannot properly describe—I saw him distinctly from an opening in the tiles—I then went out at the back door, he went on the other side and leaped down into the stable-yard—I followed round after him, and found him in the stable—I asked him about a pheasant—he said he had not seen it—I then took him round, and accused him of this lead, and he begged my pardon twice—a part of the lead, about 3lbs., was removed, and some was gone—the prisoner was employed on the premises as a weekly servant—he had no business in the brewhouse; but he made an excuse afterwards that he got up to clean down the water-spout—I said that was not the truth, for his tools were all put fast for the night—I had never desired him to clean it—the lead remains partly cut now.</p>

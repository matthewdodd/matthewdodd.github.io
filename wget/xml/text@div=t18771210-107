                  </hi>. I am a laundress, and lived at 3, Upper Rupert Street, Soho—I washed the prisoner's linen—he brought it—on 9th August he came to me from 2.15 to 2.30, and brought a bundle of linen—I remember it because it was my child's birthday—she was 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The birthday was the day before—I cannot recollect what washing the prisoner brought afterwards—I have lived for the last 12 weeks at 26, Oxenden Street—I cannot swear there was not a period of six weeks when the prisoner did not bring any washing—I be<lb></lb>lieved he was an interpreter at the Hotel de Versailles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had the prisoner's washing two weeks after August 9.</p>

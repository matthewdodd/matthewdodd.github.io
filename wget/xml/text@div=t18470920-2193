                  </hi> I was in St. Giles's workhouse on Friday evening, the 26th of Aug.—there were a lot of us down in the yard—Wrench and the prisoner were among us—we were standing together talking on marine and naval affairs—the prisoner joined in the company, and asked for a light to light his pipe—he was given one, and he smoked his pipe for about ten minutes—he then left the company, and went a short distance away—he turned back again, and seized hold of Wrench by the hair of his head with his right hand, and drew the knife which he had in his left hand across Wrench's throat—it cut through his neck-handkerchief—Wrench exclaimed, "He has cut me!"—he bled very much—the prisoner ran away as soon as he had done it—I ran after the prisoner, threw him down, took the knife out of his hand, and held him till I got further assistance—we placed him on a seat—he was secured, and strapped down—he was very violent—several of us were obliged to hold him—this is the knife(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the one the prisoner ate his supper with that evening—I had seen him with it before that evening, eating his victuals—when Mr. Bachelor has asked the prisoner to come down to his supper and he has refused to come, I have seen Wrench take hold of him, and carry him down stairs—I never saw him ill-use him in any way.</p>

                  </hi> I am surgeon to St. Giles's Workhouse. On the evening of the 20th of Aug., Wrench was brought to me—I examined him and found a large wound in his throat and neck between five and six inches long, and about half or three-quarters of an inch deep—the smaller vessels were divided, the larger ones escaped—there had been a good deal of hemorrhage I believe before I saw it—I dressed it and he was doing well in the course of a few days—I know the prisoner—I had seen him the same morning—he addressed me as I was going round the wards, saying he wished to speak to me—he said he suspected he had the disease—I ordered him to be brought over, and found such was not the case—there was not the slightest foundation for any such opinion—I have seen him two or three times since he has been in the workhouse—I had noticed that same morning, and I think once before—I considered that his manner was singular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you noticed him enough to form an opinion whether his mind was at all unsound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I spoke to him only a few words—he did not answer me at all—he appeared surly and morose in his manners—that was before this occurrence.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you been surgeon to the workhouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nine months—I do not think he has been there all that time—my duty is not to attend at the house, but out of it; but the gentleman who attends in the workhouse was then out of town, and I was attending for him—I had very little opportunity of seeing the prisoner—from what I did see of him I thought his manner was singular—he appeared very singular on that morn<lb></lb>ing—there did not appear to be the slightest foundation for the disease—I was struck with the oddness of his complaining of a disease for which there</p>

               <p>was not the slightest foundation—he appeared to be odd in his manner—his eye was strange—there is no stronger indication of insanity than the eye—I noticed that appearance about him that I asked two of the men to come and be present with me while I examined—I was fearful of being with him alone—I imagined that he was in such a state he might com<lb></lb>mit an act of violence—that was the morning this took place—from what I have understood from the medical man, he was brought into the workhouse in a state of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, brought on by furious drinking—<hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> is a species of insanity while it lasts—the mind of a person suffering from it is almost always unhinged—it is a kind of fever of the brain—I should say the brain was in a state of depression in the intervals between the attacks—that would not create unconsciousness, or prevent the proper operation of the mental faculties—I imagine the partly would be cool and collected during the intervals—he was quite calm in his manner when I saw him on the morning in question.</p>

                  </hi> I am the governor of the workhouse—the prisoner came there on the 18th of August—he then seemed to be in good health, and quite in a sane state of mind—he was rather eccentric in his manner—I saw him the day this happened, and spoke to him—he appeared no worse that day than I had seen him on the previous days—he was rather of a morose, reserved, and sullen disposition—he did not seem to join with the other people—there was no appearance of violence that day—he complained to me about the state of his body as the surgeon had described, and I described the the surgeon to examine him—I know Wrench—I was not aware of his occasionally bringing the prisoner down when he would not bathe or come to his meals—Bachelor is the orderly man of the word—he would not have authority to direct Welch to bring him down—he would have authority to ask any of the men in the ward to assist him—I do not know of Welch having ill-used the prisoner in any way—I have inquired since, but have not learnt that he has—this knife is a worn-out old knife, which I believe did belong to the word—they are not allowed to keep possession of their knives after they have done their meals—if the prisoner did so, it was contrary to the rules of the house.</p>

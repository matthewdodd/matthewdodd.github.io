                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of Robert Johnston, of John-street, City-road. He had a boat at Mr. Sowter's wharf moored to a chain—I saw it safe on Thursday evening at eight o'clock—next morning I found it had drifted away, and I missed the chain, which was broken off, and two spring balances—this is one of them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I had seen the prisoner lurking about the place that afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Friday evening, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Brick-lane, and saw the prisoner come out of a marine-store shop—on seeing me he popped something under his smock frock—I watched him—he kept looking round after me—I at last saw him go into another marine-store shop—I went and found him offering this spring balance for tale—they would not buy it, and he came out—I stopped him, and asked what it was—he said he did not know, he found it in Macclesfield-street—I said, "Well, then, it must be dirty, as it is a wet night"—he said, "No," he had wiped it off—I took him to the station-house, and found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—he said he had shown it to the people in the tap-room of the public-house in Macclesfield-street.</p>

               <p>Was it locked? - I cannot be particular, I wore the sattin waistcoat, which I have since found, on the Sunday before; the prisoner had been breeding a disturbance, and I went to look at my clothes, and three waistcoats were missing; I did not see them put there; in the evening, when the two young men came from work, that is, the prisoner and another that lodged with him, my wife enquired about the waistcoats, he said he knew nothing of them, my wife then told him that we could suspect no other person but one of them two, and we begged them to get another lodging; the other young man went away, and sometime in the week following the prisoner took another lodging; I forbid him the house, and he did not come there for some months, about six weeks after that a gentleman that is present wore one of my waistcoats in my house; my wife first saw it, and said it was very much like my waistcoat, and the gentleman was very angry, and soon after left the house; it had some gold edging put round it after it went from me; about six weeks ago I saw the waistcoat again on this gentleman's back at my house that I now live in, in Dean-street, Fetter-lane; upon this we suspected the prisoner; this gentleman's name is Egan; I met him again in Sydney's Alley; I saw him have the waistcoat on; I asked him to drink a pint of beer; says I, George, you have used me very ill; you have worn that waistcoat out; that is mine, he said I do not know it was yours,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190052"></xptr> but it was some time after I had it he said that the prisoner gave him the duplicate; he went and took it out of pawn, then I thought it was not safe for me to mention it in the street with him, for fear he should go out, and I went to Mr. Hyde's, which is just by, and brought an officer to take Egan up, then he swore Maxwell gave him the duplicate; the waistcoat had been scoured, there was a mark in it, but the mark is gone, here has been a mark put in it since, that is, K. J.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you detect this waistcoat when you first saw it? - Because there was some gold lace upon it, and I was not sure of it; since I have seen it a second time I have been informed of it, there was one Conner who lodges in the garret, and Egan swore before the Justice that he asked the prisoner how he came to let him have a waistcoat that he did not come honestly by, and the prisoner told him he had the duplicate from Conner.</p>
               <p>How do you know that is your waistcoat? - There was a mark in it, but it is now out.</p>
               <p>Jury. There is no mark in it, it is a common pattern.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was marked with an R. with common ink, with a pen.</p>

            , I am now out of place, I have left him about three months about December, 1783, I was one day at dinner at the gate in Stafford-street, where the prisoner was, and the prisoner came out of doors; it was a very wet day; his foot slipped, he fell down, and dirtied himself very much, I took him home with me, and I sent him some clean clothes to put on, he was so very dirty.</p>
               <p>Did you live with any body then? - I did not, he slept at my lodgings that night, the next morning, when he was going to put on his clothes, he told me, if I would accept a duplicate of a silk waistcoat he had in pawn he would make me a present of it, he gave me the duplicate; it was three months after before the waistcoat was taken out of pawn, then I took it out, as near as I can recollect, it came to seven shillings; it was not a new waistcoat; it was a very good one; there was a taylor with me when I took it out of pawn, and I happened to have some gold binding by me, and I had it put round to make it look smarter; about six weeks after I went to the prosecutor's house in Saint James's-street; Mrs. Rodden came into the parlour where I was, and said, that waistcoat looks very much like one my husband had stolen from him; I found myself somewhat confounded, and I told her she behaved very rude; and the first time I met the prisoner afterwards I asked where he got that waistcoat that he had given me the duplicate of.</p>
               <p>What name was it pawned in? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>How came you to keep the duplicate so long? - I was out of place, and it was not convenient to me to take it out of pawn before.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the waistcoat was challenged, did they say there was a mark? - No, nor I never observed any mark upon it; the prisoner said he had the duplicate of a young man that is here, whose name is Conner, and I will venture to say there never was a mark on this waistcoat in this world with ink; I had the waistcoat, and wore it, and went into the prosecutor's house, I dare say forty times, with the waistcoat on, and they never claimed it; after that, I may say with truth, I have been there an hundred times.</p>
               <p>Was your coat open? - Yes, twenty times, an hundred times; after his wife said it was like his, she came afterwards and asked my pardon, she said the ground of it was a lighter green than that which her husband had lost.</p>
               <p>Was the husband by at the time? - Yes, I heard nothing transpire concerning the waistcoat for a year and an half; but about five weeks ago I went into the prosecutor's house again, the waistcoat had got greasy, and the lace was tarnished; I took it off and had had it scowered, when I went in this time the prosecutor's wife said it was very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190053"></xptr> much like her husband's: I said I had the duplicate, I took it out of pawn: I met the prosecutor in Sydney's alley, and I had the waistcoat on, and he asked me to have a pint of porter; he said George you use me extremely ill concerning the waistcoat; says I, I had the duplicate of the waistcoat of Maxwell; he wanted somebody to fetch a peace officer; I said I would go to any Justice he thought proper; he left me in the house, and went down to Justice Hyde's; Justice Hyde gave an order for apprehending the prisoner, I went with a peace officer, and the prisoner was taking a glass of punch with some friends, where they had a dinner; I asked the prisoner if he recollected giving me a duplicate of a waistcoat; he said yes, he got the duplicate from Conner, and in consequence of that he was committed.</p>

               <p>How long have you known Eagan? - Between three and four years.</p>
               <p>Long, before this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Eagan. Had you seen Conner from the first time your waistcoat was claimed till it was taken from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him about the duplicate? - I did, and he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Conner. I wanted to go with Eagan to search for the prisoner, at the same time, Eagan desired I would mention nothing of it, as he thought there would be no more about it.</p>
               <p>Eagan. I said it would only bring us into trouble, and I beg you will say no more about it, I do not want to have any piece of work about it; there was one particular I forgot to mention concerning the pawnbroker, when the prisoner was brought before Justice Hyde the pawnbroker was sent for that the waistcoat was pawned with, the prosecutor was present, he was asked by Justice Hyde did he know any thing of the waistcoat, he said no he did not, for he had fifty of those waistcoats in the course of a month, and it is impossible to tell one waistcoat from another.</p>
               <p>Court to Eagan. What became of the prisoner, has he been always to be seen, and always in the way? - Yes, I never knew he was out of the way ever since I first knew him in London, which is between two and three years.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have met him accidentally, he has been once or twice in the house afterwards, I never said anything to him after he left the house.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Does the prisoner owe you anything? - Yes, he does, four or five shillings.</p>
               <p>Eagan. You told me nine shillings, the other day.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It may be so; I told him if he would go out of the house I would never ask him for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever ask him for this money since? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I lodged in this house, there was a great resort of vagabonds, I and another young man that worked with me remained there about a fortnight or three weeks, they continually had speaking clubs of chairmen and all sorts; we did not approve of the lodging, and so we left it; the prosecutor said, what fault have you to find with your lodgings; I said, we are disturbed, we cannot get up in time to our work; his wife said, she was sorry we were going: you will find my character good, I know nothing of the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they voluntarily leave your house, or did you make them leave it? - I made them go.</p>
               <p>Conner. I never knew the man more than seeing him at a public house, we had a pint of beer, I was in the hospital at the same time, and there was very little hopes of my recovery; he was told that I never should come out; I afterwards went to Dover, to the Royal Hotel, and lived there about two months; I went from thence to Ireland for seven months, with a gentleman, and on my return to this kingdom<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190054"></xptr> the waistcoat was talked of again, and I said it was a very hard case, Eagan came to me five days after I left the hospital.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give the prisoner a duplicate? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever pawn a silk waistcoat? - No; I desired Eagan to come directly with me, to go to the prisoner to know whether he would say so before my face; no, says he, I will not, drop it; I went to the hospital about a fortnight or three weeks after this affair happened, I was very bad.</p>

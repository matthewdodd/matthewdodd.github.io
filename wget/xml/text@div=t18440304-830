                  </hi>. I live next door to the prosecutor—I have known the prisoners eighteen months or two years. On the 13th of Feb., about twenty minutes after seven o'clock, from that to half-past, I was returning home, and saw them coming down Lamb's-buildings together towards Leggatt's house—I had occasion to stop for a minute, and after that went towards my own house, and thought I saw one of their legs in the prosecutor's front parlour window, but was not certain—I stopped and watched for a short time, and then saw the window-shutters come open, and one of their heads put out—in a short time the prisoner Law came from down Lamb's-passage towards Leggatt's house—I had not seen him come from the house—he was coming up to the door—I made a shuffling noise with my feet, and he went away again—he was about ten yards from the house—I did not see that he had anything with him—I lost sight of him for about a minute—he went down to the bottom of Lamb's-passage—I heard <hi rend="italic">"Jack,</hi>" or something, called from Leggatt's house—Law then came back, and went towards the house—I made a shuffle with my feet—he was then two or three yards from the door, and he walked off in a direction from Mr. Leggatt's house towards me—he passed me—I am certain it was Law—(I had not seen him in the house—when I first saw them walking together they were five or six yards from the house, and in conversation with one another—I then went in doors, and sent my sister for a policeman)—I went to my own door, and, after being there four or five minutes, I saw</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Golden-lane. On the 13th of Feb. I saw Law up at Mr. Dunn's, my master's place, from half-past five till half-past ten—I do not know the name of the place—it is about three minutes' walk from Lamb's-buildings—he was in my company all that time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in your company from half-past fire till half-past ten? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was down stairs, I was up stairs—I went down three or four times, and saw him sitting by the fire every time I came down—I saw him eating about half-past seven o'clock, I do not know what—I went down next about nine—I went down four or five times to go backwards, as I was very ill.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">DUNN</hi>. I am the prisoner's father. On Tuesday night, the 13th of Feb., he was at work at No. 4, Chequer-alley—he does not live with me—I know he was at work there, because he brought three pairs of shoes home to me, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went that evening on purpose to see if he had done the work, about a quarter or ten minutes to seven—he told me it would not be done for half an hour or an hour, and they were brought to me about eight o'clock by his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. Have you been in Court while all the witnesses have been examined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not all—I did not pay attention to Brooks's evidence—there was no person with me that evening, she came to me with my son's work—she is a wife, or pretends to be—I have never been indicted—the witness Brooks only binds for me—she is not the person I mean by my son's wife—I do not know whether he is married—I live in Ebenezer-place—I cannot say how far that is from Chequer-alley—I have not been get<lb></lb>ting up this <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi> nor treating or talking to the witnesses.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where does Law usually live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Usually with my son—Brooks lives in Green Arbour-court, not with them—Ellen Carr brought my son's work home—they call her my son's wife—she lived with him, not in the same room with Law—there are two rooms joining each other—when I went to go there Law was in my room, my wife, Mrs. Brooks, and the daughter—my wife and daughter are here—Law was eating his supper—he has no father and mother, and at times he takes his meals at my place—he does not work for me—he sometimes goes on errands—he was never out of my place from half-past five till Davis took him out at half-past ten, when they left off work—he was sit<lb></lb>ting at my fire all that time—I went to my son's about half-past seven, and returned before a quarter-past eight—I left Law in my room, and found him there—the prosecutor lives about 200 yards from my place—it would take about ten minutes to go there and return—my son was singing "The Ivy Green" when I got there—I was not in Court when a witness said he was singing "The Ivy Green."</p>

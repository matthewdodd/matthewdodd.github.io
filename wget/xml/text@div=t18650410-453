                  </hi>. I am an unmarried woman—I have been getting my living by seeing gentlemen, though not recently—before last Christmas I went to lodge at Katzenstein's—I lodged there about six or seven weeks—about a week after Christmas I left his place, and went to live in Greek-street, Soho—I did not tell him I was going—Greek-street is the next street—I continued in the neighbourhood, but I never walked the streets there—MR. Katzenstein keeps a restaurant—I occupied a furnished room of his—I bad seen the female prisoner before the 7th March, but I had never spoken to her—I knew she was servant to Katzentstein—on 7th March she came to where I was living in Greek-street; she asked me to come out and go to the corner with her—I refused—about 4 o'clock on 8th March I was at the corner of the street when the female prisoner came behind me, canght me by the throat, tore my watch-chain away from me, tore my bonnet<lb></lb>strings off, and pulled the buttons off my dress—she said a word or two, but I do not know what—she gave me no time to answer—there was a locket and key on the gold-chain—I think the value of the property I lost was about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she immediately ran away, about a dozen housesdown—I saw Mr. Katzenstein standing that distance off—I called out, and a butcher stopped her before she got to Katzenstein—he detained her, and then he let her go—she ran in between several persons, and put the chain in Katzenstein's hands; I saw her put it there—I then went to the Police-court—I appeared before the Magistrate the next morning, and the prisoners were then in custody.</p>

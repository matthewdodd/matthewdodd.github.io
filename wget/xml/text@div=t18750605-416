                  </hi>. I am captain of the steamer <hi rend="italic">Hutton</hi> now at Milwall—on the 5th May we were at Port Said—I was informed of something that occurred and saw Hassan—he was in a state of faintness, what the doctors call collapse—I mustered every soul in the ship and passed them all before him, and when he came to the prisoner he pointed to him and said he was the man—we had a gentleman on board who spoke Arabic—he also pointed to Thomas Beattie, a fireman, and said that man struck him first, but the prisoner stabbed him—I put them both in irons—the next morning after I had investigated the case I let Beattie out—the prisoner was kept in irons—I should say he Lad been drinking—Hassan was all right—I only s. w him suffering from the wound—I don't think they drink much as a rule; it is against their creed to drink—I sent the officer down to the prisoner next morning with the log book, the law requires me to send the log book down with a copy of the entry—I made an entry in the log book in which I charged him with stabbing the man—he did not sign it, that is not requisite.</p>

I am a fireman on board the Hutton—I remember the 5th May—I did not strike Hassan—I separated them—I was put in irons that night and liberated the next morning—I saw Hassan—he had brought two bottles of grog on board, and ten minutes after I saw blood on his pants—he had his hands at his side and I saw blood—the prisoner went to the port side of the ship at the time that Hassan rushed on deck—there had been a quarrel between them that night—I separated them—Hassan did not go to his bunk at all, he was wounded in the forecastle—he was standing up with a bottle in his hand treating the prisoner—he asked him for some more grog and the prisoner said he had no more—then I saw the prisoner with a knife in his left hand and he had a pipe and some tobacco and his pipe fell on the deck, and afterwards this Arab was sitting in the forecastle and I said "You had better go your own side and mind your own business," and then he rushed on deck with his hand to his side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Weldon—for some years I resided at Tavistock House, Tavistock Square—ten or eleven years ago I tried to establish an orphanage there—I kept poor children there for residence and education—I first became acquainted with the prisoner in 1872, through Monsieur Gunod, who was staying with us for three years—the prisoner visited him; he described himself as a journalist of importance—he said that he had been connected with a newspaper called <hi rend="italic">La Liberte Colonial</hi>—after that I lost sight of him for some little time—I had a book belonging to him, and I sent one of my pupils to say I had got it, and to express my sympathy with him and his wife as to something that had happened; and he came to see me again, I think, on 12th or 13th of April, 1876—very soon after that Madame Menier came to stay with me, with a little child—we were on terms of great friendship, and were very fond of each other—she remained with me at Tavistock House, until October last year, with the child—the prisoner came to see her very often; I thought he was a very honest man, and his wife was quite certain that he was—in October it was arranged that owing to Madame Menier's health we were to go abroad for a time—we were to go to Paris—we left London at 6.30 on the evening of 9th October, I, Madame Menier, and the child, and six or seven other children; some of them had gone before with Madame Menier's sister; We went to Argles, about four hours from Paris, the prisoner accom<lb></lb>panied us to the station—prior to my departure I had arranged for Mr. and Mrs. Lowther to occupy Tavistock House; I expected them to come in the morning; before I left, but they did not arrive—I left nearly all the servants in the house—I did not give the prisoner any instructions at the station,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187809160002"></xptr>
               <p>before I went there I had given him six pages in English to give to Mr. Lowther, instructions as to different little things that ought to be attended to in the house—I gave him no authority to occupy two rooms in the house—I never contemplated anything of the kind; he could not have lived in the store-room and the lumber-room, because there was no place for him there—he had the keys of those two rooms—I gave him no authority to sleep in the house, or to keep the latch-keys or anything of that kind—I could not exactly say when I received a letter from Mr. Lowther, I think it was in December—I was in Paris on and off, the children were ill, and I was generally at Argles, or at a convent, where five of the children are now—I remained in France till 2nd April—on 9th March I got a letter from my husband's lawyer—I wrote to my mother, and ultimately I returned to England on 3rd April, and went to the house on the 4th—the door was not opened, I rushed in, I got in by a dodge, because my husband was trying to keep me out—the prisoner came up when he heard that I had come home, and he rushed out of the house as fast as he could go—he did not say a word to me—I saw a box in the hall packed and corded ready for removal, it was my box—it contained higgledy-piggledy things, dresses, and linen and lace, but nothing like jewellery, he had cleared off my jewellery-case first—there were several boxes ready packed, crockery, and in fact there was a general clearance—I then searched my jewel case, and he had taken every single thing except some little coral beads not worth much—the things produced by Mr. King, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Cordell are all mine—they were left quite safe when I went away in October—the articles of jewellery in the first packet were not in the jewel case, they were in another box—when I was at the house on 4th April, I saw a man named Baratti there—I found that the prisoner had a mistress living in the house, I found the address of her father and mother in my box, and I telegraphed to them to come up and look for the girl, and we traced her to where the prisoner had taken her, and that was how we caught him—on 5th April I went to the Hotel Cont at 21, Golden Square, with the officer, I went there first and saw the box there—the policeman found the girl Nicholls there, and the servant also, she is one of the persons I desired Mr. Wontner to subpoena, but he has not done so, she ought certainly to have been subpoenaed—the box at the hotel was not mine, but the contents were; there was wearing-apparel, towels, and other things, the detective has them—I never authorised the prisoner to take them away—I gave the servant into custody—the prisoner came to the hotel while I was there with the officer, at a quarter past 12—I said to detective Cook, "I give that man in charge for the theft of these things which are in this parcel"—he strode across the room, shook his fist in my face, and said, "I give this woman in charge for the murder of little children"—he also said that I was mad, that I was not to be listened to, that I was a miserable woman, and that he would do for me, that I should not have my own way long, or something like that—he did not say a word about the property—he only said I had murdered the children and was mad—he repeated that a great many times, in the room and all the way down stairs, and in the cab, and he kept on threatening me the whole way that he would do for me, that he had got everything in store for me, that I should see, and I should know what was coming and all that sort of thing, and that I was a bad good-for-nothing woman—it was all in French; I told him to speak in English so that the policeman could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187809160003"></xptr>
               <p>understand him, I translated to the policeman what he said—I charged him at the station—he made no statement as to why or how he had taken the property; he said I had got his balloon; that was his excuse for taking the things, because he said I had got a balloon of his; he told Mr. Flowers that it was worth 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had taken my things as a sort of equivalent—he had given me the balloon, it is a dreadful thing, I wanted it to be taken away, and I wish somebody would send for it—I think it is a very clever invention—he gave it me to benefit my orphanage, if I could get it from the War Office, as I knew several persons there, and if by my influence I could get hold of the thing I was to have it for the benefit of the orphanage, and we were to divide the profits—I was to have one-third, and Madame one-third, and he himself one-third, and we often argued as to what we should do with the money—it was a balloon which he had submitted to the War Office for military operations, it is now in my yard—I should like to state that I have here Mr. Simmonds and Mr. Morris to state that it is their balloon, and not Mr. Menier's, and that they paid 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I saw some furniture belonging to me at Baratti's, it was taken from my house—I wish I knew where Baratti lives; he did live at 372, Euston Road; the furniture consisted of tables, beds, chests of drawers—I had left them all right in the house, when I went to France on 9th<lb></lb>October; I did not authorise any one to take them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Tavistock House was acquired on 3rd December, 1870—I did not say at the police-court that I had last slept with my husband in 1875; it is not the fact—I did not say I had not slept with him since 1870, you asked me how long it was since I last saw my husband, and I said not for thirteen or fourteen years; I said I had not slept with him for about thirteen or fourteen years—I lived with him under the same roof till 1875—I don't think I had much interest in a house in Bentinck Street I did not take it, it was not taken for the purposes of the orphanage—I did not advance money for it—Madame Menier first lived with me on 19th July, 1876, she has lived with me from that time, and she is with me now—at the police-court I declined to give her address—in October, 1877, I did not contemplate being abroad for many years, I did not intend to expatriate myself for three years, I meant to come back in May—I taught the Rawlings family at the orphanage, music, reading and writing, and other things—I authorised Menier to procure bells and a piano for them—I had nothing to do with their engagement at the Oxford, they were engaged there to play on hand bells—I have signed my name as "Valerie" and "Granny"—these letters marked from A to Q are my writing—Madame and I both gook the name of DeLuz, and so did Mr. Menier—these are parts of letters written by me in October, 1877—some of them were addressed to Tavistock House; many were to Mr. Ray, his cousin—this (<hi rend="italic">marked F</hi>) is my writing, it is a letter which I sent to the prisoner to post for me, and he kept it back—this letter (<hi rend="italic">R</hi>) is the prisoner's writing, I received it in Paris—it is an agree<lb></lb>ment for the balloon and for the millions in New Caledonia—this is the account the prisoner sent me—it is dated 15th June, 1877—there was another account which I received after he was given in custody, saying that I owed him 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a certain sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I put into the City Bank to oblige him, because he said he wanted to appear to have a financial position in the City, but he was most particularly asked not to touch it—I did not know it was for a bad purpose—I wrote to the City Bank</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">about it and also to</hi> Mr. Gunod, thinking he would not like to have to do with such a wretch, but I was mistaken—I let him have a great deal of other money—I did not desire him while I was abroad to let Tavistock House—I wanted him to save a piano of my very own, which I had in Bentinck Street—the wearing apparel that I found at the Hotel Cont was in Miss Nicholls's box—I have never kept an old rag shop, therefore I cannot tell you the value of the articles—I did not charge Miss Nicholls with stealing them—I gave the servant Elizabeth Haseldine in charge—I never saw her before—she ought to be a witness for me—she was Menier's servant—I was so sorry for Miss Nicholls I did not charge her with anything—I said if she did not stop screaming I would make her leave off—I was too sorry for her to accuse her of anything—I identified my watch on that occasion—the prisoner had got it and Would not give it me, and I was determined to have it—I don't know what he said—he gesticulated, and roared, and bellowed, and said I was mad, and that not a word I said was true—I can't say that he said it was not my watch—the detective took it from his pocket—I said it was stolen from me—I never withdrew from that statement—the tickets for. the jewellery were found at Tavistock House—I know that he had no business; he might have had a dozen addresses, one of them was in the Minories—Baratti was a protege of Miss Torreani's—I have tried to be kind to him, as I have to a good many people—I did not allow him to live in the house—I had not given him assistance in money—I had been to the Austrian Embassy, and had helped him when his child died of smallpox, and tried to get him assistance—I had known him about four years—the furniture was not returned at my request; Mr. Wontner told Barratti to send it back, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the cart, and he sent it back—I charged Menier with stealing that furniture—Baratti is not here, the subpoenas were served. so late, there was no time to find him—I did not advance money for the construction of the balloon, Mr. Simmonds and Mr. Morris had done that—the prisoner represented to me that he was interested in millions of acres in New Caledonia—I was, when in Paris, to interest myself with the Minister <hi rend="italic">of Marine there</hi> In getting the property—I think I went once to his brother's <hi rend="italic">office</hi> in Paris, and Madame and I dined with his mother—the prisoner's brother was not the proprietor of <hi rend="italic">La Liberte Colonial</hi>—can you be the proprietor of a thing that is dead? it was all but dead, it only lived nine months—I was not going to edit it, I am not up to that—I dare say I did represent that I would put it in such a shape as that <hi rend="italic">it would</hi> be successful—I think it was on 2nd April that Mr. Neale had anything to do with the case—this is true: "I was barricaded by lire keepers trying to get me to a lunatic asylum, some one having got two doctors to sign a certificate"—will you, my lord, subpoena them? do subpoena them—"the lunacy laws are something awful"—so they are. "Two villains may quite unsuspectingly get into your house and swear away your mind"—it is Dr. Winslow and Dr. Wynne, and Campbell and Rutherford. If you would only bring those doctors into Court, I should be so much obliged to you. It is a conspiracy, I have charged them with it, and Mr. Flowers desired the Home Office to take it up, but Mr. Wontner is a friend of Dr. Winslow's, and therefore he would not do it. It is all very well to laugh, but when a woman's life and reputation is at stake, I will defend myself. I am not wrong. I know perfectly well that three keepers did get into my house and lay hold of me. This man is but the tool of the conspiracy, and why should</p>

               <p>he stand there alone? It is not because he is a miserable adventurer that he is to be the target of these people; there are others more wicked than him who have tried to get me away and get possession of my house. It is not a question of my judgment, it is a question of fact Mr. Neale was actually abetting him to steal my property. Let Mr. Hirschfield be subpoenaed. I know they try to make me mad, they are all connected in conspiring against me. The case has not been fairly tried, and I wish the Jury and the public and the press to know it; the proper witnesses have not been subpoenaed. Dr. Winslow and Dr. Wynne are two villains, and I hope the press will not be afraid to report it I am a spiritualist. It is atheists who run down spiritualism."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When I first attended before the Magistrate I was not represented by anybody—Mr. Flowers wanted the Treasury to take the case up, but they have not taken it up properly—a man named Nelson had the house in Bentinck Street, he had gone bankrupt for 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he got 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of me under the pretence that he wanted to use it for the benefit of my orphanage—that was how I was always taken in by people—the house was heavily mortgaged; the lawyer made him give me the lease, and Menier said he would give me 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and he gave it me out of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had placed to his account at the. bank—he had no right to use it except for my purposes and by my permission, and he swore he would never touch a penny of it—I believe this account was rendered to me in October (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—this is dated 17th November, 1877; it was only to show to the Minister—the prisoner speaks in this of the money I had lent him and the assistance I had rendered him—the term "granny" is one that the children used to me, it was a term of affection—Madame Menier and I used the name of DeLuz, it was her grandmother's name—I did not want to be known, I was incognito—the letter F is addressed to Ray, he lives at 20, Adelphi Build<lb></lb>ings, Covent Garden—I handed that letter to Menier to post, but it never reached Ray—the watch was one that I lent to Menier—I had asked him for it dozens of times, but could not get it.</p>

I had ceased to live with my wife since somewhere about 1875—she then had some adopted children in the house—I left her in full possession of the house—she has private property of her own, in the sense that her jewellery was considered her private property—there was no settlement upon her, she is not entitled to any property in her own right, that I am aware of—I cannot explain how it is that she says I improperly tried to make her out a lunatic, in order to get hold of her money, because she has no money—I was not actuated by any malicious motives in calling the doctors in to see her, I have certainly not conspired with the doctors, it is a delusion—I did not interfere at all with Tavistock House, or with her movements between 1875 and March 1878—I took no part about the house in Bentinck Street—I don't remember purchasing any of these articles—I had nothing to do with giving the prisoner into custody.</p>

September to the beginning of March—I can tell by my books, but I gave Heluy 100 francs at a time for the keep of the children, and to take them abroad—I have asked her for accounts six months since—as to what she saw in the newspapers, she received a telegram from Menier's brother, asking her to go and give evidence for Menier—she said "If I am paid I will go"; Madame was there and told us the whole story—as to Menier being master of the house, I should like to call my servants, who could speak about that—as to dining at the same table, we all, I and my servants, dined together.</p>

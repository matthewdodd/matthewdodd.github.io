                  </hi>. I am a rope-maker at Stepney. On 15th Aug., the prisoner and another person came and asked me if I would purchase a horse—I said, I would see it in the morning—next morning the prisoner came alone—I walked with him to the Fountain public-house, Mile-end-road, to look at the horse—there were three men there; one of them, I believe, had brought the horse up from the country—I told the prisoner I thought the horse was not worth more than 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was worth all the money which was asked, which was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I said to him, "Is it all right about this horse, you are not going to take me in?"—he said, No, so help him, Jesus Christ, he would sooner suffer his arms to be severed from his body than take me in—I bought it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told him to bring it home, which he did—he then asked me to let him put it in harness, that he might show it to a person, and he and my man put it in—he drove off with it—he said he should be back in an hour—he never returned—the cart and harness came back about eleven o'clock at night.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner—on 18th July, I was with him at the Rising Sun public-house, with two others, for about three quarters of an hour—we went from there to the City of London beer-shop, at Little Ilford—Emma Spurgeon was behind the bar—the prisoner called for some beer, which she supplied—we sat down in front of the bar—the prisoner sat down, but not near us—I was playing the concertina, and my two friends were also playing—while we were doing so, Emma Spurgeon came out of</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the City of London beer-house, at Little Ilford—on 18th July, between 6 and 7 in the evening, I saw the prisoner come into the house—he sat down close to the bar door—my daughter was then in the bar—I went up stain, and as I came down I saw her at the frost door—as she came back to the bar I saw the prisoner jump form his seat, put his left arm round her, and struck her in the breast—they both had their backs to me—my daughter screamed out, "Mother, I am stabbed"—I said, "You villain, what have you done?"—he said, "I did it; I meant doing something; the knife is out there," and he pointed with his hand—I went to my daughter's assistance, and the prisoner was secured.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my house, on Saturday the 7th of June, about half an hour past seven in the morning, No. 20, Clerkenwell Close; he came with a loud knock at the door, and asked the maid servant if Mr. Hillier was at home? - I heard him; she said he was, he was not stiring; I heard her say that to him; I then spoke to her out of the parlour, and asked what the gentleman wanted? he said he wanted to speak to Mr. Hillier on particular business, from a Mr. Orchard, in Hatton-street, or Hatton-garden, I cannot say which; I then repeated that Mr. Hillier was not stirring; he said his business was very particular, and he must see him; I then went to the door, asked him into the room, and asked him to sit down, and I would call Mr. Hillier; he sat down in an arm chair, close by the closet door in the parlour, exactly at the door that opens into a kind of beauset; I went up to Mr. Hillier; when I came down, he was sitting in the chair, I told him Mr. Hillier would wait on him immediately, and then left the room; in about a minute after, he got up, and he said, he could not stay, he had particular business with an attorney. I had only gone into the other room with the door open, he was in view at that time; he went out, by then he had shut the door, Mr. Hillier came down, he said, he knew no such person as Mr. Orchard, I had had a sharper with me; Mr. Hillier opened the door of the closet, he did not perceive he had lost any thing; but I looked after him, I suppose, in the space of two or three minutes, and I missed a gravy spoon, three table spoons, and a small pepper castor. I can speak to the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed as a sailor, as he is now? - O, no, very genteelly dressed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know whether she could indemnisy my person at the house at that time? - I am positive as to his person, and his voice without seeing his person.</p>
               <p>Q. What particular marks have I got in my person? - There is a gentleman that comes to my house, that, at first sight, I took him for.</p>
               <p>Q. Only them circumstances? Then you cannot pretend to speak, but I may be that gentleman? - O, yes; I know it is not by your voice.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hillier; I saw the prisoner the 7th of June, on a Saturday; last month, about half past seven in the morning; he knocked with a loud knock at the door; I went immediately and opened the door; he asked me if Mr. Hillier was at home? I answered him, he was not in the way; I went immediately into the parlour and called my mistress, and my mistress came out; and he asked her if Mr. Hillier was at home? She said he was not stirring; she asked what it was o'clock? I looked and told her that it was half past seven; she asked him into the parlour, and said she would call him. I went immediately down into the kitchen, I heard my mistress go up stairs, she returned down in about two minutes; I was not in the parlour to hear what past; he went out by himself, I did not let him out, I was below stairs;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160070"></xptr>I put the spoons in the ever night, between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock, they were all in a closet in the parlour, in a knife case; I was in the parlour five minutes after this person went out of the house, when they were missing; I was not certain of the pepper castor being in over night, I did not put that in, but the other things I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any spoons left behind? - One table spoon. There was no person in the house but the prisoner at the bar, from the time that I put them in the closet till I missed them. They have never been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray how do you know my person? - I took particular notice of him, he was not dressed as he is now, he had his hair tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Was my hair powdered? - A little powder in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Hillier, I think, in her evidence, said, that my hair was dressed? - It was dressed and powdered; I knew his person the moment I saw him, on the 24th, at the New Prison. My master went to the New Prison, and he came back again, and I went back with him to know if I knew him; he was shewn me in a little room, just going into the prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Hillier, and Mr. Roberts, the keeper of the New Prison, are acquainted.</p>
               <p>Court to Witness. Had you any doubt about his person at that time? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you equally sure now? - I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the spoons that are missing? - I don't know the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Hillier. Did you see this man before you have seen him now? - I see him in New Prison-yard; I see his back, and Mr. Roberts called him; and he answered with an oath, that he was coming; and I said, that is the man, I do not desire to see him. I was sure it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Hillier. Did you know the spoons were missing yourself? - Yes, by looking into the cupboard. I have had the fellow gravy spoon weighed, and the fellow of one of the table spoons, and the silversmith told me that the weight of the gravy spoon was better than sixteen shillings, the price of old silver; and the table spoon twelve shillings the single one; and the pepper castor five shillings, I value them altogether at fifty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Hillier said they were loose in the cupboard, and the servant said they were in a case.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hillier. I did not say they were loose.</p>
               <p>Court to Hillier. Do you know Mr. Orchard? - No, I do not; there is such a person, I believe, in Hatton-garden; but he is no acquaintance of mine at all.</p>

I live at 4, Little Thames Street, Greenwich, and am a single woman—I knew the deceased and the prisoner, and on the 13th July I saw them at the North Woolwich Gardens—when on the boat I heard a conversation between them which attracted my attention—the prisoner said to the deceased that he was going to Birmingham, and she said that he should not—I left them, and walked to the other end of the boat—I joined them afterwards, and we all three went together into the Gardens—we took some refreshment there—I left the prisoner and the deceased together, and went to the square platform—the deceased came there, too, and commenced dancing with a gentleman—in about ten minutes my attention was again called to the prisoner and to the deceased—I was walking down a path, and heard a scream of "Murder!"—I went to the place, and saw the deceased, bleeding very much from the nose, mouth, and left eye—I asked her who had done it, but she did not answer—the prisoner turned round, and said "I have done it; it was quite an accident"—he was holding her round the neck, and had a handkerchief up to her eye—I made one remark, which I cannot recollect now, and a policeman asked me to move on, or he would take me—the prisoner again turned, and said "Leave her alone; she's her sister, and is a little excited; I will look after them"—I went with the deceased to the hotel, for the purpose of having her eye dressed—the prisoner went with us—the deceased said that her eye was nearly into her head—when the prisoner was following her, she said that he was her husband, and they were not to hurt him—after her eye had been dressed by a doctor, we returned by boat to Greenwich—we went to South Woolwich first, where the prisoner tried to get a cab, but could not; and ultimately we engaged a little boat, and so got home—the prisoner stayed with us all night and next day—the deceased was attended by a doctor—I heard the prisoner use threats to her about two months ago—they were having a few words—they used to live as husband and wife—I have known her for about three years, and the prisoner for about three months—about two months ago I heard were quarrelling—I was in the next room at the time—I heard him say also, "I will murder you"—I never saw him strike her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living in Berners Street, Greenwich—I was called to attend the deceased on the 14th July—she had a wound under the left eye, near to the nose—there was strapping on the wound, which had nearly healed—I removed the strapping, and ordered fermenta<lb></lb>tions to it—I attended her until Monday the 23rd July—she had no serious symptoms of lock-jaw until the Wednesday after the injury—the symptoms after that time began to increase, and on the Monday she was taken to the hospital—I had seen the wound from day to day, but had not made any special examination of it—a blow, in the way described, would have caused the injury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a Licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company—the deceased was not brought to me, but I was called in to see her, on the day after the accident—I did not at that time make any examination of the wound—I prescribed salines and purgatives, as she complained of pain about the wound—there was nothing to examine—there was inflammation of the white of the eye, but she could see out of it perfectly well—the wound, whatever it was, was healed up, and on that account I did not probe it—she complained of nothing else, except the eye and the wound—I asked her if she was injured anywhere else—I did not examine the eye to see if there were any bones broken—she said that the wound was accidental—I did not know that the orbital plate was broken—had I bare known it, I could not have done any more—I think my treatment would have been the same—I could not know that the plate was broken—supposing that the plate was broken by a blow of this kind, there would, in all probability, have been an infusion of blood internally.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—I remember the deceased woman being admitted—she had a mark on her left eye, from a wound that had healed—it was just beneath the eye-lid, and was about three quarters of an inch in length—she was suffering from lock-jaw, and I treated her accordingly—she died on 1st August—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body—I opened the head, and found a fracture of the left orbital plate of the frontal bone—some of the plate of bone was broken off—it is a thin plate of bone, that runs behind the foremost and upper border of the orbit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing that an umbrella had been struck upwards, would that have fractured it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would, and in this case considerable violence must have been used—the cause of death was tetanus, brought on by the injury she had received—had it been an eighth of an inch higher, it would not have been so dangerous, because it would have passed outside, where the bone is much thicker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wound was closed up at the time the' deceased was brought to the hospital—I formed an opinion as to its direction merely from the wound and the fracture together—the thin plate extends below the eyebrow; it is in the same level with it, and slopes slightly downwards—if the umbrella had been pushed in a horizontal direction, and the woman had put her head back at the time, the bone, in all probability, would have been broken by the blow—she did not say anything to me as to the way in which the injury had been caused—I do not think I asked her the question—the prisoner and the deceased's mother were with her, and they gave me a</p>

               <p>history of the case—the prisoner said that it was done by an accident—I traced tetanus to the wound, from the manner in which I was told it had been inflicted—there is some cause generally for tetanus—exposure to a current of air, or damp, might cause it—in case of a wound, tetanus generally arises within four and ten days—I did not know the deceased, and therefore I had no knowledge of any symptoms of another kind which, might have developed themselves into tetanus—the length of time in which tetanus was coming on in this case, led me, in one respect, to suppose that it, arose from the wound—tetanus did not show itself until nine days afterwards—then there were violent spasms, which generally accompany tetanus—I did not examine the body all over, but I inspected the head, the brain, and all the viscera, with the exception of the uterus—I did not examine the feet, and therefore do not know whether there was any wound or mark upon that part of her person—I saw the body oil over, and I think if there had been any other wound I should have seen it—she did not complain of any wound on her feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have seen several cases of tetanus—I have no doubt that in this instance, it was caused by the wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Northampton-street, Cambridge-road, and an servant to a gentleman in High-street, Whitechapel. On the 17th of February, I was standing at his door, next door but one to Mr. George Kirby's, and saw the prisoner snatch the trowsers from the door, fold then up, and give them to another boy, who walked away about three yards, and then ran away as hard as he could—I am certain the prisoner is the boy—it was about a quarter before eleven o'clock at night, and in about half an hour he came into Mr. Kirby's shop again, and looked at another pair of trowsers—the policeman came and asked me if that was the boy—I said, "Yes," I can swear to him, I am quite sure of him.</p>

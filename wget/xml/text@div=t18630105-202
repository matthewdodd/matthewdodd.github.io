                  </hi>. I am an assistant at Messrs. Jackson and Walford's, book<lb></lb>sellers, of St. Paul's Church-yard—on 29th December, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, a lad came into the shop, and asked for six copies of a tract</p>

               <p>"Conformity and Non-conformity"—the price was a penny each (I don't swear to either of the prisoners)—he gave me a five-shilling piece, and I gave him a half-crown, two shillings, and three-halfpence in change—there is a discount of three-halfpence on purchasing six—I placed the crown in a bowl, where we keep the money—there was no other there—I afterwards looked at it when the constable came, and found it was bad—I should think that was about 5 o'clock—Mr. Walford, in my presence, gave the policeman the five-shilling piece that I had taken—I had not taken any other crown between the time of selling the tracts and the policeman coming in—I had been serving in the shop all the time—no one else was serving in the shop but me at that time—the six books were afterwards shown to me by a policeman—I believe they were the six copies I had sold—I had not sold any that day before, or after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, of 47, St. Paul's Church-yard—that is on the opposite side to Watford's, close to Cheapside—Wal<lb></lb>ford's is between Ludgate hill and Cannon-street—between 4 and 5 o'clock, on 29th December, Fookes came in, and asked for six Good News almanacs, which are a penny a-piece—he gave me a crown, and I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I was not sure at the time whether I gave him the three-halfpence discount, but he acknowledged at Guildhall that I did—he took the alma<lb></lb>nacs and change, and left the shop—I doubted the crown at the time he gave it me—I threw it in the till, took it out immediately, and ran out of the shop, but I went the wrong way, and did not see him—there were several small pieces of silver in the till, but no other crown—he went out very quickly—a few minutes afterwards a lad, who saw him hand me the crown, came and said something to me—I directly went to Jarrold's shop, in Paternoster-row—that was not more than ten minutes after Fookes left—I saw him looking into Kent's shop, just below Jarrold's, on the opposite side—the one who was in Jarrold's shop was not the one who had passed the bad crown to me—I can't say he was looking straight at anything—he did not see me coming up to him—I went behind him, put my hand on his shoulder, and said, "You passed a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece at my shop, a little while ago"—he said that he did not—I cannot remember the exact words; he signified that he knew nothing about it, and then ran away as fast as he could down the Row, and turned down a passage—I did not overtake him—I saw him stopped by a number of persons—I gave him into custody, and afterwards gave the crown to the constable—Fookes was then taken to Jarrold's shop</p>

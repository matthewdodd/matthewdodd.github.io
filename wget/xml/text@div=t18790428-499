                  </hi>. I live in St. John Street, Clerkenwell, and am manager of the Cavendish Permanent Building Society—in November, 1877, Bouffler handed me these two memorandums ("<hi rend="italic">A" and "B</hi>")—he brought me "A" first—that was the first time I had heard of the premises in Lower Belgrave Street—Roberts afterwards came with Mr. Bouffler—both papers were then in my hands—I asked her questions with respect to them, especially as to the surveyor's report. (<hi rend="italic">"A" was an application for a loan of for five years on the tease of two shops in Lower Belgrave Street, one returning</hi> 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per annum, and the other returning</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per annum. "B" was a report from Johnson and Payne, dated</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th June, giving the total value of the premises in Lower Belgrave Street at</hi> 775<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">or</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">years' purchase.</hi>) There is a blank in "A" forthe amount of the loan, but she applied for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked her if these particulars of letting were perfectly and sincerely accurate—she said "Yes," with a slight alteration which I made in pencil, but which made no difference in the rent; it was merely that one shop at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and three rooms on the second floor at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were let to one tenant at 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told her of course I could not rely upon the report, it would be necessary for some one to verify it—we agreed, and I went to the premises in two or three days—she said there was about from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year surplus which she made out of it—I found two shops, one a tobacconist's, was open—there was a note against the door of the other—I inquired of a man-servant for Mrs. Roberts, and Crighton came from the stairs—he said it was all right, he would show me over—he took me over the premises, as Mrs. Roberts was not at home—I mentioned the Cavendish Society—he weut into a little room at the back of the shop, and told me that he held that room and the shop at 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I said "That seems rather a heavy rent"—he said "Not considering the position of the premises; we do a very good busines"—as I was going along the passage again I saw Mrs. Roberts—I do not know where she came from—she took me into the back-room first floor, which was a much larger room, and said that it was 'let to a solicitor, with a room over it, at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and that the front room was let to two officers of the Guards at 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; the upper part of the house she stated was in her own occupation—there were, I think, two upper rooms—there was a sitting-room and a bedroom to each of the officers' rooms, and the solicitor had two rooms—I went upstairs and said, "I understood you to say that this shop was let at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year"—she said "Yes, it is let to a lady who is well known in the Berlin wool trade; she has not come in yet; I expect her in next week"—that was not the larger shop—the matter was brought before the directors in the usual manner, and they agreed to advance 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the property—I then wrote to Mrs. Roberts, and she came to see me—I told her we could not lend 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., only 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I conveyed that information through Mr. Bouffler—she did not in any way alter the statement that she had made when I went over</p>

               <p>the house; I believed it, and the money was lent her on, I believe, the 21st December, 1877—here are four of the cheques—they are all endorsed by her—this one of 21st December was for the balance after paying off the mortgage—Messrs. Miller attended to the legal part—she said nothing about having granted an under-lease to any one; that was entirely concealed—the money was to be repaid by 60 monthly instalments, but we only got the first, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I heard nothing more till November, 1878, when I in<lb></lb>structed the solicitor to stay proceedings in the matter—I then for the first time knew that there was an under-lease to Crighton—we have never received a farthing more, except 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for ground rent, which was dis<lb></lb>trained for, having been paid to the ground landlord—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>). is a memorial signed by Roberts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Roberts.</hi> You certainly did show me over the house, and you used the words I have stated—the first distress was in July, 1878—we paid the first quarter's ground rent out of the society's funds, and we were obliged to distrain for it to prevent ferfeiture—I bad not 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of yours in my hands, nor 40 farthings, except what I had at the time of the settle<lb></lb>ment, and I paid that over to the ground landlord, and this is his receipt—you answered everything that I asked you—I asked you particularly whether the house was let for 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and you distinctly said "Yes"—the solicitors may have sued you, I did not—I knew nothing about your being made a bankrupt—the society being a very old and respectable one, we allowed 10 months to go over without getting a farthing—I do not know what you mean by "your tenante"—the broker said there were no tenants—I am not aware that I am your trustee in-bankruptcy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The reason we did not recover on the distraint was because everything appeared to be Crighton's, and the broker came back empty-handed—this receipt for rent (<hi rend="italic">produced by Roberts</hi>) Mr. White obtained by a distraint himself, which I know nothing of—Crighton told me nothing about the lease of the seven upper rooms, only that he held the shop, and the room over.</p>

               <p>this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original memorial of lease from Roberts to Crighton—I was not aware of that till November, 1878—neither the abstract nor Mrs. Roberts gave me any information on the subject—in February this year I believe she was made bankrupt, and the usual order was made to file a statement of accounts—it was adjourned for a month that she might do so, but at the end of that time no statement was filed, and I obtained an order—I have searched the registry—there is no registration of the lease of March, 1874, or of the assignment to her of 34th March, 1877, but there is a registration of the under-lease from her.</p>

I am an upholsterer and cabinet-maker, in Buckingham Palace Road—about 4th April, 1877, Mrs. Roberts came and selected a Brussels carpet for a room in Coleshill Street—she directed it to be made and sent home and laid the following day—I told her distinctly that our terms would be cash when the carpet was laid—we usually require a deposit—she said she was not prepared with a deposit, but would pay it when it was laid—I went myself and took the measurements, and not seeing much in the house I directed my salesman to accompany the carpet-layer, with strict injunctions to bring back the carpet or the money—she sent back the man for some stair-carpet—I sent it with instructions not to leave it without the money—the amount was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not get the money—I went myself to the house the same day—I saw Crighton there, in the area—I asked for Mrs. Roberts—he said she had gone in the City—I went again next morning, and saw Crighton again—he said as before that Mrs. Roberts had gone into the City—I said that was false, for I saw Mrs. Roberts at the window, and I intended to come in—I knocked at the door and rang violently, and several people came round, and at last they let me in—I saw Crighton inside—he assured me that Mrs. Roberts was well-to-do and had extensive business in the City, and actually did business on the Exchange—I said "That will not do, I will see Mrs. Roberts or I will take my carpets out of the house, I am swindled"—in about half an hour Mm Roberts came into the hall—I then got 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., under the threat of locking the pair of them up—I went again and the house was closed, within eight days—I never got any more money or the carpets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Roberts.</hi> I sued you for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the County Court, and got a judgment and put in execution, but there were no effects—it cost me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not hold 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture of yours now, not a farthing—you and Crighton both came to select the carpets, as Mr. and Mrs. Roberts—you never said who Crighton was—I know nothing of a Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Crighton.</hi> I am sure you came with Mrs. Roberts to choose the carpets—when I made a row at the house you let me in at the door—I did not see you for a year and a half afterwards, at a cigar shop—I had no other transaction with you, only when you came with Mrs. Roberts—I don't remember your ordering a carpet of me about two years ago, and paying me half cash, and its being laid down at a Berlin-wool shop.</p>

               <p>Victoria Street—in July or August last Crighton came and wanted to obtain some goods on credit—no particular amount was mentioned—I said it was our custom to have cash or good references—he gave the name of Mrs. Roberts as a reference; he said she was his landlady—I communicated with Mrs. Roberts and she came to our place with Crighton and signed this guarantee (<hi rend="italic">this was dated 9th August</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">and was to the amount of</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—she said she had known Crighton for some years as a very respectable man, and was anxious to help him as much as she possibly could—in the mean<lb></lb>time I had sent up my man to the neighbourhood—goods were supplied to the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 2nd Nov. Crightan was indebted to me about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards sued Roberts on the guarantee, hut never got any money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Roberts.</hi> I don't recollect that Crighton gave any other reference than to you—he ordered 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of the receipts I gave, Aug. 9 and Oct 10—we had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—you called on me afterwards to obtain more goods to carry on the business, and paid for what you had—that was after the credit was stopped—you said if I gave you time the balance that was due should he paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk and bookkeeper to Messrs. Wood—in consequence of his directions I went to Lower Belgrave Street to make inquiries—I there saw Mrs. Roberts, and I think I saw Crighton at the same time—I stated what I had come about—she told me that Mr. Crighton was a very honourable man, and she wished to help him—she took me upstairs, showed me the shop and the front room, and said that was Crighton's room as well as the shop—she told me that she had a furnished house in Eaton Square—I believe that was afterwards, when the credit had been obtained and we could not get our money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant and manager to Henry Archer and Sons, 171, Strand, tobacco manufacturers—about the latter end of 1877 or early in 1878 I saw Mrs. Roberts several times in company with Crighton—she gave the name of Crighton; I believed them to be husband and wife—she bought goods, and for about two months paid cash, ultimately she got credit, and it ended in owing our firm over 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in about three months—the last goods were supplied on 27th April, 1878—I went several times to Belgrave Street and saw both the prisoners—I did what I could to get money, but never got one penny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Roberts.</hi> I did not know you as Mrs. Roberts or address letters to you in that name—you put the shop into our hands to sell—up to a certain time you paid for all you bought, but the account was opened in a fraudulent manner—we were under the impression that Mr. and Mrs. Crighton were man and wife, and that he was the proprietor of the premises in Belgrave Street, and in consideration of that, and cash having been always paid previously, we gave him certain credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Crighton.</hi> You never asked me for credit, but you came frequently with Mrs. Roberts after the account had been opened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of records in the London Bankruptcy Court—I produce the file of proceedings in the case of Annie Roberts, of 23, Lower Belgrave Street, widow; she was adjudged bankrupt on 30th January, 1879—no accounts were filed—an order was made for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Roberts.</hi> There was a meeting on 14th March, which was adjourned at your request till 4th April.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Roberts's Defence.</hi> I have not had time to call my witnesses. These people have got from me 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property. As to the lease, they did not search in the Registry Office as they ought to have done; it was registered in the County of Middlesex, and if they had done their duty in a proper manner they would have seen it; but they have put it all on my shoulders. I borrowed 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of them, and I laid it out on the premises, they have had the benefit of the money. They kept my creditors from coming to the Bankruptcy Court to get their share in the profit, nearly 1260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have no lawyer or any one to protect me, and I leave myself entirely in your hands. They pocket all the money and my poor creditors are left without a penny. I think the fraud and conspiracy has been on their side; they have paid witnesses to come and swear falsely. I have been straight<lb></lb>forward in all my transactions. It is for you to say who is right and who is wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Crighton's Defence.</hi> With regard to the loan that was granted, I knew nothing of it till some time afterwards, and then Mrs. Roberts said she had obtained some money to pay the rent; that was all I knew. I never attempted to obtain tobacco or cigars with any idea of fraud. I paid cash as far as I possibly could, and I never asked Mr. Archer for credit.</p>

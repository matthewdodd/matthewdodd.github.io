I am the wife of William Ward, a baker, of Vauxhall-road On 15th Dec., about 11 or 12 o'clock in the day, a little girl, eleven or twelve years old, came to our house—I did not know that she was the prisoner's daughter—she asked for a half quartern loaf, and gave me one shilling—I gave her the change, and she turned to a basket of biscuits, and said, "These are two for a halfpenny?"—while she was looking at them, I said the shilling was bad—she said she had taken it at a tea shop in Warwick-street—she wanted me to give it back to her, but I told her to send the parties who gave it to her—I received a communication, marked the shilling, and gave it to a policeman—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

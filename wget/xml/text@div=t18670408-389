                  </hi> (446 <hi rend="italic">N</hi>). On 28th March I was in Lee Bridge Road about half-past nine p.m., and met the prisoner with a bay mare—he asked me the way to Kingsland—I directed him, and, finding he did not go the way I directed him, I stopped him, and asked him where he brought the mare from—he said he did not know the name of the place nor the man's name whom he brought it from; that he met a man on London Bridge about four o'clock in the afternoon, who asked him if he wanted a job, and em<lb></lb>ployed him to go into the country to bring up a mare, and would pay his expenses down by rail and go with him, which he did to some station in the country, and they then walked some distance to a public-house, where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186704080036"></xptr>
               <p>he left him, and told him to remain there till he came back, and came back in about an hour with the mare, which he told him to take to Kingsland Gate, and most likely he would meet a man in Lee Bridge Road, who would take the mare from him and pay him for coming down, and that if he did not meet him he was to take the mare to Mr. Watson, of Alpha Cottage, near Kingsland Gate—I asked him if he knew the man's name he went down with—he said, no, and that he never saw him before, but that he should know him again—I did not believe him, and took him to the station—I made inquiries at Kingsland, and took this paper, which the prisoner gave me, "Mr. Watson, Alpha Cottage, Kingsland Road, over Lee Bridge, or Buckhurst Hill"—I found no such person at Kingsland or at Buckhurst Hill—Mr. Smith identified the mare in the green-yard a week afterwards—the prisoner gave his address at the station, 61, Peter Street—he first said Wood Street, Hoxton, but that was untrue—where I met him was seven miles from the prosecutor's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Wharton a pawn-broker in Crosby-row, Walworth. On the 10th of May the prisoner came and offered a shawl and waistcoat in pawn—I asked where she got them—she said she had bought the shawl of Mr. Blay, of East-lane, and the waistcoat was bought in the New-cut—I do not recollect whether she said she bought it herself, or her husband bought it—I sent round to Blay, and before the person came back, the prisoner was gone.</p>

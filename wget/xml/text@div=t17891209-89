               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Please you my lord, and Gentleman of the Jury: when that iron was first put upon me; it was nearly cut through, and quite rusty; I did not perceive it; I hope<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090087"></xptr>you will consider; I broke no prison; I used no violence before I got away; I was in the custody of Mr. Akerman; I made my elopement, and went to a friend, to go to Bristol, and from thence to get on board a ship to America or the West Indies; and I am very confident that there is not a convict in the prison but would extricate himself out of the prison if he knew how. If you had a bird, Gentlemen, that you was ever so fond of, and kept it so that it wanted for nothing but liberty, it would get away if it could; and who would be to blame, the bird or the keeper? Gentlemen, ask the keeper if I have not a good character.</p>
               <p>Sibley. He always behaved remarkably well in the prison, and always remarkable for his cleanliness.</p>
               <p>Owen. I say the same.</p>

On the evening of the 1st of November he asked me to mind the shop, which I did - he went into the yard, and in a quarter of an hour brought in some water, and sprinkled the shop; he went into the yard again for about a quarter of an hour, then returned, and began to shut up; he appeared much agitated, and could only put up three shutters - he then left without finishing - I put up other shutters; he had began to shut up about a quarter-past ten o'clock - he did not go away till about eleven. I saw a pair of shoes in his trousers pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did not he appear very ill? A. No; he went into the yard twice - I saw the shoes quite plain.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in charge on the Friday following, and asked what he had done with the shoes - he seemed much agitated, and began crying; he said they were at his lodgings, but he meant to pay for them. I went there, and asked his sister for the shoes - she said he had measured her, and brought them - I found them there.</p>

            . I am in partnership with Thomas Wasp; I heard of this circumstance; the prisoner has worked for us some years; he had permission, about three weeks before, to take a pair of shoes for his wife; he brought them back, saying they would not do, and he would make a pair - I told him to do so, and not take any more, as we did not like it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not a fresh quantity arrived on this night? A. Yes; he might find a pair to fit her among them - his character has been excellent.</p>

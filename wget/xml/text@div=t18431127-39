                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the morning of the 2nd of Nov. I saw the prisoner coming up out of the cellar of the Ship public-house. The flap was partly across the pavement and partly across the opening—it was lifted partly off—it was fastened underneath with a chain—I saw him come right up out of the cellar, he bent his body double, gave a whistle, and ran un<lb></lb>derneath the wall—I suppose he bent his body to hide himself from me—I then saw a man who was standing in a dark corner nearly opposite, and he ran with him—I followed, sprang my rattle, and never lost sight of the pri<lb></lb>soner till he was stopped in Commercial-road by Baxter, between 200 and 800 yards from the house, Smith came up and took him in charge—I had walked over the cellar flap a quarter of an hour before, and it was secure as it ought to be—I afterwards went to the station, and got the prisoner's boots, took them to the cellar, and under the flap was a little dampish dirt, which had got through the cracks of the flap, a couple of inches thick—I found foot<lb></lb>marks in it corresponding with the right boot exactly, and there was a mark where the left foot had stepped, which corresponded with the left boot at the toe—it was only made by the toe—I found some lucifer matches in his waist<lb></lb>coat pocket.</p>

Soon after two o'clock I heard a rattle spring—I was standing in my own doorway—I saw the prisoner running across the road from Vinegar-lane—I ran and stopped him—he was about forty houses from the Ship—he said, "What do you stop me for?"—a police<lb></lb>man came up—I gave him to him—Ryley came up immediately after.</p>

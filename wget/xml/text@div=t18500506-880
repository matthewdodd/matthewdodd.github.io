On 19th March I heard of the National school-house at Kingsbury being opened and robbed—On 27th March I followed the prisoner to a house in Camden-town—I asked Mrs. White, in his presence, whether the prisoner lodged there—she said "No"—I asked her whether he had got any property there—the prisoner said, "No" but she said he had left a parcel there a few days previous—I opened the parcel and looked at the things—I asked the prisoner if it belonged to him—he said it did; he bought the things of a man in the Edgware-road—I said I believed it to be stolen, and I should take him into custody—I searched him, and found on him these keys—my brother officer asked him whether he knew anything about a clock—he said, "No"—Mrs. White said, "Yes, you brought one and sold it in Camden-town for 3<hi rend="italic">s."</hi>—he said nothing to that—I took him to the station—I then went to a broker's shop and found this clock—I afterwards took the keys to the school and fitted them to the locks—every key fitted some lock there.</p>

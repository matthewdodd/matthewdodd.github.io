In consequence of information of this burglary, I made inquiries at pawnbrokers and general dealers and others, and amongst them of Mrs. Wager on 5th September—I asked her if she had bought any children's clothing; that several robberies had been committed about the neighbourhood, and I was endeavouring to trace them—she said no, she had bought nothing—I asked if she had bought a table<lb></lb>cover or children's clothing—she denied both, and said they were just the very things she wanted; that she had a sale for such articles—7 called again on 19th September, and said I had called again respecting these articles; that I had reason to believe they were sold to some wardrobe dealers—she said she was sure she had not bought anything, and I left the house—after I had got about 300 yards the servant girl ran after me, and said her mistress wanted to see me—J went back, and Wager handed me this pawn<lb></lb>ticket, and said she had bought it of a woman—I asked who the woman was—she said her name was Hastings—I said "Where does Mrs. Hastings live?"—she said "No. 11, Raymead Road "—the ticket refers to a sealskin jacket and a top coat, the proceeds of another burglary—she also handed me this letter relating to children's clothes, a table<lb></lb>cover, and watch; it is signed "Mrs. Hastings"—she said Mrs. Hastings had sent that letter hay little girl, and she wanted a shilling for the ticket—I found the table<lb></lb>cover and the child's frock at Wager's—I found 67 pawn<lb></lb>tickets at her place, some of them relate to the proceeds of other burglaries; things that I had inquired after, which she denied having—I said so to her—that was on 4th October, the day I arrested her—I called on her five times, and made inquiries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Mrs. Wager was at first called as a witness at the police-court; she was in attendance twice, and was recalled—she keeps a wardrobe shop—the only articles I found there were the table<lb></lb>cover and the child's dress—she brought out the table<lb></lb>cover from the window—I could not see it from the street—on one occasion I spoke to her about a pair of gloves—she said she did not recollect anything about them; her daughter said "Yes, mother, you did buy a pair of gloves"—I asked$ who the woman was she bought them of—she said "I have known her a long time, and We had dealings with her; she is a very respectable woman, her name 18 Mrs. Hastings, and she lives at 11, Ray mead Street, Ladbroke Grove</p>

I called at Hastings's house, 11, Raymead Street, on the 20th—I saw Mrs. Hastings, and asked if she had been buying or selling anything about the neighbourhood—she said "No, I have not bought or sold anything"—I found 27 pawn<lb></lb>tickets at her house, two relating to the proceeds of a burglary at 49, Swinburne Road; I found nothing relating to this burglary on that visit—I called next evening about 8.30, and arrested James Hastings—they both lived there—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned with Ann Hastings in committing several burglaries about that district—he said "I know nothing at all about it; 1 will go quiet"—I made a search then, and found this figure and shade; also this box, containing two antique 'copper coins, a small metal thimble, also this bunch of keys, and this key I find fits all the doors where burglaries have been committed—it fitted the door of Mr. Williams's house—I also found this rent-book, proving that they had been living there 15 months—I heard Mrs. Wager say before the magistrate that she had bought the tickets of the frock, the watch, and the table-cover of Mrs. Hastings—she did not mention the dates—Hastings is the man's assumed name—the female has lived with him about nine years; she goes by the names of Brown, Williams, and Annetta Marks.</p>

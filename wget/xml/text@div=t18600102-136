I was formerly an inspector of police—I am now in the service of the Mint—on 13th December I went to 16, Little Warner-street with inspector Briant and other constables, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I found the street door open—I went up to the first floor, forced the door open, went in the room and found the female prisoner sitting by a clear bright fire drawing her hand from a bag which hung by the fireplace; she put her left hand to the fire on which this iron spoon was placed with molten metal in it, and this <hi rend="italic">get</hi> was in it as it now appears—I seized her by the shoulder, and she said, "Oh Mr. Brannan"—I said, "Well Mr. Pomeroy, we have come to pay you a visit"—she said, "I have been driven to this by <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>; I never knew anything about this until he taught me; you knew me when I was a little girl, before I was married: he drove me and my little gifl to it, who is now in Colney Hatch, I never knew anything about it till he taught me"—at that time she called a little boy from an adjoining room and said to him, "Fetch. <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> from the beer shop over the way"—I then instructed a sergeant to go and take Pomeroy in custody—I searched the room, and in the bag alluded to I found a plaster of Paris mould for casting sixpences quite hot, and a piece on cloth forming a pad—on the table I found three counterfeit sixpences quite hot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the same table I found a galvanic battery jar containing a solution of acid, and a file with white metal in its teeth—I found a knife with plaster of Paris adhering to it, and this piece of glass in the cupboard with plaster of Paris adhering to it—this is the pad—it was rolled up for the purpose of holding a mould—it is impossible to hold it in the bare hand—I went to the cupboard and found a galvanic battery<lb></lb>plate, three pieces of copper wire which had been dipped in solution, some plaster of Paris in powder, two tins containing black composi<lb></lb>tion used to give the coin a dull appearance, and another bottle con<lb></lb>taining acid—while I was in the room Joseph Pomeroy was brought up</p>

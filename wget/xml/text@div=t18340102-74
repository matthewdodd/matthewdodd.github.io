               <p>HENRY ASLETT (police-constable H 89). I went and found the rope.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALKER. I was coming up Essex-street, and saw the prisoner with this rope in his possession, with part of an old coarse apron over it - it was whole then, but has been untwisted.</p>
               <p>JOHN DOWN. I live in No. 18, Rose-lane - I went out and met the prisoner, who asked me to take a walk with him - as we were going by Mr. Dykes, he turned his head and saw this rope, and took it - we went into Thrawl-street, and met a boy - we asked him to cut the rope for us, which he did - he then helped us to unlay it, and we gave him twopence - we then put it into a bag and took it to Mrs. Martin's shop, and put it into the scale; it weighed forty-two pounds, but she would not buy it; and the officer came in.</p>
               <p>SARAH MARTIN. The rope was brought to my shop - I would not buy it - the officer came and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down the street, and saw the rope - Down took it and put it on my shoulders - we then got it cut, and took it to Martin's.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FOX. I am brother-in-law of the prisoner - I will take him and give him employment for the winter.</p>

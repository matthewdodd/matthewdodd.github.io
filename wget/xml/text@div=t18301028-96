               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was he before he was in your service? A. A brewer himself; I bought his casks and stock in trade, and retained him to bring his custom into my business - I was not to give him any compensation, beyond the purchase of his casks and stock; I had offered him 20l. previous to purchasing his casks and stock, but he preferred my purchasing them -I believe I did deny to Mr. Humphrey's, having offered him the 20l., not then recollecting the circumstance, but not before the Magistrate; it was while the matter was under inquiry in the office, but it was in the private chamber - they were taking my deposition; there was a letter produced, which revived my recollection; Mrs. Singleton was one of my own customers - the casks should have been counted when they went out and when they returned, and the difference between them tallied with the account in the day-book; he was ordered not to give credit to too great an extent - I did make a deduction from his wages of some amount, for beer which he had given credit for; I do not remember the amount - the whole that had been received from Mrs. Singleton, when the prisoner left me, was 30l. or 40l.; perhaps some of the payments might be 9s., but mostly 4s. 6d. - this was during the two years and nine months; beer was certainly at times left there on credit, and the credit given on one day may have been entered when paid, upon another - on the 15th, and on the 21st of April, he left a firkin of beer each day, and received 4s. 6d. - here are the entries in the book, but there is none on the 19th; on the 3rd and on the 12th of June he left them, and entered them in the book, but here is no entry of any left on the 7th of June; on the 16th, and on the 26th of August he left them, but here is no entry on the 21st - this book is what he takes with him, and it is his own writing; he took out printed receipts, but they have no margins.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BODKIN. Q. When did you put your name on this? A. When the prisoner called on me, not at the time I paid this - my husband does not assist in the business at all; I generally paid for the beer, one after another; it might happen that I was not well or had not change, and the next time I paid for that and the other - I have no entries of what I pay; I conclude, by seeing these receipts, that I paid him - no one paid but me; he always signed the receipt on the day I paid; I am indebted to the prosecutor now for two casks of beer.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever pay him without a receipt? A. No; when he left it without payment I paid him on the next occasion, but I never paid him for two at one time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing he came to you on the 19th of April, and had written a receipt without having the money, might he not have come on the 21st and given you a receipt dated on the 19th? A. Never; I always paid him the money before he wrote the receipt - I do not know whether he sat down to write; he wrote it in my presence, and put the day of the month and the date of the year - I have no particular recollection of either of these days.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it your office to count the casks that went out? A. Yes, and I do generally, but if I was busy some other person might do it - they were counted again on their return, and the result expected to be found in the book, and the money paid down or accounted for; the amount of casks he had laid down were entered in the dray-book - a cask might be made up, but I should expect he would bring an account of what he had had; I do not know how there could be a balance created; I should have demanded the account of him - I went round, and inquired after this circumstance; there might be some cases in which the prisoner had paid for beer which the party were still in debt for, but I cannot speak to any one distinctly; I have seen some accounts in which the parties have got down beer, owing to the prisoner, which the prosecutor has no account of.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you, in the course of your examination, discovered that the person who was put down as a debtor, had never had the cask at all? A. No, if the prisoner had left a cask, and not got the money, he would have left this blank to show he had not yet received it; so on the 19th of April if he had left a quarter cask at Singleton's, he should have left the blank, that is the case uniformly through the book; it was his duty to leave the blank on the day he delivered the beer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But if he brought back the casks, or returned the money, the blank would not appear? A. No; I should have expected the money, unless he delivered the beer.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. But would you not expact to find the blank there? A. Yes; the book was made up the first thing every morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to swear there is the initial of any person opposite the 27th of April? A. They were all paid for as they were scratched out that is all I can tell about it - my wife pays sometimes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280044"></xptr>but when I come home she tells me, and I took if it is scratched out; the prisoner sometimes left casks which he was not paid for, and then I paid him for two the next time - I take notice of the date, whether it is paid or not; I believe these initials to be his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This is a book with "
               <persName id="t18301028-96-person855">S. </persName>
            Betteley" on the back of it? A. Yes; the prisoner brought it to me, and said it would do instead of printed receipts - the whole of the writing is the prisoner's; I began last year, and these are particular sums struck out, and J. K. put against them.</p>

             BLACKMOOR. Q. Have you not discovered that the prisoner had paid his master for beer which is still owing? A. Yes, in some cases; I did not discover that I had made an error in my account with Mr. Gerkin - there was no error discovered, to my knowledge; I do not recollect an error on the 29th of July.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was at one time in Mr. Gerkin's account - I said it was more than he owed - we looked over, put it to rights, and put the money down in the ledger; there is no doubt there are many places similar.</p>

I am resident superintendent of schools at Wandsworth Reformatory—I heard a cry of "Fire" and found the workshops in flames—I tried to put them out—they were destroyed entirely—in consequence of something I heard, I called the prisoner to me that evening, and told him I was going to ask him one or two questions—I asked him if he was the boy who set fire to the hay-loft—he said "I did"—he also said that one of the other boys (who was charged with him before the Magistrate) supplied him with the matches, and a was lucifer to do it—I am sure he said "To do it"—I said so before the Magistrate—the servant maid, Elizabeth Cremer, supplies the matches—she is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Reformatory and Schools, at Wandsworth—the institution is built on my estate—on Wednesday, 6th April, I was sent for, and arrived there at 11 o'clock at night, when the in<lb></lb>mates had retired to rest—next morning, after breakfast and prayers, which I conducted for the boys, I sent for the prisoner, and said "How came you to be such a wicked boy as to set fire to the premises?"—he said "I was told to do it"—I had said nothing to him by way of caution—I said "Who told you to do it?"—he said "Ross told me to do it, and supplied me with the materials to do it with"—I asked him what he supplied him with—he said "A match and a taper"—I said "Were you under punishment?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020110"></xptr>
               <p>—he said "Yes"—I said "Were you on bread and water?"—he said "No"—I said "Had you been flogged?"—he said "No"—I said "Then, what was your punishment?"—he said that he was put to sit on a form by himself—I said "If he had told you to jump into the river, would you have done it?"—I do not think he made any reply—I afterwards had the same conversation with him in Ross's presence—(<hi rend="italic">The Bill against Ross had been thrown out by the Grand Jury</hi>)—Roes said "I gave him the match and the taper, but I did not think he was going to do what he did do"—the prisoner made no reply to that—in consequence of Ross being afflicted he was put in the school, and employed to light the gas there, which no other boy was allowed to do—he gets matches one at a time from the kitchen, and keeps the taper in a drawer—he would not have the match before 7 o'clock that day—they only give him one; we are very careful about that—the servant, Elizabeth, gives out the matches—the prisoner had no right to be in the loft at all, nor had any of the other boys—a master has the charge of it—there is a lock and key, and if he had done his duty, this would not have happened—a range of buildings, two storeys high, value 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were burned down—they were not insured, as there was no fear of fire, because then were no fires there—the whole of the stock, and the shops and stables were destroyed—they belonged to me—I feel a great interest in the work, and I have seventy-five out of every hundred boys turn out well.</p>

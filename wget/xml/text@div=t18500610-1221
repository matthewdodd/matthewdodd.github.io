On Monday, 31st Dec, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to their warehouse at Bermondsey—he asked to see some low-priced butts of leather—I showed him two parcels—he selected some, which amounted to 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he said, "You will send them in to-morrow morning, and send the invoice with them"—I said, "Yes, but I am not the master; I must have the cash for them on delivery of the goods"—he said, "Well, send them before nine o'clock in the morning; I shall be sure to be at home, and I will give the man the money"—I had sold him a small parcel of goods on the Friday before—that was for cash—it was the first time I had sold to him—after he was gone, I had the leather weighed—next morning I saw the leather loaded, and gave the invoice to Saxby—I told him to be sure to bring back the goods or the money—he left the yard with the goods at a little before eight o'clock, and returned a little after nine without the goods—(I suppose the distance from our place was about a mile and a half)—in consequence of what I heard from him, and by the direction of Mr. Vicary, I went with Saxby and the horse and cart, about eleven o'clock the same morning, to the prisoner's house—I knocked at the front-door, and spoke to a female—in consequence of what she said, I went round to the yard-door, knocked, but no one came—I waited about five minutes—I left Saxby there, and I went round again to the house-door—I knocked twice, and the door was opened by a female—I went in and went through the house into the warehouse—I saw the leather there—one of the parcels contained thirteen bales, of five butts each—I took up one of the bales, and opened the back-gate, and gave the bale to Saxby, who put it into the cart—I went back and attempted to get another bale, but the men in the yard locked the yard-gates; locked the warehouse-door, and locked me in and leather and all—I called to Saxby, who was outside, to come round to the house-door—he came into the house, and I came out and left him in charge—I went back to my employer, and communicated what had happened to Mr. Vicary—it was then about half-past eleven o'clock—I went back to the prisoner's house, and was let in at the front-door by the same female—I waited from half-past four till five—I then saw the prisoner—I asked him why he did not give the man the money as he promised—he said he had been disappointed of some money, and he could not—I said, "Well, then, I must have the goods"—he said that I should neither have goods nor money—I then sent Saxby to my employers, and after some more conversation with the prisoner, on the return of Saxby I sent for a policeman—the policeman said he did not know what it was, whether it was false pretences or a debt, and he could not detain the prisoner—at last, when I found I could not get the policeman to take him, I left—the prisoner told me I might stop as long as I liked, he should neither give me goods nor</p>

On Monday, 31st Dec, I assisted Mr. Wilks in weigh<lb></lb>ing the bales of leather—there were thirteen bales of light butts, and three bales of heavy butts—Mr. Wilks took the weights down—these are the cor<lb></lb>rect weights he took down—next morning I went with my master's cart to the prisoner's house in Ann's-place, about eight o'clock—I knocked at the door—a man opened it—I told him I had brought the bales of leather from Boutcher and Co.—he told me to drive round to the back gates—I drove round, and the gates were open—I stopped my cart outside the gates, and two men who were there told me to bring the goods in—I said I could not bring them in till I saw Mr. Tucker—the cart was outside, and I waited in<lb></lb>side—Mr Tucker came in a little while—I showed him the invoice, and told him I had brought the goods, and 1 was to have the money for them; I could not leave them without—I put the invoice into his hand—I never received it back again—he said, "Very well, that is all right, put them down here"—that was inside the gates—I put the goods down, and he said, "They must be weighed"—I assisted in weighing them—he put down the weights on a slate—he did not let me see it, he took it in-doorts, and told me to drive round to the front—I drove round to the front, and the prisoner came to the front and asked me if I should like to have a pint of beer, or a glass of gin, it being a cold morning—I said yes, and he gave me sixpence—that had not the effect of getting me away from the door—I was at the door outside—he shut the door, and said he should be ready for me in a minute or two—in two or three minutes he opened the door, and said there was 21bs. short weight—I believe that would make a difference of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him I knew nothing about the weight, my orders were to bring the money back, and I must have it or the goods—I said our scales were very correct, and his might make that dif<lb></lb>ference—he said, "Oh, my good man, don't be alarmed, I will go with you in the cart and settle with Mr. Wilks"—that threw me off my guard—he went and got his hat, and got in the cart, and went with me—when we got to the Swan, the prisoner said, "Which way are you going? I am going this way," pointing down Swan-street, which leads to the Grange-road—as soon as he said that he jumped out of the cart over the front—I asked him why he did not come to settle with my master, and I whipped the horse to prevent his getting out, but he got out and went down Swan-street—I went after him, and overtook him about 200 yards off—I asked him why he did not come with me and settle with Mr. Wilks—he turned round and told me not to insult him—I told him I did not insult him, all I wanted was for him to come and settle with Mr. Wilks as he promised—I followed him down as far as the Grange-road, and then be said he would come and settle with Mr. Wilks in an hour—he went on, and I went and told Mr. Wilks—it was then a little past nine—I went to ray breakfast, and on my return, by direction of one of the partners, Mr. Wilks and I took the horse and cart and went to the pri<lb></lb>soner's—we tried to get the leather—we got one bundle, containing five butts, and then were told we should neither have money nor leather, and we came home without money or goods.</p>

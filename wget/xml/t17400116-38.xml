A little before Six, I returned, and called upon my Wife for the Key of the Door; and having appointed to meet a Friend, at a publick House over-against our House, I took the Key from my Wife, and went to meet my Friend. But when I came against my own Door, I saw it open, and upon that I went cross the Way, and upon going into my House, I found the Kitchen Door open, and I had not gone above two or three Steps into the Kitchen, before the Prisoner ran against me. I laid hold of him by the Collar, and asked him what he did there, but I was so surprized, that I can't tell what Answer he made. He struck me, and I struck him, and we were both down on the Ground together in the Kitchen. He pulled from me, to get out of Doors, and he got into the Entry; I cried out, and threw him down again: after which he got to the Street Door, and the Neighbours heard me make a Noise. I tore his Cloaths sadly, - that I did, and I threw him down in the Street, when the People came to assist me, and secured him. After he was in hold, I went Home to see what was missing, and I soon saw a Shirt of mine was gone, and some Pieces of Camblet belonging to

               <p>Curd. No; it was totally dark; I could not distinguish him, nor know him, 'till he was taken into a House: but I am sure he never got out of my Hands, 'till he was taken. - He was sent to the Watch-house that Night, but he escaped from thence, and was not taken 'till Monday in the Christmas Week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says it was about Six o'Clock in the Evening, when he took hold of me, - but it was between Five and Six*.</p>

            . I was going that Day to Mr. Curd's House, about Four o'Clock in the Afternoon, and I met his Servant John Brown, within three or four Doors of the House, and he told me his Master was gone to see my Lord-Mayor's Show. About Six, I met Mr. Curd in Bishopsgate-Street, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160020"></xptr> told me he would meet me at Mr. Boocay's at the Two Fighting Cocks at Stepney. I went thither and heard, that Mr. Gates's Son had broke open a House. I did not know whose House had been broke, but I saw the Prisoner sitting in the House bald pated. I asked Mr. Boocay when he saw Mr. Curd? Why don't you go over the Way to him, says he, for 'tis his House that has been broke open, and his Wife is abroad? I ran over to him, and found a Hat upon the Table in the Kitchen: then I went to Mr. Boocay's again, and asked the Prisoner if he had no Accomplices with him? If no body stood at the Door, to watch, while he went into the Back-kitchen? He insisted upon it that no one was with him, and upon our asking him how he opened the Door, he said he opened it with one of the Keys which he had about him. I asked him, if he had any one to receive the Goods? He told us no, he intended to have carried them to pawn. As we were carrying him to the Watch-house, he desired me to speak to Mr. Curd to be easy with him, and he promised me, he would go aboard of a Ship the next Day.</p>

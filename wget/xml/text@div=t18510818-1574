                  </hi>. I am a smith and bell-hanger. Last Saturday week, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was on Ludgate-hill—I was not quite sober—I could have managed to walk home if I bad not been interrupted—the prisoner came up, laid hold of my arm, and offered to see me home—I had two sovereigns in my right hand waistcoat pocket, and some silver in the left—I had seen it safe a few minutes before—we walked some little way toge<lb></lb>ther—he put his hand into my pocket, took the money out, and ran away—a policeman followed him directly, brought him back, and I charged him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 357). I was on duty, and saw the prisoner go up to Lee, and take hold of his right arm—they walked some distance together—the prisoner lifted Lee's arm away from his body, put his left hand into his waistcoat pocket, and instantly ran down Aye Maria-lane—I ran after him, brought him back to Lee, and asked what he had lost—he said, "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—there was a man with the prisoner who escaped, and who I know by sight.</p>

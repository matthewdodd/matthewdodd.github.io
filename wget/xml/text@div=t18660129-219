                  </hi>. I carry on business at the South Sea House in Threadneedle-street and am the proprietor of the"Floating Cargoes Morn<lb></lb>and Evening List"—I know the prisoner, I believe he is the proprietor of a similar publication to mine—it is called, "Fermi's List"—that purports to give the same sort of information as my "Morning List"—on Saturday morn<lb></lb>ing, 23d December, about half-past ten, I was passing through the passage of Gresham House on the way to my office—it was a very dark morning and the passage was very dark—when I arrived in the middle of the passage, which is the darkest part of it, I felt several blows on my back accompanied by a stinging sensation—they were given from behind and I could not see anyone—I turned round, staggered, and fell down, striking a heavy blow on my left temple and left shoulder—the passage is paved with stones—I can<lb></lb>not say how many blows I received before I fell—I felt a good many—after I had fallen the blows were continued over my chest and abdomen—at that time I did not know what the wounds were inflicted with—I felt several punctures, but could not imagine what it was—it was dark and I did not see anyone—I did not make any resistance nor attempt to grapple with my assailant, and at that time I did not think of danger—I did not lose my senses—I was lifted by some one and I then felt great pain in every part of my body, but mostly in my back—with the assistance of two persons I was taken into Mr. Sparkley's office on the ground floor—I was there undressed and then I found I had been stabbed—there was blood in several parts—I had on an overcoat, undercoat, waistcoat, shirt, undershirt, drawers, and trousers—in the lower front pocket of my undercoat I had this diary, and these are some of the papers I had in my breast pocket—there are three marks on the diary produced by the stabs; one is nearly through it—that diary covered my abdomen—that would, in a measure, protect the groin—the papers I had in my breast pocket were also pierced in several places—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186601290031"></xptr>
               <p>the police officer came into Mr. Sparkley's office and showed me two spears—I believe this is the one that came in contact with the pocket-book and was bent—I was taken to the police-station in a cab—I was asked there in the prisoner's presence whether I thought he meant to murder me—I said I thought not—at that time I did not know how many stabs I had received, nor had I seen my diary nor the other papers, and I did not like to throw out the worst imputation against him—when I said I did not think he intended to murder me, he said, "I did"—he then said I had assassinated his six children—I have never seen his children—I then had the services of my own medical attendant, Dr. Pettifer, and am under his care now—I had thirteen wounds in my body; three in the back, eight in the groin, one on the left hip, and one on the right arm—they are independent of the stabs I received in my pocket-book, in which there are three, and there are four to be seen in my papers—altogether there were twenty stabs—I have not spoken to the prisoner for the last five years, and I have been very careful to avoid giving him any provocation—my "Evening List"appeared in 1858, and the "Morning List" was transferred from another proprietor—it has been in existence seven years—it was commenced in 1854 and was transferred to me in 1861—I have now forty-two or forty-three subscribers, and at the time when it was transferred to me I had only twenty-two—I believe the prisoner's paper was established in 1852.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long do you suppose this occupied from the time you were first struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say about a minute and a half or two minutes—nothing was said during that time—I think I have known the prisoner since 1858—he has behaved very strange at times—when I first started my "Evening List" in 1858 he constantly interfered with me, and when he understood I was going to take that from the "Morning List" we had a very long correspondence about it and he endeavoured to dissuade me from taking it—I should say that he may be sane on some points, but on the subject of his list he is most decidedly a monomaniac.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe that at the time he was stabbing you he knew whether he was doing right or wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he was then under the influence of an uncontrollable passion, and that he did not know what he was doing—I believe he has an office on Tower-hill, but I have never been there—I have seen him on 'Change.</p>

I am a porter, employed by the Gresham House Company, Old Broad-street—between ten and eleven on the morning of 23d December, I saw the prisoner about midway in the passage of Gresham House—it was a very dark morning and it is a covered passage—it is a public thoroughfare from Broad-street to Bishopsgate-street—I saw him standing over Mr. Dornbusch, stabbing at his body—MR. Dornbusch was lying on the ground—I could not see what he was stabbing him with; it was something bright—he dropped something before I got to him—I caught hold of his hands—he said, "He has assassinated six of my children"—he said that three or four times—afterwards I went for a policeman.</p>

               <p>the same time—I asked the prosecutor if he thought the prisoner intended to murder him, and he said he thought not—the prisoner then said, "I did, I did; he has assassinated six of my children; I have given him seven years to redeem it, and instead of getting better he gets worse"—he repeated that several times—the prosecutor appeared to be very weak and in great pain—the prisoner said Mr. Dornbusch had reduced him to poverty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at 88, Great Tower-street—the prisoner has had an office there about four years—for the last twelve months I have noticed something very strange about him—he was very excitable, and I should not have been surprised if he had destroyed himself—on the morning of 23d, he came to the office and appeared very strange.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know his wife and family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but not all his children—I have never visited his house—I have been housekeeper at this place nearly twelve years—he used to come about 10, 11, or 12 in the morning—on the morning of the 23d I gave him his key, and he gave it back again about five minutes afterwards, which was very unusual—I never saw these daggers before—he locked his door when he left—he paid me for taking care of his office—one day he had his desk turned round; shortly afterwards he had the man to put it back again into its original place—about two years ago, I told his wife that he was very strange, and during the last twelve months that strangeness has increased—I have never given information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Goal of Newgate—I have had experience in mental diseases—the prisoner has been under my supervision about five weeks—I have had many conversations with him for the purpose of judging the state of his mind, and my opinion is that he is of sound mind—I saw him on 24th December, and he was then perfectly capable of knowing right from wrong.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you had great experience in mental diseases? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have had some—I know it is a speciality—I consider I have had much more experience than most medical men, as I have had all the prisoners under my observation for more than ten years, and I am frequently applied to by Magistrates as to the state of the minds of the prisoners.</p>

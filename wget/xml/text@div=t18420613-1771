                  </hi>. I live at Hanworth. I know the prisoner and his brother, named John—he is not here—the prisoner is a labourer—I was at Hanworth on the 22nd of May, about six o'clock in the afternoon, when they were both together at the Bear, at Hanworth, and quarrelled (they had been at Hampton all the evening, and came to the Bear, and drank there, about half past ten o'clock) the prisoner got the worst of it—John knocked him down, then kicked him and stamped on him—he then left to go home—the prisoner was down when he left him—after he was gone the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, pulled his knife out, and said he would go and stab his brother before he got home—it was a clasp knife—he went after him—I followed, and saw him stab his brother in the stomach directly he got to him—the policeman came up, and sent me for a doctor—the prisoner was not taken till next morning—when he stabbed him, John said, "He has stabbed me"—I did not hear the prisoner say anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was sent for, and saw the nature of the wound—he was wounded on the right side, below the ribs of the abdomen—I should say a knife most probably did it—it was done by a cutting instrument—when I went into the room I found him lying on the bed in his clothes, which were saturated with blood, but the bleeding had then ceased—I closed the wound, dressed it, and went home—I was called between five and six o'clock the next morning, to say the bleeding had burst out again—I was obliged to open the wound, and apply different remedies—in the afternoon I gave the case up to his club doctor—I dared not attempt to ascertain the depth of the wound—a wound in that part is certainly dangerous—he was in imminent danger, and must have continued so for some time—there were also two small wounds on the back besides—they were slight wounds, only skin deep—they were recent wounds, and, I suspect, stabs.</p>

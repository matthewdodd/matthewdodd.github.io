            . I am servant to Mr. Carr. On the 6th of January the prisoner was carrying goods backwards and forwards into the warehouse; I saw him go from the warehouse into the necessary, and I observed something in his pockets. I informed Norman, the porter, of it, and told him to watch him. I took the candle and the lanthorn, and there I discovered the articles of earthen ware concealed in the necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what it was in his pockets. - A. No, I only saw a bulk. After he had left work, he was going home; about the distance of an hundred yards off I met him, and asked him what he had got about him; he said nothing but a cracked bason. I clapped my hand upon his bosom and told him I felt more than that; he immediately pulled out four basons from his bosom and gave them into my hands. We immediately took him to his master's house, and there were taken from him twelve cups and twelve saucers; they were distributed about his person, and some in the crown of his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the value of these articles - were they worth four shillings all together. - A. More than that.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

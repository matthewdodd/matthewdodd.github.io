                  </hi>. I am shipping-clerk to Mr. Taylor, of Tooley-street. On Sunday, 20th Jan., I was going home down the steps of London-bridge, I put my hand into my pocket and pulled out a piece of paper, with three or four shillings in it—I let the money fall—I picked up two shillings, and the sound of money brought a party up the steps again—I stood on one side near the wall—he came with violence against me, and pushed me down the steps—he was just before me when I got to the bottom—he turned round and hit me a violent blow on the mouth, which caused it to bleed, and knocked me backwards—I recovered my position, and called "Police!"—the policeman caught him under the dark arch, and I gave him into custody—there was plenty of room for us both to pass on the steps—I lost two shillings, and I think I picked up two.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 22nd of February, I saw the prisoner come into Mr. Herbert's place, in York-chambers, St. James's-street, and after a few minutes, he took a deal plank from the scaffolding-board, and walked out with it—the place was being repaired—I followed him to Duke-street, Piccadilly, and asked him who that property belonged to—he said, "To Mr. Herbert," and that he was employed by him—I then followed him without his knowing it, and at the bottom of Bury-street he crossed into Angel-court, and put it down there—he then came to the end of the court, and looked out, took it up, and went down into Pall-mall—I followed him, and gave him into custody in St. James's-park.</p>

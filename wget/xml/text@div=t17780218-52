On the 18th, I think it was of October, the last day of the sessions (it was very late at night before the sessions ended) I had engaged to go to Mrs. Reynolds at Richmond, supposing the sessions would finish early; I ran to Goldsmith's-hall; my carriage was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180050"></xptr> waiting for me; I did then as I commonly do, put my keys, money, and rings in an inner closet; I put this ring on an upper-shelf in the corner of the closet; I returned to town on Tuesday morning; when I went up to dinner, I saw this closet door open; I asked the meaning of it? Mrs. Reynolds said, the closet had not been cleaned out a long time, and she had employed this woman (the prisoner) to clean it, and that she had removed all the papers and things into a drawer; I turned over the papers, but could not find the ring; I called up the prisoner, and asked her what she had done with my ring which she had taken off the top shelf; she denied knowing any thing of it; I enquired of my other servant in town; then I went down to Richmond, and enquired if the servants had seen any thing of it there, or if it had been dropped in the chariot, but could hear nothing of it. On this day was three weeks, as I was going to the play, a young man came to Goldsmith's-hall to see if there was any notice left there of a ring being lost; I told him I had lost one myself; I described it to him; he said, a woman had left such a ring, and was to call again in the afternoon. I desired him to stop the person that brought it; in consequence of which, the prisoner was stopped.</p>

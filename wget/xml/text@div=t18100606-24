            . I am a watchman. On the 16th of May I was watchman at the corner of Long-lane, and at the White Bear, at half after eleven o'clock, I saw a man run from Long-lane, he ran as far as Carthusian-street; I cried out stop thief, he was stopped; I came up and took hold of him, he said, for God's sake let me go, I am not the man; directly the prosecutor came up, and said, that is the man that robbed me of my watch. I took him to the watchhouse. I saw the prisoner come from Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was in Long-lane at all. The gentlemen told me to stop; I said, there goes the man; they said, never mind, you stop; the watchman came up, and the prosecutor; I told them to hold my hands; they immediately took me to the watchhouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Norfolk-street, Curtain-road. On 27th July I was with the prisoner, and some other boys, <hi rend="italic">larking</hi>—I remember knocking the prisoner's cap off his head, but I did not know that I tore it—he jumped up to kick me—I prevented him, and said, "That will do, Thomas"—he went home and fetched his father and mother, and they came out, and promised to lock me up—it was about 2 o'clock, or a little after, when we began <hi rend="italic">larking</hi>—about 10 minutes to 4 o'clock I was at the top of Norfolk-gardens—the prisoner had been away for about an hour; he then came back, and walked by me four or five times—one of the <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> said,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French polisher, and live in Bateman's-buildings. On this Sunday, about 10 minutes to 4 o'clock, I was standing at the top of Norfolk-gardens—the prisoner walked up several times, and stood at the corner—one of the lads then said, "What is the matter, Thomas"—he instantly took a knife from his pocket, and struck Collinson over the right shoulder, and said, "That is what is the matter," and ran away—we took Collinson to the doctor's.</p>

I was at Norfolk-gardens—a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> named <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> Smith came out in a cap, and my brother and he changed caps—Collinson began to knock the caps about—the prisoner came round with his hands in hit pocket, and directly Collinson saw him he ran at him, knocked him about the head, and pulled his cap off—he said he did not like it—Collinson did it the more—Cluley went to fetch his father and mother, and said he should rue this day—Collinson, and <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and Anderson went to the top of the gardens, and sat down on the step of a door—in the meantime the prisoner came up, and stood against the post, about five minutes each tome, and the last time he made all manner of motions at me with his hand—Anderson said to him, "What is the matter, <hi rend="italic">Tommy?</hi>"—he said, "That is what's the matter," and stabbed Collinson in the right shoulder, and ran away—this was about an hour and a half after his cap had been pulled off.</p>

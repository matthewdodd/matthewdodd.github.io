               <p>Q. Did she come in at that door that stood open?</p>
               <p>M. Allen. No, she did not; she came by that, and in at the kitchen door ; I asked her how she came to open my mistress's room so soon; she answered she had not been in that room to day, then I went up stairs and missed the things mentioned in the indictment, and a great bundle of linnen not laid in the indictment; the silver things were taken from out of a closet, then I fainted away, when I came to myself I went down stairs and told the prisoner mistress had been robb'd, she went up with me and saw the same; then she begg'd of me not to say she had been out; then I went to a gentlewoman in the town to tell her the affair, and desir'd her to come and tell my mistress of it, she came and some other ladies with her. Mistress being lame justice Cross came to her house and examined the prisoner, she said she was innocent of the fact. She was committed to New-Prison for further examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of the goods again?</p>
               <p>M. Allen. Yes, my lord, they were all brought home on the Thursday following, by the High-gate noon stage coach, but who deliver'd them to the coachman I don't know.</p>

            : On Saturday, the 7th of May, in consequence of some information I had received, I went into the warehouse about half past eight in the morning; I immediately missed all the articles mentioned in the indictment, (enumerating them,) except the handkerchiefs, which I missed soon after.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts is the value of all that property? - A. The whole of it very near one hundred pounds; I saw it on the Friday evening, the night before; on Thursday, the 12th, I went to John Lench's house, in Horseshoe-alley, Moorfields, in company with Armstrong; Lench was not at home; we found two hundred and seventy handkerchiefs in a bed-room, up one pair of stairs; I immediately knew them all to be my property; the officer took the property; we found nothing else then; I saw Lench afterwards at the Office in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>PETER JEFFERY sworn. - I am a warehouseman belonging to Drake and Kay; I got up about half past seven the morning the property was lost; I went out for a walk; I left the porter in the warehouse; when Mr. Drake came, the property was missed; I saw the property found at Lench's house.</p>
               <p>LOUTHER JONES sworn. - I am porter to the prosecutors; I got up the morning of the robbery about a quarter past seven; I went out about five minutes to fetch water to sprinkle the warehouse; I shut the door after me, and locked it, and put the key in my pocket; I returned in less than five minutes, and found the lock shot out, but not into the ketch as it ought to be; I am sure it was in the ketch when I went out, for I pushed the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; in consequence of a search-warrant, I went to the house of Mr. Lench, in Horseshoe-alley, on Thursday, the 12th of May, about seven o'clock, or a little after, at night, in company with Mr. Drake, Jeffery, and Mason, another officer; I informed Mrs. Lench I had a warrant, and had these goods immediately produced to me out of a drawer by Mrs. Lench; it was a chest of drawers; there was nothing in the drawer but these handkerchiefs; Mr. Lench was not at home; I took the goods and Mrs. Lench to the Office that night, and she was committed; on Friday night, Mr. Lench surrendered at the Office, which was the first time I saw him; he is a master weaver, carries on a manufactory, and has a number of people working for him; I knew him before; he has lived there many years; Lench attended the Magistrate on Friday, and the two prisoners' names were given in by him; I knew the prisoners, and went in company with Ray, about eleven o'clock on Friday night, to a house, No. 10, in Leonard-street, pointed out by Lench as the house where Clarke lived, a little chandler's shop; we did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250044"></xptr>go in that night; in the morning I, Mason, and Ray, went to this house, and went in, and found a woman and child, but Clarke was not at home; I left Mason there, and went, in company with Ray, and apprehended the other prisoner in his bed-room, No. 3, Fox-court, Worship-street; we then went to a bookseller's, Postern-row, Tower-hill, and found Clarke at work there; I took him, and brought him to the house where we left Mason, No. 10, Leonard-street; I asked him if that was his house; he said, yes; I asked him if he had any lodgers; he said, no, none but him and his family, and that every thing there was his; I desired Mason to search, and in a cupboard I saw Mason pull out a handkerchief, which I desired him to take care of, for I believed it was some of the goods we were searching for; I found this bag at Clarke's, on the pillow of a bed, at the foot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You knew Lench very well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with a search-warrant, and though you knew him to be a master weaver, you detained his wife in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not appear till Friday night, and she was still detained in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Clarke at work at his usual employ? - A. Yes, at a bookbinder's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Lench? - A. A number of years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you ever know any harm of him? - A. No, I always thought him a man of independant property.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON sworn. - I am an officer of Worship-street; I was with Armstrong at Lench's house; I saw the things found that he has been mentioning; I was also at Clarke's house, and found the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mrs. Clarke told you that she bought it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you a married man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife has such a handkerchief, perhaps? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN RAY sworn. - I went with Mr. Lench to his house on Monday, the 16th of May, and Mr. Lench delivered this bag to me; he took it out of a drawer.</p>
               <p>JOHN LENCH sworn. - I live in Horseshoe-alley, Moorfields; I have known Chinnery many years, and the other prisoner about two years: On Saturday, the 7th of May, between twelve and one, I was reading the newspaper at a public-house, the Blue Bell, the bottom of Horseshoe-alley, there is a skittle-ground at the back of the house, which the back window looks to; Chinnery came out of the skittle-ground, and asked me how I did; I asked him the same; he said, he wanted to speak to me; I went about the space of a yard from where I was sitting; Chinnery said, his friend standing by, that was Clarke, had got something he thought might suit me; I asked him what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Clarke near enough to hear what he said? - A. Yes, he told me it was women's shawls; I told him I did not deal in those kind of things, I was no judge of them; Mr. Clarke then asked me if I would see them; I told him I had no objection, but they were articles I did not deal in; Clarke said, should he bring them to my house; I told him he might, if he pleased; he asked me what time; I told him I should be at home in half an hour, or a little more it might be; Clarke then went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Before Clarke went away, was there any conversation to whom the goods belonged? - A. I seemed to hesitate; Clarke said, I need not be afraid, they were honestly come by; I think he said he had them to sell for a friend; Chinnery went away, I believe, at the same time; I staid there about half an hour, and then went home; in about an hour from the time they left me, Clarke came to my house with some silk handkerchiefs, in a black linen bag.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at those handkerchiefs that lie by you? - A. I cannot swear to any of them; they are handkerchiefs of the same description.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that bag, was it that sort of bag? - A. It was a bag of this sort; the bag that Clarke brought them in I delivered to Ray when he went to my house on the Monday; when Clarke brought the handkerchiefs, I told him he might leave them, I was going to dinner, and that when I had dined, I would look over them; after dinner I looked over them, and put them up in the best manner I could, being so much tumbled; I told Clarke I should be some time looking over them, and if he would come to my house in two hours I should be ready; Clarke appointed me to meet him at the Green Dragon, Half Moon-alley, Bishopsgate-street Without, near about four o'clock in the afternoon; I went to the Green Dragon, and found both the prisoners there; Clarke asked me whether I had looked over them, and how many I made; I told him I made two hundred and fifty handkerchiefs; he said, he thought there might be more; Clarke talked first of selling them by the piece, then by the lump, at last I agreed to give him forty-five pounds for the whole; I paid Clarke the money in the presence of Chinnery.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they about when you came to the Green Dragon? - A.They appeared to have been eating, there were radish-tops on the table; I left the handkerchiefs at home; I put them in the bag again; when I returned home, I put them in a drawer in my bed-chamber, up one pair of stairs; on the Thursday following, I took out two or three parcels, and went to a master weaver, a Mr. Stevens, in the neighbourhood where I live; I shewed them to Mr. Stevens, and asked him if he would buy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250045"></xptr>Q.Where was this? - A. At Ruddock's-buildings, near Skinner-street, Shoreditch; I believe I went with them about half after two; he looked at them, and asked me what I asked for them.</p>
               <p>Q.You had some conversation about them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.After the officers had been at your house in your absence, did you go to Worship-street? - A. Yes, I sent my compliments to the Magistrate, and I would wait upon him in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not taken up at all, but went to the Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the story there you have been telling to day? - A. Yes, as near as could be; I was sent to New Prison that night, and was bailed on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Bailed to appear here, and give your evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife was discharged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. We have heard that you are a man of independant fortune - that you could have no temptation to mix in a dishonest business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You believed you were dealing in a perfectly honest transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Stevens, you told him how you came by these things? - A. Yes, he said he could give no such money as I asked; then I said I had made a bad bargain, for I had given more than I should have done; he said, they would be a dead stock, they were going out of fashion.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether you told Stevens the truth how you came by them? - A. I told Stevens I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell Stevens you took them for a bad debt? - A. No, I did not; I said, I had had a bad deal.</p>
               <p>Q. You enquired of this person, Clarke, what business he was, I suppose? - A.No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew what Chinnery was? - A. I heard he was a kind of a smith, that made small instruments for cases.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not a dealer in handkerchiefs? - A. No, that is very clear.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no curiosity to ask Chinnery what trade his friend was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a manufacturer - you know large quantities of goods don't commonly come into person's hands? - A. I cannot account for that.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag was found in your house? - A. I produced it.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no enquiry what trade the man was, nor went to his house to see what trade he was, nor asked Chinnery what trade he was? - A. No, I did not; I did suppose he was a bookbinder.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed he was a bookbinder, and therefore bought of him forty-five pounds worth of handkerchiefs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't deal in this sort of articles? - A. I deal in a variety of articles, and manufacture a great many articles.</p>
               <p>Q.Not handkerchiefs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you talk of this in the neighbourhood? - A. To no person but Stevens, whom I went to.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you went to the Magistrate, your wife was in custody? - A. I was not at home that night till half after eleven; then I heard of this matter of Mrs. Lench; the next day I sent to the Magistrate to tell him I would wait upon him; I have lived in the house thirty-six years, my character was never impeached before in any criminal way whatever during my natural life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say that this matter was brought home to you, if you did not get rid of it? - A. I never did; I never made use of any such expression.</p>
               <p>Q.Nothing at all to that purpose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you deal in? - A. I cannot tell you all I deal in; I manufacture all in the fancy way, tassels and fringes for garments.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrates committed you? - A. I was committed on Friday night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. This bag you found in your house, was it sent for by the Magistrate? - A.There was a bag produced at the Office, and I was desired to look at it; I looked at it, and could not take upon me to say it was the same bag; I thought it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there at the time? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go back to the house, and find this bag you now produce? - A. I did, and gave it to Mr. Ray.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in the employ of Messrs. Bardgett and Picard, of No. 149, Fenchurch-street—I do not know the prisoner. On 30th Dec a person called at the office—I do not know whether it was the prisoner or not, but to whoever it was I paid these two cheques to the account of Boddington and Co.—I do not recollect whether the person wrote a receipt, but it is usual to take receipts—I know nothing of the receipts on the back of the cheques—we have receipts on the back of the cheques or on the accounts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Messrs. Boddington. I know the prisoner, and have frequently seen him write—he kept the underwriting accounts—I should say that the receipt at the back of these two cheques of 30th Dec. is in the prisoner's writing—they are both in the same writing—that is a customary way of giving receipts—the prisoner had not received cheques before, to my knowledge—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was kept by the prisoner to put down particulars of moneys paid to him on the under-writing accounts—I find here a memorandum of a cheque for 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., from Bardgett and Picard to Mr. Davis—that agrees with the amount of the cheque (<hi rend="italic">reading the entry</hi>: "30th Dec, 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., cheque Bardgett")—the cheque for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not accounted for—if it had been received it ought to have been entered in the column which is now blank—this "Clm., loss," in pencil, is in the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>indicates that the cheque has passed through his hands—all these cheques are subject to discount—the gross amount would be the balance standing in our books—I am a clerk at Lloyd's—I sometimes receive cheques—I have handed them to the prisoner on many occasions, and then it was his duty to enter them here, and pass the cheque on to the cashier, Mr. Jelly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Boddington and Co. The prisoner was in our employ—it was his duty to post the ledger and agree the accounts—he kept this book—this page is in his writing, in reference to this case—here ate several columns—when money is received by the collecting clerk, it is his duty to hand it to the cashier, should he not be out, having crossed it "and Co.," or "Martin and Co."—should he be out he would hand it, most probably, to the prisoner, to enable him to check the amount of payments with the sum appearing due in our books—the prisoner was constantly in the habit of having possession of cheques for the purpose of checking them with the payments prior to posting them in the ledger—this "Clm. loss" is in his writing—that signifies that no moneys had been paid, so that it is accounted for by a loss—we have a collecting clerk for that particular department—I dare say the prisoner may have received money, but cannot speak positively to the fact—if he did, it was his duty to hand the cheque to Mr. Jelly, to be entered in the banker's book, and to make a memorandum—he has never accounted to me for the cheque, and never had our consent to appropriate it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi> Is there any other writing there of the prisoner's in that book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I do not think there is, unless it is the pencil memorandum of the word "Loss," and "Vivian and S."—I cannot speak positively to the next page; it is scrawly writing, which I cannot speak positively to at all—he had no authority to receive cheques, but if he did it would not have been looked upon in the light of an offence—the persons authorised to receive money are the collecting clerk, the cashier, and Mr. Boswill; but if by any chance Mr. Armstrong or Mr. Jelly wanted to pay money, it would be taken by one of the clerks—those persons do not each keep books, but the money is entered in our banker's book as soon as it is received; that book is a check upon the pass book—we have a cash book, but do not enter money in it—directly it is received, Mr. Jelly keeps it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a basket maker, of No. 44, St. John-street, Smith-field. On 10th April, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was going down King-street, Snow-hill—I saw the prisoner, with two other parties, standing against the wall—just as I passed them I felt a twitch at my pocket—I had my hand at my pocket at the time, because I had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket, and was going to my solicitor, in lincoln's-inn-fields—I turned round, and saw the prisoner deliberately throw the handkerchief away from his hand, between the leers of his accomplices—I directly laid hold of him, and a friend</p>

               <p>who was with me stooped down and picked it up—I saw him do so, and he kept possession of it till he gave it to the constable—I know I had it in my pocket shortly before this happened—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

            . The deceased was my husband. He came home with his forehead full of blood, tied up in a handkerchief, and was not easy all night. I asked him how he came by that hurt, but he would not tell me; this was on Sunday, Dec. 7. He went out the next morning, and return'd about 5 in the afternoon; he then complained his head was very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to drink much?</p>
               <p>S. Jolley. He did, more than he should; he was not a sober, regular man. On the Tuesday I found his head was sadly swell'd; he had a cut over his eye, and his eyes were black. I asked him how he came by that: he said he believed it would be his death; and told me it was Mrs. Mathews at the alehouse; tha t he went into her house drunk, and she struck him with a quart pot, and push'd him out at the door upon the ground. I went to her. The maid said, She can't be seen: then I went away. His head swell'd so that he could not see at all on the Wednesday; then I and another woman went to Mrs. Mathews's house, when Mrs. Mathews was sitting by the fire side. I said, I understand my husband was here on Sunday night, and you have used him very ill. The woman said, He is very ill, and if he dies he will lay his death to you. She fainted away, and, when she came to herself, asked me if I had had any advice for him, and sent me to her surgeon, and said she would pay him; the surgeon's name is Hewit, who sent him to Hyde-park infirmary. Mrs. Mathews paid 2 chairmen for carrying him there. He was carried on the Wednesday night, and died on the Saturday following.</p>

            . I was standing opposite the house, when I saw Mrs. Mathews push the prisoner out of the house; he got up from the ground, and went in again; he seemed to be in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such a push that would have thrown a sober man down?</p>
               <p>Crambourn. There are steps coming out of the door, and he ran down, and was a considerable time before he fell; he fell with his head near the channel, and his face to the ground: when he got up, his face was all over dirt.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Kren. I live in the Hop-Yard. I went to see the prisoner with the deceased's wife. We told her that Mr. Jolley was in a very bad way. She said she did push him out of doors, but did not think any thing bad would have attended that: she said, when he went in again she wash'd him, and said, she was very sorry for it, and fainted away: when she came to herself, she said if he died she should not desire but to be hang'd for him, for she should never enjoy a happy hour. She ordered me to go and fetch surgeon Hewit to attend him: I went, and he gave me a note to send the deceased to the hospital. I carried the note to Mrs. Mathews, and she ordered a chair for the deceased, and gave me the money to pay for it.</p>

            . The day after this accident happened I saw the deceased, when he said he had been at the woman's, at the Angel and Crown in St. Martin's lane; that she hit him with a quart pot, and push'd him out of doors; that she hit him once or twice with the pot, and that he was not able to work. He used to work with me. I saw him again on the Tuesday morning: he then could not hold up his head at all. I never saw him after that till he was dead.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Mathews. The deceased came into our house on Sunday in the afternoon, and made a great noise; my master was then dying. My mistress was up stairs, who came down and said, Pray Mr. Jolley don't make such a noise, for my husband is dying. Jolley was very drunk, and said, Whenever the constable dies his soul will go to hell. My Master was constable. She said get out of the house, for I cannot bear those words. He said, You are a Welch woman, let me have a halfpenny worth of gin. My mistress said, Pray go out: He refused to go out, upon which my mistress took him to the door, and shoved him out, after which I saw him fall down; if he had been sober he would not have fallen down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a quart pot in your mistress's hands ?</p>
               <p>S. Collet. No, I did not, and I was there from the beginning to the end of it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150009"></xptr>Mr. Hawkins. I am a surgeon, and live in St. George's hospital. I attended the deceased there; I found a small wound on the fore part of his head, on which was a sticking plaister, which was a very bad thing, and under that was a quantity of matter; there was a very great swelling and inflammation all over his face, and the fore part of his head. After he was dead I examined the wound: it did not go so far as the skull. I opened the head: there was no fracture on the skull, nor any kind of contusion. I examined the durn &amp;c pie meter of the brains: they were not at all affected; I thought they look'd a little red, but not inflam'd: upon the whole, I do not think the blow he receiv'd was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would have died so soon if he had not received that wound?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hawkins. No, I think he would not. He had not been properly taken care of by a surgeon, and I understood he drank hard, which made the wound worse; and the sticking plaister did him harm.</p>

            . I was at the prisoner's house when the deceased came in on the Sunday afternoon; he was very much in liquor, and kept making a noise. The prisoner came down stairs, and said to him, Dear man go out, for my husband is dying: he would not. She held the door in one hand, and shoved him out with the other, and he, being in liquor, fell down; had he not been in liquor he would not have fell.</p>

               <p>Russel. No, she had none; I was there all the time, and saw all that passed. He was in company with me, and no body else, and he was so drunk and he could hardly stand on his legs.</p>

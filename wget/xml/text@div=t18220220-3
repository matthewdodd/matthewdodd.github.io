On Sunday, the 3d of February, I was at home; and received some information, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; I went to the door, and found the front window open, sufficiently for a person to get in - there is a garden before the window railed round. I had been in the room five minutes before, the window was then shut, but not fastened; some linen which hung on a small horse in the room was gone; it was dark, I had lit my candle about five minutes before; the prisoner was taken before I knew any thing about it.</p>

            . I live at Yoell, in Surrey. On the 3d of February, I was passing Cook's house, and saw the prisoner standing at the gate - I passed him and saw another man come from the window with the clothes under his arm; they both went away together, I followed them, the other young man threw the things out of his arms, and ran off the prisoner stopped to pick them up, and I secured him and took him to the watch-house - the clothes were carried into the house; it was a few minutes past six o'clock when I first saw them, it was moonlight.</p>

I saw the prisoner and a boy run across the road from Cook's, Oakham followed, and stopped the prisoner, I went to his assistance; I had seen the other throw the linen into a garden, but some of it fell into the street. I picked most of it up, and carried it to Cook's - I first saw them five yards from Cook's gate, there was very little moonlight, and no daylight, it was nearly dark, and about half-past or a quarter past six o'clock when I left home.</p>

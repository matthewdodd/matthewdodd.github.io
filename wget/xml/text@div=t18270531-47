On the 19th of May I went out at half-past ten o'clock, in the morning, leaving the property stated in the indictment safe, and the prisoner in care of the premises - nobody was at home but him.

I immediately went and gave information to Jamieson - he was taken that morning.</p>

            . I am a publican. On the 19th of May Josephs came and gave me information, and about ten minutes afterwards the prisoner came in as a customer, and asked for a glass of ale. I detained him, and was going to send for an officer, but he bolted out of the door, I ran out and secured him about three hundred yards off, and took him to an officer - he was searched at the watch-house, and two tortoise shell combs, and a dress wig, were found on him, also 1l. 10s. in gold, and 111/2d. in copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have a free-and-easy club at your house? A. It is not a club, any one may come to it - they meet once a week: it is not composed of very young people.</p>

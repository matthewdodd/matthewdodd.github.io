The other man, who was taller than the prisoner, held a pistol to me, and told me to stand several times. I asked them what they wanted. It shocked me at first; after I recollected myself I stood still. That man said to the prisoner, Search him. The prisoner came up and searched me. I said, I will give you my money, if that is what you want; you have no occasion to rifle me. He put his hand in my right-hand breeches pocket, and took out four shillings in silver, and from my left-hand pocket he took out a guinea; then the other man that had the pistol said, Now feel for his watch. The answer I made to him was, If you must have the watch, I will give it you; here it is. I was going to take it out, but instead of that he took it out himself. Just as they had got it, a man came up, I t hink it was a brewer's servant; then they ran down towards the water-side. I told the brewer's servant I had been robbed. He and I ran after them. They jumped into a boat, and away they went. I saw them as far as Horse-Ferry, Ratcliff-Cross, by the light of the water. I saw the prisoner again at Sir

            . I am turnkey at Bridewell in the Borough. I think it was the 28th of April the prisoner came to me and said he had got something for my wife; (I knew him before;) he said it was a watch. He shewed it me, and offered it me for two guineas. I was not for buying it. Then he said he would go and pawn it; I then said, I will lend you two guineas upon it, and if you bring me the money again in a month's time, you shall have it. I then was thoughtful he had stole it. He left it with me. Soon after I saw it advertised. I knowing he was bound over to give evidence against people in Surry gaol, and as I knew not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100023"></xptr> where to find him, I got him to come within Bridewell, I turned the key upon him, and desired to know how he came by it. He said he got it at gaming. (The watch produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>One morning I met a short man in Nightingale-Lane. I knew him before. We went to a public house in East-Smithfield. He whispered to me he had got a watch he wanted to sell. I asked him how he came to have two; he said he fillupt his against the other and won it. He said he wanted money. I said I am going into the Borough, perhaps I can sell it for you. We went to the Borough. He desired me to get two guineas for it. I shewed it to Mr. Benton, and he gave me a guinea and a half for it.

            . I am a waterman. I was in a public house, the Lion man of war, near a fortnight ago, about twelve o'clock in the day, when the prisoner came in. I called him to drink part of my pint, knowing him. There was a young fellow asked him and me too if we would buy a watch; it looked the colour of gold. I had it not in my hand. I observed the gilt was off at the bottom of the case. (He takes the watch in his hand.) This is the very watch. The man seemed to be quite a stranger to each of us. They went out together, and left me in the house.</p>

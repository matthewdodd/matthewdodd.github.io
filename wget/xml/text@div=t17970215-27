               <p>Q. Did you know them? - A. I have seen them before several times; they called for a pint of purl, and paid me for it, and while I went to draw a pint of beer they went out of the house, and took my pot with them; I followed them out, and caught Connor's wife first; upon searching her, I found a quart pot and a half pint pot in her lap; I called a neighbour to hold the woman while I pursued the man; I pursued him, and brought him back, and in searching him I found a pint pot upon him, the pot in which the purl had been served; the pot is here; he said nothing in his defence; I took the pint pot from him, it was in his left hand pocket.</p>

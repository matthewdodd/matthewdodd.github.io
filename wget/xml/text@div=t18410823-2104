                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live in Goodge-street, Tot<lb></lb>tenham-court-road. On the 27th of July Dean came to ray shop, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—he asked for an ounce of salts, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he threw down a good half-crown—I had no change, he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead, and went away—in about ten minutes Cooper came in for a pennyworth of magnesia, and she threw down a half-crown—I saw it was bad, and I said, "This is bad money"—she was saying some<lb></lb>thing, I do not know what, when the officer came in and took her and the half-crown—he left her in my care, and fetched Dean in.</p>

On the 27th of July I was in Tottenham-court-road, in plain clothes—I saw the two prisoners walking together—I followed them into Goodge-strect—I saw Dean go into Mr. Edwards's—he remained about a minute, and Cooper waited a few doors lower down—Dean then came out of the shop, and went, to Cooper—he gave her something in her hand, and then she went into Mr. Edwards's shop—I followed, and saw her put down a half-crown—I told Mr. Ed<lb></lb>wards it was a bad one, and asked if he would give her into custody—he said, "No"—I took her into custody, and left her in Mr. Edwards's care while I went to the corner of Charlotte-street, where I found Dean—I took him—he said he knew nothing of the woman—I found on Dean a coun<lb></lb>terfeit crown, a good half-crown, a shilling, and a halfpenny—I found on Cooper two bundles of wood and a milk-jug—I had been watching them a quarter of an hour.</p>

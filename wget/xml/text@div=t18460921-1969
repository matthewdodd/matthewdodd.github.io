I am a tailor, and live in Granby—street, Waterloo—road—in the middle of Aug. the prisoner came tomy house to live with a woman, and agreed to pay me the rent by instalments, half on Wednesday and half on Saturday, which they did the first week—the second week went on till the Thursday—I named it, and he said, "You shall have it by—and—bye"—it went on till the Saturday, the middle of the day—I asked him, and he said, "You need not keep asking about your rent; if you do, I shall pay you and go"—I said, I do not care if you do"—I went into their room on the Sunday—I found they were both out, and missed a blanket—while I was there the prisoner came and said, "Did you think I was gone?"—I said, "Itlooked very much like it; you have shut the place up, and gone out"—he said, "You are not a fool"—I said, "No, not quite; but where is the blanket?"—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "Well, I shall keep you here till the policeman comes"—he went to the tea—caddy and gave me the duplicate of the blanket—he said, "Here is the ticket; will you forgive me, if I give you one shilling"—(it was pawned for one shilling)—I said, "No"—I took the shilling—he said, "You" are not going to turn me out"—I said, "No, but you must go down in the kitchen, and I lock this room up"—on the Monday my wife came home, and said, "They have got the counterpane."</p>

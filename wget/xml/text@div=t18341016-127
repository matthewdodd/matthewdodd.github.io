            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Shoreditch. On Saturday, the 9th of August, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop and offered me the parts of two broken tea-spoons - the bowls were off, and the letters had been battered, apparently with a stone, but I could trace a "G" and a "K," as the first and last letters - I asked him where he got them - he said he picked them up in Tooley-street - I detained him, and he was taken to the office - he was remanded, but no person appeared - the officer unfortunately gave him the spoons back, but I afterwards ascertained where they had been taken from, and he was taken again - I saw a spoon produced by the prosecutor - it had the letters, "D K," and a letter between, and the same hall mark on it, as those the prisoner brought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you find him? A. I informed the officer where he was most likely to be found- the hall mark denotes the year the spoons were made.</p>

             (police-constable D 207). On the 9th of August, I was sent for by Mr. Burgess, and received the prisoner into custody, with parts of two spoons - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160064"></xptr>was taken to the office, but there was no charge against him, and the magistrate suffered him to go, on his own promise to appear the next Monday, which he did; and as there was no further proof produced, the magistrate discharged him, and gave him the spoons - I had examined them very minutely - I could trace the last letter to be a K - I could not see what the two first were - my brother officer produced another spoon which exactly corresponded with those I had seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You examined the spoons produced by the pawnbroker, to ascertain what was on them, and you could not find the G? A. No - there has been no opportunity of comparing the spoons, except by recollection.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was he at work? A. At Mr. Charrington's brew-house.(The prisoner received a good character, and

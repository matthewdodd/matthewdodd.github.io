                  </hi>. I am a seaman now lodging at the Sailors' Home—I am a native of Providence, Rhode Island, and am 29 years of age—on 1st September last I joined the Mary E. Chapman, a British vessel sailing under the English flag—I joined her at Breeze Point in the Delaware river—on Monday morning, 3rd September, about 11, I was doing work on the forecastle splicing blocks—all the crew, except the watchman, were at work—tar was being used—one of the crew was a Chilian, known as Allis—the prisoner was the first mate—he said "The first son of a bitch that spills tar on the deck I will make him lick it up with his tongue"—Allis replied he would be d—d if he would lick it up for no man—the prisoner then took a handspike and struck the man twice on the head with both hands—he staggered to the rail, and I saw blood running down his face—the handspike is a piece of wood about 6 feet in length—it is used to heave the capstan—it was lying on the top-gallant forecastle, about 2 feet from the prisoner—Allis then went up the rigging to the top-gallant yard, and I saw him signalling to a man-of-war or a training-ship which was lying a little way off—the prisoner told him to come down, that he would not hurt him—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100020"></xptr>
               <p>Allis said he would not—the prisoner then ordered Osborn, the second mate, to go aloft to get him down—Osborn went aloft and asked to come down—he refused to do so—the prisoner again tried to get him down by speaking to him, and he then went aloft to the fore-top-gallant-yard—the man would not come down—the prisoner then came down and ordered the fre-top-gallant-yard to be lifted to the masthead—that was the place where Allis was—and Allis said to the prisoner and to all the men on deck "If I fall from this yard you will be responsible for it"—we did pull the halyards and he would not come down—Osborn told the prisoner that he was in danger of killing the man by lifting the yards aloft—Allis still remained up there—about an hour afterwards the prisoner went on shore—Allis was up the rigging altogether about two hours—when he came down I looked at his head—there seemed to be two wounds—one seemed to be soft, and there was a clot of blood—I touched it with my finger—I thought his skull was fractured—the skin and flesh was cut; one wound was on the top of the head, and the other near the temple—one was worse than the other—the flesh of both was cut—I thought the skull was fractured from the way the man seemed to act when he came down—he did not seem to be the same man he was before—he seemed to be a sort of delirious, as if his mind was not right—he went into the forecastle and from there to the galley to get his dinner—I did not see him jump overboard; I saw him in the water—at that time the prisoner was on shore, it was after he had had his dinner; I saw him have his dinner and afterwards saw him in the water, swimming for the shore—another sailor named King was also in the water swimming away—I heard Osborn ask Allis to come back—I heard Allis sing out "I am drowning," and he was drowned—the prisoner came on board next morning—we afterwards sailed to Antwerp—the Consul there was communicated with—the prisoner left the ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I joined the ship at Philadelphia—the crew consisted of eight men before the mast; there were three officers, the captain, chief mate, and second mate—the crew were mostly foreigners—all wore knives, some with lanyards and some with sheaths—the work began at 6 o'clock in the morning—I heard the mate give orders to the crew to be careful not to spill the tar—some tar was spilt by Allis—I think the prisoner called his attention to it—Allis was very insolent—the mate did not say "You would be more careful if you had to lick it up;" I did not hear him say that—I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advance-note before joining the vessel—I have been at sea 11 years—Allis spoke in English at the time he swore at the mate; he had got his knife on him—I did not see him turn round and face the mate with the knife in his hand; I swear he did not—his manner was threatening and defiant, as well as insolent—I heard the mate say that he had had another crew, a mixed crew, on board before I joined—I did not hear him say that he had had a great deal of trouble with that crew—the work that was being done at this time was being done with the capstan-bars, one of which the mate took in his hand; he did not take it up till Allis had sworn at him—he ought to have obeyed the order to come down from the rigging—when the prisoner went up the rigging to him Allis had the knife in his hand in a threatening manner—three men set off to swim ashore, King, Langford, and Allis, while the prisoner was on shore—it was about half an hour after the prisoner left the ship that Allis came down—he went to the cook—I don't know whether the cook</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100021"></xptr>
               <p>had charge of the rum—the prisoner told me he was going on shore to see the captain; he did not Bay it was to report the mutinous state of the crew—he spoke to me with regard to where this man lived when he was in Philadelphia—he said he must go and speak to the captain about what had taken place—when Allis came down on deck I told him that the mate had gone on shore to tell the captain of his conduct—when, he was swimming ashore Osborn called to him to come back, and he fired a pistol to frighten him, not to hurt him—the foreigners had been rather trouble<lb></lb>some and obstreperous since the day they joined—I did not see that Allis had been behaving badly before this; he associated with me mostly—the tide was running very fast, about five miles an hour, when he was swimming—the Delaware is about a mile and a-half across—it would not be an easy thing for a man in ordinary health to swim ashore with the tide running at that rate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Just before the prisoner went on shore he asked me where Allis lived or boarded when he was on shore, and said he was going to see the captain—I did not hear him say anything to the crew; he called me aft and spoke to me privately—Allis had his knife out of the sheath at the time he was struck, and was working at the stays—I did not see him do anything more than use the expression he would be d——d if he would lick up the tar; he said that about a minute and a half or two minutes before he was struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a native of Fort George, Nova Scotia—I was a seaman on board the Mary E. Chapman—I joined on 6th June at Hamburg—on this 3rd September I heard some noise and saw Allis jump off the forecastle-head and the prisoner after him, with the capstan<lb></lb>bar in his hand—I did not see him do anything with it—I did not see whether Allis had been injured at that time—I saw him go up the rigging—afterwards, when he came down, I saw that his head was injured—I did not hear any conversation before he jumped off the forecastle-head with the capstan-bar—I was not at work with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A different crew joined at Hamburg from that which went from Liverpool to New York—the crew that went from Hamburg to Philadelphia was a crew of mixed nationalities—they all deserted at Philadelphia except myself, and they were obliged to take another mixed crew there, in distress—I don't know whether Allis had been on shore between the time he joined the ship and the time the crew had deserted—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100022"></xptr>
               <p>I did not see the injury done with, the capstan-bar—I did not see Allis speaking and acting in an insolent manner to the mate; I was in my bed—the yard is not very often hoisted when men are on it—they are generally called off; if they can't get off they are cautioned to hold on; they don't come down on deck—I believe Allis had his arms round the yard, I did not take particular notice—I saw him signalling to the man-of-war—there was one Greek on board, I believe, and some Italians.</p>

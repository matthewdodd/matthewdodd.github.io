                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant colonel, and live at 6, Victoria-terrace, Lee—on the afternoon of 10th January, about 5 o'clock, I was leaving St. Paul's Cathedral with my ward, Miss Cherry, when my attention was called by her having hold of the female prisoner—I did not see the purse in her hand—I picked it up—the female prisoner called my attention to it—she looked down at my feet and said, "What is that"—I was then holding her, and was in the act of stooping down to pick it up, and she wrestled herself from my grasp, ran down the stairs, and ran away—I immediately followed her, and as I got out of the iron-gates, just round the iron gates, the male prisoner threw his arms out and said, "Hollo! what's this?" or something of that kind, and endeavoured to stop me—I threw him on one side, continued the pursuit, and caught the woman about a hundred yards from the Cathedral Coffee-house, I think it is—after I had seized her, the male prisoner again came up, and attempted to get me away from her, but there was a crowd then—a policeman came up, and took them both in charge, and walked them off to the station.</p>

January; I was on duty near Sir Robert Peel's statue, at the end of St. Paul's Churchyard and Cheapside—I saw a crowd very suddenly assemble, and ran over to see what it was—I saw Colonel Hillyard holding the female prisoner by the arm—I immediately seized her, and asked him what was the matter—he said, "She has been picking a lady's pocket outside the cathedral; "the male prisoner immediately ran up and com<lb></lb>menced throwing his arms out, and using bad languages, saying, 'Leave my wife alone; it is my wife'"—I asked him if she was his wife—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I shall take you in custody as well;" and I did so—he did nothing more then.</p>

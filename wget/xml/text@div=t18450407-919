                  </hi>. I live at Berkhamstead; the prisoner was in my service, and left on the 3rd of Feb. I then lived in Hyde Park Gardens—after she left me I removed to Berkhamstead, and then a gown and several other things were missed—I had not missed most of the things which are here, but they were found in the box, and I know they are mine—the table-cloths and other things were in common use—I went with the officer, and found them in the box and the bundle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you had a very good character with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the great mass of these articles are table-cloths and other household things—some of them are female apparel—the prisoner was my wife's lady's-maid—if she had given anything to her maid she would have communicated it to me, if it had been table-linen, not if articles of dress—I do not know that she might not have given an old towel or so, but not new things—Mrs. Finch is not well, and is not here—she did not appear before the Magistrate; her health would not allow it—I did not mark this linen myself, but there is the mark on it—here is the mark on this table-cloth—Mrs. Finch does not keep her bed—she has been out every day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Shoreditch. On the night of the 7th May I was in Holborn, and felt something at my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—he ran Toss to Farringdon-street, and tried to conceal it under his coat—I caught hold of him, and called "Police," an officer came up, and he dropped the handkerchief—a lady took it up, and gave it to the officer.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you drunk or sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sober—not perfectly sober, but I knew what I was about—I never lost sight of you—I did not see you drop the handkerchief—it dropped from under your coat—you did not throw it away—I saw the lady pick it up at your feet, and had seen it before in your hand—I have been a prosecutor in this Court four or five times, not about picking pockets, but shoplifting—I am a shopman—you were going towards Snow-hill at the time you were stopped—I was never refused my expenses in this Court—I am not an amateur thief-taker—I came to swear to property stolen—I do not go out to look after thieves—I was not reeling about and insulting persons on that day—I did not lose sight of you—I did not say, at the station-house, there were two men behind me—the female who picked up the handkerchief could not have taken it—there was no omnibus or cab passing at the time you were stopped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I had been to a religious meeting, and was going to Queenhithe to meet my sister—on Snow-hill I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I walked quickly to the corner of. Farringdon-street—the prose<lb></lb>cutor collared me, and said, "You have stolen my handkerchief"—I said, "I will walk quietly with you; if I stole it, it must be in my possession" I went with him to the station, and in about ten minutes after it was brought there, and he identified it—I had my own handkerchief in my hand at the time.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

             sworn. - I am the son of the prosecutor: I was in the front of the shop helping to load a cart. On Saturday, the 22d of December, one of the men came forward, and desired me to take notice of the prisoner; I followed him out at the door, and took the rivets from him; I asked him what he had got in his pocket; he said, he had nothing; I then took the rivets out of his pocket, and he said, they were to make a soldering iron for a friend, who had asked him several times to get him one. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER ROSIER sworn. - I am journeyman to Mr. Smith: On the 22d of December, I was desired to go backwards and cord up a chest; I saw the prisoner stooping down and taking up these nails, and putting them in his pocket; I informed my young master of it, and he took them out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they nails or rivets? - A. They may be called rivets by people that don't know any thing about it; we call them nails.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. A nail has a point, a rivet has none; these are, most undoubedtly, rivets, they have no points.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I took the two rivets from my master's. A friend of mine wanted a soldering iron, and he told me, two of our rivets would answer his purpose, and if I would bring him two, he would give me something to drink, and would pay my master for them; I mentioned it to the people in the shop; I did not mean to rob my master; I have worked for him very near four years; the witness and I had had some words the day before, and he told it out of spite.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t17990109-33-verdict201" type="verdictDescription">

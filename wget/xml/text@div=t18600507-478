I am brother of the last witness—on the evening of 10th April, I was in the shop, there was a cry at the door that the soldiers were coming after the policemen who had the man in custody—there were about eighteen or twenty soldiers, they had sticks in their hands and were throwing stones—the police were not able to contend with them; there were too many of them, and the police brought their prisoner into our shop—the soldiers came in after them; they got into the private part of the house, and into the garden, and every part—they poured in and filled the house, and they were all in action throwing stones and potatoes and anything they could lay hold of—they broke the window and burst the door open—the prisoner Murray took a quarter of a cwt. and threw it at me, saying, "Charge, you b—r"—it did not hit me, for while he was throwing it at me another soldier came to the scales and got another weight to throw at me, that broke the fall of the weight, so that instead of hitting me it fell on my toes—Murray's manner was very violent—one of them got the scales down, there were three of them about the scales—they took one of the shutters from the door and tried to burst the private door open—we had shut it, and it was broken open again—Murray was intoxicated—those who were outside were throwing stones and potatoes into the shop.</p>

On Thursday, the 25th of Sept., in consequence of information, I went to No. 15, White Bear-gardens, Kingsland-road—there is a private door to the house—it was shut—I knocked twice, and it was opened by the prisoner—I asked if his name was Reynolds—he said yes—I stepped in and laid hold of him—he said, "It is no use, you have got me to-rights"—I then told ser<lb></lb>geant Price, who was with me, to hold his hands—I commenced searching his pockets, and I think the words he said were, "I will give it to you, putting his hand up towards his waistcoat pocket—I put my hand into that pocket, and found there three counterfeit half-crowns, which are now among five others found afterwards, and I cannot point them out—we then took the prisoner up stairs into the front room first floor, and found a</p>

This mould produced by Teakle is for casting counterfeit half-crowns—it has both sides of the impression, and is complete in all its parts, and with the application of metal would cast a counterfeit half-crown—here is an<lb></lb>other plaster-of-Paris mould, with the impression of both sides of a shilling, complete in all respects—this tobacco-pipe has a portion of white metal about it, as if used to lade the metal from the pipkin to the mould—these spoons are Britannia metal—one appears to have been broken and partly melted—it it the metal of which counterfeit coin is generally made—these eight half-crowns are all counterfeit, and made of that sort of metal, fit for circulation—here are fourteen counterfeit shillings of the same sort of metal, fit for circulation—a file is used to remove any surpluss metal from the edges of the counterfeit coin—it appears to have white metal in the teeth of it—the pipkin has white metal in it, which appears to have been fused—sand may be used to remove the roughness from the coin—these bands are to form the moulds while the plaster-of-Paris is in a fluid state—here is another mould with both sides of a counterfeit half-crown, but the channel has not been cut—here is a good half-crown which produced the mould.</p>

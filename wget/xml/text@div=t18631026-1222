                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I live at 2, Woburn-court—on the night of 5th October I had returned from Margate, where I had been professionally engaged—I am a musician in the band of the Lincoln's-inn Rifle Corps—about ten minutes after 12 I came through Soho—square into Holborn—I had a piece of paper with me, with the direction of my lodging on it—I met the two boys (Greenhoe and Southard) and gave them the direction to show me Holborn-court—they looked at the direction and told me to come along with them—instead of taking me there they took me in another direction—I don't know the name of the street—the first street they took me into was Arthur-street, and then they took me into another—the tall prisoner (McCarthy) then caught hold of me by the throat, and they took my watch and ran away—I don't know which took my watch, I was insensible, from their having their hands round my throat—my watch had a guard to it, with a bar through my button-hole—they took the guard also—there was a lamp about thirty yards from where this happened—the two I know well, because I saw them when I gave them the direction, and the other one I recognised in the street before he seized me by the throat—I met a gentleman who could speak Italian, and went with him to a policeman I gave him a description of the persons who had robbed me—I went with the policeman to a kitchen where there were eight or nine persons—three of them were playing cards with a stout man—I saw all the prisoners there and pointed them out to the policeman.</p>

On the morning of 5th October, I was on duty in New Oxford-street—the prosecutor came to me about a quarter or twenty minutes past 12—he mentioned the word "watch" and made signs that it was gone—I took him to the station, not being able to understand him—I then went with him to ascertain where the watch was taken from him—he took me to the corner of Arthur-street—I asked him in what direction they went—he pointed down Arthur-street, and I went with him—I saw a coffee-shop open and went in—a foreigner was there who understood the prosecutor, and we went together down Church-lane, to a cellar—he pointed down the stairs as the place where the men went—I took him down into the cellar and told the gentleman to look round, and if he saw any of the men to point them out—he looked round but did not point out any one at that time—we went back to the station, and the prosecutor there intimated that he had seen some of the party in the cellar—we went back again with two more constables, and he pointed out the prisoners—I took them into custody—they said they knew nothing about it.</p>

               <p>the time I came into the kitchin till 1 in the morning he was there listening to a man reading a book, and the other two lads were asleep on a form opposite—I am quite certain he did not leave the place till the police took him out—he was sitting on the same form with me, only two persons from me.</p>

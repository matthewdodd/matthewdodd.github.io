                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew on the Saturday before the matter came before the Magistrates that a summons had been taken out—I was in Leyton with Mr. Hollow, a corn merchant, at that time—I was at the police-court, but was not called as a witness—I expect that was on account of the solicitor—White was there, my brother Alfred, and Mr. Wyatt—I heard the Magistrate say there was no occasion to call witnesses for the defence, there was enough to commit him on—I was last in regular employment with Robert Tucker, general merchant, 2, Gresham Buildings, Basinghall Street—I have been to Mr. Hollow's since as a friend—I don't know that he turned me out—I am living with my parents—they are keeping me—I was not horse dealing, I merely lent Upton 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the first place to pay the deposit on this horse, and I thought I would go halves with it—I got my money back when we were paid the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the horse—I hare bought two horses before, about two years ago I should think—I never sold them for such an amount as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have known of lots of horses being sold for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and less—the shilling was to "buy the deal "as it is termed—I did not hear the prisoner say to Mrs. Grist "We have bought a horse and you have got to pay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—she did not say to my belief "Does my husband know about this?"—if she had I must have heard her—I will swear positively she did not—the prisoner did not say "Yes, Charlie knows all about it"—his name was mentioned—she did not say "Are you sure my husband sent this horse?"—there was nothing said about the horse being sent by the husband—I said nothing to her about the son buying the horse as she was paying the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner did not say "Yes, Charlie sent me"—she did not see the horse to my belief—her son said "Mother, I have bought a horse"—I heard that the horse was sent to Upton about 7 p.m. on the 28th—I never spoke to Mr. Grist since—I got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of it—I might have been at the Blackbirds public-house on the 28th or 28th—it is just opposite Mr. Grist's shop—we went in there after we sold the horse on the 27th—I did not say "We have done Charlie out of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I swear that; nor did the others in my presence.</p>

George White. I live at Romford Road, Stratford—on the 26th August I was with the Swifts, Wyatt, and Upton when I saw Grist, jun., standing just inside the shop gate—he said to Edward Swift "Are you going to take my money?" and Edward Swift said, "What money is that?"—Grist said, "The five guineas I offered you"—Edward Swift said, "No, give me a sovereign more and it is yours"—that is all I heard—he said he would not give the sovereign more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and print the bill-heads for Grist and Son, and have done so for the last two years—it has been "Grist and Son" the whole time—I have never been blamed for its being a mistake—I submit my proofs before I take the order—I should think I should not print "Brown and Son" or "Grist and Son" without instructions—on the Thursday morning I was passing the shop when I heard Grist distinctly tell the boy to take the horse back to Mr. Upton—as he was gone so long Mr. Grist, senior, asked me to go up and hear what the conversation was between them—I went to Upton's shop, and saw Upton and young Grist together with the horse—Upton turned round to Grist and said, "Didn't you buy the horse?" and the son said, "I did"—then he said to Grist again, "Didn't your father know all about it?" and he said, "Yes, it was with my own money that I bought it; father had no business to have anything to do with it, only he wouldn't let me keep it"—as they turned round I said to Grist, junior, "The best thing you can do is to take the horse back under the circumstances"—he said, "I mustn't do that, you know what father is"—Upton's is a butcher's shop, certainly not a cat's-meat shop—Mr. Upton is as respectable a butcher as Mr. Grist, I should think more so—he has hit carts and sends round for orders—I have no interest in the matter, I lose money by it—I shan't do any more printing for them, I believe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Murray and another, No. 30, Cornhill. On 25th May, the prisoner came and wanted to buy an Albert chain—I took out a tray that contained a dozen chains; I counted them before I took them out—I placed them on the counter before him; he took the heaviest one of the lot in his hand—he asked the price; I told him fifteen guineas—the pattern of it did not suit him, he wanted one stout in the middle and taper at each end; we had none of that pattern, and I told him I could let him have one the next day—he then took up two other chains, he kept them in his right hand, and tried the weight of them—he then asked me to show him some chains which were in the next glass case—I opened the door and watched the movement of his hands—I took the first chain out, and at that moment I saw a rush with his hand, and the two chains were gone—I put my chain back again, and told him I supposed it would not suit him—he said, "Very well!"—I said if he called to-morrow he might have them—I</p>

               <p>allowed him to go—I accompanied him to the door, but I <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> him back, and said, "You are a swindler, you have taken two chains"—he said, "You are mistaken"—he put his hand into his coat pocket and took out two chains, and threw them on the counter, they were worth 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him in charge.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been in this country? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three years—I am a German—the prisoner remained in the shop about three minutes after I saw this movement of the chains—I did not charge him with taking them—I thought it would be more value to allow him to go out of the shop with the goods—I was not acquainted with the law—I thought, when he went out, to fetch him back, and find the property on him; I thought the punishment would be stronger. During that three minutes I showed him another pattern, and in the mean time I counted my chains, and missed two of them; I counted them twice before he left the shop—he left immediately after I counted them tho second time—he had only gone from the shop outside into the passage—he had not got into the street, only one step in the passage—I could not call a police<lb></lb>man; I was alone in the shop—when I saw him make the move, I did not say anything to him about the chains; I counted them twice to be sure; I was sure the first time—he might see me count them, I was behind the counter—I kept him waiting three minutes, showing him the chains—I was not talking while I was counting them—he went out, and I went after him—I have said that I counted them in a hurry; it was two or three minutes before the policeman came—I left the prisoner in the shop with my <hi rend="italic">governor's</hi> brother—I stood in the passage and called a policeman—the chains the prisoner took were coloured—they are not here, I thought it was not necessary; there were two chains taken to the Police Court—I was not able to swear that they were the two he took, he threw them amongst the lot—I said, "I think these are the two he took"—he did not say anything about the price; there was another mysterious move—he stepped forward, I rushed immediately behind the counter, and saw him throw the two chains, but they were amongst the lot, I could not see which they were—I could not say that they remained on the top—there has been no property lost since I have been there.</p>

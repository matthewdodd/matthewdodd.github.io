                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Ingleby, of Blue Style House, Greenwich—it is an academy—I have been there three months. On Thursday night, 18th November, at 7 o'clock, I took these finger-plates off the drawing-room door, and these three pieces of brass for the key-holes from the dining-room door—nobody gave me leave to do so—after I had stolen them I took them to the prisoner's the same night—he keeps a marine-store shop at the top of Rose-street—I put them in the scale and said nothing—he did not ask me any questions, but gave me 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 114). On Friday afternoon, 19th November, at half-past 2 o'clock, I went by Mr. Ingleby's direction to the prisoner's shop, 1, Strait's-mouth, Greenwich—he is a marine-store dealer—I found him in the shop, and asked him if he had bought any brass of any description yesterday—he said, "No"—I pointed to his shop door, and said, "Some brasses that fit on the doors; I believe they were brought about the evening part of the day"—he said, "I do not remember it"—I did not tell him who I supposed had brought them—I said, "Is your book in the shop?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Is there any entry of it?"—he looked, and said, "No;" and I looked, and there was none—I told him that I must take him in custody, and take him to Mr. Ingleby's house—he said again, "I do not remember buying them"—we then went to Mr. Ingleby's, and I took him into the presence of the boy White, and said, "Is this the man you say you sold them to?"—he said, "Yes;" and the prisoner said, "I do not recol<lb></lb>lect you; I do not remember buying them; if we had given it a thought I might as well have looked into the metal bag"—after he was taken to the station I went and searched his shop—I got the metal bag out; his wife directed me to it, but I could not find the plates, and commenced searching round the counter—the wife seemed rather excited, and went down stairs and brought these plates up in a wooden box—they were so hot that I could not take them away till they were cool—these three escutcheons were in the shop—they were not hot—I took them to the school, and found that they fitted—I did not fit this broken one—I went back to the station, and showed them to Parker—he said, "I do not remember buying them, I have no recollection."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Kennington. In the afternoon of 22nd Feb. I was in Kennington-lane—I had two or three dupli<lb></lb>cates in my purse—I went into a house, and received two sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In silver—I left there, and went to Mr. Rent's—I then missed my purse and money—I went back to Mr. Harrison's, where I had been before, and inquired—I gave information to the police—Mr. Har<lb></lb>rison's is a few houses from the corner of Devonshire-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Devonshire-street, Kennington-lane, and am a lighterman. On 22nd Feb., at a little after two o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, I was coming up Devonshire-place—I saw the prisoner about five yards ahead of me, and when he had got a few doors round the corner, I saw a dark purse on the ground, with bright steel slides, and full at both ends—the prisoner stooped down and picked it up—I said, "You have got a good prize there"—he said nothing, but looked at me and crossed the road—he went down Loughborough-street, and examined something—he dropped what appeared to me to he a piece of paper—he picked it up, and went down the street—I saw a policeman, who spoke to the prisoner—he pulled out his pocket-book, and gave a card—I was not more than three feet behind him when he picked up the purse—I saw it on the ground before he got to the spot—it was between Mr. Harrison's house and the next house, and five doors from Devonshire-place.</p>

Bartlett pointed out the prisoner to me—I stopped him, and asked him if he had picked up a purse—he motioned that he did not understand English—I stooped as if to pick up something, and asked him if he had picked up anything—he said, "No, me pick up nothing"—he took out his pocket-book, and gave me his card—he went towards Westminster-bridge—I followed him a little way, and then came back and met the lady—she said she had lost her purse, containing 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went after the prisoner, but could not see him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Hallett, of Broad-wall, Lambeth. This cloth, three pairs of trowsers, and three coats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine, and were safe in a little sitting room on the ground floor of Mr. Hallett's house, when I went to bed, at 1 o'clock, yesterday morning—I bolted the entrance door before I went to bed, and when I came down, to let our workmen in, at 5 minutes before 6 o'clock in the morning, it was standing open—the window of the small parlour is not quite four feet from the ground—I found it open—a person could get in there—I cannot swear that it was closed the night before—this pair of light trowsers I cut short myself, and put the pieces into a drawer in the same room, which was shut, but not locked—I did not miss the pieces till they were shown to me—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). About a quarter past 6 o'clock, yesterday morning, I went to the prosecutor's premises, and found the place had been robbed—I found traces over a shed in the rear of No. 40, Broad-wall, which led me to a yard of another house at the rear of the prosecutor's house—I entered that house by the front door, and found this property, covered up with this coat, in which I found the bottoms of a pair of trowsers, one piece in each pocket—afterwards, about 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner within thirty yards on the opposite side of the way to where I found the property, and took him into custody—I told him it was for breaking into the premises at the back of No. 45, and taking some property—he said he knew nothing at all about it</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, of Halford-street. The prisoner is my brother—I know this jacket; I made my brother a present of it about a month ago, and he wore it occasionally when he was out with the cart—he has sometimes worked with me since he left Ipswich, on and off, earning his victuals—he wore it a day or two previously—he left me the night before, a little after 9 o'clock, between 9 and 10 o'clock, and said he was going to wash himself—I pay the rent of the house No. 45, and have lodgers there, and in the garret I sometimes put sacks of potatoes—the place is in a miserable state altogether—there are no locks on it—I partly occupy it.</p>

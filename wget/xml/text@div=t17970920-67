               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. I was in hopes your wrath towards this poor man would have been abated by this time; there was a scuffle between you; you charged him, and he charged you? - A.Exactly as I said before.</p>

               <p>Q. And that as early as the Saturday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He called upon you on the Tuesday again, so that there was ample time to have removed any thing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am very sorry that he was rude enough, even, I believe, to assault you? - A. I gave the assault first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever till that think of pursuing him for robbing you? - A. I had been well informed before that he had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. He was an extremely ingenious man? - A. I have taken pains to make him so; he was a very useful man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a custom in your business, that journeymen are entrusted with and keep the tools for a considerable time? - A. Not off the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the tools are wanted where the organ is put up? - A.The tools that are here spoken of, are tools that we use for making our work; when we go to put up an organ, screw-drivers and pincers only are wanted; I have said to this man a number of times, that I have been told that he has hawked pipes about the trade, and he denied that he ever had done it.</p>
               <p>Q. He had done work for others in the trade? - A. But he could not conceive that I would lend him my tools to do it.</p>
               <p>Q.On the Saturday he came to you to know what he was to do, wishing to continue in your employment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, after you had shewn this anger, you never took any steps till Tuesday? - A. No.</p>
               <p>BOWYER sworn. - I am an officer belong ing to Queen-square; I went with Mr. Avery to search the prisoner's lodgings; the prisoner at first hesitated to let us search; he asked by what authority; I told him I had a search warrant, and then he said I was welcome to search, for he had no property whatever of Mr. Avery's; Mr. Avery picked out these articles, and claimed them; he said, some of these things were Mr. Avery's; that he had had them to finish some work.

               <p>Jury. Q. Did you take the plane home to cut it? - A. Yes; I took it over night from Mr. Avery's shop, and returned it the next morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.What young man was it gave you this wood? - A. He was a German, named Frederick; it is five or six years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give it to the prisoner? - A. A great while.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years have they been made? - A. Not one year.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were they not made of Mr. Avery's wood? - A. No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Craile? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it every your property? - A. No, it is Mr. Robson's; I was with him when he bought it at a timber-yard, in Little St. Martin's-lane; I do not recollect the gentleman's name; it is about six months ago; he gave near upon 7d. a foot for it; I bought, at the same time, two half-inch deals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Have you ever made application there to know if they could remember the young man buying such a thing? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q.You undertake to swear, that that is the same piece of wood? - A.No, I do not; I said, he brought a piece of wainscot there like this; but it is impossible for me or any man to swear to such a piece of wood.</p>

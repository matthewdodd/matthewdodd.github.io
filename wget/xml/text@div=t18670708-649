                  </hi> I am a carpenter, and live on Ealing Common—on the morning of the 25th, between twelve and one, I was going home, and just at the lower part of Ealing Green I saw the prisoner standing near a tent, close to the roadside—I believe I said, "Good morning, "to him, and he said the same to me—I said, "Can you give me a night's lodging? "—he said, "Yes, and a good feather bed for you to sleep on, and we shall charge you nothing"—I said, "I shall want to get up soon in the morn<lb></lb>ing"—he said, "Yon can get up what time you like"—two other men then came out of the tent—I said I had not far to go home, and I might as well go— as I turned to go on one of them came on one side of me, and another on the other, and pushed me down, and while I was on the ground the prisoner held me behind while the other two picked my pockets—I had 6 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my right-hand pocket, and about 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence— they took my neckerchief from my neck and let me go—I cannot say where the other two went, but I got up and followed the prisoner into the tent—I then went to the station and returned with a constable—I had had some<lb></lb>thing to drink, but I was as sober as I am now, and perhaps more so.</p>

The prosecutor came to the station, and in consequence of his statement I went with him to Ealing Green, to a tent—I found the prisoner and another man lying in it— I turned my light on, and asked the prosecutor if he knew the men—he did not know the first man, but when the prisoner rose up he said, "That is the man who choked me while the others picked my pockets"—I told him he would have to come to the station with me—he said he should not—back part of the tent—I ran round and caught hold of him—he then made a rush and got out of my grasp, and ran down the green—he had no boots on—I followed him, calling, "Stop him! "—a constable from the village came up—we went into a tent and found the prisoner there un<lb></lb>dressed—I told him to get up—he said he would not, he had been</p>

"—the man said, "It is no use telling a lie; he has only just come in"—the prisoner got up aud dressed himself—he wanted his boots—I took him to the first tent where he ran from, and his mother fetched his boots, and he put them on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and reside at 34, Sussex-street, Gower-street—I am employed at M. Claudet's establishment, in Regent-street—in the early part of last year the prisoner came to me, and represented that he was bringing out a work of naval officers, and asked if he brought parties to M. Claudet's to have their likenesses taken, what would we allow him—I told him the percentage, and he asked me to lend him a portrait to show gentle<lb></lb>men the style in which they would be done, and I did so—he never brought the portrait back—after that some gentlemen came, and I allowed him his percentage on one of the portraits which was paid for—the last time he came was in May, as near as I can tell, from 21st to 29th—I am not sure whether he came himself the last time, or whether he sent—I then lent him a small case containing four lady's portraits—I believe the prisoner was not present—the case was afterwards shown me, at the Police-court—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was to have returned it in a few days.</p>

Fitzory's portrait which was paid for—the Bishop of Toronto's portrait was taken, but it has not been paid for, and Sir John Rolt's—we have taken the Earl of Cathcart's portrait, but not it the prisoner's recommendation.</p>

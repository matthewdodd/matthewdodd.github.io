About 10.30 on 15th April, I was in the Camberwell Road, and saw the prisoner Harris, with two other men—Harris had a bundle under his arm, and appeared to be rather stout about the body—I stopped him and said "What is this bundle"—he said "What has that to do with you"—I said "I am a police constable, I want to know</p>

               <p>what is in this bundle"—he said "I shan't tell you"—I said "It you don't satisfy me, I shall take you to the station"—with that the other two men walked away—he had a wine bottle in his hand, drinking out of it—I took him to the station and he said "They have gone and left me in the hole"—I opened the bundle and found in it a black gown, a surplice and two hoods underneath his great coat—he said they were given to him by the two persons who went away—I would not positively swear that the other two prisoners were the men that were with him, but they are just the same description of men—I saw them at the workhouse, and failed to identify them, then in workhouse clothes; but feeing them in their usual clothes, I have a very strong opinion of them.</p>

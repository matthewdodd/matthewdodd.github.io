            . I am a constable. I was in Hackney church-yard on the 17th of November, about four o'clock - I met the prisoner with this coat tied up in a handkerchief, under his arm - I called a brother officer - we followed - I stopped him and asked his name; he said Clark, and that he had a coat there belonging to his brother, who lived in the Commercial-road - that he got it from a Mr. Jackson; I said I would go back with him - he then said it was of no use to tell a story, he might as well tell me, he bought it of a man in Hackney-marsh for 5s. - I said"That is not likely;" he then said he got it from the window of a house as he came along - that he had lost his tools, being a carpenter, and he wanted to get others.</p>

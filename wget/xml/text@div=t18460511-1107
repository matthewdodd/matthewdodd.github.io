                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Benjamin, a blacklead-pencil-maker; he sells new and old silk handkerchiefs; we have lived at No. 9, Field-lane, about twenty-eight years; the prisoner Bates was in my service, on and off, for nearly two years. On the 19th of April I missed some handkerchiefs—I made inquiries of Bates—I was looking over some handkerchiefs, and she said, "What are you looking for?"—I said, "Nothing particular"—I then looked over some more, and missed several—I said, "Margaret, you have robbed me of some handkerchiefs; you are very cruel; you have been robbing the children you pretend to be so fond of"—M'Carthy lived in one of my little houses, at the back of my house—Bates was con<lb></lb>stantly at M'Carthy's—Bates had the charge of my children—I only kept one servant—when I accused her she said, "The duplicates are at M'Carthy's"—here is a handkerchief which was pawned on the 30th of Jan.—I cannot say when it was in my possession—it belongs to my own children.</p>

             (Police-constable G 156). I took the prisoner for smashing, and as I thought he resembled the person who took the lamb, I took the prosecutor to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He was very much in liquor - two women had told of his arm; he asked me to have something to drink - we went into the Paul - I staid there some time, and then he said I had got his shoulder of mutton; I said I had not - he said, "Has Jenny got it;" I said, "I don't know;" we then came out - I was afterwards taken on another charge; I saw no mutton with him.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLIAMS. I had not drank with him, nor had any intimacy with him; I was sober - I changed a sovereign at the Paul, and lost 9s. 6d. there.</p>

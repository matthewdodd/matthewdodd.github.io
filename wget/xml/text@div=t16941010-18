He had a Lac'd Hat on when he was taken, and a Guinea, and a Brass Halfcrown, and a Brass Shilling was found in the Prisoner's Pocket, which Grimes swore was his money, besides 32 l. odd money; and Bullets and Powder was found about him. Kneaves swore positively to a couple of Halfcrowns, and a Nine-pence, which were found about him. The Prisoner said he had no Arms. How should he be a Highway man then? But it was sworn by a Gardener that helpt to take him, that he Had a Sword on, but he had quitted his Horse, and was endeavouring to make his Escape over the Fields. There were several other men Robbed besides, all which Robberies were done about the hours of 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the morning. They stopt the Post-Boy too. The Prisoner declared in his Defence, That he had the money of his Mother, one

None of the Evidence could swear that he was one of the Highway men, only believed he was. Kneaves swore farther, that the Prisoner's Mother offered him a Sum of money not to prosecute him. The Prisoner's Mother alledged further, that she lived in good Credit at Colchester, and the Mayor thereof (if he were here) would give a fair Testimony of him; he was called, but did not appear. The Prisoner added moreover, that one piece of money might be like another, &amp;c.

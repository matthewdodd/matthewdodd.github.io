I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; the china cup and tea-spoon were taken from a locker under the window, in my bed-chamber: I saw them on the 11th of December, and missed them on the 16th. I could suspect nobody but the prisoner: upon asking her about them, she confessed to me she had taken the buckles, and afterwards to the constable, and likewise before Mr. Alderman Cokayne. She said, her mistress had sent her of an errand, and she had lost a shilling of the money, and she stole these buckles, in order to replace the money, and then intended to have put them in their place again. She always denied taking the other things, though I have been told she pawned them only for a shilling.</p>

            . The prisoner was brought to St. Dunstan's watch-house, by Mr. Cotton, and charged with having stole a silver tea-spoon, and a pair of silver buckles: she in my hearing, did acknowledge she had taken the buckles, but absolutely denied knowing any thing of the spoon; she said, she had lost a shilling of her mistress's, and she being a very severe woman, she pledged the buckles, in order to get a shilling, and did intend to replace the buckles again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. How long has the prisoner been about your chambers?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The first was about September was twelve months; but she has several times left her mistress, and has been taken in again. I never missed any thing before this.</p>

               <p>My mistress is a very unworthy woman: she sent me of a message that I am ashamed to speak before the court. I dropped a shilling, and I dare not go home without the money, for she has beat me several times. I went to the gentleman's chambers, and took the buckles, and went and pawned them to get the shilling: I told my Mrs. afterwards that I had done so. She said I should not get any anger by it.</p>

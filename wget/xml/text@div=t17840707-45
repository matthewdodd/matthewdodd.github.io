               <p>Prisoner. I told him the man that gave them to me, and he said he thought so himself, because he was surprized to find a large dog muzzled.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that so? - I asked him how he got in, he said he did not get in, I asked him if such a one got in, and he nodded to me as if he meant yes.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner Watkins on the morning of the 6th, and I suspected him, I saw these two prisoners about one in the morning, I discovered the robbery when I was going the hour of four.</p>
               <p>Court to Coachman. Were these things taken in the night of the 5th of June? - Yes, we were all in bed.</p>
               <p>Pettington. I suspected Watkins because I have known him many years.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing on Watkins when you took him? - I found this box coat upon him, it was tied up in his apron, something of a hard working rag, he said he would go into this house of ill fame where we had been searching for him, and he said to the prisoner Nunn, I will go and see if he has called here, says I, you will ask me leave first will not you, and I seized him, and that moment he discharged the bundle from him, and likewise Nunn the same; Nunn had this great coat tied upon something of a handkerchief, and this lace I took out of Nunn's pocket; we brought them to the watch-house and these twenty five grains of buck shot, this punch and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070075"></xptr> these keys I took out of Nunn's pocket when I searched him and some loose powder.</p>
               <p>(The lace deposed to by the Coachman)</p>
               <p>It came off my Lord's hammer cloth, this lace belongs to the waistcoat the same as I have on, and the lace from this hat.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say this lace was the property of Lord Southampton? - Yes, I am sure it it is the same pattern I have on, and the waistcoat and hat had the lace cut off.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these were not given to the servants? - No my Lord, they were my Lord's property.</p>

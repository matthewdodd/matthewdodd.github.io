               <p>Prosecutor. Suspecting the prisoner I sent a man in search of him, he was brought to me, and then I mentioned that I had lost these articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then tell him it would be better to tell you how he disposed of them - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I must not hear what he said - A. The prisoner delivered up the duplicate of the pantaloons. I found the pantaloons at Mr. Richards, Brick-lane, Spitalfields. I knew them to be the pantaloons which had been delivered to me to be dyed. I paid the pawnbroker his money, and took them out. The pawnbroker found three pair of stockings besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find them by his duplicates - A. No, by his confession. I knew them to be the stockings that had been sent to me to be dyed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I must own to the truth I pledged one pair of pantaloons for four shillings; my master forgave me for so doing. I left my business because he had not constant work for me. The foreman called on me and told me that my master wanted to see me. He told me that he had lost five pair of stockings; they had been lost five weeks, and I had only been to work there three weeks; and twelve pair of cotton gloves, which were lost before I came there. I have been five years at sea. I hope you will have mercy on my unfortunate situation.</p>

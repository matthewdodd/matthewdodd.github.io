                  </hi>. I am a marine store-dealer, and live at Marsh-gate-lane, Stratford. I purchased a pair of axletree-arms of Haydon, at Bromley—I had them in my possession about five months—I then lent them to Mr. Sorrell's to be altered—he sent for me, and I went to Mr. Adams—I told him I had the axletree-arms of Haydon, and told what I gave for them—I saw them afterwards at the Police-court and they were the same—I do not know anything of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. William Bridges Adams and others. Mr. Clark came to their premises, and I went with him to Mr. Sorrell's—I saw the axletree-arms which Mr. Clark claimed—they were my master's—Mr. Haydon was taken up for having them and not giving a proper account of their possession—he was discharged—the prisoner was in my masters' service up to the day that Mr. Clark came, and absconded the next morning—he came in about a month, and surrendered—he said he was an un<lb></lb>fortunate man or an unfortunate sinner—I am positive he said "a sinner"—h said he did not steal the axletrees, but found them outside the works tied up in a leather apron—he hoped we would have mercy on him—he said he took his knife out and cut the apron, that he took one axletree home and then came and fetched the other, and that he sold them to Haydon—the man who made them is here—I found them at Sorrell's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am hawk boy to a plasterer; I live at No. 1, Law<lb></lb>rence-yard, Queen's-row, Chelsea. On Saturday night, 17th May, I went to the Three Crowns public house in Queen's-row, about a quarter after 10 o'clock—I went into the skittle ground at the back of the premises—it is lighted with gas—there is one burner—there is not light from the house at one side of the skittle room—on the other side there is a door and window—it is the skittle ground window—when I went, skittle playing was going on—there were about ten persons there altogether—the three prisoners were there—I sat down; I was not playing, nor were either of the prisoners—I had a silver-watch in my waistcoat pocket, and a metal chain round it passed through a button hole of the waistcoat—Durkin sat next to me, Sullivan sat next to him, and Vickery was standing on the floor—I saw Sullivan stand</p>

               <p>up and tap Darking on the thigh, and he pointed to my watch in my pocket—Sullivan stood up and went over to the gas; he stood there about four or five seconds, and turned the gas off—I stood up to go out, and Durkin put his hand round my shoulders, put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and pulled my watch out—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me against the wall, and got wrenching the watch off the chain—he gave the watch to his mate Vickery—when they let me go I got to the door, and as Durkin and Vickery came to the door, I saw Durkin give Vickery the watch—there was light from the air—it was an open place where I stood—the night was rather light—it was about a quarter before 11 o'clock—I called out when they had hold of me—the first thing I said was, "Now, Durkin, leave me alone, it is no use your trying to rob me; I know you"—I did not hear anybody else call out till they let go of me—I heard some one call out, "Scale the wall!"—I went out before Durkin and Vickery—I went out of the skittle ground into the yard; I remained in the yard about two minutes—I left Durkin and Vickery still there, and I went for a policeman—I brought one back in ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour—I saw Sullivan there—I told the police<lb></lb>man that I charged him with <hi rend="italic">outing</hi> the gas—I did not say that in Sulli<lb></lb>van's hearing—I told the policeman in Sullivan's presence that he was one of the party—Sullivan was taken in charge—I knew all the prisoners before—I was quite sober.</p>

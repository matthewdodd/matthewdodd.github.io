               <p>On Sunday the 24th of November, I had orders from Aldermen Townsend and Hart, to keep a strict watch about this place; Fleet-lane I think they call it: we had information that they were all receiving houses, and that they covered one another; and the prisoner was seen to carry in some bundles, into Mr. Turner's house; we went into Turner's house, and in the cellar we found a caravan box, in which were contained, the things mentioned in the indictment; I did not go down into the cellar myself, I was in the shop: this trial was put off from the last sessions by the prisoner's desire, and by the order of the court: I gave the gentleman and lady all their cloaths, except this coat.</p>
               <p>(The coat produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. You saw the rest of the things? Yes.</p>

               <p>Where did you see them? - I saw them at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Was Gates present then? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Gates. These things that Mr. Willard saw, were the same things that you took in Turner's house? - Yes, I asked Mrs. Turner where Mr. Turner was, she said, he was not at home; she had lain in a little while, and I was tender of her: I asked, whose the things were, she said, the things were Mr. Jones's; I immediately sent for Mr. Jones, who lived but two or three doors off; he came, and I asked him if the things were his; he said that they were his, and take them away if we durst; I told him, I would not only take them, but I would take him too; I took him, and the next day I took him before the Aldermen at Guildhall; he then declared, before the Aldermen Hart and Townsend, that they were his: we found Mr. Willard, by a hand bill.</p>

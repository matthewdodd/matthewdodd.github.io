                  </hi>. I am a barrister at-law, and a native of Jersey—I am familiar with the law of Jersey—I have been examined before Sir James Wilde on the marriage law of the island—it is the fact that before 1836, a register book of marriages was bound to be kept by the law of Jersey—a marriage, without dissent by parents, celebrated by a clergyman in Jersey would be valid at that time, without the parties signing the re<lb></lb>gister—there was an alteration of the law in 1842, by order of her Majesty in Council, and that was the law previous to 1842—this marriage was just previous—it was solemnized by the clergyman, and entered in a book without the signature of the parties—the rector of St. Helier's was my cousin, the Rev. Corbett Hue, Dean of Jersey—he died in 1838.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEAST BALLATINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you an English barrister? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I never was a barrister practising at Jersey—I never was an advocate of the Royal Court of Jersey—I have special reasons for knowing the law of Jersey—I was for some time a special agent for the Appeals to our Privy Council for the States of Jersey, and for the Crown Officers—matters connected with the law of marriage came before me con<lb></lb>stantly—I have had a matter of this kind before me; I can't say how often—I am not aware of any particular appeal upon this point before 1842, but cases of this kind came before me—there was the general law of Europe as to the restriction as to age—a male of fourteen and a girl of twelve may contract marriage, if there is <hi rend="italic">consensus per verbal de presenti</hi>—I am sure of that—I am sure that a female of twelve may contract marriage, but not without consent of her parents, unless the banns are put up in church, and called in the ordinary manner three successive Sundays, under the Order in Council of King James I., which is binding upon the ecclesiastics of the island.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The ecclesiastics were bound to obey what the king had said, but did it govern the law of Jersey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That may be a moot point, but at all events, a marriage performed by a clergyman of the Church of England would be a valid marriage—I will not say that a marriage might not be valid, if it was by consent of two parties without the presence of a clergy-man, but certainly with the presence of a clergyman it would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Under what circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between two minors, if the banns had been properly published, though their parents did not consent;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186901110075"></xptr>
               <p>but the banns might be forbidden by their guardians—I say, that before 1842, a female of twelve might have contracted marriage, if there were <hi rend="italic">con<lb></lb>sensus per verba de presenti</hi>, without the consent of her parents, if no oppo<lb></lb>sition was offered, if called three times in church by a clergyman of the Church of England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINF</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the banns were published of A. B. and C. D., which a clergyman would read without knowing the age of either? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If a couple of children were to come to the altar under those conditions, that would be a perfectly valid marriage in Jersey, if no negative was shown; but if the girl wanted a day of twelve, I do not think it would be a valid marriage—I cannot give any instance in which that has been laid down; my opinion is purely speculative—I am not aware of any case in which it has been held valid or contested, the case has not arisen—I should not give an opinion as to handwriting, unless I had seen the genuine writing before; but I give an opinion on a matter which I have never heard of, be<lb></lb>cause the law is known—very few persons in this country are interested in watching the law of Jersey.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a marriage between two minors takes place, is that a valid marriage until it is set aside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it must be set aside in the Court of the Dean of Jersey, from which there lies an appeal to the Bishop of Winchester.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Although Mr. Le Breton was of a contrary opinion, he was not an expert, in the true sense of that word, and even if he were an expert, he could not lay down that there was a legal obligation to keep a Register, and that a certified copy of it was receivable in Courts of Justice.</hi> ("Huet <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Mesurier," Cox's Cases in Equity, p. 275).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that in practice they keep a register? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My father was rector of one of the parishes of Jersey, and it was the usualcustom to keep a register—it was usually kept at the clergyman's house, but he oc<lb></lb>casionally deposited it in the parish chest, in the church, in the custody of the rector—the books kept by preceding rectors are handed over to their successors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">then contended, that the mere fact of a custom to do a thing, did not render the thing done of a public character, and that unless there was a legal obligation to do it, and a legal penalty attached to the non-performance of it, it was not of a public character, it had only the same value as a diary kept by the Judges would possess, invaluable to posterity, but net admissible as evidence in a Court of Justice, because such a book must be kept under a duty to keep it.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEANE</hi>, Q.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">considered that the</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th section the Act did not apply, to any books kept out of England, and that if the rector of St. Heliers had refused to furnish a copy of the register, he could not be compelled to do so.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am widow of a solicitor, and live at Wootton-under-Edge—in 1837 I kept a boarding school at Thornbury, near Bristol, and employed a French master, named Alexandre Victor—I believe him to have been married; he introduced a lady as his wife, that was the prisoner—Victor afterwards entered into partnership with me, and the prisoner took part in the school—they lived together—the partnership lasted about five quarters, to the best of my recollection—I think it ended at the beginning of 1811, or 1842, 1841, I think—I do not know where Victor resided after the termination of the partnership, or how long he remained at Bristol or Thorn<lb></lb>bury—I think I should remember Madame Victor's writing if I saw it (<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at the Register</hi>)—to the best of my recollection this is it, in the corner of this look—I never saw this before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Clifton—some years ago I became acquainted with a person named Victor, a French teacher; it was about 1842—I know the defendant—I became acquainted with her, it may have been in 1841—I lived in the same house with Madame Victor, at one time—her husband taught at Dr. Stone's—I have been there with her—I re<lb></lb>member going with her to the gaol at Bristol, and seeing the governor—I am not sure I went inside—she left me, and went in—they were lodging in the same house with me at that time—but Victor was not living at home, he was in gaol—I was not in the gaol—he was absent from home, perhaps some weeks—he afterwards returned, and there is no doubt whore he had been—I went with the prisoner to the gaol—I can't say that she said why she was going there, but the fact is most positive that she knew it—they did not leave Clifton until after Dr. Stone's examination, after the June holidays, 1842, after the rehearsals—I did not see the prisoner and Victor together after they left Clifton, but I saw Victor alone in 1847, in Brighton, and had a con<lb></lb>versation with him there—he was the same person that I had known in Clifton—I have no remembrance of seeing the prisoner after June or July, 1842, when she left Clifton—I can fix the exact date of seeing Victor at Brighton, by undeniable proof—I was there on 9th July, and slept at the Rev. Samuel Hardy's.</p>

J. Farrer, as a token of his esteem—there is a date in the book—Mr. Matthews knew that—I offered to go and fetch it, but I don't know what Mr. Matthews said to that—I think he said the book was thought needful, that it would be a very important document—that was not the reason I left it behind; my health was not sufficient to let me go for it—I was not obliged to fetch it, but for the ends of justice I would have done so—Mr. Matthews said what I have told you—when I am driven to it, I will strain a point to do a thing—I can't go into the why and the wherefore of what Mr. Matthews said; he said he was sorry I had not brought it; he expressed his regret that I had not—he did it in perfectly polite terms—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you swear before the Magistrate that you had seen Victor in 1848? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said it depended upon a letter I handed to the Court—I went home and sorted through my writing desk, and found a letter which will bear me out; it was an invitation to go there, and I found it was in 1847—I did produce a letter—I can explain the matter if you will allow me—I was asked what time I went from Brighton; I could not remember, my head is not an almanack—I sorted my writing desk, and found a letter dated June, 1848, where they invited me to come and stay some time at Richmond with them—I had another letter, dated 1847, October 14, I think it was the 14th, which said, "When will you pop in upon us as you promised to do"—if I have not got that letter about me, it is at the Museum Hotel—I have not got it, I showed it to Mr. Matthews—I don't know whether he con<lb></lb>sidered it important—I last saw it yesterday; I actually looked at it yesterday and left it at home, and a lot of others with it.</p>

BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that she exculpated herself fully at the time about the rumour propagated by Lady Lewis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, she treated it with derision and thorough contempt—Lady Lewis propagated a rumour that she had been married before, and Mrs. Crow called in a friendly manner, and said that there was a nasty rumour going about, and we determined to prosecute Lady Lewis; and I crossed over to England—no person's name was mentioned who she had named, but Lady Lewis said, "I will undertake that four or five people will say so," that she had been previously married when she married me—when her attention was called to that she treated it with scorn, and treated Lady Lewis as a well-known scandal-monger—she did not assent to the truth of it in any way; she denied it utterly; but I was so irri<lb></lb>tated at it that I determined to make an example of Lady Lewis, and crossed over to England for the purpose—the name of Victor was never even passed for two years afterwards, either by her or her family, or friends.</p>

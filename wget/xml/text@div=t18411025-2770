                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman, and live in St. An<lb></lb>drew's-terrace, Waterloo-road. On the 16th of September I was washing in the yard, and heard the prisoner talking against me—I said, "Fanny, what you have got to say about me, say to my face, not behind my back"—I lifted the window up—Mrs. Taylor pulled it down again—I then knocked at the door—Mrs. Taylor opened it—the prisoner said, "If you enter the room, you d—d wh—, I will stick a knife to your heart"—she took a knife off the drawers within the door, and stabbed at my face—I lifted my arm up to save my face, and got the cut in my arm—I was taken to the hospital, and was there a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner lodged with me. On the 16th of Septem<lb></lb>ber she was in the same room with me, very drunk—the prosecutrix over-heard her telling me of a depredation which the prosecutrix had committed in my house during my absence, and she knocked at my door to come in, and fight her—I locked the door against her—she then attempted to come through the parlour-window, and put her foot in, but I would not let her—she then came back to the parlour-door, and battered till I thought she would break the panel—I then opened the door, and asked what she was going to do—she struck the prisoner twice over my shoulder, and the third time she attempted to strike her, the prisoner said, "If you strike me again I will mark you"—I had been cutting some bread and butter, and as soon as the prosecutrix attempted to strike the prisoner again, she caught up the knife and struck her on the arm—it was a common table-knife—it was afterwards given to the policeman.</p>

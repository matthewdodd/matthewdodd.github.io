On the 19th of August the prisoner was leaving work - I called him back; the constable was sent for, and this copper found on him; he is a smith in our employ, and had copper of this king entrusted to him- three of these pieces had been found in a particular place, and they were marked to see who would take them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where were they concealed? A. Under the ashes of the forge; if copper had been dropped there, it might have been covered with ashes, but that was not a place for it - it is not common for smiths to work at home; he was employed from six o'clock in the morning till six at night for my master, the other time he had for himself - I do not know that the prisoner had worked at home; when the constable came he acknowledged he had the property, and begged to be forgiven.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner - I heard him state what the witness has just repeated; these ten pieces were found on him - three are marked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the Monday I took this copper to the shop for the purpose of cutting it; I have a small modelmachine making - I have some tools at home, but I have not a hammer, except a very small one; I came from Nottingham - I began making the machine there, and am going on with it; they went to my house, and found a small bench and some tools - I was going to the West London Theatre on Monday - as Mr. Lea's son was to perform: on the Tuesday, I went to work again; I was called out between three and four o'clock, to do a job, which I was not in the habit of doing (unloading some castiron) - I said "This is pretty work to set a tradesman to do labourer's work;" when I went in again, I was told some copper had been marked - I said whether it was or not, I should take it up; I took it from under my bench, and was putting into in my pocket, when a man ran and told Mr. Lea.</p>
               <p>LEA re-examined. Q. Did he say anything of this at the time? Q. No; he owned he had it, and begged Mr. Braithwaite to forgive him - he appeared very much confused.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He came to the counting-house door, and said "Have you some property of Mr. Braithwaite's?" he put his hand to my pocket, and said "Yes, here it is," and then he said "How many times have you taken copper of your master?" I said "Never before, and I hope you will forgive me."</p>

            . Q. Did you know it to be Mr. Braithwaite's property before he marked it? A. Yes; from its being the same sort as he uses for bolts and other things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If such copper was laid before you, could you swear it was Mr. Braithwaite's? A. No, we have them in long rods ten or twelve feet long; it is not usual to cut them into small pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When did you mark that copper? A. While you were taking in the iron; I only marked three pieces - the man did not tell me it had lain there from the Monday morning. GUILTY. Aged 24.</p>

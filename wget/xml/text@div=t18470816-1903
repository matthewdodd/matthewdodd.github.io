                  </hi> I am a widow, and live in Lambert-street. Last Tuesday week I lost a spoon—it had been just outside the back window-ledge, in the yard, on the Friday form or Saturday before—I afterwards saw it broken—these broken pieces from my spoon, and the one which was out-side my window—a person could get it by coming over a wall, four or five feet high—which is in a public street.</p>

                  </hi> I am a widow, and live in Lambert-street—the prisoner used once to board with me. On the 12th of Aug., between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, he came to me, and said he had found a spoon in the ruins which are nearly opposite my house—I said, "There is no harm in find<lb></lb>ing, my lad; go and find the owner, and the reward of that spoon will be better to you than many spoons, for honesty is the best policy"—I laid the spoon in my window, and am sure this is the same—he came to me about <hi rend="italic">two</hi> hours afterwards, and said, "Mrs. Hale, I have found an owner for the spoon"—I said, "I am very glad of it"—I let him have it—it was not broken then, only bruised—in about an hour I saw him passing the door, hailed him in, and said, "What have you done with the spoon?"—he said, "Taken it to the owner"—I said, "What may your reward be?"—he said, "4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."</p>

                  </hi> I am a widow, and live in Lambert-street. I was washing for Mrs. Ryan on Tuesday and Wednesday week last—she told me on the Tuesday that she had missed a spoon, and on 12th of Aug. I heard a talk about a spoon, and I told Mrs. Ryan about it—she told a policeman, and the spoon was found—I had seen the prisoner on Thursday, about eleven o'clock, lurking near the wall, with his cap off, and raking about the dirt in the ruins—it was after the spoon was lost—some houses had been pulled down there—I have seen rubbish thrown there.</p>

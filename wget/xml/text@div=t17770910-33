Viner and Cummings to bring the prisoner into their shop, which was consented to; one of the gentlemen there went to St. Martin's watch house, and fetched four watchmen, who conducted them to the round-house; the next morning the prisoner was committed: they were both searched, but nothing found upon either of them; I am positive the prisoner is the person who struck me on the breast, and was opposite to me when my watch was pulled out, and there was no other person so near me, nay no person near enough to be able to reach my pocket but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor said, You rogue, you have taken my watch, and given it to that man; he laid hold of me; I said I had not; I was taken into a shop, and searched; there was no watch found upon me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I was potman at the Cock public-house, in the High Road, Kilburn, on 20th March—on that night the deceased Martin was in the house—between 10 and 11 the prisoner and a friend came in and called for a pot of four ale, they put down 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and a navvy who was with the deceased snatched the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the prisoner; the prisoner asked him for it, and he rushed at the prisoner, hit him and knocked him down, and tore his trousers—after the prisoner got up Martin caught hold of the prisoner and shook him, and hit him twice, and he said three or four times "If you touch the navvy I will knock your b—eye out"—the landlord came into the bar at the time he was making use of this language, and he got over the counter and put Martin and the navvy outside the house, and told me to stop at the door and not let them come in again—Martin fell on the pave<lb></lb>ment as he went out; I don't think he hit his head—as I was standing outside, I heard some of the persons who were standing round me say some<lb></lb>thing about the man being knocked down; I did not see what took place outside—I saw the deceased lying down—he did not get back his 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

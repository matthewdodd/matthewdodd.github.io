            . I was near the house on the 26th of May. I saw the prisoner go into the shop, and bring out a light green scarf - he had none when he went in - he stopped in the shop about five minutes. I went in and told Mrs. Riley, and then ran after him - he got away from us, but I saw him taken by a man. I don't know what became of the scarf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What colour did you say it was when you were at Worship-street - A. I said it was a lightish green. I am sure it was not a handkerchief. I was outside when he took it; he passed me, and I looked at the colour of it.</p>

            . I know Mr. Riley's house. I saw the prisoner go in, and come out with a light green scarf. He wrapped it under his arm, and ran away. I followed, and saw him give it to his partners - there were two others with him. He went alone into the shop - the other two staid at the window the while.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What were you about - A. I was minding my father's shop. I did not say that one of the boy's had a blue scarf. I did not see one of them with a blue pocket handkerchief. I have always said the scarf was light green. I had seen him talking to other boys before he went into the shop.</p>

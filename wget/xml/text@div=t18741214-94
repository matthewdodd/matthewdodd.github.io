                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—we shall have been married thirteen years on Christmas Day—we have no children—we lived at 27, Bath Street—on 11th. November I took a screw of sugar out of a bason in a cupboard in our room—it was about five or six teaspoonsful—I made a screw of it in paper like you do tea—I took it with me to my work—I had had my breakfast 8.15, and used what was in the sugar bason before I took the screw ont—my husband went away at 6 o'clock—I felt sick after breakfast, and complained of it—I began to feel sick about 8.45, and I felt it on and off all the morning—when I woke up that morning I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner tying up his food near the cupboard door—the food was kept in that cupboard—he did not take sugar to his work that morning, he had taken it on Monday morning—I had bought the sugar on the Saturday night previous at Mr. Simcoe's, the grocer's—I bought one pound and took it home with me—my husband put it into the bason on Monday morning—he took about three quarters of a pound with him to his work, and turned the rest into the glass sugar bason, where there was about a quarter of a pound of the old sugar—it was my practice to buy sugar on Saturdays, and he took his sugar to his work on Monday morning, and I took mine to my work on Wednesday—I felt the effects of it on Wednesday morning at breakfast, and between 1 and 2 o'clock I took some more in coffee—I work at a book folder's with a lot of women, and two young girls, Lousia Jones and Rose Johnson had some of my coffee—I put some sugar in it from the screw of paper which 1 brought from home—none of the other girls had any of my sugar, they had their own—I put about a teaspoonful of the sugar into the coffee, and it had a coppery, burning taste, very nauseous—I let it remain till it got cold, because I could not drink it, and about ten minutes after<lb></lb>wards I threw it away, and poured out some more—I thought it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187412140058"></xptr>
               <p>chicory in the coffee—I put about a teaspoonful of sugar into that and could not drink it—it was out of the same coffee pot—I merely tasted it and found it worse—I then said that it must be in the sugar, and I went to the sink and vomited—the other girls had some of the coffee and did not suffer at all—one of them tasted it, and said "Good gracious, it is poisoned"—I asked them to give me some salt and water, which I drank—it purged me and relieved me—I went with Mrs. Wood to a chemist in Farringdon Street—we took the screw of sugar with us and the spoon—he would not have anything to do with it, and we went back to the shop and then to St. Bartholomew's Hospital with the same screw of sugar—the doctor looked at it, and asked me if I had any more at home, and he told me to go home and secure what was in the bason, and if I saw anything in it to take it to Bag<lb></lb>nigge Wells Police Station—before I left the hospital I had an emetic and some castor oil, which thoroughly cleansed me—I had the nasty taste for three days, and my mouth went ragged inside, all like skinned—I had had some of the same sugar for breakfast on the Tuesday morning, and felt no effects from it—the prisoner did not breakfast with me all the week—after breakfast on Tuesday I put it in the same cupboard, and did not taste it again till Wednesday—that cupboard was not locked usually, nobody occupies the room but ourselves—we only occupy one room, and we each have a key—before I went out on the Tuesday morning I found that my husband had not taken his key with him, but I locked the door as usual—it was the practice for whoever went out to lock the door—I hung the key up in the room—no one could get in after I left without breaking the door or having a false key—I met the prisoner at the corner of Bath Street at 9.45 on Tuesday night, and he said that he could not get in; he was very angry—I had not been in since the morning—I let him in with my key, and we both went in together—we had not been in many minutes when I went out to fetch the supper beer—I was out five or ten minutes, leaving only my husband in the room—he was there when I came back—we had our supper, and there was no quarrelling—we both went to bed comfortably, and next morning he wished me goodbye and kissed me before he went away—that was at about 5.55—I took the sugar basin to the police on Wednesday afternoon, after I left the hospital and before my husband came home—Mrs. Wood went with me; but before that I took it to the grocer where I bought it, then to the police, and then to Mr. Neighbour, the Inspector of Nuisances; but it was never out of my sight, nor was the screw or the spoon—I left the screw with Mr. Neighbour first, and afterwards the basin and spoon—I can hardly say whether he turned the screw into the basin—he will tell you best—I only saw him once—when my husband came home at a little after 10 o'clock, I asked him if he found anything the matter with his sugar; he said "No"—I told him that I had been poisoned; he looked astonished, and sat by the fire, and did not say any more—he asked me about it, and I told him that I had taken it to Mr. Neighbour and the grocer and the police—he said I had done quite right—I said "You had better fetch your sugar and see if there is anything in that; and he fetched it the next morning from his shop—he went there alone, and brought it back in the pound sugar bag I had got it in on the Saturday night—he had not turned it out—he stayed at home with me all Thursday morning, but nothing of any consequence occurred—I was very ill on the Thursday morning, but I went to work in the afternoon as I was better, though far from well—I put about five or six</p>

               <p>teaspoonsful into the screw, and took about two out—we have been married thirteen years; we were not unhappy the first part, we were unhappy the last four or five years, but the last part of the time better—this improve<lb></lb>ment had been for some months—I left him two years ago last July for three weeks—that was because he used to go out of a night and leave me in the shop—we kept a chandler's shop for about four or five years, and it was unsuccesful—it was given up because I left him, and he could not carry it on without me—he sold it while I was away from him—since then I have been working at book folding—my husband used to stay out till 12 and 1 o'clock, but sometimes he would come home at 10 o'clock—I was with him when he was taken in custody on a Saturday, about twelve days after<lb></lb>wards—I was telling him that I was going to leave him, and asked him for part of the <hi rend="italic">home</hi>—the detective then came in, and said "I apprehend you on a charge of attempting to poison your wife"—we had lived on good terms from the time I was taken bad till the time he was taken—I told him all that had occurred, and that the detectives had been to me at the workship, and I said "Tom, they have traced it to you"—they came once to the workshop, that was on the Tuesday following, and on the Thursday they came to my house—my husband saw that I was in an excited state, and he said "Sit down and calm yourself, it is false: they don't keep no poison in the shop but what is killed"—when I spoke on the Saturday about leaving him, he said "Take all the <hi rend="italic">home,</hi> I am an outcast; you are going to turn against me"—I had not made up my mind to leave him till the Friday, and had not threatened to do so—we once had a quarrel about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but that is an old grievance, three years ago—on the Friday after he was taken I found this new razor behind a stack of books in the room—he had not been in the habit of shaving himself lately, but I daresay if I looked I could find an old razor now—I never saw him use either the old razor or this new one; he went somewhere in Bunhill Bow to get shaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> About three years ago he had 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bank in his own name—he took 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out first—I did not take any of it out, but I be<lb></lb>lieve I had some portion of it—I have taken money several times from the business—I took 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I left home, and my husband came after me and fetched me back—he was not on a sick bed when I left him, but he was ill—I did not give the money back to him, but I laid it out on him—he was on a sick bed, and the money was spent—I left him because he stayed out so late at night—while this business was going on he was sometimes working at a smith's business at night, and sometimes he was not—it did not keep him out till 10 o'clock—he works at a smith's business now—7 o'clock is his time, but he works overtime occasionally—I cannot tell you whether he works till 10 o'clock, his employers will tell you that better—he came home at 10, 11, and 12 o'clock as black as when he left off—my time for leaving off was sometimes 7 o'clock in summer and sometimes 8 o'clock—we were busy at this time—though he had left his key at home, and though I knew that 7 o'clock was his time to get home, I did not come home to let him in before 9.45, because I left my shop at 9 o'clock, and I had half an hour's walk, and I met a young girl and went with her to buy her a waterproof—I was not sure of my husband coming home, so I did not hurry myself—I pointed out to the Inspector of Police at Bagnigge Wells some white stuff on the top of the sugar bason, and also to Mr. Neigh<lb></lb>bour—I called their attention to it before they saw it, and the person with</p>

               <p>me saw it—I had tea for breakfast, that was about 7.45, as near as I can tell, and about an hour after that I was on my road to business—I suppose it was between three quarters of an hour and an hour after taking the tea before I felt any sickness—I drank the whole cup of tea—I took the sugar out of the bason with a spoon and put the spoon in and stirred it up in the ordinary way—when I showed the sugar to the inspector it was scooped out, and this powder was laying on the top; it was like salt—it was on the outside of the sugar—as soon as I got to work I complained of being sick, and two or three times during the morning—after that I drank more than half a teaspoonful of coffee; I will not swear that, but I tasted it each time—I drank a drop first, and when I tasted it I put it down—none of the other women tasted the first cup—I said "Aint that coffee funny," and I put it down—none of my sugar was put in the other girl's cups—I did not say that I thought that cup was poisoned—I had some bacon for dinner, and I thought it might be that that made it taste funny—I then poured out a second cup, tasted that, and that was worse, and I said "<hi rend="italic">Good</hi> gracious me, it must be in the sugar"—I did not say that it was poisoned, but one of them did while I was at the sink—I let some of that coffee go down my throat, and I felt the effects right down my inside—I drank nothing like a saucer full—several others were at the sink washing their things up—none of them are here, but the person who brought me the salt and water is here—I was very bad, indeed, at the sink—I asked for the salt and water, because one of them took up the coffee and said "Good God, it is poisoned"—I asked for the salt and water because I knew it was a very good emetic, and I have taken mustard and water for the bile—I could not get mustard, and I asked for salt—the prisoner's manner has always been kind, and he has never ill-used me—I told the Magistrate that he was an affectionate husband, and that I did not believe he could do such a cruel thing; that I could not believe he put the poison there—on the Wednesday morning I awoke and saw him by the cupboard door with his food in his hand; I was not awake when he got up—I told the Magistrate that I woke up and found him tying up has food—he had not been taken in custody when I asked him on the Saturday for part of the <hi rend="italic">home</hi>—I told him I could not live with a suspected person—I should not have taken the home and left him, should have taken my share and left him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Wood, of 6, Cornwal road, Lambeth—I am a book folder, and worked at the same shop as Mrs. Cherry, but I do not now—on 11th November, she came in at 9.15 or 9.20, and I sat nest to her—she repeated several times "I think I must have made my tea too strong for I have been violently sick all</p>

I work for Mr. Horton, a smith and gas fitter and engineer, of 7, Finsbury Street—the prisoner worked in the same employment—I went there five years ago as a brass finisher and gas fitter—I use corrosive sublimate mixed with vinegar in my own shop—I mix it myself—I keep it in a cupboard in the shop which is not locked—the prisoner had the same access to that shop as others—I have seen him there, he has come up for anything he wanted or to work at the lathe sometimes, but he worked in the downstairs shop—I buy the corrosive sublimate in a crystal state, nobody has anything to do with it but me—I had had a supply in about five weeks before from Fox's—I kept a small piece in the cupboard, I never used it all—it was wrapped in the paper labelled "Poison" in which I received it—it is a deadly poison, there is nothing worse—I missed it a fortnight before the detective called and never saw it again—it was in small crystals, but not in powder—over an ounce was left I should think.</p>

                  </hi>. I am analyst to Dr. Pavey, of Guy's Hospital—on 13th November I received three parcels from Mr. Neighbour, one marked "Mr. Cherry," another "Mrs. Cherry,"' and another "Nov. 11"—I marked them 1, 2, and 3 in the order I have given—No. I contained 5 ozs. of pure sugar—No. 2 was extremely nasty, there were 3 1/4 grains of cor<lb></lb>rosive sublimate in 100 grains of the sugar in that sample, 3 1/4 per cent.—that preparation would be 1/2 an oz. in 1 lb. sugar—there would be at least 4 grains in a teaspoonful—3 grains has caused death, but there are cases where more than 4 grains have been taken and the patient has recovered—3 grains would be a very dangerous dose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians—corrosive sublimate is a very deadly poison—3 grains is a very dangerous dose; cases are on record where 3 grains has produced death—it has a metallic, coppery taste, and if swallowed would produce a burning sensation in the stomach and chest and vomiting would follow—it excoriates if applied to the surface of anything—it amalgamates with a brass spoon and blackens it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The taste and the burning sensation are immediate and within an hour a sense of nausea would come on—a small portion would produce a metallic taste on the tongue and a burning sensation in the throat—the pain would not be immediate on her taking the 1/4 spoonful of tea—I do not know that one cup of coffee with a teaspoonful of the sugar in it would be so nasty as to prevent her taking another cup as it is very heavy and not entirely soluble—the first cup of coffee might be poured away and hot coffee being poured in would dissolve what was precipitated in the cup—it is so nauseous that a person would be prevented from tasting it a second time out of the same cup, but they might try a second cup.</p>

On 21st November I went with Sergeant Kenwood to 27, Bath Street, and found the prisoner and his wife by the fire—I told him I was a detective, and came to take him in custody on suspicion of putting poison into the sugar—he said "You will have to prove that"—I told him I had been making inquiries respecting it, and found he had free access to such kind of poison where he was at work—he said "No"—I said "You have, by going up a ladder in the other work<lb></lb>shop"—I had cautioned him—he said "Yes, you are quite right"—I told him he would have to go to the station—he said "When?" I said "Now"—his wife got up and said "For God's sake, Tom, tell me whether you are guilty or not"—he said "No, I am quite innocent of it"—I took him to the station.</p>

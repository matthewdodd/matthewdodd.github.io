                  </hi>. I am a coal-dealer, and live at Pim<lb></lb>lico. The prisoner was in my employ—on the 9th of December, Mrs. Crow sent for a hundredweight of coals—my other man was out, and I let the prisoner go and take them, at his own request—he came back and said they were not paid for—I said, "Very well," and ptit them down on the slate—in seven or eight days, Mrs. Crow sent for another hundred weight of coals—I made a bill for two hundredweight, and sent them by my other lad—he came back and said they were paid for—I went to the prisoner</p>

               <p>and said, "Can you set this right?"—he said, "Yes, I can"—I took him to the place—Mrs. Crow said, "You were paid"—"Was I?" said the prisoner—"Yes" said she, "the boy went for change for a half-sovereign, and you were paid"—"Yes, so I was," said he, "and I paid it to you, master"—I said, "You are a very great villain"—he said, "Master, you have got me now, but I have got you"—I said, "How do you mean?"—he said, "For selling short weight"—I said, "If you do, it is your fault, but I never had this money"—he was employed as my porter, and if money was paid at the time, he was employed to receive it.</p>

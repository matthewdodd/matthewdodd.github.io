                  </hi> I am a licensed victualler of 10, Dean-street, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn—in consequence of my house having been broken into four times, on the night of 21st November I watched with a friend, named Richard Chapman—I put myself in the bar parlour, and put out the light—I remained there till half-past five or a quarter to six—I am sure that what took place was before six o'clock—I heard a noise coming through the window, where the brick work was removed—it was a window that had been blocked up with a kind of shutter; that was removed, and then the brick work was removed to make the place large enough to enter—the noise then came to a passage, and then at a spring door—I heard the spring go, and then saw the prisoner come through the door into the bar—he appeared to be feeling for the matches, which I am accustomed to keep on the counter—I was in darkness then; there is a fan-light over the door and window—they would give enough light to distinguish a person's features—I waited for him to get the matches, and to get the gas on—I had a blanket on to keep me from being cold; he saw me throw that off I expect—he bolted to the door and was gone before I had time to catch him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280075"></xptr>
               <p>—after I made the place secure, I told the girl to get up; and I then went to a night coffee-shop where the prisoner goes—I had known him before—he has been in the habit of coming to my house for the last twelve months—he knew the place as well as I did myself—I found him at the coffee-house—I sent for a constable and gave him in charge—I accused him of breaking in—he said he had not; he had been in the coffee-shop all the night—I asked the proprietor, in his presence, if he had been there all night—he said that he had been out three times; he had come in an hour before I came; that was about seven o'clock—he (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) said he only just went out for something—I afterwards examined my house—he had got in from a back court, over a wall, into the yard—then there is a window which opens into the private yard—he must have got from the yard through this window—there was a wooden shutter put up, that was knocked away, and brick work removed to make it large enough for anybody to get through—that brick work was all safe the night before; and I found in the morning that it had been opened—the prisoner came right facing me within three inches, and there was sufficient light to distinguish him—I am perfectly sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 90, Gray's-inn-lane—I sat up with the last witness on this night by his invitation—I did not see the prisoner come in, but I saw him pass by the bar to go out—I saw his face by the aid of the light that came in at the fan-light over the door; and when he opened the door the light streamed in, and I saw the whole of him—I am certain he is the person; I had seen him in the house before—I knew his face.</p>

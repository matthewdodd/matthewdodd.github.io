On Sunday morning, 2nd May, about 4 o'clock, I was in Thrawl-street, Spitalfields, and saw the prisoner; he had two bundles, one on his head and the other under his arm—I stopped him, and asked where he got the bundles from—he said he had just come from the country—I asked how long he had been in the country—he said three days, and he had taken them out of his boxes—I took him to the station—when I first stopped him he threw down the bundles, made a sort of snatch at his coat, and took from it an iron bar, which he raised with an intention to strike me—I took it out of his hand, and secured him—the bundles contained three coats, three cloaks, eight pairs of plush breeches, and a piece of white cloth—I found on him a bunch of keys, a tobacco box, a halfpenny, a measure, and a purse.</p>

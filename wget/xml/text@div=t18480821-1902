On 17th July I was in a boat on the Thames, near Blackwall, with the deceased John Doherty, and his father, mother, and sister—some barges belonging to the Trinity-house were moored near the West India Docks—I was in the stern-sheets of the barge—it was a lighter, not likes a coal-barge—the cabin—head was decked—there was one man on it, and another on the cabin—head—the prisoner was taking the wash-boards out—the deceased got out of his boat and came on to the barge, and asked the prisoner to let the wash-boards alone—the prisoner asked what that had to do with him, and said he did not belong to the barge—deceased said if he did not, he belonged to another belonging to the same Corporation, and it was all the same, and stepped down to take hold of one of the wash-boards—the prisoner said, "You <hi rend="italic">shan't</hi> have it," and challenged him down in the hold to fight—de<lb></lb>ceased stepped out of the boat into the barge, and said, "I am low enough where I am"—before he had time to go to the cabin head the prisoner struck him, and knocked him overboard—I was four or five feet from them—the other man did not interfere till deceased was knocked overboard—Dohertv had not time to raise his hand—his sister was on the barge—she got out of the boat before me, and had hold of him at the time he was knocked over, trying to pull him away—I saw him in the water, and stepped into the boat and <hi rend="italic">shored</hi> off to save him, but a steam-boat passed by, which caused a swell, and he was drowned—he was not prepared to fight—he had had a fever six weeks, and had only come out to see the rowing-match—there was only one person on that part of the barge when he was struck.</p>

"—my brother used angry words—the prisoner said, "Come down in the hold and fight"—my brother said he was low enough—I took hold of his hand and said, "John come along," as I saw words were going to occur, and said, "I shall go"—he took my right hand and said, "Wait a minute"—he had not time to turn round, when the prisoner hit him, and he fell overboard—his other hand was down by his side—my father and mother went to look for him—I took hold of the prisoner and said, he was the man that threw my brother over<lb></lb>board, and said I would follow him wherever he went—he took hold of me and said, "You b----y bitch, if you say much more, I will throw you where I threw your brother "—I took off my bonnet and hailed for assistance—two gentlemen came in a boat—I went ashore with him in the boat to the station, and did not lose sight of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lodging-housekeeper, in St. Georse's-in-the-East. I was on the aft of the barge, about 'midships, and saw the prisoner, his wife, and several women—I had seen him before, but did not know his name—they were on board before me—there were ten or twelve men on the barge in different parts, and about as many women—I should say there were more than twenty—the deceased came up alongside in a boat with several others—he came on board and came up to the prisoner and his wife, and several other women, and desired them to get up—they did so—he took the board, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it down to the bottom of the barge, and went away about 'midships—it appeared to have been put there for the accommodation of the women—he began abusing the parties sitting on the board—the prisoner said, "Do you belong to the barge? "—he said, "If I do not belong to this barge I belong to some other one"—the prisoner said, "If you don't let that board alone I will give you in charge of the police"—deceased then began talking about pulling noses and punching heads—the prisoner said, "If you want to punch my head you had better come and do it "—deceased then went to him, doubling his fists, but did not hit him—the prisoner was sitting on the cabin—head, his wife had hold of his arm, holding him down—the deceased stepped three steps back—the prisoner said, "You had better punch my head"—the deceased was going at him again, when the prisoner's brother, who wore a blue frock and a straw hat, got up and gave the deceased a push to prevent the blow, and through the gunwale of the boat being slanting, he was overbalanced and fell overboard—the deceased was near enough to strike the prisoner when he was pushed—I kept my eye upon William Green—he got into a boat with about five men, and rowed ashore as fast as he could—I jumped into my own boat, caught him on the West India Dock Pier, and gave him in charge of the dock constable, who took him to the station—I said, "You <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> that man overboard "—he said, '" I could not help it'—the prisoner never touched the deceased—he was in the act of rising—there is no doubt he would have struck him, but his wife held him down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there twenty people in the aft of the barge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not think there were not twelve men there—I had a full view of the deceased when he was struck—I saw the girl in the boat: I did not see her on the barge—she was not there when her brother fell over; I saw her in the boat at the time—she never got out till she got ashore—I never went aft—the deceased was a stoutish man, but not able to give a beating to such a man as the prisoner—I distinctly saw the prisoner sitting down—his wife made him sit down, and he never got up after that till he came ashore—the deceased held his head down, over the prisoner, as if he was going to <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> him where he sat—he had moved away from him when William Green met him and hit him—he had turned his back on the prisoner, and was going; aft—William was not close to George at all—the deceased was threatening George; I cannot say what he said—he came up to him, I should say, twice, and wen; away—this was the second time—the quarrel lasted lour or five minutes—there were about eighteen men there.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a labourer. I recollect Doherty coming on board with his fists clenched, in a threatening attitude—he had some words about the prisoner taking the wash-board for the women to sit on—one of the men said, "Don't make a noise about it"—the deceased said, "I will pull your nose!" the prisoner said, "If you mean that, go into the hold"—he was in the act of striking the prisoner, when the brother struck or pushed him overboard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The deceased had his hand close to the prisoner, and was in the act of pushing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; The prisoner never got up at all—they were on one side of the hold and I on the other—there were four or five men at that end to the barge—my husband was with me—Campbell took us away in a boat—William Green went in first, we all did the same—more than one person could stand between William and George Green when the deceased put his hand against him—William was standing up, I never saw him sit down—I saw a little girl have hold of the deceased's hand on board the barge—she came running to us, and said, "For God's sake, what shall I do, my brother is drowned "—when the deceased came, he put her on board before him—the deceased said he would cut the headfasts, and she stood by him then—I was a stranger to all the parties—I could perfectly see what was done—William Green was between me and the prisoner, but was nearer the edge of the barge—I could distinctly see all three.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the deceased on the barge—he and the prisoner had a few words about a board—the deceased stood with his fists clenched over the prisoner, who was sitting down—a man with the prisoner said, "What are you making such a noise about?"—the deceased said, "For a halfpenny I would ring your nose," and made a blow at his chest—he was close enough to hit him, but I did not see whether he did—the other man struck him in the chest, and he was overboard in a minute—I saw him rise twice in the water—the man went ashore directly after—they said he was gone—the prisoner never rose till the lad was in the water—I saw a little girl and boy on board—I did not see her near the deceased—she came ringing her hands, saying, "Oh, my brother! my brother! how shall we get ashore; let us get into your boat!"—I did not see her while they were talking about the wash-boards, not till she came to Where the men were, when the man was in the water—I (did not see her put her hand near the prisoner—we left her on the barge, and came ashore—I was looking at the lad when he was struck there was no one between him and me—the girl might have been by him—she was not close to him at the minute I saw him go.</p>

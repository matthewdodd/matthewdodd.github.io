On the 16th of October I was in the back part of the shop When I was informed by Mrs. Parker, a person living directly opposite of our house, that woman had entered the shop and had taken some goods, but what she could not say. I immediately went in pursuit of the woman, she was gone up a street little distance from our shop. I overtook the woman and asked her what she had got, she said that she had got something that a woman gave her in the street I turned her coat of one side and discovered the two pieces of handkerchiefs. I brought her and the property back, and she was taken to Shadwell office</p>

            . Q. You live opposite do you. - A. Yes, in High Street, Shadwell. On the 16th of October, between eleven and twelve, I saw the prisoner go into the shop, she took something off the chair that stood opposite of the door, and by her concealing it I supposed that she stole it, she was by herself. I went over and gave information of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A woman met me at the shop door, she said she would give me a shilling to carry the bundle, I was glad to earn a shilling. I did not know that they were stolen, or else I would not have had any thing to do with it.</p>

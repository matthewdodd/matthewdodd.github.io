               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. Are you not disposed to think there were twenty-one. - A. I am not disposed to think there were more than twenty; I had not a shadow of doubt to think but what they were right.</p>
               <p>HENRY BECKWORTH. I am servant to Mr. Chipperfield; the prisoner came on the 26th of January, he asked me whether I had room for twenty sacks of flour, I told him no, in a minute or two I would make him room; I did so, I ordered him to pitch the flour at the further part of the lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more sacks in the lost. - A. None nigh the place where I told him to pitch them, if he had pitched the flour there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine how many sacks of flour there were. - A. I did not trouble my head any more about him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked how many did you find. - A. He said were they all right; I said if you have got six behind as in the front of course they will all be right; he went away and I went into the bakehouse again; about a quarter of an hour afterwards I went into the lost, I found a sack of flour missing, I had left seven sacks of brown flour in the loft. I found one of the sacks of brown flour between the sacks that this man brought.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sacks of white flour did you find on the same spot. - A. Only eighteen; we found a sack of white flour among the brown flour, that made only nineteen sacks of white flour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You do not know how many he brought. - A. No.</p>

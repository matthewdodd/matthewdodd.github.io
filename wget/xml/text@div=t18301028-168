            . I am an officer of the Mansion-house. On the 24th of August, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner Wilson go and put his hand against Mr. Cleland's door, in Ludgate-hill, to try it - he appeared to press it; there are two doors to the house; I was watching there - he then went away, and in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour he came again, and went to the other door in St. Martin's-court, staid there a little while, and then went through the court to Little Bridge-street; I followed him down there into Bridge-street, to the coach-stand - he went round a coach there, then went up Bridge-street to Ludgate-hill, crossed over the hill, and went up the Old Bailey; - my partner was standing at the corner of the Old Bailey - we secured him, and took him to the watch-house; I there told him one of his partners had been taken out of Mr. Cleland's house, which was the reason we detained him - he said he knew nothing of it, and on the way to the watch-house, at the corner of Farringdon-street, he tried to get out of our hands; he then threw himself on the ground, and we all came to the ground together - his hat came off in the scuffle, and a bag came out of it, in which was a dark-lantern, a phosphorus-box, a few matches, and a piece of wax taper candle; the bag was picked up by a young man, and brought to the watch-house - I am sure it was the bag which fell from him.</p>

               <p>Wilson. Q. Do you mean to swear that bag came out of my hat? A. No - I cannot swear they are the same things; I saw the bag fall out of his hat, and the bag produced before the Alderman appeared to be the same - it was brought to the watch-house five or ten minutes afterwards; there appeared to be something in it when it fell from his hat.</p>

            . I am a hackney-coachman - I have come from the Compter. I gave Mr. Cleland information of this before it happened; I know all the prisoners. About the 16th of August I went into the Cans public-house, Liquorpond-street, and saw Phillips and Smith; I had been there about a quarter of an hour, when Smith asked if my name was Hussey - I said Yes; I had gone by that name - he knew me well before: he sat down there- I was drinking some beer; he and Smith came to me, and asked if I was out of work - I said Yes; Phillips said he knew of a good concern if I would be in it - I made no answer at that time; I listened to what they had got to say; I asked what concern it was - Smith said it was an out - and - out concern, and as safe as the Bank; Phillips up and told me it was where he had been living on Ludgatehill - he said there were a great number of shawls up in the one pair, which was a warehouse, and there was a great deal of money in the big desk; I asked how it was to be done - he said there were apartments to let, and one was to go up to look at the appartments - another was to follow in close after, and go down stairs; he asked me to take a walk and look at the house - I went with Phillips and Smith; neither of us went in at that time - they asked if I had got any tools or instruments; I said No - Smith said he could get another man who would find the tools and every thing, if he would he in it - we separated, and next day we three met again; Phillips left us to go and find the man - I and Smith were coming up near Liquorpond-street, and met a man who was a stranger - Smith said he was one of the grand mob, and went and spoke to him, and in about five minutes they both came up to me - we went to have something to drink together; I do not know that man's name; we went to a public-house - the man said he had not got any thing of the kind himself, fro he had left it off, but he would find a man; Smith said he could get a man himself - the young man said it was only a few minutes' walk; we all three went down to Mount Pleasant, close by the House of Correction, into the Cheshire Cheese public-house - the young man went to speak to Wilson, and brought him to Smith - Wilson said he could complete the concern, if it was worth while; Smith told him how it was to be done; Wilson said he should like to see the young man that put it up - we came out, and met Phillips at the corner of Liquorpond-street; he told Wilson how it was to be done, and what money there was - Wilson asked if any men lodged in the house; Phillips said only a few old people, who lodged up at the top of the house - Wilson asked if he was sure the shawls were good for any thing; Phillips said that he should see some of them, and that he had lived at the house a few weeks before - we all went on together to a public-house in Monmouth-street, St. Giles'- he told us to stop there and he would go and get the duplicates of some shawls which he had pledged - he went and returned with a bundle and three duplicates; the bundle contained three shawls without borders; one duplicate was for a shawl pawned for 21s., another for 15s., and the other for some stuff for 3s. 6d. - Wilson said he should take them to a party to look at, and tell them he should have a quantity of shawls for them, and they might judge by them what they were worth - the shawls were got out of pledge by some people who were to buy them -I did not see the money advanced, but I saw the shawls after they were redeemed - they were pawned some where in Goswell-street; I saw Phillips go into a person's house, who I understood was to purchase the shawls - we then all four went to Spitalfields; Phillips gave the shawls without borders to Wilson, to do away with, and he brought 10s. as the money he had got for them - Wilson and Phillips then left us; Wilson said he would bring the instruments down to the Cheshire Cheese next morning, and next morning we all four met there - it was agreed among us to be done on the Friday following, but it was afterwards put off till the Monday; on the Monday we all went down to Mr. Cleland's house, about two o'clock in the afternoon; Wilson went up to look at the apartments, which were to let - Smith followed in close after him: Wilson came out in about ten minutes, and told Phillips it was all right, and that Smith had gone down safe - we all three came away to the Cheshire Cheese; I went to Mr. Cleland's that afternoon, alone - I had given information on the Friday before to Mr. Cleland; I went on Monday, some time after Smith had gone in - I rang the bell; a young man belonging to Mr. Cleland came to the door in Ludgate-hill - I told him what would take place in the night, and that a person was concealed; I did not go in - I went down towards Gray's Inn-lane, and at the Cheshire Cheese I found Wilson; this was before dark - he asked where I had been to; I gave him no positive answer, but he said if he thought there was any thing amiss, he would knife me, if I did not stick true - I understood he meant to put an end to me; I told him I had been out, but did not say where - Phillips and Wilson had been playing at skittles; Phillips said it would be best for him to go home, because then there would be no suspicion, and he went - we were then there would be no suspicion, and he went - we were to meet him at White Condnit-house at four o'clock precisely next afternoon, and to bring his share there; I was with Wilson from that time, except for an hour, when he went to tea; a coach was to meet us on Holborn-hill between eleven and twelve o'clock, to carry away the shawls - we got into the coach a little before twelve that night; I did not know the driver- we got out again, and walked to the coach-rank in the Old Bailey, the coach following us; another coach overtook us, with another party in it, and we both stopped together at the rank in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other party acquainted with your intention? A. Yes, they knew what was going to be done; they all got out and got into the coach we had at first got into - there were seven of us in all then; we then drove to Bridge-street, to the rank - we all got out, and came opposite Mr. Cleland's house, on Ludgate-hill, and four of them went away; they were going to another part of the City; they left one of their party with me and Wilson; Wilson told us to go down to the coach in Bridge-street, and he would walk up and see if all was right - he came back, and told us he had tried the door, it was fast, and he thought the vagabond had gone to sleep, with drinking the ale in the cellar - he went back again, and tried the door;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280075"></xptr>I staid by the coach; he did not return, but was taken into custody - I was in sight of the persons who had him in custody, and was afterwards examined by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Smith. Q. I asked what you were doing for your living, and you said if I would stop till the evening I should see? A. No, I told you I had been at work driving a hackney-coach and as a horsekeeper - I did not say I was following my old course of life; I did not go with you that evening and pass off 25s. in bad coin - I had come out of the Penitentiary in April last, and knew you there; a day or two after we first met, a hackney-coachman came in, and asked how I got on about a case - I said I had had ten days' confiuement for charging 1s. more for a fare than was due to me; I did not say I had three warrants out against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, "We have both been transported, and are not going to give in yet?" A. I said no such thing, nor that I had stolen a coat from Wellclose-square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How many names have you gone by? A. The name of Hussey, and no other; I knew if I did not give information I should have been hung, for I could not get rid of any of them, and I knew if I did something of this kind they would have nothing more to do with me; I have had nine years' transportation, and I thought that enough - I was not innocent of what I was transported for; I gave information on purpose to get rid of them, thinking none of them would entice me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not say, "I am going to give information?" A. Yes, but then they would make away with me; I have been transported twice - the first time was for brushes and several articles, taken from a gentleman in Bryanstone-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a burglary? A. No, down an area - I was more than five years at the Penitentiary for it, and exactly five years afterwards I was sent there again - I was not in custody between those times; I was four years with Mr. Wilkinson, a post-master - the second conviction was for receiving some knives and a time-piece, stolen from' Squire Horsefall; they had been given me to carry - I was guilty - I was in the Penitentiary for that a little better than four years; I came out last April, and since that have had ten days for over-charging 1s. - I never drove a night coach; I drove for Mr. Smith for four or five weeks and a few days for Mr. Fenny, of Ratchliff-highway, while his man was ill; I had let a man drive Mr. Smith's coach one night, and he charged 2s. too much - Smith wanted me to pay for the Summons - I would not, and left him; I did not return to him after the ten days were up - I aferwards worked for Chapman, a farmer, at Northall, and left him because he had nothing to do-he said he would employ me if I could cut corn. The coachman said if I did not pay 1l. he would get warrants against me, but I never saw them; I know nothing of a warrant for exacting 4s. 6d. -I have told Smith several times that if we went down into the country we should get some work, and be more comfortable than going on in this way; I did not object to the proposal at the Cans, because they would have been after me continually, at every place I got, and I thought if this spread, about my giving information, they would not come near me; I still went with them after giving the information - I cannot state whether I told the Magistrate about their playing at skittles, and Phillips going home; I must have told him Phillips said he would go home to avoid suspicion, and I stated also that his money was to be taken to a public-house by White Conduit-house - I must have stated that; you will find it down if all I said was taken down - I have been kept in the Compter ever since this, to be a witness here; we were in the public room at the Cheshire Cheese - the master and mistress were there at times; there is a girl here who lived with Phillips - she must have seen us at the Cans; she was no acquaintance of mine - I never saw her till I saw her with Phillips: I have had no conversation with her about what she was to state here, nor on the subject of this robbery; I have been in the Compter all the time - I saw her at Guildhall, but had no conversation with her about the robbery.</p>

I have seen him five or six times - I saw him with Phillips at the Cans, and before the Magistrate: we said nothing about the robbery - I went there about pledging two shawls; Pressey came to my place and told me Phillips was taken up - he took me to a public-house, and then told me all about it, about Mr. Cleland's house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who did you pledge shawls for? A. One for myself and one for Phillips - they both had borders to them; I never inquired where they came from - I have not seen them since; I pledged them about a fornight before Phillips was taken.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How came you at Guildhall? A. Forrester, the officer, came and searched my place, and took me there; Pressey came to me just before the officer - the officer took a great many of my duplicates away, to see if the things were Mr. Cleland's, but found nothing - I had given the duplicates of the shawl to Phillips.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Bride's. On the 23rd of August, about eleven o'clock at night, I went to Mr. Cleland's, and took Smith into custody, charged with being concealed in the cellar; I handcuffed him and took him to the Compter, searched him, and found on him a screw-driver, a phosphorus-box, with matches, a knife, and a little bag.</p>

            . I was sent for on the 24th of August, to Mr. Cleland's; Pressey was there-in consequence of what I heard there I went to the Salmon and Compasses, near White Conduit-house; I got there about four o'clock, waited for fifteen minutes - Phillips then came across the road, and sat himself down by Pressey, on a seat outside the door; I came and secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any body else on the bench? A. No; another man was there, but he left before Phillips came.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday night, the 23rd of August, at twelve o'clock, I received information from an officer - I looked out and saw some suspicious characters on Ludgate-hill; I saw six or eight persons about - I kept about Cleland's house, and about one o'clock in the morning I saw Wilson try<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280076"></xptr>Mr. Cleland's door; he pressed against it with his hand- I missed him for some time, and took him into custody in the Old Bailey, which is nearly opposite to the house; I saw him cross from St. Martin's-court into the Old Bailey, ran after him, and took him - he attempted to get from me twice on Ludgate-hill; Ridgley was with me - we kept hold of him, and at the end of Farringdon-street he threw himself down; his hat fell off - we got him up, and took him to the watch-house; I did not receive the bag till it was brought. to the watch-house - it contained a phosphorus-box, dark-lantern, and pieces of candle; Mr. Cleland gave me a centre-bit a few days afterwards at his own house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any body there besides Ridgley? A. No other officers - some friends of Mr. Cleland were looking out, as it was excepted the house would be robbed.</p>
               <p>MR. CLELAND. I found that centre-bit in the dust-bin in which Smith was concealed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Phillips had been in your service? A. Yes, from the 27th of April to the 27th of August - I had trusted him with property to a considerable amount, and when he left I promised to take him again if I should have employ for him.</p>
               <p>Smith. Q. Do you or your man recollect seeing Pressey on some excuse before he gave the information? A. I never saw him till he gave the information - several questions have been asked at my house since this; Phillips' mother called, and asked if inquiries had been made whether that was No. 17, Ludgate-hill - this was after Phillips was in custody.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I had just been liberated from the Penitentiary - I met Phillips, whom I knew before, on Holborn-hill; we were together an hour or two - I saw him several times after, and met him at the Cans, and at another time I was at the Cans, Pressey came in; I asked what he was doing for his living - he said he was following his old course, and asked what I intended to do; I said my character was lost, but if I could get employ, I should - I asked what he was doing; he said, "If you will go with me to-night, you shall see" - I went, and he passed 1l. worth of base coin at a shop at the corner of Red-Lion-square; I have sent to know if they did not receive two crowns and four half-crowns that night - they say they did, but do not know the person; Pressey asked me several times to put him into a concern - he said, "Who was that I saw you with?" I said Phillips - he asked what he had done; I said he had lived at a shawl warehouse - he said, "Cannot you get a little information about that;" I met Phillips, and asked him some questions about it, then went and related the matter to Pressey - he said,"We can do that if you have a mind;" I said I never did any thing of the kind, but agreed to accompany him - he said he knew Michael Smith, and he asked him several times about the tools; he kept putting if off, and said he would have nothing to do with it; he said, "It is as good as bread, let us do it" - we were all three together; I went and found money to treat with - I refused to go; he said, "Well, I will take the things and go" - he went on Thursday: we waited on the opposite side - he came out, told me somebody was on the stairs, and they could not go down; he afterwards asked if I would go down -I said I would; I swear, before God and man, that Pressey was to commit the robbery, but Phillips and Wilson had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN addressed the Court on behalf of Wilson.</p>

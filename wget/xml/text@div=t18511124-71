I went to 1, Gloucester-villas, Richmond-hill—I found these articles in a box there, of which the prisoner had given me the key—here is a pair of slippers, a silver pencil-case, two books, a muslin apron, and some remnants of lace—the prisoner had obtained a situation there—I have shown these things to Mr. Thrupp.</p>

On the 11th of March, about half past eight o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner looking in at the window - he then walked away for about a quarter of an hour; I turned my head, and saw him at the window again watching the boy who was cleaning the brass plate at the door - I saw him moving his arm he was against the window. I saw some cards move in the window, and directly I got off my seat, I saw a knife move in the window - he had the knife through the hole driving the card out; his hand was not inside; I did not see him take any thing. I told Mr. Marchant; he ran to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170021"></xptr>the street door. There was a gold pin in the card he was moving. He did not get that.</p>

            . Jones informed me. I went to the private door, and the prisoner was at the window; I tried to catch hold of him but he got away - I followed and stopped him in Riding House-lane, without losing sight of him. I missed two wedding rings; he had not got the pin out. The cards the rings were on, were left behind. I have not seen the rings since.</p>

I missed the things mentioned in the indictment [ mentioning them] on the 27th of April. I went to a great many pawnbrokers, and left an account of the things lost; and on the 30th one of the table-cloths was stopt by Mr. Styles in Castle-street, near Leicester-fields. That is all I have found again; the pawnbroker brought it to me. I went to get a warrant, and saw the prisoner in the street and took her. I charged her with all the things. She said, she had nothing but that table-cloth, and that, she said, she borrowed; but did not say, whether it was of my wife or me; and as she wanted money she went to pawn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she borrow it.</p>
               <p>Langford. No, she never did: she has borrowed lesser ones; but these were of a better sort, and seldom used.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the things missing from?</p>
               <p>Langford. The two table-cloths were in a deal box, and the gown and spoon in another box, both in the room where I lie, that is, in a one pair of stairs room, and the prisoner lodged up two pair of stairs. The room door was generally kept lock'd, unless the maid left it open after making the bed.</p>

            . The prisoner came to pawn the table cloth with me some time in the latter end of April; there were the letters E. L. upon it. Mrs. Langford had been with me before, and described it. I stopp'd it, and went and gave her an account of it. As I was going the prisoner desired I would not go, and acknowledged she had taken it, and that she had a large family and wanted a little money.</p>

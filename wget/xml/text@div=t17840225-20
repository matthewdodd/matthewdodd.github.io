             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of January I sat in my parlour, and I observed the prisoner at my shop window.</p>
               <p>Court. What time? - Between six and seven, near seven I saw the prisoner go from the window, and return again in the space of a minute, I had a gentleman with me in the parlour, and I told him I must go to my trap, I had contrived a trap at my window, I had been robbed so frequently, and if he had introduced a hand, or a finger, or thumb, I should have caught them, and held them fast; I went into the shop behind some shutters that I had put to secrete myself, where I could observe every transaction at the window. I saw the prisoner extend his finger against the glass of his right hand, and with his left hand he was working his hand, and I heard the glass crack; as well as seeing his hand in this manner, I saw some of my goods go out of the window, without his hand being introduced, I then considered it was by an instrument; a gentleman at this instant knocked at the door, and informed me of him, I said I was obliged to him, but I should know the man if I saw him, I would go out and look for him.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he drawn any thing out? - Three girdle buckles, a black girdle buckle, and a silver nutmeg grater.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these things were in the window before? - Yes, I advertised in two papers for this gentleman to come forward, but he never appeared, I had my window mended on the Saturday morning, and on the Saturday evening I went out, and when I returned I found two or three of my neighbours and the prisoner in my parlour, I addressed him with, O you are an old acquaintance of mine, I saw saw you here last night, for he had on a double breasted coat, it was not a lappelled coat, and the button holes were so close to the buttons, that when they were buttoned, the buttons touched within a quarter of an inch, which is remarkable, and I described him so to my wife, and he went away and came again six or eight times before he had compleated his purpose; therefore I had an opportunity of seeing him, for I had at a high window four lights, which gave me a full view of him, so that it is impossible I should be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Council for the Prosecution. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the lights were in the window between you and him? - They were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott Council for the Prisoner. What<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250063"></xptr> time of the evening might this be? - Between six and seven.</p>
               <p>What part of the shop was you in? - At the end of the counter, facing that window he was at.</p>
               <p>I should have supposed if the lights had been behind you, you could have seen into the street? - The lights were close to the window; they gave light that I could see him.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on at that time? - He had a slouched hat.</p>
               <p>And a great coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw any thing more of that man on the Friday evening? - No, there is an instrument that he threw away.</p>

               <p>You live in Fleet-street? - Yes, I know Mr. Lewis's shop; on Saturday the 24th of January, as I was coming down Ludgate-street between the hour of six and seven in the evening; just before I came to Mr. Lewis's door, I perceived the prisoner at the bar at the bulk on the left-hand side, just by the door; and just as I came almost on a line with him, I both saw him break and heard the crack, which was made with something he had in his hand; he directly left the window, rather in haste, as though conscious somebody had seen him; he went down Stationers-alley, and then wheeled round; by this time Mr. Lewis's boy run out of the shop, and said that is the man that broke the window; I immediately went up to him, he made a slip as if he had fell, I laid hold of him, and the people began to gather round him; I saw him hurl something into the highway; I said he has thrown something into the highway, I wish you would try to find it; I took out a candle, and a boy picked up a knife, which I have in my pocket; Mrs. Lewis immediately sent away for Mr. Lewis; when Mr. Lewis came and saw him, he said you are the man that I saw here last night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. That knife you saw him hurl away? - I saw him hurl away something, there was no goods upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. You saw this man break a window as he went through the street.</p>
               <p>Court. When you first observed him, was he standing or walking? - Standing, with his hand close against the glass; I perceived some motion against the glass and heard it crack.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I do not know what to say, there is my Council; I have people to call that I am innocent of what I am charged with.</p>

               <p>What makes you recollect the day? - The Sunday following was my own child's birth day that I buried.</p>
               <p>How came you to meet there? - Mrs. Anderson and me are very old acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Who fixed on the spot? - I believe my husband or her; I received a penny post letter.</p>
               <p>Have you that letter? - I have not.</p>
               <p>That is a pity; have you looked for it? - No, I do not think I have the pockets on; the letter is of very little consequence; I have not it about me; but such a letter I really did receive; I live in St. James's Market.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Mr. Harris did not drink any tea at all? - I do not recollect; when he came in I told him we were but drinking the third dish.</p>
               <p>How many dishes do you generally drink? - That is just as it happens; some times I drink six or seven; I am fond of tea.</p>
               <p>How came you to fix just on the number of three? - I am sure we had drank no more.</p>
               <p>You had toast and bread and butter I understand? - I do not know that Harris eat any thing; Harris went away at a quar- before nine; I did not go away till after supper; I believe it might be turned of ten, but I cannot tell as to the time of my going away, what time it was.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go home? - I went as I generally do, through Chandois-street and Tavistock-street, the way to St. James's-street; my husband saw me as far as the linen draper's in St. James's Market; I lodge at the corner of St. Alban's-street: he parted from me at the linen draper's.</p>
               <p>Nobody else went with you? - Nobody else at all; I never saw Mr. Harris afterwards.</p>
               <p>Then you are sure that nobody went with you? - Nobody but my husband.</p>
               <p>You two went together arm in arm after making this quarrel up? - We went home together.</p>
               <p>What became of your husband after that? - He went to his lodgings.</p>
               <p>But it was made up? - No, I have seen him, but it is not made up, nor may be never may.</p>
               <p>Who else was in company? - Nobody else was in company the whole evening that I remember.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Anderson walk home with you? - I do not remember that she did.</p>

            ? - I do.</p>
               <p>For what purpose? - To see my wife.</p>
               <p>Did you meet your wife? - I did.</p>
               <p>When was that? - It was the 23d of January to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Be so good as explain to the Court your reason for supposing it on the 23d of January? - Yes, Sir; on the 22d I went to the Bank and received some money, for which reason I appointed on the 23d to be at Mrs. Anderson's.</p>
               <p>Court. What day of the week was it? - To the best of my knowledge it was Friday.</p>
               <p>Why do you suppose it was Friday? - Because on the Thursday I went to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Did you see your wife there? - I did; when I was at St. Margaret's Church, it was past four; I cannot say to the minute; I then went from thence to the Strand; I found I was beyond the time; I was to have been there at three; I called in the Strand; I did not stop as long as I have been here; I went immediately to Mrs. Anderson's, where I met my wife; I look upon it, it might be about a quarter after five; my wife was there first; I suppose I staid there four or five hours; I staid there till I do not know whether it was ten or eleven; there was Mrs. Anderson and a child, and there was the prisoner, he came in afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250066"></xptr>Who went away first, you or the prisoner? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you drink any thing there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What? - Anniseed.</p>
               <p>Who went home with your wife? - I did.</p>
               <p>Any body else? - Mrs. Anderson.</p>
               <p>Did you and your wife walk together and Mrs. Anderson follow you, or did you all walk in one bunch? - I cannot say; I parted with my wife in Market-lane, close to the Market, and then my wife went home and Mrs. Anderson with her, and I saw Mrs. Anderson home after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You went with her and parted in Market-street; what became of you? - I staid there till Mrs. Anderson returned.</p>
               <p>What! in the street; where did she go; how came you to part there? - Because it was not my desire to go any farther; my wife lived about a stone's throw off.</p>
               <p>You did not chose to go that stone's throw then? - No.</p>
               <p>Why the quarrel was made up? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Did not you make up the quarrel between you and your wife? - I do not know that I did, I appointed to see my wife there upon some business.</p>
               <p>Then it was not to make up the quarrel at all? - I did not come here upon that quarrel, nor upon the affairs of my wife.</p>
               <p>What was the business you met there about? - To see my wife.</p>
               <p>That was all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that you call business? - I do call that business.</p>
               <p>What did you go there for besides? - I do not choose to tell you what I went there for, nor neither shall I.</p>
               <p>Then it was not to make up the quarrel at all; now, Mr. Cam, this going home, you do not know what time it was, whether ten or eleven, or half after eleven? - I have told you I did not know exactly the time I went away; I did not mention any time to my knowledge; I told you I did not know the time; I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - I cannot say rightly.</p>
               <p>Then you say you went home? - Yes, Mrs. Anderson walked as far as Market-lane with me and my wife, and she and my wife went away together.</p>
               <p>Your wife said nobody went with you? - I cannot say that, I am speaking for myself.</p>
               <p>What is Mrs. Anderson? - I cannot say rightly, something in the feather way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, I beg leave to call a person that lives next door to the prisoner at Walworth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. My Lord, they have kept their witnesses in Court and now they are going to call them, while our witnesses have been all out of Court.</p>

               <p>I am servant to the last witness Mrs. Welch, who lives at Walworth; I know nothing of the prisoner; only I heard him go out one evening.</p>
               <p>What evening? - I cannot recollect the day of the month, it was the Friday before the search warrant was Sunday.</p>
               <p>What Sunday was that, do you recollect? - I cannot recollect the day of the month; it was in January sometime.</p>
               <p>What did you hear or see? - I saw nothing, any farther than I thought I heard him come down stairs to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Why do you suppose it was this man? - Only by the quickness of his steps, I have often heard him.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - To the best of my knowledge it was a quarter after five o'clock, I cannot tell for a quarter of an hour, I heard nothing pass.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Welch. How came you here to day? - In a coach.</p>
               <p>What did you come for? - I was subpoened here.</p>
               <p>By whom? - By Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>How came Mr. Lewis to know that you knew any thing of this man? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Lewis. How came you to subpoena this woman? - I had a search warrant, on the Sunday in the morning, to search his house; Mrs. Welch came to me at the door, and asked me what was the matter, I told her; after that I called at Mrs. Welch's but did not see her, and I called again after the examination at Guildhall, on the Monday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. At that examination at Guildhall, were these witnesses,

             called? - No; Harris gave an account of them at Guildhall, that they were to appear.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, with respect to the crime of burglary, the Judges in construing the law respecting it, have extended the construction of it certainly very far, for they have held that it is not necessary for a person actually to go into the house, but that the putting into a house any part of their body, or even any thing which they hold in their hands by which the felony is committed, is sufficient to constitute an entering; that is certainly a very extensive construction, but it has been so decided for many years.</p>

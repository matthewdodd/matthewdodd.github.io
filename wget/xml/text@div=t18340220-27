I am an officer - I took the prisoner, and asked him where he had carried the hams - he said he had had no hams, nor carried any - I then said,"Where did you get the hams you carried to Mr. Winsor's?"- he said from the City, that his mother had sent him one, and some other person had sent the other - I took him to the watch-house, and the next morning he asked to see Mr. Wells, one of his masters; and he said to him that he had made a great fool of himself, but he hoped he would not be hard with him; and that it was Freeman's fault, who had led him into it - he said he had had three before; two he had sold, and one they cut up.</p>

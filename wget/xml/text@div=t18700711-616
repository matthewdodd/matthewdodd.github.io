I am a pawnbroker at 55, Charlotte Terrace, Lambeth—about 2 o'clock on Friday morning, 10th June, I heard a noise of something smashing—I went down stairs and disturbed the assistant, who slept in the shop—we made a search but could find nothing—I went to bed again—the boy came to me, and in consequence of what he said I went down and waited at the door till a policeman came—when we opened the inside case we discovered that a hole had been cut in the shutter, and the plate-glass shattered—the goods were all distributed about—I missed about half a dozen knives and two or three meerschaum pipes—anyone could have reached them by putting an arm through the shutter—this is the plan of the panel that was cut (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was last to bed the night previously and the shop was securely barred then.</p>

I am a coffee-shop keeper, of 24, Charlotte Terrace—that is about 60ft. from Mr. Ramus's on the opposite side—about 1 o'clock on Friday morning, 10th June, I was standing at my door—I saw two men go up to Mr. Ramus's shop—they did something and went away—there was another man on the opposite side and he joined them at the comer of Eaton Street—in a minute or two they went back to the shop—I was inside my shop then, looking through the window—they went to the shutters, went away and came back again—I heard a noise like a large crushing of glass, or something of the sort—the two men were at the shop then—I only saw their side-faces—they wore black felt hate, black coats, and the trowsere were something dark, but I could not say what they were—I gave a description to the police, and on Sunday afternoon I went to the police-station and there saw eight or ten men—I picked Hibbell out as one of the men I saw on that morning—on Sunday night I was again called to the station, when I picked Anderson out of about eight men—I said I fancied he was the man, but I could not say for certain—he on had a high hat then, and that made the difference—to my knowledge I had never seen the men before—I do not think I hare any doubt about the two prisoners being the men.</p>

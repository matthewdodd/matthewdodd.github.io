               <p>seven in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and his wife in the Goat public-house, 41, Verulam Street—that is not very far from where they lived—the prisoner was very tipsy—his wife was sitting on a seat when I went in, with her eyes closed, very queer—I spoke to her, she returned no answer, but shook her head, and soon afterwards fell down between the bar and a vat which stands in front of the bar—I picked her up—her hus<lb></lb>band assisted me with her across the road to their own house, 12 or 13, Verulam Street; it is opposite the Goat—I placed her on the second step of the stairs from the bottom of the flight which leads up to the first floor, the second step from the passage—her head was then leaning towards the wainscoat—I left her in her husband's hands, and did not see her afterwards—she never spoke a word to me as she went along, nor to her husband—she said, "Harry, come home," meaning her husband—that was before she fell—it was said in a very faint voice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Harriet Hawkins—I was locked in the kitchen on this day—I heard somebody call Mrs. Hawkins, and they called again, "Is Mrs. Hawkins in?"—I said, "No"—I then looked about and found a key, opened the door, went out, looked up, and Mrs. Snelling slipped—Mr. Snelling whs on the top of the stairs with her—she slipped down the stairs—he was the only person there—he was looking at her as she slipped, and I went up, and she fell backwards down to the bottom—when I first saw her she was sitting like this, with one hand like this, and the other like this, on the first stair—there are only nine stairs, and she fell down to the bottom stairs, down to the stones, which are at the bottom—after she had fallen, her legs were in the back kitchen and her head in the front, in the middle like—I could not say what caused her to fall—I went up and she fell—she was not going up stairs when I first saw her, she wanted to come down—when she fell I went up and told Mr. Snelling—he did not come down—he said, "I thought she went up stairs," and then he came down and caught her by the shoulders, and knocked her head on the stones three or four times—I saw him do that—that was after she had fallen—he was ant helping her up—she did not say anything, she only went like this (<hi rend="italic">making a snoring noise</hi>)—after he had knocked her head he said, "Let the b—die"—it was after he got tip stairs he said that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Francis Hawkins, of 13, Verulam Street—the prisoner has lived on our second floor since 2nd September—he is a painter—on the night in question at ten minutes to seven I returned home from my husband's stables—my little boy spoke to me, and I found Mrs. Snelling lying at the bottom of the stairs—the kitchen is underground—the stairs are old wood, and there are square stones at the bottom—she was insensible, but breathed—I lifted her up and found that I was covered with blood—there was a quantity of blood at the bottom of the stairs and on her head—I sent next door for Mrs. Wallace, and after that the prisoner came down—that was the first time I saw him—I told him she was dying, and I thought we had better have a cab and send her to the hospital—he swore he would not let her go to the hospital—he said he would have her in his own room, and would not have a doctor—I afterwards saw the deceased in her own room; but before that, when the prisoner came down to the kitchen, and I lifted her up, I said, "Mr. Snelling, she will never walk any more;" he then violently gave her a kick, I could not say where; but I understand it was in the stomach—her feet were under her, bent, her head was down, and Mrs. Wallace and I had hold of each arm—I was side-face to the prisoner when he kicked her—I thought she was dying before he gave her the kick—I said that she would never walk again—I sent for two doctors, and then went into her room and saw her on the bed—she lived about an hour from the time that he gave her the kick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 38, John Street, Bedford Row—on 2nd March I was sent for to the prisoner's wife—I found her lying on the bed quite dead—I examined the back of her head externally; there was an irregular contused wound about an inch and a half long, which had been bleeding—it was at the back of the head, on the right side—on the follow<lb></lb>ing Monday I opened the head—Sunday had intervened—I found a frac<lb></lb>ture of the bones at the base of the skull, not corresponding with the wound outside, but lower down—the wound was above the fracture—there could not be a blow at the part which was fractured—I believe the cause of death wae fracture of the base of the skull, causing an effusion of blood on the brain—a fall from a staircase on the stones at the bottom, or on the edge of the stairs, would be likely to produce what I saw—there were contusions on each side of the forehead, and on the nose—that had nothing to do with the cause of death—supposing she had fallen down and received that frac<lb></lb>ture of the skull, I think a person taking her by the shoulders and knock<lb></lb>ing her on the hard stones would accelerate her death.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I live at No. 48, Chamber-street, Goodman's-fields—the prisoner lodged at my house for ten days—it will be a month to-morrow since he left. On Sunday night I was aroused by the opening of a window above—I jumped out of bed, opened the window, and saw the prisoner receiving a bundle, coming down from above—that was while the prisoner was lodging with me—his wife was living with him while he lodged in the house—he lodged on the second floor; I live on the ground and first floor—I could see the bundle coming down, and I could see what it was—I noticed the blankets and the feather bed—the prisoner ran away—I ran after him—he turned into a court, or passage—I could not see any more of him that night—I saw him eight days after, on a Monday, at the corner of Prescott-street—I asked him whether he thought it right to treat me like that—he said, "Stop a minute, I will go to my governor, get some money, and settle with you"—I went with him—he took me close to the railway, in the Minories; he then ran under some of Pickford's wagons, and tried to escape—I called "Police!" and he was stopped—after I pursued him on the night of the robbery I went up to his room, and found everything gone—I left the door open when I pursued him—I went to bed at about 11 o'clock that night—the prisoner and his wife were then in doors—I myself fastened the door—none of the things have been found.</p>

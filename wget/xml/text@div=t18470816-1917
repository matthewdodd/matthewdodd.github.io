                  </hi> I am in partnership with my father, George Samuel Oram, in Whiskin-street—the prisoner was our apprentice. I went out on the evening of the 27th of July, and left him at work—I came home about eleven o'clock, and he was gone—I did not miss anything then, but on the following day the policeman came, and missed two watch movements—these produced are what I lost.</p>

About one o'clock in the morning on the 28th of July, I met the prisoner and another boy in Holloway—I stopped them, and asked them where they were going—the prisoner said, "To Barnet, and from there to Liverpool"—he said he was in no business, he was going to get what he could—I searched him, and found these movements on him—I asked whose they were—he said they were his own, that he bought them in Petticoat-lane for three shillings, and he was going to dispose of them to help him on the road.</p>

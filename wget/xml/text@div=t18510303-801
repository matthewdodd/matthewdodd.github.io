                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 98.) I saw the three prisoners in Battersea-fields on 6th Feb., about half-past nine o'clock in the morning—they were together—I was in plain clothes, and I watched them—I saw them all go into two public-houses, and Ellington and Feary went into five shops—Stringer staid outside, watching—they afterwards went to Mr. Bellchambers', and I saw Feary go to his shop three times, and Ellington and Stringer stopped on the opposite side of the way—the third time, Feary made a pull at the coat which was hanging at the shop-door—he did not get it—he went back to his companions after touching it—he saw me watching him, and I went into Mr. Bass's, a builder, about fifty yards from Mr. Bedchambers'—Mr. Bass went up-stairs, and looked out of his window—he came down-stairs a few minutes afterwards, and told me something—in consequence of that, I went towards Wandsworth, and when I got to the Railway arch, the prisoners were there—they were stopped by Mr. Bass, and given into my charge—with Mr. Bass's assist<lb></lb>ance, I took them to Mr. Bellchambers' shop, and then went to find the property—the witness, Skinner, pointed out to me a heap of bricks, which was close to the road where I had followed the prisoners—I found this cap under the stack of bricks—I received this coat from Mr. Bellchambers' shopman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder. Walker came to my house, and I went up-stairs—I looked out, and saw the three prisoners—Stringer and Elling<lb></lb>ton were on the opposite side, a little distance beyond Mr. Bellchambers' shop, and Feary was nearer to my house on the same side—it was between one and two o'clock in the day—I saw Feary walk to the other two pri<lb></lb>soners, and then he went across to Mr. Bellchambers' shop, and then back to the others, then back to the shop, then back to the others, and then to the shop again, and the third time he went in a hurried manner, and made an attempt at something, I could not see what it was—the moment he grasped it, the other two walked off, and Feary ran after them towards Wandsworth—I went down, and gave information to Walker—I then went out of my back-door across the gardens under the Richmond Railway, and saw the prisoners close to the main arch—I came behind them, and caught them—they saw me just as I came up, and one of them, I think Feary, said, "Let us <hi rend="italic">cut</hi>"—one of the others made answer, "No, d—n it, let us stand our ground"—I then beckoned Walker to come on—he came, and they were taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. John Edward Bellcham<lb></lb>bers; he sells clothes and caps, and boots and shoes. On 6th Feb., I heard a noise outside the shop-window—I went out, and missed a coat and a cap from the front of the door-post—the cap was fastened to the coat—I had seen them safe a few minutes before—I found the coat in a meadow adjoining the shop, by the side of the road going towards Wandsworth—there are wooden pales by the side, and it was three or four yards from the pales—this is the coat and cap—I know the cap, because it is exactly like the one I lost, and what I have got—I had not sold a cap that day at all like it.</p>

I was working for Mr. Carter, in a garden, near Mr. Bellchambers'—it joins the Wandsworth-road—I saw Stringer and Ellington coming from a heap of bricks, where this cap was found, about twelve yards from the road—it was between one and two o'clock in the day—they walked on to the end of the road—they made a stop, and looked round towards Mr. Bellchambers' shop—they went back a little way; they then went forwards, towards Wands<lb></lb>worth—I afterwards saw the officer bring the prisoners back, and I pointed oat the heap of bricks.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how many persons are necssary to work an engine of this kind? - A. Three, generally, one to each end of the fly, and the other at the foot of the press to feed it.</p>

and some sieves that are used to fist the saw-dust out of the halfpence, and these cloths all over grease, I do not know what they are used for.</p>

I had not seen them from the Friday, for another person fed them, but when I came to the stye on Monday morning the 11th of May, I missed three pigs out of the five; they might be worth more than 6 s. a piece; the stye is about two furlongs from the house. Mr. Carr came to Hampstead on the 26th, and told me that he had seen his pigs; I went the next day to town, and found the pigs shut up in a back place, at the George Inn, in Long-Acre. I can swear to the three pigs; the next day I carried them to the sow.</p>
               <p>How do you swear to the pigs? - By the marks that they had, AND THE SOW WOULD SWEAR TO THEM TOO; for when I carried them home, the sow and they perfectly well knew one another, and the pigs began to suck immediately.</p>

               <p>I am one of Sir John Fielding's men; I received an information against the prisoner for robbing Lord Onslow's fowl-house. I went down to the prisoner's house, at Clapton, when I came there: the prisoner had left his house; this was on the 14th of May, on Monday the 18th I saw him in Hatton-street, in a cart, selling turkeys. I laid hold of the cart and horse, and the prisoner not choosing to tell where he lived, in order to find out his dwelling-house, I let the horse take his own way with the cart, and the horse went down to the prisoner's house at Hoxton. I found his wife in the house; I knew her, and in searching, I found five pigs in the stable; his wife looked out at the window; I took the five pigs, and brought them to the George Inn, Long-Acre: these pigs were the same which were afterwards shown to King, and he swore to three of them; King described the pigs before he saw them.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher; I live in Goswell-street, and deal in Smithfield-market; I have no shop. I was in Smithfield on the 15th of May, and there I saw a man cheapen six pigs; I believe the prisoner to be the same man.</p>
               <p>What sort of pigs were they? - Prick ear ones of the Norfolk kind.</p>
               <p>How large were they? - They might be worth seven or eight shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>How came you to trouble yourself about these pigs? - I bid the man money before; six shillings.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prisoner bought them, or no? - I cannot tell; I did not see him buy them.</p>
               <p>What colour were the pigs? - Spotted.</p>
               <p>All spotted? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were they all of the same size? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had no conversation with the prisoner at the time? - No; never in my life, other than seeing him about Smithfield-market.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you to appear here, since you are as you say, a stranger to the prisoner? - I heard the man was in custody.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030015"></xptr>Who told you so? - I was told by his friends.</p>
               <p>Who came to you about it? - A man, that knew this man, came and asked if my name was not Barrington.</p>
               <p>Court. How could they know that you could give material evidence, when you had no conversation with him at all?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have known that man some time; I knew his name was Barrington, that made me enquire after him. I had enquired after several others, that knew better of it than he did, but they are not here, because it was in the news paper, that the court would not sit to day.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I believe he saw me in the market that very day? - I saw him in Smithfield-market about two or three days before he was taken, near the Bear and Ragged-staff, by the Hog-market.</p>

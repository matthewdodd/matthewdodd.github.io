            . I reside at Highbury-place. On the 2nd of February, about ten o'clock at night, I was returning home, and crossing the <placeName id="t18110220-79-crimeloc437">City-road</placeName>

When she had hold of me I imagine she put her hand behind me underneath my coat. I immediately went back to a lamp, knowing I had some silver in the other pocket I took it out to see whether I had mixed the gold with the silver, I found I had not; I ran up and down the City-road, I could not find the prisoner; I went into the public-house where the prisoner first accosted me; there I saw the prisoner at the bar drinking with some more people; a constable was in the house; the prisoner was searched immediately; he found a guinea and a half upon her.</p>

            . I am a constable. I searched the prisoner; I turned her pocket out; I found a guinea and a half in her pocket, some halfpence, and silver. The gentleman said he could swear to the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that half guinea, is there any thing particular about it - A. I wafered a letter with it; I put the ruler upon it, that made a dent upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going towards Islington, this gentleman accosted me; he put his hand down my bosom; he gave me a sixpence. and some halfpence. The gentleman came to where I had something to drink, and said I had robbed him of a guinea and a half; I said if I had it he had given it me among the halfpence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

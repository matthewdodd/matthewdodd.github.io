                  </hi>. I live at 12, Newcastle-court, Strand, and have known the prisoner about four years—on 6th February, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, he sent for me to a public-house in St. Clements-lane—I treated him and his two friends, and went away—after that I met with them at another public-house in Holy well-street, and treated them again—I mean, I paid for what they had to drink—after stopping there about half an hour I bade them good night—the prisoner said I must go along with him—I said I could not stop, and bade him good night—I ran out of the public-house, and when I had got some little distance I saw him coming—I ran as far as Somerset House, when he ran up to me, and he said, "I'll</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260078"></xptr>
               <p>murder you!"—he struck me in the stomach with a penknife, which went right through my clothes, and made a slight wound—it was nothing to mention, because it had to go right through my clothes—I had on a silk dress, three petticoats, a flannel petticoat, besides stays and under<lb></lb>clothing—some soldiers came up, and pushed the prisoner away, and he was after<lb></lb>wards taken into custody—he had been drinking a good deal—he caught me round the neck with the left arm, and struck me with his right.</p>

I was going down Wellington-street, heard a cry of "Police!" ran down and I saw the prisoner turning into York-street—I went down the other way and met him—the woman came to the station, and told us what the prisoner had done—we gave her a light, and she undressed herself to see what had been done—she found a spot of blood on her under<lb></lb>clothing—the prisoner had evidently been drinking.</p>

On 26th February last I was employed at Woolwich in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners together there—Ryan was carrying a pair of boots—he took them into four shops and offered them for sale—Brown stood outside—I stopped Ryan and asked him where he got the boots from—he said he made them where he had been working in Union-square, Woolwich—I asked if he knew where it was—he said yes, he could show me—he went some distance with me, and then said, "It is no use my telling you a lie; I made them in London, where I have been working"—I then told him I should take him into custody—Brown made off but was brought back by a civilian.</p>

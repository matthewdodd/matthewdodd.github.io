                  </hi>. I am a corn-porter, of 12, Clarence-street, Rother<lb></lb>hithe—on 26th July, about 8 in the evening, I was in doors, and heard a noise—I ran out, and saw Fennell strike Mr. Reed, and knock him down—as he was going down Gainey hit him on the face—Mr. Reed ran into a shop for protection, bleeding in the face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 8, Clarence-street, Rotherhithe—Fennell lodged in that house for about eighteen months—the deceased was my father; he was quite sober on Wednesday, 26th July, and I was sitting at the window, and I saw him at the top of the street—I saw him <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi>, and went and told him to come home—when he got to our door Gainey hit him on the nose, and made it bleed, and while he stood in the road bleeding, Fennell knocked him down, and kicked him in the back—he ran into No. 10 to get away, and Gainey pulled him out, and kicked him again on the left side—he got up, and then Fennell hit him on the eye—he fell with the blow—my aunt ran over to take his part, and Gainey hit her, and raised a great lump on her head—Fennell's wife then took the prisoners in doors, and my father went in doors, and washed his face—he went to work next day, but came home ill at 12.30—he went to bed, but could not rest, and went down to my uncle's—he took to his bed on Thursday night, and did not get up any more—he died on Sunday morning—Mr. Frith attended him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it not Gainey who knocked your father down, and kicked him on the back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but Fennell kicked him on the back as well—I said so before at Green<lb></lb>wich—on the Friday I saw that the skin was grazed on my father's back—it was a heavy kick; he had good big boots on—it happened only one door from me—I saw my father <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> Gainey before he was struck by anybody—Fennell has lived eighteen months in our house; he is not a peaceable young man; it is not the first time he has hit my father—my father was not a quarrelsome man; he was more quiet than other people in that neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer for the parish of Rotherhithe—on Friday night, 28th July, about 10.30 o'clock I was called to Mr. Reed—his head was very much battered about—there was severe erysipelatic swelling, and the eyes were closed—his head was almost twice its natural size—he complained of great difficulty of breathing and pain in his side, and presented the appearance of having been severely ill-used—his throat was swollen and discoloured—he died on Sunday morning with appearance of congestion of the brain—I made a post mortem examination, and found a quantity of blood between the skull and the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, as if from the rupture of one of the vessels of the brain—my opinion is that death was caused by concus<lb></lb>sion of the head, extravasation of blood, and rapid congestion—I found abrasion of the skin below the left shoulder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the immediate cause of death was extra<lb></lb>vasation of blood on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the viscera were perfectly healthy—he was about thirty-four years old, and was a fine, hearty, well-made man—the erysipelas was caused by the injuries—some people are more disposed to it than others; that had nothing to do with his death—I cannot say how long the extravasation had been going on; it was not from natural causes.</p>

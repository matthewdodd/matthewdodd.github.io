            , Carlisle Mews, Bedford-square: Last Friday was a week, the ostler of the Red Lion came and ordered a chaise and four, and one saddle horse, to go out; we took up at the Red Lion, in Tottenham-court-road; after waiting there twenty minutes for the prisoner, who came in a hackney-coach, he got into the chatle, and ordered us to drive to the Load of Hay, at Haverstock-hill, two miles and a half out of town; when we arrived there, he got out of the chaise, and went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were you hired to go? - A. To Hounslow at first; when he came out of the house, he brought a soldier with him; he got into the chaise, and said, turn about, my lads, he ordered us to drive to Hampstead; he said to the soldier, take my stick, and thrash the rascals; the prisoner then came out of the chaise, and gave me several violent blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Which horses did you drive? - A. I drove the leaders.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he went to the other lad, and served him the same? - A. Yes, that is my master; he got into the chaise, and ordered us to Hampstead; I told him any where where he pleased; we went up to Mrs. White's, a stay-maker's, I believe we asked him which was the house; he said, he would stop us when we came to the house. When we came to the house, there was a young woman at the door, and when the prisoner got up to the door, she knocked first; she cried out do not let him in, he is so and so, and she ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said he is a madman, he is a madman.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Witness.) What were the words the young woman said, do not let him in - what were the words that she used? - A. He wanted to take Sally, I believe she said.</p>
               <p>Q. The young woman said, do not let him in, he is coming to take Sally away? - A. Yes; the prisoner said to the young woman, what do you mean by that? he ran after her, but could not catch her; he returned again to the door, and came up to Mr. Clarkson's servant, who was in a gig, and pulled him out; the young man got away from him, the prisoner ran after him farther than I could see. When the prisoner returned, I was standing at Mr. White's door, I asked him if he caught the young man he ran after; he made me no answer, but caught hold of my coat, and cut me in the lip with a knife; I caught hold of his two arms to defend myself, and with my struggling about he cut me on the shoulder; I called out for assistance, I said, come, master, for God's sake come, or else I shall be murdered. He came to my assistance, and defended me as well as he could, and as soon as I saw an opportunity, I put my leg under him, and threw him on the ground, and we kept him there till the constable came; he cut me about six inches across the shoulder, this is the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. It was nothing of any wound on your shoulder that happened in the scuffle, how was your lip cut? - A. Right through to my teeth; he had the knife in his hand, but whether it was the blade of the knife, or any thing else, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Whether it was before the constable came that he saw I had a knife about me? - - A. It was before.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether I brought the soldier out of the house, or whether he said you are using that gentleman ill, at Haverstock-hill; I said, I am an old soldier, and he promised he would take care - that was after I had given you and your comrade the beating? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then I took the trooper with me, thinking I should have some assistance against these youths; he ran away as soon as the battle came on, he was not steel to the battle, he was not a man of my heart, he was not point valiant, he did not stand by me at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you wish him to stand by you for? - A. He saw I was in danger of being ill used by these rascals; I will tell you my story by-and-by, only I will put them to rights now and then, when they swerve from the truth.</p>

             sworn. - I am a post-master; I was driving the horses: I went to Tottenham Court-road to take this gentleman up to the sign of the Load of Hay; when he came there, he got out of the chaise; Mr. Davis, who keeps the house, asked him if he was going to give the lads something to drink; he said he would see them d - d first. Up came a soldier and interfered; I told the soldier to mind his own business, I was hired to go to Hounslow; the soldier and I had two or three rough words; the gentleman told us to go to Hampstead; I then said I had no objection, so as he paid me for it; the gentleman began beating my man with this stick; he came to serve me the same; I let him taste my whip as well, then he left off. He got into the chaise, and ordered us to drive to Hampstead; we went to Hampstead, and stopped at Mrs. White's, on the right hand side of Hampstead-hill, and there was a double knock at the door; I believe the prisoner gave it, but I was on the other side of the chaise:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180095"></xptr>I heard a woman's voice say, do not open the door, Mrs. White, for this gentleman is coming to take Sally away. I believe he drove the woman away somewhere, but that I do not know, I was on the other side of the chaise; when he returned, there was a scuffle with a servant man that was in a gig: I saw him run up the hill after him; he came back again, and I heard my man crying out for assistance - that the prisoner had a knife in his hand, and that he should be killed. I went to his assistance, we got him down at that time; he cut at me, but I did not see the knife till he was down; he struggled sometime with the constable before he could get the knife from him, the knife was open; we put him into the watch-house, and returned home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it not when I was in the house that you turned the horses' heads to London - who ordered you to do that? - A. Nobody; had not I a right to do that to go to Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not Joe Davis that ordered you - did not I tell you I would take you to Hampstead? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is rather a ridiculous thing of Mr. Clarkson; he was rather desirous of Sally: she is a very pretty girl, and every body else as well as me liked her; the only objection that the mother had to my having her was, I was too old; the mother said she was a poor young thing. Mr. Clarkson was very officiating when he found I was coming after her, he said I was a madman; the father and the mother went off the bargain. I went up on foot to Mrs. White; says I, Mrs. White, I am come to offer to take Sally for my wife, and I will take you all and give you a pretty jaunt if you will go to Gretna-green, I will pay all the expence, will you let your three daughters go; she said, no; (Sally had no objection;) she said I was a blockhead for talking such nonsense; I told 
               <persName id="t18050918-116-person1059">Sally</persName>
             I would take out a license, and take her to Scotland. All this was agreed to; Mr. Clarkson said I was a madman; he it was that ordered our

             to turn the horses' heads to London; I ordered them to be turned to Hampstead, they would not do it; I told them, if they would not, I would make them: the blackguard post-boy heard it, he would not stir a step till he was paid; I went into the bar; I said, how much is your demands for the chaise; he said, two pounds, and ten shillings for the horse to Hounslow; I said, there it is, and nine shillings between you; I went up to Hampstead, and Mr. Clarkson's man came driving up in the single horse-chaise, and said, do not let the man in, he is mad; I said, you say I am mad, I will let you see; he ran away, I never asked for Sally; a woman cried out, murder, murder, at the windows, this fellow is come to take Sally; those men here got me down, I did not know what they were going to do with me; I had my knife, I wrought with my fingers till I got it open, and by G - d I would kill any man that dared stop me in the King's highway: the scoundrel of a constable came up to me, and stamped upon my wrist, and got the knife out of my hand; there is the mark on my wrist now. I was brought back as a felon; they took me to the public-house, and stripped me of every thing; what I did was in my own defence, being attacked in the road. In the first place I demand that my money may be returned - the forty shillings that I paid for the chaise, they not having performed the journey; they may keep the nine shillings for the dressing I gave them; that villain (meaning the constable) stripped my pocket of every thing.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a constable of Hampstead, I heard the cry of murder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you take his money from him, and how much? - A. Yes, a penny-piece and a shilling, that is all that ever I took out of his pocket, besides his snuff-box and twelve yards of white ribbon, which I have left at home. When I heard the cry of murder, I immediately ran up; I met a soldier, I asked him what was the matter up there; he said, I am in a hurry, I believe there is some mischief being done. I went up, and saw Mr. Halston on his back; I said, for God Almighty's sake take the knife out of his hands, he will murder me; he made a strike at me; I put my foot down on his hands, and took the knife out of his hands. I caught hold of him by the collar when he got up, and he caught hold of me by the throat; I was obliged to secure him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had something to communicate to His Majesty about Bonaparte; I have endeavoured to introduce myself to the Prince of Wales; I was denied admittance.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You will not be treated improperly for any thing you communicate here? - A. That is foreign to the present subject. That villain said he had delivered up all at Hatton-garden; there was a skein of silk and a twenty-shilling note I will swear he took out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this you know about Bonaparte? - A. I would rather not mention it here at present, because you will possibly look upon it as the effect of a disordered brain; I am sober, I speak the words of truth: if you read in the Hebrews, you will find it written - A body hast thou prepared, O Lord; and the same thing was said of him that died at Jerusalem - he is a madman; is not this the carpenter's son. I can shew you, if you will allow me, all the marks that ever he had on him, not that ever I was at Jerusalem, but my manner of life is known to many in England, Ireland, Scotland, and America; I may be deemed mad, I am not. I can shew you what I suffered in the House of Correction, if you like to go into it, without being indecent at all; I know what I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180096"></xptr>do know, and in your presence I shall prove that I am what I am. What I have to communicate to His Majesty, I will communicate to you in private, if you please, not here. I wished to see the Prince of Wales; his insolent porter told me he would not admit a man of my description: I went in disguise, with my gun in my hand, a powder-horn, and a shot-bag; I wished to be admitted in that garb as an old soldier. He that suffered in Jerusalem suffered but little to what I suffered; these wounds (shewing them) I got in this pretty House of Correction, for me attempt of running away with Sally, who was very willing to go, whose connections are not very genteel; she is the daughter of

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You have under your care a number of people of this description at Hoxton - you have had this gentleman in your care? - A. I knew Mr. Halston from the present time up to the year 1790. In September that year he was put under my care; he was with me about three weeks that time, he was then in a low desponding state of mind; then he was admitted into St. Luke's Hospital, upon what they call the cure establishment; he remained a year there, the usual time, and was discharged, that was in 1791; he then came under my care again, and remained so till the year 1794, when he was re-admitted into St. Luke's Hospital on the incurable establishment, for which it is necessary to give security for a year, and I became security upon that establishment; he continued in that situation till the year 1799. For that five years I had frequent opportunities of seeing him, being security, and supplying him with little comforts that he stood in need of, and during that time he was labouring under a partial mental derangement. He was, however, very earnest to be set at large; I communicated to his brother on the subject, and against the conviction of the steward of the hospital, and against my own conviction, we complied with his request, on condition that he should be placed somewhere near to myself, that I might have an opportunity of seeing him occasionally to superintend and watch over him; I placed him at my gardener's, a house close to my own; I had frequent opportunities of seeing him almost daily; he conducted himself with very great propriety, he was very calm and very honorable, which is his natural disposition when he is right; he used to go to town for me on errands, such as carrying cash to the bankers, and receiving bills; he was much better at that period, though at that time I thought there were the seeds of insanity lurking about him, and if there was any exciting cause he would become downright a deranged man. His brother, to whom he has a great affection, I believe, has returned from India, after being there twenty-six years; it was an event very likely, in my opinion, to affect him, for either a great deal of pleasure or joy on one hand, or a depression of spirits on the other, would excite the lurking seeds of insanity into action, and the joy of seeing his brother might have taken this effect on him. I never considered him as cured of the disease; he was, when right, the best disposed man I ever saw; I saw him on the day he went in the chaise, and I saw him a day or two after he was committed to the House of Correction; there I saw him completely outrageously mad, scarce a rational word to be got out of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before the Magistrate, and told him all this? - A. I did, he was in a strait waistcoat then; he told me a long history that he had seen Bonaparte, and had conquered him and his brother Jerome; I saw Mr. Halston in the prison also, I am thoroughly satisfied, from the questions I put to him about Bonaparte, that he is labouring under mental derangement.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, you look upon him as deranged in his mind? - A. Certainly.</p>

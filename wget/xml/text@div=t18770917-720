                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 786). On the night of the 22nd of August, about 9.30, I was in Jury Street, Aldgate—I saw Sullivan with a drunken man and Cleary about 10 yards away—I watched and saw Sullivan with her arm round the drunken man's neck—she took him into a dark doorway where they stood a little while—I saw Sullivan with something in her hand, and she put it into her dress pocket—she said something and ran away—I ran and caught her—she said "I have done nothing"—Clearl then came up, and she took the purse from her pocket, and was in the act of passing it to Cleary—I caught hold of her hand with the purse in it and caught Cleary with the other hand—they struggled, and I was obliged to let Cleary go—I still held Sullivan—I asked the bystanders to assist me—the purse contained 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—police constable Dixon brought Cleary back—he said "I don't know that woman."</p>

I passed Cleary once or twice; a crowd collected—he stood about 100 yards off, and then came up and asked what was the matter—I might have said "She has stolen a purse"—Cleary did not say that he had done nothing, and that if he was to be accused he would go and find a policeman—he came up after I caught the woman—Cleary had a piece of rag round his finger—his arm was not in a sling.</p>

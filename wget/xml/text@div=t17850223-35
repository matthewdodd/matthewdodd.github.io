               <p>Going down Newgate-street, between seven and eight o'clock, on Friday the 11th of February, I passed two men opposite to Mr. Payne's shop, just after I passed them, they turned short about, and looked in at the window, upon which I turned and looked at them, just after I saw one of them strike his hand through a pane of glass, and take some stockings out, I pursued them as fast as I could, after he got into the middle of the street, he threw some stockings down, I pursued the prisoner, crying stop thief! I followed him into Ivey-lane, then I lost sight of him, he turned into a court that goes into Newgate-market, I followed him into the place, but did not see him taken; I cannot swear to his person, I should not know the stockings again.</p>

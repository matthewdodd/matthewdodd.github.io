               <p>Mr. Conte came to my house last Sunday evening between five and six o'clock, and when I came there, I found the prisoner on his back in the parlour; I searched him, and found in his pocket an old knife and 2 s. I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Sunday morning about eight o'clock, there was two men that belonged to the East India Company's ship Brunswick, came to my house and called me out to take a walk with them; we went to Clerkenwell; coming through London-street, this window was up, they threw my hat in and I went to get my hat, and they came and laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Court to Bateman I think you say, that the prisoner threw open the window and looked into the room once or twice, before he came into the room. - He came back first and throwed up the sash, and went away, then he came back a second time and opened the blinds, and then he went again.</p>
               <p>Q Was it possible for you to distinguish the features of a man, to know he was the same man? - I could, he jumped over, and there was two outside to help him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any hat thrown in? - There was no hat but what was on his head.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

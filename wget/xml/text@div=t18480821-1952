                  </hi>. I am one of the partners of Messrs. Cook, Son, and Company, St. Paul's Churchyard, Manchester warehousemen. The prisoner was in our service as salesman and manager of the outfitting department, a business we knew little about ourselves—he had no authority to take money for goods, or to take poods on his own account, or to delivery to Baker—if any ready money transaction took place, or credit not to shippers, it was his duty to enter the goods in the journal of the day—I have here the waste-book and the journal—in the journal there is no entry of these goods—there is an entry in the waste-book to H. Baker—I am not acquaint with the prisoner's writing, but it is very likely it is not his—he might order the clerk to enter it—here is, "Henry Baker, one and three-quarter of super wool, dyed, two and a half kerseymere"—this book is intended expressly for the convenience of shipping—if I wanted an order that was not shipping I should not expect to find it here—across this there is another mark, <hi rend="italic">"Ent, "</hi> meaning it has been entered in the journal—this "<hi rend="italic">Ent., "</hi> in red ink, in my opinion, is the prisoner's writing; but I am not sufficiently aware of it to speak to it—we are unable to turn to the journal of this date, for this is not dated—the item before it is Jan. 24, 1847, and the entry after it is Jan. 16—these two entries are posted in the journal—there is no entry in the journal of Baker's goods—we have never been paid for them—if I had known he had had any transaction with Baker, or let him have these on his own account, I would not have permitted it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The book you have here is the shipping-book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the shipping waste-book—it is marked outside, "Outfit Journal"—it was intended for that, but not having a shipping journal this book was taken for it—this means outfitshipping—I find no entries here but for outfitshipping, but some that I have a strong suspicion were put there for the same purpose that this was—some we can prove were—this is the particular entry I speak of—I think it is not the prisoner's writing—it would be entered by his orders—I think M'Ginniss might be the clerk at that time—I have not inquired who made the entry; I did not think it was necessary when it was acknowledged—the prisoner might have ordered any boy in the room to do it, there were perhaps six or eight in the room—the firm had access to this book, they scarcely ever looked at it—it was a waste-book expressly for shipping—if a merchant buys goods from the 1st to the 50th of the month, and wishes to have them all in one entry, that the invoice may go to his correspondent, he would have them so—half-a-dozen different sales would find their way into one entry, if he orders it—they are put in in items, for the purpose of a general invoice—here is the name of Mrs. Nixon; she is a merchant—I learned the purpose of this book from Mr. Foy, as soon as we began to look into the books—I looked through it, and found no entry, except to merchants, except those we have strong reasons to believe are wrong—I did not see this item before I gave the pri<lb></lb>soner in charge—I saw it the day afterwards—we sent an invoice to Mr. Baker, charging him with these goods, and expected to have his bill and receipt up—he was not a customer of the firm, but a friend of the prisoners—this book was never in the counting-house that I know of—its place was up stairs—it was brought down to Mr. Foy's office, and was there posted up—he had an opportunity of looking at it every day—I do not know whether there was any particular time for entering in the journal—when a merchant</p>

               <p>gives an order for his invoice that would be posted up—I should think it might be three months before it was entered in the journal.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You know where to find Baker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We never knew him, or of this entry, till the morning after the prisoner was takea—he is a servant to Lowe, of Kingston.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. This item in this book to Mr. Baker, without a date, is my writing—I made it by the prisoner's direction; I can<lb></lb>not tell when—the "<hi rend="italic">Ent.</hi>," written across it, is the prisoner's writing—it means that it has been entered in the journal, in the counting-house—that journal has been examined, and there is no such entry.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Have you looked at the journal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know how I came to omit the date—it was an oversight—the prisoner was over me—he did not order me not to put the date—the prices are put cor<lb></lb>rectly, as he told me—all the entries on these two pages are mine—here are some of the prisoner's entries in this book—he might make entries as well as me, but I being the clerk, ought to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know anything of this lumping system, putting half-a-dozen things together, and then including them at the end of the month? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That has not been the case in this journal—they have been entered as they are here—I have done such a thing in another journal—the prisoner has not desired me to enter my own items—goods have been entered in fictitious names—it was the habit of that department, and I think it was the habit of the house—when a customer came in it was my custom to enter what goods he bought—the goods were given in to me by the prisoner, or any warehouseman—young men in the bouse have bought goods, and probably not wishing their names to appear in the book they have appeared in other names—three or four persons had goods, which have been lumped together, and—all entered in one name, and the amount has been paid in one name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have the entries in the book, in fictitious names, been of goods supplied to the young men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that has been confined to transactions when they have been paid for regularly—I do not think Mr. Cook or any person in the house knew of it—it was the request of the young men to the prisoner, and he gave me the names of the persons to whom they were to be entered—if the money were paid to the cashier when the goods were supplied, the house knew nothing of the matter, so long as the money was paid—this <hi rend="italic">"Ent."</hi> denotes that the person who entered it has made the entry in the journal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing two or three ready-money customers came in, might he put down the entry to Jackson, or any other name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been done—they might come in, and he would say "What name? "—they would say, "Never mind about the name," giving a fictitious name, or none.</p>

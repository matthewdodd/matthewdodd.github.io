                  </hi> On Friday night, the 22nd of Oct., about twelve o'clock, I was in a public-house in Whitechapel-street, with my husband. I saw the prisoner there—my husband left, in consequence of missing a ring off his finger—as soon as he was gone out, one of the women was going to leave—I said, "Stop a minute, my husband will be back with a policeman, and perhaps you will have no objection to be searched"—I went to the threshold of the door, and she struck me—I fell, and the prisoner came and thrust his hand down my bosom, to take my watch from me—I grasped his hand, and tried to raise myself up, and he kicked me at the side of the temple—I fell down again, with the pain, but I held his hand till I rose myself up, and found the policeman at my elbow—the prisoner did not suc<lb></lb>ceed in getting the watch—he put his hand in twice, and caught hold of it the second time, but I held it till the policeman came up.</p>

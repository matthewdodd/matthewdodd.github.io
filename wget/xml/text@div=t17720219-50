On the first of February the prisoner came to my master's in the evening, to ask for a bit of black stuff; I shewed her a remnant of half a yard, which she agreed to give 6 d. for. She stood close to the shew-board in the window. There were two red cloaks and a black sattin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190031"></xptr> one; they were folded up; she had a child in her arms; she put the child on the counter between me and the window. She gave me a 5 s. 3 d. I said, I cannot change it for 6 d. Then she said she would have a bit of pink stuff; I went backwards to get the change, and when I came to her again, I observed her drawing a cloak out of the window upon the counter. I sold her a yard of the stuff, and gave her change. I called our young man up, and asked him if he had taken the cloak out of the window; he said, No. The prisoner went out; I followed her when she had got about ten yards, and desired her to walk in again. She said, what do you want? I have got nothing of yours. As she was coming back, I saw her attempt to drop something from under her arm; I held her arm, and the cloak from under it. (The cloak produced.) Here is my master's shop mark upon it. She confessed she was a little in liquor, and did not intend to take it; but if I would let her go, she would give me all she had, and go into the country.</p>

               <p>The prisoner in her defence said, she set her child down upon the counter; and whether the child took it up or no, she could not tell; that she had been a wet-nurse since her husband's death; and that she was in liquor at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Chitlow. Had she the child in her arms?</p>
               <p>Chitlow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cloak under the same arm as the child?</p>
               <p>Chitlow. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in liquor?</p>
               <p>Chitlow. I believe she was a little.</p>

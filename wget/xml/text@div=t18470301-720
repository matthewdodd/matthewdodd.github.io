                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Shannon—we live at No. 48, St. Paul's-terrace, Islington—the prisoner was in my service about five months. On the 19th of Feb. I missed from a drawer in my bed-room a box, contain<lb></lb>ing several articles, five sovereigns and a half in gold, and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the drawer was locked, and I found it locked—I belived the property was there on the 16th—the key of that drawer was on a bunch of keys, and I had left it in a drawer till nine o'clock that night—after missing the box on the 19th, I went to the kitchen and said I had been robbed of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was some<lb></lb>thing in the prisoner's manner which induced me to suspect her, and I requested her to come with me to her box, to see what see had—I there saw a pair of ear-drops which had been in the box that the money was in—I found some velvet cuffs, a handkerchief, and a watch-key, which had been in the same chest of drawers, but not in the same drawer where the box was—I required her to turn out her pockets, and she produced a garnet necklace and a pair of red silk gloves, belonging to me—she had a red cloth petticoat on—the cloth of it was mine—I knew it because it was an old cloak, and from pieces that she had of it in her box, and from its being moth-eaten—I could swear it was mine—the constable was sent for—I reproached the prisoner with her conduct, and asked how she could do so—she denied that she had the money, and said she was not the first that had done wrong—she was searched at the station, and I saw a sovereigns and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver taken from an old glove which was found on her—four sovereigns and a half were taken from one stocking which she was wearing, and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from the top of her petticoat—I could not swear to this note as I did not known the number of the note I had. but it was folded in a particular manner to be put into the box, and this note had that appearance—I do not think it had been unfolded—there was another necklace found in a gown which the prisoner had just taken off, before she accompanied the officer and me to the station—she had seen me put money into that box—she came into the room on the 13th, as I was putting a sovereign and a</p>

            . I am assistant to the overseers of St. Giles Without, Cripplegate; my business is to relieve the paupers - in December, 1826, and for some time previously, I relieved the prisoner, as a <rs id="t18270913-57-deflabel345" type="occupation">pauper</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18270913-57-defend745 t18270913-57-deflabel345"></join> of that parish - I also relieved him six years ago - I relieved him again in January, 1827, and several times, till July 1827. On the 18th of July I paid him 25s. on account of his taking his wife and family from the poor-house; on the 20th of August we again took his wife and family into the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the 25s. given to me? A. Either to him or to his wife, in his presence - I paid it on his account; I paid the money, as his wife said, he had said he would take her out of the house, if we would give her that money - he was not present then, but he came in the morning, took the money, and took his wife and family away; it was said, by either him or his wife, they would not be troublesome again; that was said in his hearing, if he did not say it himself; the wife and him were talking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a direct application made to you to advance that money, on an undertaking on his part, or by his wife, in his presence; that they would not be troublesome any more? A. That was the impression on my mind; the money was asked for in his presence, on a promise that they would leave the house; he had been moved to us regularly in February, 1825, and settled in our parish, with his family - he was present when his wife received the money.</p>

            . I am relieving overseer of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On the 8th of January I received the prisoner and his family to our parish, by a regular order of removal at that time - I paid him 8s., which I wrote on the order; I continued to relieve him at different times till August - our parish did not appeal against the orders. On the 14th of August I paid him 3l. 5s. to set him up in business as a box maker; I did not then know that his wife and family were in the poor-house at Cripplegate - he, himself, was admitted into our work-house on the 25th of July, with his family, and discharged on the 14th of August, when I paid him the 3l. 5s.</p>

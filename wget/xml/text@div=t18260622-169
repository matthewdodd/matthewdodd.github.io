               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did he work by the piece for you? - A. Yes; at his own house - I turned over a great deal of leather, and said I could not say it was mine, but I can swear to this, by the figure No. 8. upon it - he never made but one pair of boots for me; he jobbed and mended; he had not work enough from me to keep him - I know this other piece by No. 6. on it; I know the blocking of these pieces from all others in the world.</p>

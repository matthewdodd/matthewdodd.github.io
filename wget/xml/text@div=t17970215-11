             sworn. - On Saturday evening, the 11th of this month, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked to look at some muslin handkerchiefs; the last witness shewed him some; I cannot exactly say what passed between them, because I did not pay attention to them till he was about to leave the shop; the prisoner was got to the door, with the door in his hand; the young man requested he would return and bid him something for one of them; the prisoner said, they were all too high in price; the young man said, he would render them lower if he would point out one that he liked, but he would not come from the door, but when pressed more closely, he said he would give him 1s. 6d. for the one he offered him for half-a-crown; his not returning into the shop gave me some suspicion of him; he was partly out and partly in, he had the door in his hand; I turned round then, for my back was towards the prisoner, and observed under his coat some muslin, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him take any thing before he went out? - A. I don't know that I had looked at the man before; he immediately shut the door; he saw that I was following him, and he ran away; I followed him about twenty or thirty paces, I caught him by the collar, and he immediately threw the goods behind a pillar of a door; I secured the prisoner, and brought him back into the prosecutor's shop; I met the other witness at the door, and requested he would go for a constable; he brought a constable and one or two of the officers of the night from Mary-le-bonne watch-house; we then took the prisoner to the watch-house; the officer searched him there, and found nothing upon him but what was his own property; I brought the handkerchiefs back with the prisoner into the shop, and kept them in my custody till the constable came; we took him from the watch-house to the office, and the Justice committed him.(They were produced in Court by the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the goods you picked up in the street? - A. Yes; I gave them to the constable, who is ill in bed, and cannot attend.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure those goods which you had in your possession in the shop, when you brought the prisoner back, were the goods the prisoner threw away? - A. Exactly so; they were never out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brings them here from the hands of the constable? - A. The last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know is, they are the same you saw the prisoner throw away? - A. I cannot swear that; they have been in the constable's hands ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gordon.) Did you see, in the presence of the last witness, the things that he produced as the things that were stole by the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that those things were ever in your shop? - A. Yes; they were part of the things I shewed to the prisoner, previous to his being taken up.</p>

               <p>Q. And afterwards traced to the custody of the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly sure they are part of the things you missed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever sensible of the man's taking them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you or not certain they were taken out of the shop, and by whom? - A. I don't know by whom; I have every reason to believe him to be the person, there was no other person near at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you have no doubt that they are part of the things shewn to him, and nobody could take them but him? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these things? - A. Eleven shillings.</p>

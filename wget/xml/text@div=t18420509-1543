                  </hi>. I live with my sister, Frances Evans, who is sin<lb></lb>gle, and keeps the Bee Hive public-house, King-street, Commercial-road. On Monday morning, the 11th of April, the prisoner was at our house from half-past ten, till a quarter to one o'clock—he had two half-pints of beer—he called for another half-pint, and a pipe—I had to leave the bar to get it, and left the prisoner in the bar, and no one else—I returned in about a minute, and the prisoner was then gone—two females came in for some beer, and gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to the till for change, and missed from it a small wooden bowl, which contained about about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the till is under the counter—it was not kept locked—I had gone to the till to give change to a female not two minutes before I left the bar—it was as the female went out of the door that the prisoner called for the beer—the bowl and silver were then safe—I knew the prisoner well—he used to come to our house frequently, but not lately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-man at the Bee Hive public-house. I saw the prisoner there on Monday, the 11th of April—when he first came in about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, he asked for some beer, and the newspaper, but I do not think he looked at it—he put it down, came into the tap-room, and asked me to lend him a penny, which I did, and he had half-a-pint of beer—that was about half-past eleven—he was standing up against a cask in the bar, facing the counter—he asked mis<lb></lb>tress if she wanted any sawdust—I was called up on the money being missed—I found the prisoner about a quarter to nine, that same evening, in the tap-room of the Bull's Head, Well-street, Mile-end, New town, and gave him into custody—he was dressed differently to what he had been in the day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you quite sure he is the person that asked you to lend him the penny? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite—he said he would pay me when he brought the saw-dust—I had seen him several times before—I did not know where he lived—my mistress said he lodged about fifty yards from our house in the next street, and she went to his lodging—I afterwards went there with a policeman to search—a woman declared that he was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live opposite the Bee Hive. On Monday the 11th of April, about a quarter to one o'clock, I was brushing my clothes, and looking out of my first-floor window, from which I can see into the bar of the Bee Hive, and right through into the tap-room—I</p>

               <p>saw the prisoner standing at the bar—I knew him—I saw the young wo<lb></lb>man turn her back to go into the parlour—the prisoner immediately put his hand across the counter and took something out of the till—he came outside the door, put it into his pocket, walked a little way up the street, and then ran away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was your window down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and the Bee Hive window also—the street is about twenty yards wide—I swear I saw the prisoner take something out of the till—he was standing at the bar not above three yards from the window—I knew him by working at Mr. Town's, the boot maker's, the next gateway but one to me—I am sure he is the person I saw come out—I never had any quarrel with him—I never spoke to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my custody by Day at the Bull's Head, charged with robbing the till at the Bee Hive—he said he was innocent of the charge—I asked him what he had done with the clothes he had on in the morning—he said he had given them to a man that was out of work—I asked where he got the clothes he had on—he said he had bought them at a sale shop—I asked where—he would not tell me—I found seven pence in coppers on him—Archer has made a mistake in saying the street is twenty yards wide, it is quite a nar<lb></lb>row street—I do not think two carriages could pass in it—I should not think it was twenty feet wide.</p>

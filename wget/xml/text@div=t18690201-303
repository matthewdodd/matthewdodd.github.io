                  </hi>. On 1st January, I travelled with Lady Cholmondeley from Stokes Bay to the Waterloo Station, where we arrived a little before 6 o'clock—we had eleven packages—after arriving at home we mussed a bag late at night, and gave information at the Lost Property Office of the railway station—I afterwards saw this bag (produced) at the Police Court; it is exactly like the one I lost, but the lock has been cut out—this gold watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belongs to me—I cannot say whether it was in the bag—I believe it cost fifty guineas, but I have had it nearly fifty years—this spoon is electro-plated, my crest is on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I came to town with Lord Cholmondeley on 1st January—this bag exactly resembles mine, but there was no particular mark on it—I put into my bag some linen, a flannel dress, a little box containing a few medicines, some boots, this spoon, and this watch, at the Anglesea Hotel, Stokes Bay—I missed the bag on arriving at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 70A.

I received information from Mr. Chignell, and, got this watch and spoon from him—I took the prisoner on the evening of January 6th, at the Hole-in-the-Wall beer-shop—I told him the charge, and told him I had watched him into a jeweller's shop, and he must accompany me home—I knew his rooms—he went to his lodgings, 13, Francis Street, close by, and in the back kitchen, which is a bed-room, I found this leather bag, with the lock broken off—I said, "Halloa, what is this?"—he said, "Yes, that is what you want"—I found some other things not in this indictment, and told him he would be charged with stealing them—he said, "I have not stolen them; I have paid dear for them; they were given me to sell."</p>

               <p>could get out he would make a clean breast of it—I said "If he can do go it shall be done"—I did not suggest his being made a witness of instead of a criminal—I know Mr. Scott, the traffic manager—I did not consult with him as to whether the prisoner should be made a witness—I told the prisoner's brother I had seen Mr. Scott, but I never said if he made a clean breast of it he should not be prosecuted, nor lose his situation—I never said that he should not be prosecuted—I said I had seen Mr. Scott, and his wife had seen Mr. Scutt—his brother saw me several times—I will not swear that I did not represent to the prisoner's brother some conversation between Mr. Scott and myself—I will not swear that I did not say that if the prisoner would make a clean breast of it I would undertake that he should not be prosecuted—I cannot positively say what the conversation between us was—I did not tell the brother that I knew very well that Merritt had not taken the things, and I wanted to find out who had—I said I knew there were more concerned in it; I upeant other porters, anybody else—I believe at this moment that they are all porters wbo are concerned in it—notwithstanding all this, I have never been able to make the prisoner make a clean breast of it.</p>

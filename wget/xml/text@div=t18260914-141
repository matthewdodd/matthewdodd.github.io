               <p>EDWARD LONDON RODICK. On the 16th of August I took a coach, with another gentleman, from St. Paul's Church-yard, and ordered to be driven to No. 7, <placeName id="t18260914-141-crimeloc825">Jermyn-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he object to your sending for change? A. No; I do not know whether the coach was opened while the servant was gone - I am sure I did not drop the sovereign in the coach.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody. The prosecutor said he had lost a sovereign; I then searched his pocket but did not find one; but found a sovereign among the straw, in the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No gold was found on him? A. No; he was too anxious to be searched; I mean he did not express any disinclination; five or six shillings were found on him - it might be only three.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman never gave me any sovereign.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 134.) I was on duty in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood of Hart-street, Bloomsbury, on Sunday night the 13th of April—it is my custom, as I go my rounds to try the doors and places, among others the church doors—about a quarter to eleven o'clock that night I tried the western door of the parish church of St. George's, Bloomsbury, and found it open about an inch—I was returning down the steps to send a person to inform the sexton, and I heard a party inside turn the key—I stepped up again and found that the door had been locked—I sprang my rattle, and placed a constable, No. 123, at the door—the sexton came very shortly after, he applied his key to the western door, but could not get it in, as there was a key in it inside—I then accompanied the sexton to the front door, leaving No. 123 at the west—the sexton opened the front door, and we went in—I asked "Who is there?"—no answer was made—I then went to the communion-table, and there found the two prisoners—I took Page into custody—they mentioned their names, and said they knew the clerk—I saw a lucifer match picked up in the porch by Sergeant Hunt, that is a good way off from where I saw the prisoners—it had been lighted—I went to the western door and the key was taken out—it was tried and it turned the lock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sexton of the parish of St. George's, Bloomsbury—it is my duty to keep the keys of the church—I know no<lb></lb>thing of this key found in the western door—on Sunday night, the 13th of April, I locked the southern and western doors after service—there was no one in the church to my knowledge when I secured the doors—service was over at half-past eight o'clock, within a few minutes—the candlestick pro<lb></lb>duced is the one by which we lighted ourselves out—before I went out I left it in the western porch, between the outer and inner doors—I am sure I did not leave it under or near the communion-table—the plale is kept in an oak chest by the side of the font, in the eastern aisle, about fifty fret from the communion-table, which is on the northern side of the church—I saw the candlestick found underneath the kneeling-cushions round the communion-table—I quitted the church about nine o'clock that night—about eleven o'clock I was called by Simpkin—I proceeded to the westers door of the church and found I could not put my key into the lock, something prevented me—I put my finger in and found there was a key—I went round to the front door, and on opening it we went in and found the prisoners outside the communion rails—I saw this key taken from the western door—tltere was a candle in the candlestick when I left—I had extinguished it—I cannot say how long it was when I left it, or whe<lb></lb>ther it had been lighted sines—there are a good many prayer-books left in the church—the parish plate is valuable—nothing was taken away—I knew Nicholas as the son of the late beadle—he used to be frequently about the church with his father—I should think he knew where the plate was kept—I cannot say.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been sexton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly two years and a half—I have frequently been in the habit of locking up the church at night—I can positively swear that all the doors were locked on this night—I locked most of them myself and looked at all—there are six outer doors—I locked four and tried the other two—they are fastened with iron bars, and I put my hand to the bars to feel that they were secured—I recollect that distinctly—there are no means of getting in except by the doors—I believe all the windows are barred—air is let in by means of case-ments which open a few inches.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Smith, who is in the county gaol, Newington. On Wednesday morning, 3rd May, I was coming up the steps of London Bridge, and saw the prisoner at the top of the steps with my hus<lb></lb>band's coat, waistcoat, trowsers, shirt front, scarf, and hat on—he is no relation—I had never seen him before—I asked him if he came from Horsemonger-lane</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184805150161"></xptr>
               <p>gaol—he said no—I said he could have got those clothes nowhere else, for they were my husband's—he said, "They were given to me, you had better not go to the gaol, as they country will be obliged to find your husband a much better suit than these, and you will be the loser rather than the gainer by going"—I went over the bridge with him—he said he should not go with me unless I paid him four shillings for his day's work, he was going down Kent-street, and if I liked to follow him I might—I gave him in charge—I went with him to Horsemonger-lane and he was ordered to change his clothes—these clothes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my husband's—an inside cost and a pair of boots are still missing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I went a good way with you before you gave me in charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; three parts of the way, and then you said you would not go further without for shillings.</p>

                  </hi> I am turnkey at Horsemonger-lane. When pri<lb></lb>soners come in, their clothes are given to me; when they go out, I give them back—when the prisoner was going away, he was given into my hands to give him his clothes—I took two prisoners into the clothes-room, turned round and saw this prisoner had a bundle in his arms while I was serving the other—he said, "These are mine"—I put my hand in the hat and took out a name "John Smith," on a piece of paper—I asked the prisoner's name, he said, "John Smith"—(<hi rend="italic">his name is Thomas Smith</hi>)—I said, "Are they your clothes?"—he said, "Yes"—we went to the bath-room—the prisoner put on the boots and two coats belonging to John Smith, who is still in the gaol—he left the prison—Mrs. Smith and the policeman afterwards brought him back, and told me in his presence that the clothes were her husband's—he did not deny it—he said I had given them to him—(he had packed the bundle and said they were his)—I made him change them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not the policeman tell you unless you said I took them it would not be conviction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never made such a mistake before, and should not now, only you gave me a false name—the ticket that was on the clothes is destroyed—that was not because Thomas Smith was robbed—the Governor did not reprimand me—if any person had come and said his name was John Smith, I should have given him the bundle—it is almost impossible for a person to leave in a counterfeit name—you did not receive a note say<lb></lb>ing that some clothing was sent by your friends—it is usual to destroy's prisoner's clothes if they are in a foul state.</p>

                  </hi> I was on duty in the Borough, and saw Mrs. Smith and the prisoner walking together—the prisoner was given into my charge—I said, "How did you become possessed of the clothes?"—he said they were given to him—I took him to Horsemonger-lane and received this bundle.</p>

I live at 22, Great Peter Street, Westminster—on Wednesday, the 11th March, I met Brown, in the middle of the day, at the Black Horse public house, York Street—I did not know him—I might hare seen him before, but not to recognize him—he wanted to pick up a quarrel with me in the house—I did not want to have any quarrel with him, and I stood a pot of beer—I took the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and paid for it—I then left the house, and went up Tothill Street to the Cock—Brown followed me, and two others who are not in custody, and a man named Pugh, who was let off yesterday—Brown wanted to pick up a quarrel with me in the Cock, and I stood some more beer on purpose to get rid of them—I might have been there half an hour—I left the house to get rid of them, and went to the White Horse—they followed me there, and there I saw Forrest—they wanted to hare a quarrel there, at least Brown did—Forrest did not enter into it—I stood some more beer there—it was about 10.30 when I left the White Horse—I was sober—I had about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my left trousers pocket at that time—I went down New Tothill Street, and when I got by the iron posts at the end a person came up behind and caught hold of my right arm—I turned round, and saw it was Brown—the other two, who have not been caught, were with him—Forrest was not with them—he was about six or seven yards behind—Brown immediately caught hold of my throat with both hands, I believe—the other two helped him—they caught hold of me, and knocked me down on the curb—I fell with violence—I then felt a pressure on me—I became insensible, and knew no more till a few days after, when I was in the hospital—Forrest was not one of the persons who at ticked me—when I came to myself at the hospital my things were in a box underneath the bed, but there was no money in the trousers pocket—my cap was gone, but this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in the box instead—it belonged to Forrest, I had seen him wearing it.</p>

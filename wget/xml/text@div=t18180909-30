               <p>ROBERT SMITH. I am errand-boy to Messrs. Thomas and Co. On the 9th of July, Mr. Robert Birchall, who lived there, sent me to Mr. Potter's, flute-maker, Johnson's-court, Fleet-street, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, for a flute; as I returned with it, I met the prisoner in New-street; he staggered about like a drunken man, he was rubbing lemon over his cheeks, and said "my man you see I have had a drop too much, if you will carry a letter for me, I should not mind giving you two or three shillings." I said if I could do him any service, sooner than he should lose his place, I would, and asked him where it was that I was to go to; he said come to the public-house, while I write it. I said my master would be angry with me, if I waited long; he said he would not be two minutes. He called for a pint of porter, and a pen and ink. I drank some of the porter - He wrote in the paper, and called for a wafer, then asked for a quartern of gin; I told the kind-lady not to bring it. He took the letter to another public-house, and called for a pint of beer. He wrote Harris, on the letter, and would insist on my drinking some gin. He then went to shew me where I was to take the letter; when he was at the top of the court, he said "don't you see that house," and immediately snatched the flute, and ran down another court - I lost my place through it. In about five days after, I saw him in Leadenhall-market. I collared him, and told him he was the man who stole my flute, he said if I did not let him go, he would knock me down - He was secured.</p>

               <p>MARY BERKS. I keep a public-house, in New-street - square. On the 9th of July, the prisoner, and Smith came, the prisoner, wrote a letter, and afterwards called for gin, which I refused, as the boy was so young, and did not seem to wish for it. They went out together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sent the boy, to take a note for me as I was drunk; five days after, he accused me of stealing the flute.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury-square. The prisoner lived with me, as cook—she gave me warning, but left before the time expired—there was a dispute about something she had done, and she said she would leave that morning—I said she might, and she went up stairs to take her things away—I went up, and insisted on seeing her box—she said I should not, unless I had an officer—I sent down to send for one, and then she said, "You may see my box, and I have something of</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 14.) On Tuesday, the 6th of May, I was called to Fisher-street, Red Lion-square, to take the prisoner—I after<lb></lb>wards received this property from Mrs. Hobson.</p>

I had known Nathan before - he had lived up the court; the reply was 40l.: I heard him say he would give 10l. for it - I came out, and met the coachman, who asked me where the lad had gone; I showed him, and then went to my own shop - I then saw Farrell join Collis; they stood opposite my shop, and looked at me - they then went together down Playhouse yard, and the coach went away; I afterwards saw the prisoners return in half an hour or three quarters of an hour, with each of them a bundle in their hands, and new hats on their heads - they went down the court, and came out again, with each a new suit of clothes on.</p>

About half-past twelve o'clock that night I was in Chiswell-street—the prosecutor passed me and appeared very much in<lb></lb>toxicated, which drew my attention—I returned back and saw the prisoner attack the prosecutor—I saw her hand in his pocket—I took hold of her—my friend had to assist the policeman to take her to the watch-house, and in going along my friend took the spectacles out of her hand.</p>

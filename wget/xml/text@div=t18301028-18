On the 1st of October, at five o'clock in the morning, I got up to let two lodgers out - every thing was then safe; I went to bed again, and as I came down, a little before seven, a person passed me quickly on the stairs into my back parlour - I found the back parlour window open; I had seen that window at five o'clock, and it was then shut - it looks into my back-yard, which is walled round; he could have got over the wall between my yard and the next house - I asked how he came to take the liberty to enter my house; he said he had got some shipmates outside, and wanted to treat them with some grog; my outer door was not open - I told him I was a great mind to give him in charge, for I did not know whether he might not have robbed me; I turned him out of doors, and told him never to enter my house again - I had seen him many times before; after turning him out I discovered that my till had been removed from its place in the bar, but not out of the house - there had been nearly 2s. in copper in it over night; I followed, overtook him about two hundred yards off, and brought him back - I had put a penny piece nearly cut in half into my till, the last thing the night before; I saw that penny piece at the station-house - I am sure I left the till in its proper place when I went to bed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not let the lodgers out? A. Yes, at five o'clock - I then saw that the bar was locked; it has a drop-shutter, and at seven I found that raised up several inches - a person could reach the till from that shutter; the till was not locked.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor, from his earliest infaury, has got his livelibood by defrauding sailors when returning from long and painful voyages, by every means in his power; he is well known to every person of disfinction and character as keeping a house of ill repute and same - persons are allowed to remain there from night to morning, and morning to night, in the company of females of bad character; he gets up early in the morning to let people out - whether these characters may have gone to his bar to rob him I cannot say; I declare I am innocent.</p>

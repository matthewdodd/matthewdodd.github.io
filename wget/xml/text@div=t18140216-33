            . I am clerk to Mr. Kent. On Monday, the 3rd of January, Mr. Kent gave me the keys with directions to go to Faulkener's lodgings; I went, and took a man with me. I told Faulkener's wife that her husband was in custody; I asked her for the things in the desk; I found nothing in the desk, nor in that room. At last I got a box open, I found the things now produced; there are twelve brush-boards, two of them are brushes completely.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know these brush-boards to be my property; I never sell them in that state. At the office the prisoner confessed of having taken them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a young hand with Mr. Kent. When I saw a board lay waste I picked it up. Some of the boards are worn out by paper-stainers; brush-boards have been worn out by the paper-stainers.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

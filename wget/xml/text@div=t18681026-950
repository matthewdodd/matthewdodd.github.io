                  </hi>. I am a hay dealer, at Langley, Bucks—on Saturday night, 17th October, I was going home from London, with my horse and cart, about 11 o'clock—I had a new whip, in a nose bag behind the cart—I was riding in the cart—I saw the prisoner come out of a stable across the road—he snatched the whip from the nose bag, and ran to his own door, and shut the door—I followed, but the door was shut—I stopped a little while, and heard the back door go—I am sure it was the prisoner took the whip—I went for a constable, and went back to the house with him—he went up stairs, and brought the brother down out of bed—I said he was not the one—he went up again and brought the prisoner down, and I said, "That is the right one"—I asked him what he had done with the whip, and he made no answer—it was worth about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was quite sober, I only had a cup of tea all the way from Paddington—a piece of the whip-cord was twisted round my finger, and I felt it go.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with my master on the 17th October, coming from London—I had the care of a horse and cart—I was in front of my master, about five or six yards—I heard him call out, "Stop, young Godle<lb></lb>man has taken my whip out of the nose bag"—I saw the prisoner running away—he was about twenty-five yards from me—we went across to the door where he went in—it is a house at the side of the rood—the whip was found at the back of the house—I have been in the habit of seeing the prisoner—I have been on the road four years, and knew where he lived.</p>

               <p>the side of his cart, on this night—he spoke to me about a whip, and I went with him to the prisoner's house—his father and mother were at the gate—they said the prisoner had been in bed since 9.30—I went up and brought down George Godleman—the prosecutor said he was not the one—I then fetched the prisoner, and he said that is the one that stole the whip—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it—I searched the house, but could not find it—it was found afterwards, at the back of the house, by Richard Lovell.</p>

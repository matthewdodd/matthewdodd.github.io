I am a fire wood cutter, of 11, Romney Street—lam the prisoner's father and work for him—a few days before Christmas last, between 6 and 7 o'clock p.m., two sacks of corn were brought in to my sons premises in a little van—I did not notice what name was on the van, but a Mr. Gibson who hawks coals, was driving; a Mr. Carter, who works for Mr. Winn, a carman, carried the sacks into an office where we keep the horses' forage, near the gate of the yard—Gibson stayed in the van—Carter then asked for 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not mention my son's name—I went to my son's wife and got it—she acts as cashier—I gave it to Carter, and they went away—I said to my son the next day "Have you ordered any corn?"—he said "No; who brought it"—I told him Gibson and Carter—he said "They had no business to bring it"—he also said "They ought to have taken the sacks away; I won't touch them"—the police afterwards took them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer B</hi>). On the afternoon of 12th January, about 4.30 I went to Palace Wharf, Nine Elms, in company with Barry and Clinch, all detectives, we saw the prisoner and asked for Mr. Harrison; he said that he was Mr. Harrison—I told him two men, named Gibson and Carter were in custody for stealing corn, and asked if he had any—he took me into his office, near the gate, and into another little room, where I saw two sacks full of corn, marked "T. &amp; G. Wright, Millbank Road, West<lb></lb>minster "—he said the sacks had been brought before Christmas by Carter and Gibson in Gibson's van, and that he had paid 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; afterwards he said 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a sack—I said "That would be more than the wholesale price"—I then said that he must consider himself in my custody for receiving them, knowing them to have been stolen—I asked if he had any more—he said that he had had a lot, but he told them not to bring any more over as it was getting too hot for him, and they should all get into trouble, and he did not think he had paid for it for he was not at home when it was brought—he then asked if I would let him go on with his business for a couple of days—I said that I could not—then he asked if I would allow him to make out &amp; bill or two, and he made some out and handed them to the carman, who went away with a horse and van—when I returned to the outer office, Clinch and Barry had got a number of sacks, and I asked the prisoner to account for them—he said that he had borrowed one or two of Mr. Wright when it had been wet—he was then put into a cab and taken to Rochester Row, Westminster, and charged—Mr. Wright's foreman came in the evening, and the prisoner asked him if he had not borrowed the sacks—the foreman said that he had lent one or two, but it would not do for his master to hear him say that, for he was not allowed to lend sacks—the prisoner said that it must be more than that, but he said no, not more than two or three at the outside—the prisoner also said he had bought some corn of Mr. Wright—Clinch and Barry were with me then.</p>

Clinch and Barry heard this conver<lb></lb>sation—I believe I mentioned at the police-court that the prisoner said he had had a "lot"—I said before the Magistrate "He pointed to two sacks in the room, and 'These two sacks were brought very near Christmas time, one night when I was out, by Carter and Gibson. It was in Gibson's van. I had told them previously not to bring any more as I should get into trouble'"—I did not make any memorandum of the conversation.</p>

I went with Preston to the pri<lb></lb>soner's wharf, and heard the conversation—after the prisoner had admitted that he was Harrison, Preston said "We are policemen," and the prisoner then asked us into an office—we went into a little room and I saw two sacks of corn—I do not recollect the exact words Preston said, but the prisoner answered "I told them not to bring any more. It was getting too <hi rend="italic">hot</hi>, and we should all get into trouble"—the prisoner also said the corn was left when he was out, and that he had paid for it—he afterwards said that he had not</p>

               <p>paid for it—he mentioned some sum that he had paid per sack, and then he said that it was as much per quarter—I saw five sacks filled with chaff—I said "What are these?"—he said "That is chaff, it is mine, I have paid for it"—I turned the chaff out with Barry's assistance.</p>

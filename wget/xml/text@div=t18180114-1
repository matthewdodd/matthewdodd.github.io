            . On the 29th of October, I lived in <placeName id="t18180114-1-crimeloc3">Monmouth-street</placeName>

I never saw him again until a fortnight afterwards, when I had a warrant out against him for striking me - I then took him to Bow-street, and he was committed for want of bail; I missed these goods, and my wife, on my return home again in the evening of the 29th of October.</p>
               <p>(Upon a further investigation of this case, it appeared that the prosecutor's wife had assisted the prisoner in carrying off the property in question, and had cohabited with him from the time of his absconding until his apprehension.)</p>
               <p>Upon an objection taken by Mr. ARABIN, on the part of the prisoner,</p>
               <p>THE COURT ruled, That no person could be convicted of a felony, alleged in stealing goods, where such goods came into his possession by the delivery of the proprietor's wife.</p>

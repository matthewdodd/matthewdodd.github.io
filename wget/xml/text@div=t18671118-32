                  </hi>. I am a groom, and live at 14, Bouverie Street, Fleet Street—on 11th October, at a few minutes past ten at night, I was talking to a woman at the corner of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street—I had not known her before—I felt something at my coat pocket, and missed my purse, containing 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "You have taken my purse," and took hold of her—the prisoner rushed up, and I clearly saw her pass the purse into his hands—I am sure he is the man—it was close by a lamp, and I cannot be mistaken—I called "Police," and he ran towards Temple Bar—I followed him to Bell Yard, and found him stopped by a constable—I had not lost sight of him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my purse and money.</p>

Q.</hi> How long had you been with the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten minutes—I had not been drinking—I suppose she was a woman of the town, but she did not ask to go with her or to give her drink—this was four or five yards from the lamp at the corner—I had never seen the prisoner before—I saw my purse while I was with the woman, because, having once had my trousers pocket cut out, I took my purse out and put it into my right tail pocket with my gloves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, of 3, Upper Cleveland Street, Euston Road—I saw Tann at the corner of Chancery Lane, grappling with a woman—the prisoner was trying to take her away—I can swear to him—Tann said, "You have taken my purse and given it to the man;" he said, "No, I have not got the purse"—he walked up to Temple Bar,</p>

               <p>and then ran, and Tann followed him—he orossed Fleet Street, and went up Bell Yard—I stood two or three yards from where the struggle took place, and picked up this purse, I should think exactly at the spot where the prisoner stood—I waited till the prisoner was brought back, and then told Tann I had found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 32, Brewer-street, St. Pan<lb></lb>cras. On 22nd Dec., between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was in the New-road, and saw a truck wheeled by a boy, who I at first thought was my own son, who wheels a similar truck and dresses in the same way, which made me pay attention to him—I saw him forty or fifty yards before I came to him—I was meeting him, and walked on the kerb till I came within two yards of him, and then a gentleman passed me—I then saw a van, driven by the prisoner, behind the truck, and proceeding in the same direction—the boy was within nine inches or a foot of the kerb, which was on his left all the way—there were three horses in the van—the prisoner was sitting on the box, in front; and the load was piled up on each side of him in such a manner as he could see before him, but not behind him—he told me himself that he could see the boy before he came to him—the New-road is on an incline at that part, and they were both going down hill—just as I came to the truck, I heard a sharp crack, and saw the boy instantaneously knocked between the fore and hind wheels of the van—I hallooed directly, and held up my hands to the driver, and told him that a boy was under the wheels—he began to pull up directly—he had not attempted to stop his horses before the collision took place—he could not see the collision—the road was not obstructed in any way, to make it necessary for the prisoner to drive close to the kerb—there was plenty of room for the prisoner to have passed the truck—he pulled up as soon as he possibly could, but the van proceeded seven or eight yards before he was able to stop it.</p>

               <p>of the truck was in front of him; he was holding it—he did not turn the truck so as to strike the waggon—I have not changed my mind upon this matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the boy turn, or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say that he did not; but the handle of the truck may have turned at the time he looked up—there might have been room for the van to have passed, if the boy had not turned—I cannot say the exact distance between the wheel of his truck and the van—I could not see between the wheel and the truck; I was on the side of the kerb.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I had just turned into the New-road, and saw the truck and the van two or three minutes before the accident happened—I was going the same way, not meeting them, and was on the opposite side of the road—I did not see the collision—I cannot form any opinion at what rate the prisoner was driving—the van was about the middle of the road—I should say that the truck was about a foot and a half from the kerb.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the boy turn the truck?<hi rend="italic"> A.</hi> Yes, he turned the-handle towards the kerb, so that the back was outwards—there seemed to be something at the kerb, as if he was going round it, and was going in towards the kerb again—he was pushing behind the truck; the hind part was turned out toward the waggon—I cannot say what it was that he tried to avoid.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 77). I went to the hospital with the brother of the deceased on the night of his death. I asked the deceased if he thought that he should die; he said he did—I then asked him about the occur<lb></lb>rence; he said that he was going towards King's-cross with his barrow, within ten inches of the kerb; that he did not see Pickford's van coming until it got close to him; that the fore wheel of the van touched the wheel of his truck, and threw him between the two wheels of the van, and dragged him about twelve yards along the road—he said nothing about the road being up hill or down hill—I saw the van; it was heavily laden on each side of the driver, and behind him.</p>

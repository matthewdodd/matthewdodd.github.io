                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Simpson, boot and shoemaker, Tot<lb></lb>tenham-court-road. The prisoner kept a shop in Tottenham-court-road—on the 28th of Oct. he came to our shop, and said he was going to outfit a gentleman who was going abroad, and who wanted some boots and shoes, and asked if I would allow him to take a few pairs to show him—I gave him five pairs to take with him—he came again the same evening, and took away three pairs more—he said he would take them to the gentleman, try them on, and bring them back again in twenty minutes, or the next morning—he never returned—those boots were not fit for sale—these now produced are them, and what he took away that day.</p>

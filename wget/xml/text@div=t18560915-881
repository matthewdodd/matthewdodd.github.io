                  </hi>. I am a seaman, in the employ of Messrs. Hewitt, of Barking. I have been in the employ about six months—during that time I served on board the <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi>, which is one of Messrs. Hewitt's smacks—the prisoner was the captain, and, besides that, he was commodore of the fleet—he commanded all Messrs. Hewitt's vessels—they may have twenty or thirty vessels—I sailed from Barking, in the <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi>, on 26th April—in the course of that voyage we were fishing off the Skilling, which is off the Dutch coast—it is on the high seas—I remember the boat of the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi> coming to our smack one Monday morning—Mr. Bullen, the master of the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi>, came in it—the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi> is not one of Messrs. Hewitt's smacks—I do not rightly know who is the owner of it, hut Mr. Bullen is the captain—I have seen him on the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi>—the prisoner had gone on board the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi> on the Sunday evening, and he came on board the <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi>, in Mr. Bullen's boat, on Monday morning—they ordered as to get a pair of bridles out, and pot them into the <hi rend="italic">Industry's</hi> boat—bridles are ropes which fasten on to the fishing nets—they are about five-inch ropes—they are for trawling the nets—they may be about eighteen fathoms long—we got them out of the vessel's stern, and coiled them into the <hi rend="italic">Industry's</hi> boat—they were new—after that we put the upper nets into the boat, by the prisoner's order—that is the upper part of the fishing net—one part goes on the ground, and the other over it—the net was in the fore part of the vessel—we got it, and put it into the <hi rend="italic">Industry's</hi> boat—the boat was let go, and went away to it's own vessel—the prisoner stayed on board his own vessel—Ryder, of the ship <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi>, had come before this transaction with Bullen—when Ryder came I had orders from the prisoner to unreef the main halyards, and reef a new pair—the old main halyards were put into the <hi rend="italic">Tigers</hi> boat by the prisoner's order—we were at sea eight weeks—in the fore part of the voyage Ryder had a bucket and a tin kettle—the prisoner was on board the <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi>, and called out for us to bring a lead line—our boat took the lead line to him, and came back—I did not go with the boat; two apprentices went with it—I did not see them deliver the lead line—the boat went with it, and came back without it—the <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi> was not far from us, forty or fifty yards—the boat returned, and came on board our own vessel, and then Ryder's boat came for a bucket and a tea kettle—the bucket was new—the tea kettle was half worn—I did not hand them into the boat, but I saw it done—they went into Mr. Ryder's boat, and the boat went on board the <hi rend="italic">Tiger.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On what occasion was that, had you lost your bridles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know how we came to get another pair—we went on board and got them—we put them down—we did not use them—we had two pairs on board before—we then had three pairs in all—sometimes, in bad weather, our nets are carried away, and we lose them—we had no bad weather before we sent these bridles to the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi>—I do not know whether she had lest her bridles—sometimes we lose all our bridles; more often in bad weather than in fine weather—we had had no bad weather that voyage.</p>

On the 14th of July, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I went to get some milk. I left six 1 l. notes, with three sovereigns wrapped in them, and 7 l. or 8 l. in silver, in a bottle-stand, in the drawer of the back room - the room door was shut, but not locked, the front door is always open. I returned in about a minute, and saw Mrs. Fryer, in consequence of what she said, I found the drawer open, and the money gone. I had seen it safe a few minutes before, when I went to put some money there - nobody had been in the room before I went out. The prisoner had once been employed to carry out coals for me, and had been in the room several times - I have found none of the money.</p>

            . I live in Brittannia-street. I was in a shop near Hutt's, and saw the prisoner laying down in an empty cart. I saw Mrs. Hutt come out, and go into the milk-shop, two doors off; the moment she went into the milk-shop, the prisoner got out of the cart, and went into her house. I saw him go into the back parlour, and saw him come out in about a minute, with something under his arm, under his jacket; I thought it was his cap, as he had one on, and when he came out, it was off, it looked like leather; he ran up the street. I ran over and told Hutt, she searched her drawers, and missed her money. I am sure he is the boy, I have known him for years.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, I was desired to look after the prisoner. On the Saturday after the robbery, I saw him on a lamp-post by Westminster-hall, looking at the people going to view the hall - he knew me. I asked him to come down, he said he would not until he chose, and directly the hall door was open, and there was a rush, he got down and ran off. I followed and caught hold of him he clung to a coach wheel, gathered a mob round me; the people asked what I was pulling him for? I said, he had robbed a neighbour of mine of 20 l.; he used a very bad expression, and said it was not 20 l., and he could bring twenty people to prove it; the people then made way for me to go, and when he got to Charing-cross he clung to a door-post, and would not go on, the street-keeper came and secured him - nothing was found on him; he had a new pair of shoes on, new trowsers, and a new hat, with the maker's name and lining torn out.</p>

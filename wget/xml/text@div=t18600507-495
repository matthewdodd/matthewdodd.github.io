I am a cab-driver of 4, Parliament-street, St. George's Market, Southwark—I knew the deceased Thomas Faye, a coal-porter, he was about forty years of age—on Friday, 16th March, I saw him at the Elephant and Castle public-house, near Vauxhall Railway-station, about half-past 9 or twenty minutes to 10 o'clock—the prisoner was also there—they both appeared as if they had been drinking, they were rather the worse for liquor—I heard them quarrelling, but did not know what it was about—one of them proposed to go out and fight; I cannot say which, but they were both willing, and I tried to prevent them—I held the deceased and pre<lb></lb>vented him from going out: after a little struggle I said, "Well; if you will go, you must go and take your chance"—they both left and went under the arches, somewhere: into the grounds of the station. I remained some few minutes, and then went towards the arches, where my cab was standing for hire when the trains came in—I heard a noise like a fall, and went and saw Thomas Faye fall, just as I got to the spot—he laid on his back very quiet—I did not lift him up—he did not speak or make any movement—the prisoner was about three yards in front of his feet—he was lifted up—I did not see him taken away—I went to the Elephant and Castle, remained there perhaps two minutes, and then went away to my cab.</p>

I am a labourer of Kingswood-place, South Lam<lb></lb>beth—on Friday, 16th March, about half-past 9 o'clock, I was returning from work, and saw the prisoner and the deceased come out of the Elephant and Castle—they crossed over the road and went into one of the railway arches—there were one or two others with them—I stood at the gate of the Vaux<lb></lb>hall station and looked in—it was within the enclosure—I stood there two or three minutes, and saw them pull off their smock frocks for the purpose of fighting—they stood sparring for a minute or two, and then the prisoner rushed at Faye with his head downwards, caught hold of his legs, and turned him over—he fell on the back of his head very heavily—he was the heavier man of the two, and about forty years of age—he laid there for a few seconds, groaning, and was picked up—he stood up as well as he could, and then Harper went at him a second time—there was more sparring, and he went in to him and turned him over in the same way, and the fall was much heavier than the first—he fell on the back of his head—they were both intoxicated—I remained two or three minutes, but he was not sensible—he never spoke; he groaned very much, and was dragged away to the Elephant and Castle—I then went for a policeman, but could not find one, and when I came back I saw the prisoner and Harrington fighting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon and medical officer of Lambeth Workhouse—on Monday, 19th March, I was sent for to attend upon Thomas Faye, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I found him in the bath room washing himself—I accosted him—his replies were confused and incoherent—I asked him what was the matter with him; he said, "Nothing"—my attention was directed by the bath man to his head—I examined it, and found a slight wound about three-quarters of an inch long; it appeared to be incised, and such as might have been inflicted with a flint or a sharp stone, or any sharp instrument—I removed the plaister, and found it was in process of healing—in my opinion a violent fall on the back of the head on a stone would probably produce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you tell whether the wound had bled much? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should presume not; there was a little clotted blood on the hair—it was a sort of wound more likely to be caused by a fell than a blow; the small quantity of blood would lead me to that conclusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he a heavy person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A remarkably heavy man, a very fine man—his being heavy would be more likely to cause a wound of this kind—after I had examined him in the bath room he was received into a ward by my orders—I saw him again in about an hour; he was then leaning his head in his hand—I spoke to him, and he complained of his head—I ordered his head to be shaved in order that I might make a more complete examination—that was done—I ordered him a mustard plaister—I did not at that time detect any injury to the brain, though I sus<lb></lb>pected it—the wound had only penetrated the scalp—the pupils of his eyes were somewhat dilated; that, and other symptoms, led me to the conclusion that he was suffering from concussion of the brain—he said he had lost his appetite, and complained of great oppression in breathing—I had him put to bed, and saw him twice next day—I had received no information as to the particulars of this fight, but from the information I received, and from the symptoms, I judged he was suffering from compression of the brain, and treated him for that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had been injured and tripped up twice bo that he fell on the back of his head, would that have accounted for what you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might—I don't think the fact of his having been of intemperate habits would make any difference in this injury—by concussion I simply mean stunning, from which a person recovers shortly; compression is the result of the slow oozing of blood on the surface of the brain, which gradually causes that effect—a patient is less likely to recover from that than from concus<lb></lb>sion—it is a small oozing from the brain or one of its vessels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe on the Tuesday evening he was half delirious? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; those symptoms kept on increasing—he had an epileptic fit on Wednesday evening; those continued to the time of his death—I was not with him at the exact moment of his death, but I was shortly before—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I first opened the head—I found a quantity of extravasated blood on the surface of the brain, and towards the base—I collected it; there was about three ounces of fluid blood—I cannot exactly define how much there was at the base of the brain; the blood there was lying on the right side, at the back of the head, on a level with the ear—it commenced exactly at the cut which was just at the apex, and went to the back part; it had gravitated down to the base of the brain—the blood had all proceeded from an artery which was wounded; that would be likely in time to cause death—I saw the extent to which it had gravitated, and it must have destroyed life—it would be likely to cause epileptic fits with other symptoms—the ruptured artery on the brain was the immediate cause of death—I examined the skull, it was unusually thin—if he had been tripped up by his legs and fallen, it might have caused both the extravasated blood and the wound; it is a common cause—I attach no importance to the scalp wound, it was purely external; both the external and the internal rupture of the artery were, at the same part—the proba<lb></lb>bility of such a rupture would be increased by reason of the heavy weight of the man, and would be still further increased by the remarkable thinness of the skull; the thinner the skull is the more the external violence would be felt—I examined the brain, and found it in an unusually healthy condition; there was nothing in it to cause death, except the rupture of the vessel and the blood in the brain—I found a fracture of the skull extending from the apex, or about an inch below it, to about an inch from the cut, extending through the temporal bone right through the bones of the ear in a diagonal direction; it was a linear fracture without depression—I should attribute such a fracture more to a fall than a blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say there was a crack, but no depression of the bone on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a sudden knock would cause it, which would be increased by the man being heavy and his skull not being thick—I attri<lb></lb>bute death to the effusion of blood—we have many cases where persons recover from simple fracture of the skull; if it had only been a linear fracture the patient might have recovered—seeing the blood that oozed from the rupture, I am of opinion that that was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When the case first came before you, did you think it was a serious case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not feel certain what had been the nature of the injury he had received, or whether he had received any—that there was some effusion of the brain I felt certain, but had no history before me—I did not consider the little cut at the back of the head of any conse<lb></lb>quence by itself—I felt certain that a fall had caused it—I was not aware, during life, that there had been any fracture of the skull—I think it more likely to have arisen from a blow or a series of blows—the body was gene<lb></lb>rally</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070210"></xptr>
               <p>healthy—the cause of death was solely and entirely to be found in the brain—I should say that a man must fall at least four feet to cause that rupture of an artery of the brain—a man drunk and falling down might do it.</p>

               <p>I am a shoemaker; I live within three doors of Mr. Watson: On Wednesday the 18th of last month, between five and six in the evening, Mr. Watson's boy came into my shop, and requested that I would run instantly to his master's shop; I went, and they were then questioning the prisoner respecting the tongs; I questioned her myself; she prevaricated very much in her account; in the course of her. conversation she let fall from under her cloaths a table spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she was charged with it? - A. Yes; I took up the spoon and said it was not unlikely that she had something more about her; she immediately took another spoon from out of her pocket-hole, and put it on the counter; she emptied her pockets, and there was nothing else upon her; the child was in her arms when she dropped the first spoon: the counter is an angle; she was at the distance of about two foot from the counter; I put my initials upon them immediately; the child laid across her arms, and she put her hand into her pockets and took out the spoon; but while she took the other out she put the child upon the counter; these are the two spoons(producing them).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Barrow.) Do you know these to be your masters? - A. I cannot swear to them; they have no private marks; we have no private marks to old silver; we sell them as second hand; I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect shewing her any plated spoons? - A. No, I do not recollect that there was any plated spoons in the window.</p>

               <p>Q. You are not sure that you missed them? - A. I am sure that I missed one, if not two.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not sure whether that was plated or not? - A. No.</p>

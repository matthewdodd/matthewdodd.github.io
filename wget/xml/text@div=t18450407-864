                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Louisa Hall Newton, No. 20, Keppel-street, in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. On the night of the 6th of March, I went to bed about half-past eleven—I left the kitchen door leading to the front area bolted, locked, and secure—about two o'clock in the morning I was called up by the officer, and found three holes in the glass above one of the bolts—if the glass had been taken out, it would have enabled a person to get in—the prisoner's father had been employed in the house, and I believe the prisoner occasionally assisted him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Keppel-street about two o'clock in the morning of the 6th of March—I heard a slight noise in the area of No. 20, and, on looking down, saw the prisoner close to the kitchen door, with one hand up towards the glass—I said nothing to him, but stood still till my brother constable came round—I then called him across—the prisoner left the kitchen door, came up the steps, and got over the gate—I there took him—I afterwards examined the kitchen door, and found three holes had been made in the glass close to the edge—I found on the prisoner this awl, which I believe made the holes, a box of lucifers, a small file, and two duplicates.</p>

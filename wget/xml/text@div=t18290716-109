No; I never gave any body leave to take any thing out of my house; I suspected her because a little girl gave me information - I deny telling her if I was absent from my walk for two hours, that she was to suspect I was in trouble, and to take charge of my property; I have a sister living near me, who I should have given such a job to if I had been in trouble - I owe money to a person, but is a friend, and I was not afraid of him.</p>

            's Defence. My master left me that morning on the walk, which he never did before - I walked all over the walk, but could not find him; I then went to the house, put my hand to the door, and it opened - he often put his back to the door, and it opened; I washed the pails, put them down, and stopped there till eleven o'clock - master being in debt, I thought he was taken up; this sort of thing happened about eight years ago, and then his sister and mother took his things; I thought the same thing had happened to him, and took them to my place - I put the door ajar, and the chairs to it; on my return I found the place as I had left it, and said to myself, "What would I not pay to a body to assist me?" I gave a girl a penny to take care of some chairs, while I ran with the rest of the things; I met a man going to market, and asked him to assist me to take them as far as Spitalfields-market - I then got him to help me to the turnpike; I there took master's blue coat and pawned it for 1s. to pay the man, and that was my day's wages; I piled the things up in my room, and said, "If master comes to night, all his property is here, and to-morrow I will try and find his sister," as I did not know where she lived then; I tried to keep the walk as well as I could when he was in trouble before, for five months; I have a young family, who have no support but from me, and they are now about the streets - he has been a kind master to me, and I thought to do it for a good purpose; he owes Mr. Gunn 25l., and they told me last Saturday, if he did not settle it they would take him up.</p>

            . I never permitted her to take any property away; I certainly did go away once, having married a woman, which caused a few words - I left London for two years - that was about eight years ago; I am in no more difficulty now than other tradesmen - I do not say I could pay at this moment every farthing I owe; I had no apprehension whatever of my goods being seized.</p>

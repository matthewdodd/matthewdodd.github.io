            . I was coming from on board a ship at Blackwall and met the Prisoner in a field. At her desire I went with her to one Johnson's house in <placeName id="t17410828-56-crimeloc270">Well Close Square</placeName>

               <p>Q. When did you miss your money?</p>
               <p>Taxon. I miss'd it just after she was gone, and I am sure I had it just before, for I felt every piece in my pocket.</p>

            . I am a constable and serv'd the warrant on the Prisoner on the 24th of July for this robbery. I took her before justice Jones, and there she could not deny the taking the money, and said her landlady had thirty six shillings poundage out of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was standing at my door, and the Prosecutor came by and said he would take me up for stealing his money. He carried me before Justice Jones, and offer'd to acquit me if I would give him 2 guineas, and make him satisfaction for a silver piece that he had lost. I never had been in trouble, therefore was willing to make it up, and then he would not take less than three guineas. <rs id="t17410828-56-verdict271" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Morris, who keeps the Kinder's Arms, in Cannon-street, St. George's in the East—Daniels was in the habit of frequenting our house—Daniels told me on the 3rd of July to take half a pint of beer to Brooks, and to bring a parcel back which Brooks would give me—he said I must not go while there was anybody in the way—I went four different times, and took beer each time—I at last saw Brooks, and he gave me a parcel which was so heavy I could hardly carry it—I took it home and Daniels desired me to take it into the kitchen at Mr. Morris's—I had a communication with my mistress, she went with me, and we looked at the parcel—it was done up in brown paper—my mistress</p>

                  </hi>, I am a draper, of No. 16, Ludgate-hill. On a Thurs<lb></lb>day in July, I think it was the 12th, the prisoner came and asked to see some mantles; I referred him to one of my assistants, Edward Stober, and in consequence of what he said I went down the street to see if I could gee a policeman; I returned with one, but the prisoner had then left—this mantle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was shown to me about five minutes afterwards by a policeman, five minutes after the prisoner left; it has our private mark on it—we did not miss anything, but we saw the lace of the mantle hang<lb></lb>ing from the prisoner's coat, and it has our private mark on it—mantles which we sell never go out with the private mark on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Turner. On Thursday, 12th July, about a quarter to 5 o'clock the prisoner came, and I took him into the show room—I could not understand him and went for a young lady, leaving him alone in the show room—when I came back I discovered the lace of a mantle hanging about a foot below his coat—I informed Mr. Turner, and he went for a policeman—the young lady came up stairs, but she is not here—I went up to him before she came up, and then she came up and began to show him some mantles—he asked for opera mantles—when I saw the lace hanging below his coat, I went to tell Mr. Turner, leaving the young lady and the prisoner up stairs—the young lady came down, saying that she could not sell him anything—the prisoner came down and I put on my hat and followed him up the hill through St. Paul's Churchyard, and met a policeman at the corner of Watling-street—the</p>

               <p>prisoner watched me speaking to the policeman, and turned round several times to look at me; he ran away, and when he got to the door before you get to the Cathedral Hotel he threw the mantle into the door way, and ran right across Cheapside towards the Post Office—a constable arrested him at the fishmonger's shop near the Post Office, and brought him back—as we came back we met a man like a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man with the mantle on his arm; he gave it to the policeman, and said in the prisoner's presence that he had seen him throw it away—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>. 363). I was on duty in St. Paul's Churchyard. On Thursday, 12th July, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, the last witness called my attention to the prisoner, who was on the opposite side of the way—as soon as he saw me he looked round, and ran from the corner of Watling-street to No. 45, St. Paul's Churchyard, took a mantle from under his coat and threw it up the door way of No. 45—I followed him across Cheapside, and took him just by the fish shop—I asked him what he had under his coat; he understood every word I said, and said in English, "Nothing, what do you want with me?"—I went back to where the mantle was thrown away, and received it from a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man—the prisoner said in English, "You did not see me throw the mantle away."</p>

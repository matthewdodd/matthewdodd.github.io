                  </hi>. I am a pianoforte key maker—on 6th August, I was returning from Kingsland Gate, about 12.45 in the morning, when I saw a cabman that I knew, and a horse that had kicked out of the shafts, and while speaking to the man a cry was raised "They have stolen your whip"—there was a crowd of about fifty people—my friend gave chase and stopped the man who had the whip and brought it back—I heard several voices say "There's one of the b——, and there's another"—pointing to the cabman—some of them being in light dust coats were distinguished from the others—they came in the road towards us—I said to my friend "We had better run," and. we ran as far as Richmond Road, Kingsland—when we were surrounded by seven young men and girls—the four prisoners, and one caught hold of me and asked what was the matter—I said "Nothing is the matter with me, I am all right" and struggled to getaway—they said "We will see you righted"—I said "If it's money you want I will give you some," and I gave them 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I was then pushed across the road and I felt the ring go off my finger—I afterwards found the ring at 4 o'clock in the morning where it was dropped—my pockets were emptied—I could feel that—I saw <hi rend="italic">my</hi> money roll out on the pavement—my waist-coat pocket had been cut—then my watch went—I bad my coat buttoned—two ounces of tobacco in<lb></lb>paper, a few odd coins, a ticket case with two pawn tickets in it—Moxey took a more active part in it than the others—I picked up my hat and ran away—I next saw them all four at 10.30 the same morning at Hackney Downs Station, and gave information at the police-station at about 2.15—I have no doubt that the prisoners are the parties—it was Moxey who held me.</p>

It is about half a mile from where I lost the ring to where I saw the prisoners at the station—I imagined it was stolen from me—I went back the next morning and found it lying on the ground—I was sober, and I certainly had a watch that night—I do not recollect the Magistrate asking me two or three times, before I could settle whether I had a watch or not—the cab accident was 30 or 40 yards from Kings-land Gate—that was about 12.45 as near as I can recollect—I was per-ectly sober.</p>

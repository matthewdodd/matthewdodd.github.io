On the 11th of February, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the parlour behind my shop, the prisoner came in, and asked to see some seals, my wife was attending to him; she showed him a tray, which contained eight dozen. He asked for a blood-stone seal, saying it was for a very fine engraving. I went into the shop to inform him what were the best stones for engraving. I returned into the parlour, and heard him say,</p>
               <p>"I will take this - it is 30 s., is it not? You must send it to Tower-street." My wife answered,</p>
               <p>"Oh, send it!" I said,</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Sir, we will send it," as he appeared a gentleman. My wife then said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, you have got another seal in your other hand," which he held down by his side. He then lifted up his hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"I hope, Madam, you did not think I meant to steal your seal!" - it was in his left hand. It was a red cornelian seal, not the sort that he enquired for. He stood at the rail, not at the counter. He asked me if I wished to search him? I said, No, but I would take the liberty of walking to Tower-street with him. With some reluctance he took me to Tower-street, to a respectable boot-maker's shop - I asked him if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170031"></xptr>lodged there? the master said No. I asked him if he would pay 30 s. for him if I sent an article there? he said,</p>
               <p>"Certainly not," and said he had not seen him for five years before. He gave me his name, and said he was a surgeon. Mr. Helmsley, the boot-maker, said,</p>

               <p>"You had better tell the truth at once - you know you have been in two or three different situations since you was a surgeon. He then said he was in no employ at present, and that</p>
               <p>"the seal was for Mr. Charles." I gave him in charge. There was only 1 d. and a duplicate found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Have you not since found he has been a surgeon - A. Yes. He produced the seal immediately my wife charged him with it. Mr. Hemsley offered to pay me for the seal - I refused.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a blood-stone seal, he said he wanted it for a fine engraving, and asked which was best. Mr. Hatton came out and gave his opinion - he fixed on one, and told me to send it to Tower-street. I asked him for the seal which he had in his left hand; he then lifted up his hand, and it was in it - he said he hoped I did not think he was going to steal it. Mr. Hatton took it out of his hand before he could deliver it to me.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, and live in Tower-street. Hatton brought the prisoner to my shop, he did not live there. I said, I thought he could not be guilty of such a thing, and offered to pay for the seal, the prosecutor refused. If he had come to me, and said he had ordered a seal to my house, I should most likely have paid for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I only asked for one single seal, she handed the tray over the railing. I held one in my hand, which was certainly lower than the tray, as the tray was nearly up to my chin. I did not think to replace it immediately. I told the prosecutor if he would go with me I would pay him.</p>

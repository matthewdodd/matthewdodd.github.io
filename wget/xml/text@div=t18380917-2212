                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-constable, in the employ of the East and West India Docks. On the 15th of September, about half-past one o'clock, I stopped Thomas Storey at the Export entrance of the Eastern Dock, and found in his hat these four silver spoons-(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—he said he found them, and then, after hesitating some time, he said his father gave them to him-his father (the other prisoner) was then brought to me—I then asked Thomas Storey, whether his father gave them to him—he said he did-his father hesitated, and Thomas Storey said, "It is no use telling an untruth, you gave them to me, father"—the father denied it—I went to John Storey's lodging, in Pell-street—he only occupies one room—I found Margaret Storey there—she went to a box, and took out some-thing, and put it under her apron—I stopped her, and found on her, two more silver spoons concealed under her apron.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the baggage warehouse, in the East and West India Docks. The prisoner, John Storey, has been employed as an extra labourer in the baggage warehouse, four or five months-Thomas storey had worked there for a few days, but not at the time of this theft-Roebuck made a communication to me on the 15th of September, and searched John Storey in my presence, but nothing was found on him—I</p>

               <p>searched the packages in the baggage warehouse, and one box had been broken open, which was directed to Captain Templar—it contained a number of pieces of plate, and I missed from it six silver spoons—there were other articles of plate in the box, which had precisely the same crest on as these spoons have—I have some of the other spoons here from the box.</p>

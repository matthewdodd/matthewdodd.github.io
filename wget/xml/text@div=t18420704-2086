                  </hi>. I am agent <hi rend="italic">to</hi> David M'Intosh, who is erecting some buildings in Albert-square, Commercial-road—on Monday, the 20th of June, he had a barge load of bricks at Ashley's-wharf, and the prisoner's father was employed as car man <hi rend="italic">to</hi> draw them to Albert-square—I went to Mr. Fitzgerald, in Green-street, adjoining York-square—I found a load of bricks shot out, opposite Mr. Fitzgerald's premises—they were of the same description as those in the barge at the wharf—I had some conversation with Mr. Fitzgerald, and from' what he told me I went back to the wharf <hi rend="italic">to</hi> find the prisoner—I found him at the works, at Al<lb></lb>bert-square, about five o'clock in the afternoon—I said, "Clements, how came you to shoot these bricks on Mr. Fitzgerald's premises?"—he said, "I know nothing about it, I never shot a load of bricks at Mr. Fitzgerald's in my life"—he was employed under his father to cart these bricks—it is nearly a quarter of a mile from where the barge was to Albert-square—I have compared the bricks with those in the barge, and have no doubt they are Mr. M'Intosh's.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a bricklayer, in Henry-street, which is adjoining York-square. I have known the prisoner twelve or fourteen years—on the 20th of June, between four and five o'clock, he called on me to know whether I would purchase 1000 bricks—I looked at them—he had got them in a cart—I asked what he wanted—he said 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I had no money to pay him for them, if he would wait till Saturday night I would pay him—he said he did not mind so long as I gave a little, and I gave him half-a-crown—he agreed, and shot them down in Green-street for me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a bricklayer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All my life—we fre<lb></lb>quently have them shot down if we are in a hurry—I had them shot in Green-street, because there was a lot of stones in the way, near my build<lb></lb>ing—I was repairing a house in York-square, and a boy came for me—the cart was in York-square when I came—I was not in a hurry—it would not break above twenty bricks to have them shot, if they are hard ones—</p>

               <p>Benjamin Parish. On the 8th of October instant, about 12 o'clock at Night, I was going to enquire after my Wife's Brother, at Mr. Fulman's, in Windsor-Court, Drury-Lane. I went close by the Door where the Prisoner and the other Woman were standing, and this Woman at the Bar said, Countryman, I want to speak with you; I could not refuse, as I was so close to them, so they laid their Hands, one on one Arm, the other on my other, and with the Assistance of somebody behind, pull'd me down on my Back, into the House of one Edmund Cahoe, which is a Den of Thieves. As soon as I came into the Door - the House is not above 8 Paces long - I was no sooner within the Door, but it was shut on me, and, as I am inform'd, Butler was the Woman who kneel'd on my Breast, and held my Arms, I am sure some Woman did. The Prisoner kneel'd on my Legs, so that I lay like a dead Man; she forced open my Breeches Pocket, as you see, [they were Leather Breeches, and torn down the Side] and took out about 23 Guineas in Gold, and some Silver, my Watch, and a Pair of Silver Knee-buckles, and out of my Great Coat Pocket, a Pair of Breeches, and a Holland Shirt, my Hat and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150028"></xptr> Wig from my Head. When I first came in, I could discern a great many Men in the House, I cried Murder! as loud as I was able, but none came to my Assistance. As soon as they had robbed me, they opened the Door, and I went away, designing to go to my Inn; but I met a Watchman who pretended to shew me the Way thither, and instead of going the right Way with me, carried me to the Cart and Horse, in St Giles's, where some Irishmen made me drunk, so that I did not get to my Inn till Morning. After this I went to Fulman's, in the same Court where I was robbed, and they advis'd me to be easy; Mrs Fulman told me that there was a Person who would give me 15 Guineas, and my other Things should be laid down in the House, if I would be quiet, but she would not tell who it was. When I found that I could not command any thing, I gave a Fellow a Crown to discover the People who had robbed me, and I took the Prisoner, and charged her with the same before the Justice, as I have now. She own'd that she was in the House; but that Butler had the Money, and one Shields the Watch, and she was innocent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Hour of the Night was it?</p>
               <p>Parish . About 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He swore before the Justice that it was between 8 and 9. I beg you would ask him in particular, whether I was the Woman who brought him into the House? I don't deny that I saw him him in the House.</p>
               <p>Parish. She was one of the Women who was standing at the Door, and pull'd me into the House.</p>
               <p>The Justice. The Evidence which the Prosecutor has given now, is exactly the same Word for Word, as that which he swore before me. He said that it was between 11 and 12, and that the Prisoner was the Person who rifled his Pockets. When she was before me, she acknowledg'd that she was present; but said that she had no Part of the Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is proper if I took the Money, that I should have some Share of it. There is a Man in the Gate-house, and I think he ought to be brought before my Life or Liberty is taken away. My Friends are not here, and I have not a Half-penny to save me. <rs id="t17401015-60-verdict324" type="verdictDescription">

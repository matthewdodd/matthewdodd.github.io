I am the prosecutor's wife—on this night I was sitting in my own place, with my bady in my arms, my husband was sitting at the table having his supper—the room door was open, likewise the street<lb></lb>door—the prisoner came dawn stairs from his own place, kicked the parti<lb></lb>tion in, and called for any County of Limerick son of a b—; my husband made no answer—the prisoner walked through the passage with a small hammer in his hand, and hit my husband on the back of his head—he got up, and said, "My God; who did that?"—he turned, round to see, and the prisoner hit him a second blow on the front with the hammer; and he was immediately dragged into the passage, and got several other blows—the prisoner was then taken away up stairs to his own place, and my husband was conveyed to the hospital—he was there nearly five weeks, and is very poorly now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Poplar Hospital—about half-past 12, on 18th October, the prosecutor was brought there—he was suffering very severely from blows on the head, and he had evidently lost a great deal of blood—there were four contused wounds; three on the forehead, and one at the back of the head—the one most to the left was the most severe, for the skull was fractured there—the part that was fractured was about one-third of a circle, the diameter of which circle would be about an inch—the wound was bleeding very much—the anterior temporal artery was divided—blows would most likely cause such a wound, a fall from a height, upon something the shape of the circle, might inflict a similar wound—it</p>

               <p>was precisely the sort of wound that would be done by the top of a hammer—he was in a dangerous state: he might have died through it—he is still in a very weak state, and will be for some time with the least excitement, or after taking any amount of drink, he will always be liable to suffer from it—he had been taking something to drink at the time, but was not intox<lb></lb>icated—he was quite sensible, and spoke sensibly.</p>

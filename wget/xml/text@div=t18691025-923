I live at 24, Little St. Andrew Street—about 12 o'clock, on the afternoon of 17th August I was in Co vent Garden Market—I saw the prisoner there—he asked me if I wanted to earn a few half-pence—I said, "Yes"—he told me to go and take the nose-bag off that white pony, and take it round the turning, and he would meet me the other way—I did so, and he met me—he went with mo as far as Temple Bar—I led the pony—when we got there he said, "Stop here, while I go and get a barrow"—he got a barrow, and took the things out of the cart, and put them in the barrow, and went away—before he went away he said, "Go to Whitecross Street, and you will meet my brother there, and I will be there as well"—I went to Whitecross Street, and waited for some time; but he did not come—I then asked a policeman the way to the Strand, and he took me and the pony and cart to the station—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

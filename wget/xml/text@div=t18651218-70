                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Poole, a watch-maker, in Fen-church-street—on 27th October, between 4 and 5 in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, produced a brooch, and asked me what we should charge for putting a catch on it—I looked at it, and turned round towards the window, to see what it required, and on turning again to speak to the prisoner, I saw him take his hand out of a case—I could not see what he took—I had no time to tell him what the brooch would cost, for he directly ran out through the doorway—Mr. Bridge followed him—the case was afterwards examined, and one watch was missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Poole—on 27th October I had occasion to leave the shop, leaving the last witness in charge, and went into an adjoining room—while there I heard a noise, as of the opening or shutting of a door—I looked and distinctly saw the prisoner withdraw his hand from the back of the case, and rush to the door—I called out, "Look to the shop," and followed him, and after a run of about five minutes, I overtook him, and gave him in charge—on coming back, I examined the case, and missed a gold hunting watch from it, worth 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am certain it was there that morning—there were four compartments, with a watch in each, and I must have missed it had it not been there—when I gave the prisoner in charge to the constable, he at first said he knew nothing of the shop, and at the station he said the brooch he had left at the shop belonged to his sister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am innocent; the reason I ran out of the shop was to speak to a friend who I saw passing. I heard a cry of "Stop thief", and saw a man running, and I ran as well.</p>

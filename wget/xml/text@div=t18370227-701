I was twenty-three years of age this month—in May last my attention was attracted by an advertisement in the public papers, offering to lend money on good security—it referred to Mr. Savage, solicitor, No. 38, Haymarket—I wrote to that address in consequence of seeing that advertisement—I was at that time desirous of borrowing 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received an answer to the letter I wrote, the next day—I was at my mother's, in Portland-place, at the time I wrote the letter—I directed it to Mr. Savage—(<hi rend="italic">letter product by the prisoner's Counsel</hi>)—this is the letter I sent—it is in the same state as I sent it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"57, Portland-place, Sunday, May 15th. Sir, On reading your advertisement in the paper, I take the liberty of writing to ask you to oblige me with an interview at your house to<lb></lb>morrow morning, at eleven o'clock, if convenient to you. I hope you will excuse my waiting on You on that day, and to save trouble, if I do not hear from you to the con<lb></lb>trary, I shall take the liberty of calling on you at eleven to<lb></lb>morrow <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD HONEYWOOD</hi>.

I was acquainted with the late Mr. Charles Day, of the firm of Day and Martin, and was professionally concerned in various matters for him—I was employed by him to lay out his money—one of the modes of laying it out was by discount—I have kuown Gardiner since the latter part of the year 1829—</p>

               <p>I first became acquainted with him at that time—in the course of that year he was in the King's Bench prison—I have known the defendant Hance about nine or ten months, perhaps rather more—I cannot say whether Gardiner was in the King's Bench in 1830—I do not think I saw him there in 1830—I might have done so, but I cannot say positively whether I did or not—I have seen this bill of £1000 before (looking at it)—John Gardiner purports to be the drawer of it—I know the handwriting of Gardiner, who was in the King's Bench in 1829—this is his writ and also the body of the bill and the indorsement—I think I first saw this bill about the time it bears date, the 25th of August—I do not know Fallow Lodge, Finchley—I was never there—I know that Gardiner lived there—the bill was in Gardiner's hands when I first saw it—I had received two other bills of exchange from him, purporting to be accepted by the prosecutor, before I received this—they were both returned to Gardiner.</p>

Hoare—previous to my giving that cheque, Gardiner stated that Mr. Honey wood was entitled to a legacy of 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., under the will of Sir John Honey wood; that he was likewise entitled, under his mother's marriage settlement, I think, to 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other expectations—it was partly on the faith of these representations that I ad<lb></lb>vanced the money—he did not say who he got the bill from, or how he be came possessed of it, or any thing about it; after giving him the cheque I received 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by way of discount—I discounted it with Mr. Day's money—I advanced him other money by way of discount on the 1st of January—I paid him with this cheque for £500 (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was paid into his bank<lb></lb>er's—I did not advance it to him personally—either myself or clerk paid it in—it has been paid—I crossed it as payable to Sir C.

Scott" across it—I do not know whose writing that is, nor "London and Westminster Bank"—it is not mine—I paid it in at the London and Westminster Bank myself—it had not that on it then—I do not know how those words got there, nor by whom they were written—they must have been added since I paid it in—after giving the cheque I took 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for discounting the bill; I handed the £1000 bill over to Mr. Day's daughter, Mrs. Claggett—the discount I accounted for to Mr. Day—he died on the 26th of October, 1836—I accounted to him for the discount in each instance.</p>

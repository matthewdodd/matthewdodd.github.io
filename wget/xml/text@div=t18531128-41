                  </hi>. I live at No. 68, Old Bailey, two doors from Shipcourt—I am a watchmaker and jeweller—I was at home last Wednesday evening, sitting at work in my shop, and a young man sitting beside me—I heard a report, which I at first thought was the report of a gun or cannon—I jumped up immediately, and saw a man's hand in the window—this stone had come through the window, and came to the inner sash and broke it all to pieces—if it had been an inch higher, it must have hit me on the head—I could see the hand, not the person—my young man went to the door, and could not open it—I went myself to the door and jerked it, and broke this rope, which had been tied to the handle of the door and to a staple—I saw the hand take a watch from the hook, and it jerked the others off—it was a gold watch, with a three quarter lever, worth sixteen guineas—I aw a little girl come across the road, she told me what she had seen—I live in the house; it is my dwelling house, and is in the parish of St. Martin, Ludgate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What lights had you in your window <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three gas lights, and one on the counter in the shop—one light in the window is high up, which throws a light down, and there are two others in the window—the lights throw a light out of the window, and on to the other side of the road—I believe there is a street lamp on the next premises to mine, and there is a light at the corner of Mr. Williams's dining room—my house is exactly opposite Mr. Williams's boiled beef house—there is always a light in his window.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Norman-street, St. Luke's, with my mother, who is a brush maker—I was in the Old Bailey last Wednesday evening, about half past 6 o'clock—it was a foggy night—I was standing at Mr. Williams's boiled beef house—I was standing on the step, and I saw two men come out of the court opposite, on the same side that the robbery was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280039"></xptr>
               <p>—the same Bide as the watchmaker's—the men stood peeping, one of them had a rope, and the other a stone—the prisoner is the man who had the stone—the other man tied the door with the rope—I went across the road to see what the man was doing; I thought he was going into the watchmaker's shop—there are lights in the shop—when I got across to the watchmaker's shop, I saw the prisoner throw the stone in the window, and take the watch—he then went away—he walked a little, and then he ran with the other one—I saw the watchmaker come out of the shop—I told him what I had seen—I am sure the prisoner was the one who had the stone—I think I saw him again last Friday—I knew him when I saw him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you see him again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At Guildhall—I had noticed that the prisoner had a red handkerchief with white spots on it, and a brown coat doubled, at the time he took the watch—I looked at his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw white spots in the handkerchief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they were square spots—I cannot tell whether it was this handkerchief—it was like it—there are many spots on it—when I was first taken by the policeman to see this man, I did not see any one with a red handkerchief—I did not recognise any one—then the policeman put the red handkerchief round his neck, and I said that was the man—there were two other men besides the prisoner—I did not recognise any till the policeman put the handkerchief round him; then I said, That is the man"—I did not see the policeman put the handkerchief round him—I went out of the room; I then came in again, and saw him—it was very foggy that night, but it was getting a little clearer then—I never saw the prisoner before in my life.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 367). I stopped the prisoner on some other affair, about' a quarter past 7 o'clock on Wednesday night, in Bridge-street, Blackfriars—he was taken to the station, and taken before the Magistrate on the Thursday—the last witness saw him on the Friday, in one of the waiting rooms—I had heard of the robbery in the Old Bailey, and I told the Alderman, and he sent for Sands, and the prisoner was remanded—when I came to the Court, I went in first, and put a handkerchief on the prisoner, as he was when I took him into custody—he had this handkerchief tied round is mouth when I took him—there were two other men brought up with the prisoner—Sands did not see him before the handkerchief was on in my presence—I got the prisoner himself to put the handkerchief on; and when Sands saw him, she identified him—she went round the three men, and went round the prisoner, and said that was the man—the prisoner said at the moment that he was at home (he had given his address at the station in Flint-street, Friar-street, Blackfriars-road), and I said, You could not be at home, as only three quarters</p>

               <p>of an hour had elapsed from the time of the first robbery till the time I took you"—he then replied that he only wore the handkerchief ten minutes previous to my taking him—Flint-street is close to the Surrey Theatre.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It would not take three quarters of an hour to go there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To go there and back, it would—he said he only wore the handkerchief ten minutes before I took him, and he had come directly from Flint-street—I had not received any description of the man at that time; but when I showed him to Sands, I had received a description from the station—it was me consequence of the description I put the handkerchief on him.</p>

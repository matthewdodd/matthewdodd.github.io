            . I am an officer of St. Pancras. I know a woman who applied for relief, in the name of Mrs. Gornall, two or three months ago - I saw the prisoner with her; she got a warrant against him, and he was taken into custody - she claimed in his presence to be his wife; he said he was very sorry for what had happened - he acknowledged she was his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deny that she was his wife in any way? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Did he never state to you, that there was another William Gornall, a cousin of his, who was a mariner? A. Never, I am quite sure; I saw the prisoner and the woman I called his wife together, in Britannia-street, when I apprehended them - this conversation took place in the street, in going to Hatton-garden Office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did both the wives claim relief from the parish? A. No, the first only.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 21st of November, on suspicion, finding these things upon her, about nine o'clock at night. She had got a bundle with her. She said they were her own things. I detained her on suspicion. She said she was going to pawn the things to pay a chandler shop score. I asked her her name; she said it was Davey; she lived at No. 7, Brentford-mews. I put her in the watchhouse. I went and enquired; they knew no such person. I came back, and took charge of her in my own name, and locked her up. Some time in the night she said she was very cold; she asked me to let her come out to the fire to warm herself; at last she said that some other woman and she had stolen the things, and pawned the bolster. After this she confessed that she pawned the bolster, and she had torn the duplicate to pieces.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. This bolster and case was pawned by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The bolster is mine, and the sheets are marked with my own mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was she with you - A. About half after eight.</p>
               <p>Langley. This was soon after nine that I stopped the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence My husband sent me out to pay the shop score, for the things that I owed; I met a woman; she had two bundles in her hand, she said, take hold of this bundle, while I go and make some money to pay my rent. When she came out she gave me the ticket. Not knowing how to read I put the ticket in my bosom. She said. she would treat me with a pint of beer. She asked me to pledge the sheet. I went in to pawn the sheets for six shillings. Immediately the pawnbroker took me up, and the women ran away from me. I told them I brought the things from Mr. Elliott. I told my husband to go up to Mr. Elliott. I was locked up in such a place, I did not know what to do, I was in such a fright. I leave it to your decision. This child is dying in my arms. My prosecutor can give me a character if he likes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I was a sailor on board the steam ship <hi rend="italic">Pekin</hi>—she came into the Victoria Docks on a Saturday—I know nothing about the days of the month—I came ashore about 6 p.m.—the lamps were alight—my little brother was with me—near the rail<lb></lb>way station where they are building I saw Cassin, who I knew as a steersman the prisoner was also a sailor on board the same ship—I saw him and eard him say that he wanted to quarrel with four men, Cassin, Alli, Dean, and this man—Alli was also known as Barlow—Dean and Alli were also sailors on board—when the prisoner went to quarrel with them I went to him, took hold of him, and told him he should not quarrel, and was taking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187411230085"></xptr>
               <p>him away to the ship, but Cassin was passing along coming away from the ship, and the prisoner pushed me away and ran and seized hold of Cassin's clothes who said "I don't want to quarrel with you," and tried to get him to go away—they spoke together in the Malay language and I don't know what they said. (<hi rend="italic">The witness spoke Hindoslanee.</hi>) Cassin pulled off his coat and said to the prisoner "You strike first"—he said "No I will not, you strike first," and then Cassin struck him on the head with his open hand, a gentle blow—after that the prisoner drew out his knife, held out his fist, seized Cassin by the hair and struck him with the knife, and in about half a minute he turned round and fell—I went and looked at him and saw a little blood from his temple and the knife sticking in his head just above the ear—I could not see the blade only the handle—I spoke to another sailor and told him to take him—when Cassin fell the prisoner used a very offensive word which it is impossible to put into English.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not a Malay, I came from Deccan—the other three men were Malays and so was Cassin—the prisoner is a native of Siam—I saw the prisoner alone first and I saw Cassin in the middle of the road with his hands on his hips—the prisoner only struck one blow—I had not been to a public-house with him, I only met him in the road and was only with him half an hour—I did not see the knife in the prisoner's hand when he struck, but I saw it in the man's head afterwards—I never saw Malays fight with knives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were forty-three of our men on board the ship, but there were two crews—Cassin came from the ship, I noticed him when he was as far off from me as that wall—he walked as steadily as I should.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of Bell and Anchor Cottages, Victoria Dock Road—on the Saturday night I was opposite the dry dock in North Woolwich Road and saw the prisoner and other men were with him—I saw Cassin going towards him and he pulled off his jacket and went up to the prisoner—they were talking their own language which I could not understand, and the prisoner struck Cassin on the head—I did not see anything in his hand nor had he hold of him in any way—I did not see Cassin do anything to him—it went into Cassin's head and he fell—I was close to them and saw the handle of a knife which was sticking in Cassin's head just by the left ear—he did not speak after the blow—the prisoner walked away and I followed him till I met Cross and Golding, two officers, and told them to take him into custody—I then went back and found Cassin still lying on the spot where he had fallen—he was taken up and carried into a building belonging to the Bell and Anchor—neither Cassin nor the prisoner appeared at all the worse for what they had taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I came up other foreign sailors were standing there—I don't know what took place before I went up, but I only saw the prisoner strike one blow—the deceased was taken to the Bell and Anchor just before twelve o'clock and to the dead-house after the doctor had seen him—it turned out that he was not dead after all—I do not know how long he lay in the dead-house before he was taken to the hospital, I went away.</p>

               <p>the prisoner <hi rend="italic">done</hi> one blow—I was 10 yards off, and that one blow <hi rend="italic">done</hi> him, and he fell directly—I then saw the prisoner, as I thought, in the act of cutting Cassin's throat—they said "Go away, go away," and I did not go near him; but it appears that he was trying to get the knife out—on going up I saw the knife in Cassin's head—I got hold of it, and the whole of the blade was in his head—I could not take it out because his head was on the ground—a doctor was called—I saw no blow struck except by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 29). On Saturday night, 24th October, I was in North Woolwich Road with Cross—Martin came to me about 11.30 and pointed out the prisoner—I directed Cross to take him, and went with Martin to the Victoria Dock Road, where I found Cassin lying in the road on his back, and the knife still sticking in his head—the blade was completely buried in his head behind his left ear—he was insensible, and appeared quite dead—I sent for Dr. Norris, who took the knife from his head in the road, and removed him to a shed at the back of the Bell and Anchor, which they call a dead house—the doctor examined him in the shed and found he was still breathing—he found a large gash in his left arm also—he dropped a little brandy into his mouth—I went to the station and reported to Inspector White, and the man was removed to Poplar Hospital at about 6 o'clock—I read the charge to the prisoner of feloniously cutting and wounding—he said that he knew nothing about it—I found nothing on him—I measured the knife—it was rather over 4 1/2 inches long, and the tip of the blade was a little turned.</p>

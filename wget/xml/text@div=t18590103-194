I asked him where it was—he said it was in the East India Dock-road in a cart—I said that I would go with him in an hour, and I went with him—I asked him where the bell was—he said, on ahead about 2 or 300 yards—I saw Irwin driving the cart. I went on to Whitechapel, and saw Mr. Marks—I said I thought I had something that would suit him in the shape of a bell—I asked it he would look at it—he said "Yes," and I drove it to his place—Mr. Marks said, "This is a foreigner"—I said to Tuttlebee, "You know the person you got this bell from"—he said "Yes, it is all right"—it could not be weighed whole; it was to be broken up, but we found it could not be broken—I went out and came back about 4 o'clock—I saw the bell sold to Mr. West in the evening for 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I sold it to him—it was appointed for Mr. West to go to Mr. Marks at 9 o'clock the next morning to get the bell away—my van went with two ropes to get it away.</p>

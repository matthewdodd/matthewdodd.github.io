            . I am the prosecutor's son. About ten o'clock in the morning of the 27th of October I came out of my father's house, and passed the prisoner within a few yards of it; I crossed the way, and happened to turn my head; I saw the prisoner put his hand up, as if to open the door - he had his hand upon it; he was in for two or three minutes, and then came out with some things under his arm; I had fastened the door myself, and had not left it three minutes - I had not my eye upon the door all that time; I crossed the road and ran after him - I said he must come back to my father's, which he did, and dropped in the passage a pair of breeches and a shirt; another witness came up to the door with a key, and I saw my father try it to the lock of our room door, which it opened as well as our own - it was picked up near where I took the prisoner; he left the door open.</p>

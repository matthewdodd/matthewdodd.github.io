               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Do you remember the terms of the sentence, in which it was pronounced? - I believe it was that he should be transported to some of his Majesty's plantations in America, for the term of seven years.</p>
               <p>Was it not a part of the sentence, that he should be taken back to the place from whence he came? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. The difference between his case and a palpable escape is, that he never was carried back to the gaol; an escape from the gaol of Newgate, is a different thing to this man's, he never did escape out of Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court. in the case of transportation, the carrying back to the place from whence they came, is no part of the sentence; if the transports should be ready in the river, the court would probably prefer that mode; the carrying back to gaol, is no part of the sentence: it is only to detain the person for the execution of that sentence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. He was taken with the irons on him and brought back, it is said for me to say, that he only varied the path to prison.</p>

               <p>I am very sorry to give the court the trouble, I acknowledge I got through the hole, my irons was not off, I never had any intention, till I saw other prisoners go that have been taken since, and forgiven; even my irons were not off, and I had not so much as a knife about me; I never was out of sight, even people followed me into the house. My Lord, I beg for mercy.</p>

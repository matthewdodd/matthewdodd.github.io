                  </hi>. I am the widow of the late Thomas Parker, and live in Whitechapel-road, and keep a beer-shop: On the 15th of Aug. I saw the prisoner at our house—I cannot tell the time, for since this happened my memory has been much impaired—it was between breakfast and tea-time—Yates was in the shop at the time—the prisoner had two baskets, one with herbs, and the other with black-coloured berries and a few nuts—I think there were nearly two gallons of black-coloured berries—they were round like black currants—they were like these now produced, but were quite fresh—when they are broken they are full of small seeds—I asked him what they were—he said they were, as I understood, nettle-berries—whether he said "wortle" or "nettle I cannot say—I said I had never seen them before, although I had lived u the country—he told me they were beautiful for eating, for tarts, puddings, or wine, better than black currants—I bought a pint for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and picked the stalks</p>

               <p>off them in his presence—he said sometimes he got them from the Surrey-hills but these he had fetched a long distance—he entered into conversation with Yates—I made a tart of them next day, of which both me and my husband partook—my husband very soon became drowsy—he went into the bar parlour and sat down—I made him a cup of tea—he took a very little of it—this was not more than half an hour after dinner—I experienced the same effect myself—my husband was taken up stairs—I afterwards heard him moaning—I went up, and his mouth was foaming—I sent for a doctor—I was afterwards taken ill myself—we were both taken to the London Hospital, but I was insensible—my husband expired the next morning, about ten o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I was acting as apothecary at the London Hospital when the deceased was brought there—he appeared to be labouring under the effect of narcotic poison, and the symptoms were as if he had taken <hi rend="italic">airofa-belladonna</hi>, as he had a remarkably dilated pupil and was frequently catching at objects, and his pulse was much accelerated, his face congested, and he was somewhat comatose—these were symptoms of his having taken <hi rend="italic">airopa-belladonna</hi>—I made him vomit, and found from twelve to a score of the <hi rend="italic">atropa-belladonna</hi> came from his stomach—the berries now produced are of the same description—he died in the hospital, and I have not the least doubt from the effect of that poison.</p>

I am a druggist and medical botanist—I live in Bethnal-green—I have known the prisoner four or five or more years, as a herbgatherer, a collector of medical herbs, he was employed by me—I consider him very clever—he collected the best herbs in the best manner—he was a man of skill in collecting them—I never employed him to collect <hi rend="italic">belladonna</hi>—I ordered the wortle-berry of him at this time—they are sometimes called cranberries—he did not bring them to me, but called on the 15th of Aug., when I was out—wortle-berries are called in the country bilberry-herts—they are more like black-berries than the <hi rend="italic">atropa-belladonna.</hi>

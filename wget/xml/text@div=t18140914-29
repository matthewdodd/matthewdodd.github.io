Yes, about a quarter after eleven o'clock at night, I was going home, and just before I went to the rope house, Anderson came up and took hold of my arm; I had never seen him before; he asked me where I was going; I told him I was going home. Foreshaw then came up and took hold of my right hand. Anderson said to Foreshaw, we must look to see whether he has any money I had my coat and waistcoat buttoned. The prisoner pulled my coat open, and tore my waistcoat pocket. I hustled with them to get away; I got away from them, and ran about. An hundred yards; they ran out right over Mile End-road. I went into the rope-house, and looked at them, and then I went into the road, and sung out robbers. I went to the Ship public-house; some gentlemen were coming out of the public-house; I told them what had happened to me six of us pursued them. I took the way I had seen them ran. I was not present when the prisoners were taken.</p>

            . I was at the Ship public-house when Lewis came past the door, it was about a quarter past eleven at night; he said, he had been stopped by three men in the fields, but they had not robbed him of any thing; he described their dress. There were six or seven of us at that time; we divided ourselves. We knew the spot Lewis had described. We went where it was most likely we should fall in with them, we passed through the posts by Mr. Steven's rope-house, of rope-ground; Foreshaw was laying there about thirty feet from the foot-path, close another side; we asked him to get up; he readily got up. He asked what we wanted with him; we told him there had been an outery that a man had been stopped there. It was in the moonlight night. When Foreshaw got up, I asked him what he did there; he said, he had been in the French prison and in a Spanish prison; he had no work or lodging; he was going down to his master; he had promised to get him employment.</p>

            . I was in the public-house. I went out after the people that were supposed to have stopped Lewis. I found Anderson between the ground and the George public-house; I touched Anderson as he was laying in the field with my stroke; he started up I asked what he was doing there; he said, he had no lodging; he laid there to sleep. He was taken charge of. He had a jacket and trowsers of the as he in now.</p>

I received information of the robbery on Sunday morning, 9th January, and in the evening I went with Branch to the house of the Sullivans, 259, Cable Street, for the purpose of making inquiries—they were occupying a front room on the second floor—it was furnished very barely—I told them the circumstances of the robbery, and asked whether Branch had taken anything there—Daniel said they knew nothing whatever about it—I have had the case in my hands from the 9th January to the 9th April—I have seen Daniel Sullivan in the interval, per<lb></lb>haps four or five times—he has been employed as an extra man at the docks—I have seen the female, Mary Sullivan, four or five times in the company of Branch—they have been shopping at different places in the Commercial Road—I have seen them come out of shops with parcels—I have ascertained that Branch had lodgings at 3, Church Path, Stepney—on the 9th April, I was in company of Monger, and we saw Branch enter a jeweller's shop, whilst Mary Ann Sullivan remained waiting outside, it was Mr. Wood's shop, 5, Crombie's Kow, Commercial Road—Branch beckoned to Mary Ann to go in to her, and Monger then rushed into the shop and seized hold of Branch's hands whilst I held Mary Ann and took her into the shop—we asked the jeweller what they had been buying, and he said a lady's ring, and he produced a brooch which he said they had given him in exchange—I produced the brooch, and told Mary Ann we should charge her on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery at Mr. Lazarus's—she made no reply, and both women were taken to the police-station—on the prisoner Branch I found 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a pair of earrings, a wedding ring and keeper, all new articles; and a duplicate, torn into pieces, was picked up in the dock where the prisoner had been standing—upon Mary Ann we found a wedding ring and keeper, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to No. 3, Church Path, and in a room, the key of which I had from Branch, I found a quantity of new furniture, a lot of receipts for new goods, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a bed and bolster, Albert guard, gold rings, &amp;c., and two savings' bank books, there were eleven receipts altogether, and they were for goods purchased on the 19th January—we searched the lodgings of Sullivan in Fair Street, on Sunday the 10th April—he and his wife occupied two rooms on the first floor—I found there a new bed, new bedstead, new chairs and tables, considerably more furniture than what they had when living in Cable Street—there wore also a gold Albert and locket, and a gold signet ring, which we found in the pocket of a coat hanging up behind the door—they corresponded with one of the receipts of the 19th January, and which I found at Branch's place—I was not present when the silver coin was given up.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Child, pawnbroker, High Street, Shad well—I produce the watch and chain that has been referred to, and a duplicate of the ticket that was torn up in the dock—it was pawned in the name of Mrs. Branch, on 19th April, for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the watch and chain together—I had seen the two women at my shop on 17th or 18th January—they made two purchases—these are the invoices; one is for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were sold to Branch—the articles were sent to 7, Fair Street—the goods were paid for in cash, principally silver money—I think the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was all in silver—I can't speak for certain, it was so long ago.</p>

I know Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan—Mrs. Sullivan keeps some sewing machines—the little niece that has been spoken of is seven years old—I recollect, some time ago, seeing her give the male prisoner a coin, and asked him to make a hole in it—he took one out of his pocket, with a hole in it, and gave it to her to put round her neck, till he made a hole in the other one—it was a silver coin, something like a florin—it was like this one—I have lived about two years with the prisoners as servant—the little girl lives with them—I saw Mrs. Sullivan make her husband a present of a gold chain, about a year ago—it was before Christmas.</p>

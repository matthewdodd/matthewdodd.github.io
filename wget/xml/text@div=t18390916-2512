                  </hi>. I am a road contractor, in partnership with joseph Nicholls, in Sovereign-mews. The prisoner was in our employ for two years, and had the charge of three horses—I went into the granery, and found the padlock unlocked, and some corn and an old sack in the loft, where it ought not to have been—all the men in the yard had access to the loft—there was nearly two bushels of it—I put back a bushel and a</p>

               <p>half, and put some square pieces of paper in it with "N" on it—I put the sack where it was before, and set a policeman to watch—the prisoner afterwards came to the stable, and I let him in—he brought out the horse and cart—I saw him put the sack into the cart—I then went to the loft, and missed the sack of oats—I directed the policeman to follow him, and I got on horseback, and rode after him—I came up with him at Kensington Gravel-pits, rode by his side, and kept him in conversation till the police<lb></lb>man came up—I then gave him in charge, and said he had got some corn which he had stolen-"he said he took it for his horse, and that he found it under his horse's feet—we found it in a sack, inside his own sack, which he took the horses' provision out with—he had the usual provision for the horses besides this sack, a bushel and a half—I found the pieces of paper among it—he could have no occasion for that quantity besides.</p>

I stopped the prisoner on the road—be said he had not stolen the corn, but found it behind his horses, that Mr. Nicholls usually allowed him so small a quantity, he thought he might as well take it, and there was another man in the stable when he took it—I found a piece of paper with the letter "N" in the corner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tin japanner, and live in Holland-street, Chapel-street, Oxford-street. I have a shop in Black Horse-yard, which I leave locked up at night. On Monday, the 24th of May, I left it about two o'clock in the day, not intending to return that day—I locked it up—it has a spring lock—as soon as the door is turned it locks, and then I turn the key which fastens it more—every thing was right in the shop then—I returned at seven o'clock next morning, and found the shop door open, the box of the lock was forced away, and hanging down by one screw—on going in I missed some articles, and found some of them exposed for sale on the Thursday fortnight following.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general salesman, and live in West-street, St. Martin's-lane—I have seen the prisoner twice—I saw him at my shop about three weeks before the 25th of May—I bought some plasterers' tools of him—either on the 25th or 26th of May, I bought of him three tea-trays, three frames, a china plate, two brushes, a tin canister, and a wrapper, for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put them out for sale, and about a week after the prosecutor came by, and claimed them—those now produced are them.</p>

I keep the King's Arms, Bishopsgate Street—on 19th September, at 12.15, I was closing my house—there is another compartment facing Acorn Street, in which there were three men and three women—the prisoner is one of the women—I opened the door and said "This way out, please"—the throe men passed me, and one of the women, the second woman, made a rude remark, and I told her to pass on—the prisoner then laid hold of my whiskers—I told her to keep her</p>

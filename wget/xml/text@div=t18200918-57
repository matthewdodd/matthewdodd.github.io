            . I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. On Saturday, the 10th of June, I was at his house, and saw Madden in the passage, nearly opposite the bar, alone - I saw him outside a minute or two after, in company with the other prisoners and another man, coming towards the house, and were about sixteen doors off. The three men came into the house - Callaghan stopped behind, and the men went into the taproom, I still stood at the door. Callaghan walked to and fro, then came in, stood in the same place where I first saw them together. I went into the taproom, and observed the men had got some beer and change. In about two minutes Callaghan came in and went to the bar. I went and observed her give the prosecutrix a note and pull a bottle out of her pocket - she was served and had her change given to her, and as she was taking up her change Madden came and stood at the taproom door, which is on a line with the bar - he could see what passed in the bar. When Madden observed her taking up her change, he said to the other two men,</p>
               <p>"Come, I am not going to wait any longer," and all went out in company together, the three men and Callaghan.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next Saturday was you there - A. Yes, I saw Madden in the yard; it had just turned four o'clock. I was going in to tell my sister, and just as I was going to speak to her I saw Newnam present a 1 l. note (I had discovered the first note to be a bad one) - Madden at that time stood on the back-door step, and could see what Newnam did at the bar. My sister said</p>
               <p>"This is a bad note, I shan't give you change or the note either." He was going to turn from the bar and I seized him - Madden was then on the step; I do not know what became of him. I gave Newnam in charge of one Wood, while I fetched Penfold. I went with him and Newnam, and as we went along, at the back of the house, I saw Madden and Callaghan in Gun-lane, looking at us on the opposite side of the way - Wood secured them in consequence of what I said. Madden said he was no thief, and where I wished him to go he would. He took a few halfpence out of his pocket, and began playing with them; he then fumbled in his fob, and took out a piece of paper, rumpled it up, and put it into his mouth. I could only see that it was paper. I immediately told Penfold I suspected he had swallowed a note - he throttled him, but he resisted, Callaghan struck Penfold, and he swallowed it. He said it was tobacco, but there was no appearance in his mouth of his chewing tobacco, for we made him open his mouth. I told him it was a note, he said I was a liar. I told Newnam he was at the shop on the Saturday before, he said he was not.</p>

            . I am a constable of Limehouse. I assisted in taking the prisoners to the watch-house, and searched them there. I found a pint bottle on Callaghan; on Madden I found a good note and about 3 s. I partially searched them then, and secured them in the lock-up room. About nine o'clock I went to the watch-house, brought them from the lock-up room, and searched them again, but found nothing on them; but on searching a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180034"></xptr>cast-iron privy in the lock-up room, it has a pipe leading to the drain, and on looking in there I discovered a parcel of particles of Bank notes in the bason of the privy, torn up and scattered. I collected them, with another officer, and pasted them together on a paper - they made three notes. I marked some, and Lines marked the others - (looks at them) - here are some which I marked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MADDEN. Q. Did you not search every pocket I had - A. I believe I did. Nobody but the prisoners had had access to the privy. I only partially searched them, being a young officer I had not experience.</p>
               <p>JOHN LINES. I am beadle of Limehouse. I saw the iron privy at the watch-house cleared out on the 17th of June - nothing was left in the bason or tube. Nobody had access to it afterwards but the two male prisoners. When they were put in I informed them there was a privy. I returned and asked Madden where he resided? he said at his father's, in White Lion-court, Bermondsey-street. I went there and found his father, but Madden did not live there. About nine o'clock in the evening of the 17th I searched the privy, and found several pieces of Bank notes - they appeared quite new. I marked some and Vinee the rest - (looking at them) - here are some which I marked. The privy was cleaned about three hours before the prisoners were put there.</p>

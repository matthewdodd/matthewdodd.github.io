The prisoner came there on the 16th of September, to know the price of a suit of fustian; I had a gentleman in the shop, and told him to wait; when the gentleman was gone I told the prisoner the price - he then asked for some black trousers, and I laid four or five pairs on the counter; he asked for a pair of the best, and then said he thought he should like a pair of blue ones - I told him to go to a place and try them on, which he did, and said they would not fit; he then tried a pair of black ones on, which fitted him well, and he told me to put them aside; I went to put a pair of trousers behind the door, and saw another pair of black ones in his hat, which was on a chair, and his own apron partly over them; he told me to make out a bill for a suit of fustian and the black trousers; I went to get the ink, and told Mr. White he had a pair of trousers in his hat, which he had then put on: Mr. White took his hat off, and saw the trousers; he said, "Whose are these?" the prisoner said, "They are yours;" I then went for a constable - he was very well dressed.</p>

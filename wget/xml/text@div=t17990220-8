               <p>Q. How many pair of shoes have you missed in the whole, speaking within compass? - A. I cannot say to the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any shoes since the prisoner was taken up, that were produced to you by Mr. Lane? - A. Yes. I got a search-warrant, to search the house of the prisoner, and went with the officer, when it was executed; I found there four pair and two odd shoes, in the drawer, they have my mark upon them, and one of the odd shoes had Mrs. Aberdeen wrote in it. The prisoner begged my pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her any thing, or threaten her with any bad consequences, if she did not confess? - A. Not at all, no such words passed; she said, she would make me any restitution, if I would say no more about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. What did you say to her before she begged your pardon? - A. I asked her, how she could do so, to rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell her it would be better for her? - A. No, she said it was from distress; I said, no, Mrs. Compton, it cannot be from distress, because you are a woman of property.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been missing shoes? - A. Upwards of three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner occasionally in your house, superintending the business? - A. Sometimes when we have been busy, she has been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not left her there, confidentially, in your absence? - A. I do not remember Mrs. Hale and I ever leaving the house both together.</p>

               <p>Q. You had an apprentice boy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you left her there to superintend that boy? - A. No farther than to see that he gave an answer, and to call us; I had confidence in the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great many shoes in your shop? - A. We have between seven and eight hundred at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. The shoes that you found were of a common ordinary pattern, the same as you sell in your shop? - A. Yes, except the two odd shoes, one was a bespoke shoe, and the other a shop shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you say but these shoes had been sold in you shop? - A. I cannot say about that, she has frequently taken out shoes to customers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did she always return those shoes? - A. Yes. An account is always taken of what are taken out, and we reckon them when they come back; if she sold a pair at any time, she brought them back and accounted for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q.Have you made any application, or sent to her, since she has been in jail? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positive of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That four pair, you did not know were missing at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say when the two odd ones were taken away? - A. I cannot exactly say, but I think it is about a twelvemonth ago; I saw them one day, and missed them the next.</p>
               <p>Q. Of the shoes that you found at the pawnbroker's, would you undertake to say you have not sold those shoes? - A. I cannot say that, if I have, it has been by retail.</p>
               <p>THOMAS-WINDSOR ALLEN sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Lane, pawnbroker, in Drury-lane:(Produces 62 pair of women's shoes); I bought them all of the prisoner, at two and seven-pence halfpenny a pair, sometimes five, and sometimes six pair at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you how she came by them? - A. No, I never asked her that question.</p>

               <p>Q. Is she a married woman? - A. Yes. At the time I took her into custody, her mother was there, she acknowledged they were her apartments; here are four pair and two odd shoes, I found them in the drawer of a chest of drawers; I asked the prisoner for the key, she at first said, she had not got it; I said, I should break the drawers open; and then she produced it. There was some conversation between her and the prosecutor, she begged the prosecutor's pardon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q. Did he say any thing to her before? - A. He did not. She said, she would make him any restitution. I then secured her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. These were the husband's lodgings, I believe? - A. I understand he lived there with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. How did you understand that? - A. From herself, and her mother.</p>
               <p>Hale. Here is a shoe with Mrs. Aberdeen written in it, I have the fellow to it in my pocket; they were a pair of shoes made for Mrs. Aberdeen, they were returned, and I missed one of them the next day, and a shop shoe with it, which is the fellow to this other. (Producing another).</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the shoes produced by the pawnbroker? - A. They have my private mark, and many of them have been altered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. You sell a great number of shoes of the same kind in your shop? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have not sold an odd shoe, with Mrs. Aberdeen's name upon it? - A. No.</p>

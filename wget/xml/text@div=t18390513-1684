                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Smith, who is in the poor-house. I am a charwoman, and live in Stable-yard-street, Greenwich, in the house of John Carter. On Wednesday night, the 24th of April, I went out to get some wood, after the clock had struck eight—my room is the first floor front—I latched the street-door, and fastened my room-door with a catch-latch, which could not be opened without a key or force—the street-door could be opened outside—I returned within ten minutes, and found the street-door open—when I went up stairs, I could not get into my room, as somebody inside resisted against me—I asked who was there—nobody answered—I said, "For God's sake, who is in my place?" and a voice answered, "It is only me"—I screamed out, "Murder"—a man opened the door, and ran down stairs—I had closed the street-door after me when I came in—I went down after the man, find found him behind the street-door, trying to open it—I opened it myself, got on the step, and screamed "Murder"—he up with his fist and knocked me from the door into the road, and came out of the house—I got up and followed him, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped by Burgess—the prisoner is the man—when I came up I told Burgess to hold him, for I had found him in my place, and I would send for an officer—he held him, and an officer came—he offered to go back to the house with me, by myself, to let me see he had taken nothing, but I would not agree to that—the officer went back with me—I found a gown, which I had been making, taken off a chair-back where I had left it, and spread open on the floor, and two pairs of stockings, two caps, a handkerchief, and some pieces of linen, all lying on the gown-piece—I had left them all on a chair behind the door—there were two shawls on a round table, with a collar and handkerchief—I found them removed to a chair, and rolled up together—there was a petticoat, a table-cloth, and apron removed from their places—I gave them to the officer—I lost nothing—I am sure the prisoner is the man—T never lost sight of him—it was a beautiful moonlight night—there was nobody running in the street but him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live in Stable-yard-street, Green<lb></lb>wich. On the 24th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, I was in the middle of the street, and heard a woman cry "Stop thief! Murder!"—I instantly saw a man run by me—I ran after him and caught him in Church-street, which Stable-yard-street runs into—he had only got across the road, in the same line—I saw nobody else running in that direction but the prosecutrix—when I laid hold of him, he said, "What have I done? What do you want with me?"—I said, "I don't know yet"—the prosecu<lb></lb>trix came up and said, "He has robbed me"—in the mean time the officer came up—the prisoner said, "I was only making water"—the policeman took him—it was a moonlight night—several people came up at the time, but not in the direction of Stable-yard-street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 8.) The prisoner was given into my custody—I went back with him and the prosecutrix to the house—the things were on the floor, and he said, "I have nothing to do with them"—a young man who was there said, "Why did you run?"—he said, because she called murder—I searched him and found on him a skeleton key and a piece of string—the key will open both the prosecutrix's room doors and several other locks as well—I tried it.</p>

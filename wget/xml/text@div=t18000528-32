             sworn. - On the 26th of April I was sent for to take a woman of the name of Davis into custody, and I found the prisoner in her company with a bundle in her lap; I asked her what she had got there; she said it was nothing to me, they were her property; she then said they were a pair of sheets that she had fetched from Westminster; she said they were the sheets her father died in, and I had nothing to do with them; I took her before a Magistrate, and she was committed for further examination; Mr. Day heard of it by some means, and he applied to me.

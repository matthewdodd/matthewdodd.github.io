               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Had you not at that time intended to give him in charge? A. I had not fully determined on it - he had the key from me a little before seven o'clock; I examined the till as soon as I came down - I think the bar-maid was not up; I cannot tell who had been in the house as customers from the time the prisoner had the key, as I was not up.</p>

               <p>MR. PALMER re-examined. When the prisoner said he had put small silver into the till for the two half-crowns, I said it was highly improbable, as in that case there would have been only one sixpence taken that morning - he said, when he was before the Magistrate, that he had paid the baker and the milk-woman in silver.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I was in the parlour on the 31st of May, cleaning it- I had a view of the bar; I saw several customers come in that morning as usual - I do not know how many came in; I saw no difference between that and other mornings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you know what they bought? A. No - I only know that silver and copper were taken; I believe 1 1/2d. is the price of a glass of gin, but I do not know the price of liquors - I sometimes go into the bar, but did not that morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What were the words he used? A."Mr. Palmer, pray forgive me;" I will not swear whether he used the word "Pardon me;" these are the half-crowns.</p>
               <p>MR. PALMER. These are what I had marked - there was some copper in the till, but we never count that; the morning takings vary from 5s. to 10s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they not sometimes less than 5s.? A. For a fortnight after, I made a point of opening the house myself, and found them never less than 5s.</p>

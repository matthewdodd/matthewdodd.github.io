                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LUDOVIC LEVASOUR</hi>. I am a glass and china merchant of Great St. Helens—the prisoner was my traveller in 1877, and in consequence of some irregularity I came to an understanding with him in November, 1878, to give him wages—in January, 1879, his account was overdrawn about 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 24th May, 1880, when he was given in custody, it was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, overdrawn—he had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week wages, which was paid to his wife when he was travelling—he was allowed 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day for his expenses when he was in the country, which was remitted to him as he wanted it, and he was furnished with money when he started—on 2nd September, 1878, I wrote to him saying, "You have so to remit at once all moneys you receive on my account, however small they may be, without any excuse for delaying such payment; my object in doing this is that you so come under the Master and Servants Act; and know for yourself that any sum you may appropriate to your own use will be no less than embezzlement"—he was then in the country, and he sent me this letter, dated 6th December, 1878, stating, "I agree to your terms, only you must make the salary 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he afterwards sent me this draft agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that all accounts should be remitted to London the same day</hi>)—I have never varied that obligation—he never remitted to me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Julia Francis, or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Brooking, or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Beaumont.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On 1st January, 1878, he had overdrawn his commis<lb></lb>sion 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called his attention to it, and he said that he would work very hard, which he has done to the beginning of the year, and would repay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he has turned over within the last twelve months it may be about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I have discovered since that there are a great many ficti<lb></lb>tious orders from Manchester—I had been about two years in the trade when he came—he has not worked up the greater part of my connection—I had three travellers at the beginning of the year, but afterwards the prisoner was my sole traveller—he had to go to Manchester and Liverpool, as well as to Isleworth and Brentford—he had a horse and trap and my man, for which I paid—the stable is in London, and I paid for the keep of the horse when there, but when out the prisoner had to pay for the baits—he had not asked me this year to make up his commission account—he may have done so once or twice last year—he made it up himself to the end of November last year, and it has not been made up since—it could not be made up frequently, because he had no commission on bad debts or on fictitious orders, and he was not paid till the orders were paid for—he gave from six to twelve months' credit, and if he sent an order in January it might be the following December before he was entitled to his commis<lb></lb>sion; but some customers pay cash, and take advantage of the discount—most of the orders are on credit, but many customers pay once a month, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188006280025"></xptr>
               <p>some at three months—in November he had 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the bad—he has not paid 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that, but it has been credited to him as commission—he always remitted cheques on his journeys and kept cash; he has not afterwards put Against that money which he has paid, such as his 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—he took four or five days' pay with him, according to how long he was going for—what I call fictitious orders are where the persons have written to me since saying that they never gave any such order; but some were refused because they were not in time, or not according to sample.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He has never complained to me that he has been under-paid; he always acknowledged that I was very kind to him—he has never complained with regard to the forage of the horse—on June 1 he was behind<lb></lb>hand 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he received on June 3rd, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 14th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 18th, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 28th, 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and on 29th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in July he was behindhand 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in spite of those drafts; he did very little business—on July 4th he had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7th, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by cheque, because I was going on the Continent; 11th, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>; 16th, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 28th, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and he was constantly asking for more—he went on drawing—he went into the figures himself in November, and roughly brought out that he had overdrawn, his commission some hundred pounds—as to his being the creator of my business, I have one customer who has done more business than he has ever done for me.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tea-dealer, and live in Hereford-place, Com<lb></lb>merical-road, but my chief establishment is No. 9, High-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner was in my employ, and I had a man I call a manager—in Con<lb></lb>sequence of suspicion I marked four half-crowns in the presence of a person named Strahan—they were marked in a secret way—I went with the police<lb></lb>man to the shop in the Commercial-road—the prisoner took a half-crown out of his packet and gave it to the policeman—it had a mark on it which the policeman pointed out.</p>

                  </hi> I am an attorney's clerk, and live in Camomile-street—I received four half-crowns from Mr. Strahan on the evening of Friday, the 24th of Sept., with a view of my using them in a purchase at Mr. Christie's shop—I used them in the purchase of tea and sugar to that amount on Saturday morning, the 25th of Sept., of the prisoner—he put the money into the till.</p>

                  </hi> It has never been customary to borrow from the till—it was not done to my knowledge—I found four half-crown in the till when I came into the shop that day—three of them were marked—I took two half-crowns afterwards—I had not seen the half-crowns marked, but I had heard how they were marked, and the one the prisoner produced was marked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been manager of this shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since last Dec—I have never borrowed money from the till—I have occasionally borrowed money of the prisoner of a night, when I have been casting up the cash—I have asked him if he had a shilling or eighteen-pence, to make it up even money—I have borrowed from him and from others to make it up without the knowledge of Mr. Christie—the money from the till of that day was made up without communicating the fact to Mr. Christie—I have borrowed a shilling or more make it up, and have paid it the next day, when there was money sufficient in the till—I had no direction from Mr. Christie to bring even money—it was my duty to take him every night the contents of the till, whether it was even or odd—I did it of my own free will—I have borrowed of the prisoner and paid him out of the till next morning—I do not call that borrowing of the till, it is paying a debt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You took money out of the till to pay? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have borrowed without my master's knowledge, and paid without it—I have the management—I pay for various things in the house, such as bread and pro<lb></lb>visions for the use of the young men—I dealt with the till in my discretion—I paid from it, borrowed from it, and paid back again—I do not know what object there could be in making up even money of a night, and applying to the servants to assistant me to make it even—I know the prisoner has gone to the till and paid for bread and various things in my presence, and in my absence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he had paid with his own money for any article, he would be entitled to take out of the till the same amount that he paid out of his own pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That has never been done to my knowledge—I borrowed to make the money even instead of counting up the pence—I only took Mr. Christie gold and silver at night, unless we had coppers in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers—it did not answer any end to make the gold and silver even money—it was done quite in an innocent way—I had borrowed of the prisoner about three weeks or a month before that time—there was nothing owing to him—he was not authorised to make purchase for the house no more than if bread came in—when the supplies have been short, he has been to Whitechapel to bring goods, but not to pay for them.</p>

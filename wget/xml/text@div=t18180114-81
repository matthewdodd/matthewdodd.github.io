On Friday, the 9th of January, the prisoner came into the shop, between eleven and twelve o'clock, to match a piece of stuff. I shewed her several pieces, and turned round to get another piece - She immediately walked out, saying there were none that would suit her. I immediately missed a piece of sarsnet, and followed her - She had got into Castle-street; I secured her with six yards of sarsnet under her shawl - She struggled-nobody was in the shop except the prisoner and myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. We had no words.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FRASER. I am a constable. Garrett gave me the sarsnet and the prisoner in charge. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St.Ann, Westminster.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He showed me some stuffs that would not do. I said I would call again; he said he did not think I wanted any; I asked him if he thought I was a thief? he said I might be, and told me to go out - He jumped over the counter, I took up the silk to strike him with, and he said I was going to steal it, and behaved insolent. I lived in Castle-street.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GARRETT re-examined. It is totally false. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140039"></xptr>did not see the silk till I brought her back - I had not missed it.</p>

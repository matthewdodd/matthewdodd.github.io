On the 22d of Aug. the two prisoners came to buy sailor's cloaths, but seemed not to settle to any thing; they agreed for a waistcoat and handkerchief, but when they came to pay, they neither of them had no money, they left me a pair of silver buttons and said, they would come again in the afternoon; I saw them no more till the 25th, they said, they were come to pay for the handkerchief and waistcoat and to have the buttons; then Hill said, he wanted some more handkerchiefs, I put down some, and some neck-cloths; I did not like them, and thought I had missed something before. The neck-cloths were soon missing, I seized Hill, my servant came in, and we bolted the door, I sent a porter for an officer; Hill was very saucy, he said he wanted beer and would not stay, he swore he would not be confined, and said he wanted to case himself, and made water against one of the counters; then they josteled up together to the counter, the neck-cloths were immediately cast from them, they were all in one piece of black silk, part sell on the counter, and part behind, and withall an old handkerchief stuck to them, which Hill afterwards said was his property; I could not tell from which they came. (Ten neck-cloths in a piece produced and deposed to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother Alfred, at 26, Surrey-place, Kent-road, we are linen-drapers. William Thorpe came into our service on 19th May, as foreman—on 31st May I missed two shawls, six yards of linen, and other articles; and on 3rd June, a dozen pair of stockings—I spoke to Quinnear about it, and went with him to Mr. Ivatt's, 4, Albany-road, and searched a box there, which was corded, but not locked, and in it found a piece of ribbon with our private mark on it—next morning my bro<lb></lb>there, who is not here, gave me some duplicates; I took them to the pawn<lb></lb>broker's and there found a piece of cotton plaid, some flannel, some ribbon, and four pair of stockings—I afterwards found twenty-four yards of calico in the female prisoner's box, a pair of stockings on her feet, one pair on the floor, and six pairs of stockings at the prisoner William's; and I found seven</p>

               <p>linen handkerchiefs in the female prisoner's box—I believe them all to be ours—the greater part of them have our private mark on them—before going to search the male prisoner's box, I asked him if his name was Thorpe, he said, "No"—I asked if he was married, he said, "No"—I asked if his father's name was Thorpe, he said, "No"—I told him I had information he had been robbing me, and I should give him into custody—he said he had not taken anything—I gave him in charge—I told him a piece of holland had been found, which belonged to me, and he said he had not taken it.</p>

In consequence of information, on 9th June, I went to Mrs. lvatt's, went to the servant's room, there searched a box, and found among other articles, two yards of brown holland—I then went to the prosecutor's, returned to the house with Mr. Southon, and then searched two boxes, and found the things he has mentioned—we returned to Mr. Southern's premises, and he gave the male prisoner into custody—I told him Mr. Southon had given him into custody for stealing two yards of brown holland—he said, "I have not stolen anything, and I do not think Mr. Southon can prove I have," and he denied being married—the next day I received a bag from the prosecutor; there was a key in it which opened a box, at Mrs. lvatt's—I went to Mrs. Ivatt's again that afternoon, and found the female prisoner in the servant's-room—I asked her if her name was Brown—she said, "No, my name is Thorpe"—I asked her if she knew William Brown, who was at Mr. Southon's—she said, "Yes, that is my husband, his right name is Thorpe"—I searched two other boxes in the room, and found more linendrapery—I charged her with stealing it—she said, "I have not stolen anything, my husband gave them to me"—Mr. Southon gave me some duplicates, which I showed to the male prisoner, and asked him if he knew anything about them—he said they were his, and related to his own property, with the exception of four he had purchased of a young man at Peckham—I told him I had been to Mr. Burls, the pawnbroker, with Mr. Southon, and he had identified property there as his, which one of the duplicates related to, and I showed him the duplicate—he said that was a bundle given him by Mr. Owens, a young man at Mr. Southon's, and he did not know what it contained.</p>

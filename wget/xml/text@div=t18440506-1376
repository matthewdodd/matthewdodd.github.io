I was a patient in the hospital in Gray's Inn-lane—I was received there in September last—I was not in the ward where the prisoner was, but on the 22nd of March I had my thigh amputated, and the prisoner was brought from the bottom ward to the top, to wait on and take care of me—he had his bed by the side of me—on the 26th of March, about twelve o'clock, I lost my purse, two sovereigns, nine shillings, a sixpence, and three pence, from my trowsers pocket, under my bed—there were more patients in the ward—I know the purse was in my pocket on the evening of the 25th—the</p>

                  </hi>. Previous to 30th October last the prisoner told me he had sold fifteen quarters of oats to Mr. Crutcher, upon which I wrote him out this delivery order to give to Mr. Crutcher, with my contract note of the price—he never brought me any money for the payment of the oats—I applied to Crutcher for it—Jones told me he had been down to see, and Crutcher had promised to pay him if he could—this is his writing—I received it, (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> 29th November, 1863. Dear Sir, I have gone down to Lee, having heard Mr. Stewart has returned from Brighton. Crutcher promises to pay me if he possibly can.")—the prisoner lived at Peckham—in consequence of what Mr. Crutcher told me when I applied to him, I went to the prisoner's house—he was not at home—I went again the next evening, and found they had all gone away and taken the furniture—I never saw him again till he was in custody, about four months afterwards—we were con<lb></lb>tinually day and night after him—he never came to my office during that time—he gave me no notice that he was going to leave—on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> October, 1863, he had sold twelve quarters of oats to Mr. Stewart, upon which I gave</p>

               <p>him this order with a contract note—I sent the invoice and applied to Mr. Stewart for payment—on 4th November the prisoner also gave me an order for forty-four quarters of oats from Mr. Phillips, and I gave him this delivery order to the Superintendent of the Great Northern Railway—I have applied to Mr. Phillips—the prisoner has not paid me a farthing for either of those orders—they would come to between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 0<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is another order from Mr. Phillips—it would be about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether.</p>

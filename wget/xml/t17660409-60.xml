               <p>On December the 20th, I and my brother bought these 2 mares of a man that said he came from Brentwood; we agreed to give him 8 l. f or one, and 6 l. for the other: we went to Birmingham, to see an acquaintance, and got there December 23; then we set off to come to London again: I went on to Cuttle-mill, thinking my brother would come to me; there came in 6 or 7 men, and put a pair of hand-cuffs on me, and brought me to Coventry; and all the way stopped at all the alehouses, and made me fuddled, and wanted me to confess: they said, if I would confess that I was the man that stopped 'squire Digby, I should have my hand-cuffs taken off. They took me before Alderman Hewitt; he saw I was very much in liquor; he showed me a piece of paper, and said it was what my brother had said; he ordered me a pot of beer; they kept me there all the afternoon; they asked me to confess, and said the Alderman would let me free by confessing; so I being much in liquor, confessed the first thing that came into my head; the Alderman wrote it down on a piece of paper, and I signed it, in order to get my liberty. I have got a receipt here of the man's that I paid for the mares: I am a milkman by trade.</p>

            . I live in Grenville-street, Somer's-town, and am a constable of the night. I did not know the prisoners before this circumstance. On the 15th of November, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at Kentish-town - one of our watchmen came and gave me information; I went, and saw the prisoners in a field, at the back of Mr. Samson's house, which is in the parish of St. Pancras; I got into the field within fifteen or twenty yards of them - they were walking slowly down by the side of the hedge; there is no foot-path there; I met them, and presenting my pistol at them, said, if they did not stop, I should fire; they stopped directly. It was a moonlight night; I told them we did not like persons hanging about the fields at that time in the morning. I took them to Kentish-town watch-house; I had no previous acquaintance with them. I found, as I went to the watch-house, that Arnold had a great coat on his back, under his own coat; I found a wet table-cloth in his hat, a pair of boy's gloves, and a pair of worsted stockings; I think they were also in his hat. I searched the field twenty minutes afterwards, and found a book.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper of Kentish-town. On the morning of the 15th of November I heard of a robbery; I went out of the watch-house about three o'clock, and met Deykin with the two prisoners in custody; I searched Brown, and found two coats under his arm, and in his hat there were two children's frocks, and a window curtain, wet - he had a book in his hand.</p>

On the 14th of November I left the school-room about five o'clock in the evening; the servant, who is here, fastened it up; I was alarmed by the watchman about five o'clock in the morning, and on going into the school-room I missed three great coats and several books, which I had seen safe at five o'clock the previous evening; nobody had a right to take them; the coats belonged to my pupils, who are boarders, but were in my care (looking at three coats) - this one, which was on Arnold's back, I know was in the school-room - I saw all three hanging there.</p>

            . I am servant at Mr. Samson's. On the 14th of November, about ten o'clock, I shut the school door, but did not lock it - I left it on the hasp; I merely went to see if it was shut; it is usual to lock it, but it was difficult to lock; I do not know how the windows were; I know these two coats - one belongs to Charles Stunt, and the other to Anthony Brown - one is marked C. S.; I have known them about three months, and often brushed them; I saw them safe about seven o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 14th, in the school-room.</p>
               <p>RICHARD DEYKIN re-examined. I saw the prisoners in the field which belongs to Mr. Samson, and adjoins his house; they might be one hundred yards from the school-room; I went to the house as soon as I could get in, which was about five o'clock in the morning; I could find no marks of violence on the window or door; I do not know whether the door was shut, as the watchman, who is not here, went in before me.</p>
               <p>HANNAH CRANHAM re-examined. I went to the school-room with the watchman; I cannot say whether the door was shut or not.</p>
               <p>ARNOLD'S Defence. On the week before this happened I was working with my father at Barnet - he told me to come to him on Wednesday, and he would give me more work; I met this prisoner in Tottenham Court-road, by accident - he asked where I was going - I said to Barnet, and he said he was going that way; we went together; I got over the gate, to go there for a necessary purpose, and saw three or four men; I called him over, pointed them out, and said, "They have dropped something" - he said,"Oh! let them go about their business;" I picked up a coat - it was a wet night, and I put it on; this young man picked up the other coats, and carried them.</p>
               <p>BROWN's Defence. I was apprenticed to Mr. Pooley,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070006"></xptr>a chimney-sweeper, and lived thirteen years with him; having been three months out of employ, I used to job about - Mr. Dawson, of Southampton-mews, told me to go and meet a waggon which was coming to town; I met this young man - he got over there for a necessary purpose; I waited for him - he called me, and I saw three or four men running across the field; I picked up these clothes, and then found the coats - the constable of the night came - I told him I had seen three or four men in the field, and picked these things up.</p>

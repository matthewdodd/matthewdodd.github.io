On the 14th of September, I heard that Pichott had been to my house on the 13th; I then went to his house, and found my boxes, which were both open, and empty - when I sent them, one had been locked, and both were corded: there was a blanket laying on the floor- Pichott showed them to me, and he had left word at my house that he wanted me to go up there: when I went, he opened the door, and said he had been robbed, and all my things were gone - he then showed me my trunks, which were empty - I took Schofield there the next morning; he went out, and when he returned he said he had very good grounds for taking Pichott, as he believed Pichott or his wife, or some one in the habit of coming there, had committed the robbery; it was no stranger, he was quite sure - I then asked Pichott who was in the habit of coming there; he said, "Nobody but respectable people, indeed, none at all" - on the Thursday, I received information that Butler visited him; I went to Pichott, and told him what I had heard - he said, I must be very much mistaken, as he was a very respectable man; he said he did not know where he lived, but he believed his wife did - his wife was then called; she said she did not know - he then said he believed it was No. 80, Drummond-street I said I should go there the next day, and left the house - I went with the officer to No. 80, Drummond-street the next day - I saw Mrs. Butler; she said her husband was not at home, but a neighbour opposite said he was at home - I saw round Mrs. Butler's neck a coral necklace, which was mine, and had been in one of my boxes; directly we went in, she caught up a duster, and threw it round her neck, but it did not entirely conceal the necklace - the officer had some conversation with her; I said I had every reason to believe that was my necklace- she said it was not; I said it was, and described it, the clasp as a gold one, with a ring at each end and twisted; the officer told her to take it off, but she would not; I believe this veil and smelling-bottle to be mine, and these napkins - they were in the trunk - I afterwards went with the officer to Pichott's, and he said I must be mistaken, as there were so many necklaces alike, that I could not swear to it - the officer asked him if he had sent his wife to tell Butler; he said Yes, and he should again, if he liked - the officer said it was very improper, after having said he would assist me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Has not Pichott been a very respectable man? A. Yes; some of my property was found at Drummond-street - I have seen these napkins; one of the boxes was locked - I did not go with the porter, but I saw the boxes on his premises afterwards, though I did not open them when I went to tell Pichott that my husband was not coming there - he was arrested for debt on the 22nd or 23rd of August, and I had sent them there at the beginning of August; Pichott said he had come to me on the Sunday night - I did not see him, but I did not disbelieve what he said; he did not request me to take away the things that remained - I think Mrs. Pichott named that to me; he said he had left his house that Sunday at ten o'clock in the morning, and came home at nine or half-past nine in the evening, and then found the house had been robbed; I heard on the Tuesday after, from Mrs. Murray, who lives at No. 20, in the same place, that a strange man had been seen at Pichott's door - she also gave me information re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140120"></xptr>specting Butler coming to Pichott's, and said she did not like him; she did not know now he got his living.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Had you known Butler before? A. No; I know the house I went to is their residence, because Pichott took me there, and the officer told her what I came about; the officer did not take the necklace from her neck - he said he would if I would give charge of her, but I must be very particular, and I wanted to go to a friend for her to see it as well as myself; I never got it at all; I went to Pichott's, and told him of it.</p>

            . On the morning of Tuesday, the 15th of September, I went to Pichott's house on a complaint of a trunk and box having been broken open - I saw Pichott who showed me a box at the entrance of the area, which he said had been left there full of articles on the Sunday, when he went out with his wife to spend the day, leaving the house quite safe - he said he likewise left a trunk full of articles belonging to Mr. Bellingham; I asked how he supposed they got in - he said by the area door he supposed, which had been left on the single lock; he showed me a shutter put too so as not to be seen, and likewise a key-hole, with some paper put in, in a door which he said he supposed they entered; it was not broken at all - he then took me up stairs to the parlour floor, and showed me a trunk, which he said he supposed had been taken up stairs, that it might not be so public as from the window below - both the boxes had been broken open as it appeared with an instrument with two prongs; I asked if any body had been to see him lately - he said no one, but there was a person living over the stable who might have access to the premises, and there was a door leading out of the stable - I went out, saw the coachman, and then went into the mews, and from what I heard there I returned, and wished Mrs. Bellingham to give charge of Pichott; she said she had known him so long she could not suspect him, and he went on appealing to God that he was no thief - I said, when he had done, "I must do my duty:" I then asked where he had been that day - he said to dine with a friend, and had returned in the evening; that he had left no one in the house, and had no strangers to visit him; on the following Thursday I got further information from the same parties, in consequence of which I suspected Butler - I got Mrs. Bellingham to the office, but in consequence of her good opinion of Pichott she would not take the oath; we went to Butler's, and saw the necklace round Mrs. Butler's neck - Mrs. Bellingham said it was hers; I told her to be very cautions, as I had seen a similar one round her neck before, and she would not give charge of her- Mrs. Butler said she would let Mrs. Bellingham go about the house with her, but not me, as I had no warrant; some words took place, and Mrs. Bellingham ran out of the house I staid some time, and then I went out; Mrs. Bellingham then said she would go to Pichott's; we went there, and found him and his wife - I told them about the necklace; Pichott said it was all false, it was not her necklace, he was sure -I then said I could do no more; I thought they were all bad characters together, and I left the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did not Pichott offer you every assistance throughout the business? A. Yes, he did, and the prosecutrix refused to give him in charge; I did not take him - he had time to run away if he chose; I did not see Butler on any of these occasions, but the prosecutrix would not take out a warrant - Mrs. Butler showed her her drawers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear on the Tuesday that Mrs. Murray had said some person was about the house? A. She gave me information at first that a person had been lurking about there, but she only described his person; she afterwards told me she heard his name was Butler - when I went to Pichott's on the Friday, I said, "You know you sent your wife last night to Butler, to warn them of my coming" - he said he had, and he had a right to do it; he was a very respectable man.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the Police. On Sunday, the 6th of December, Butler was taken on another charge; I searched his house, No. 80, Drummond-street - I found in a chest of drawers, in the back parlour, these five table napkins, a white lace veil, these pieces of lace, a smelling-bottle and work-box, and in the kitchen I found this large table-cloth; on Tuesday, the 8th, I went to No. 25, Chester-terrace, and saw Pichott moving his goods in a four-wheeled van - the man belonging to the van was coming up with a table on his shoulder; I asked Pichott if Butler was there on the Thursday- he said No, but he was there on the Sunday: I said I was an officer, and wanted to search the house - he said I was welcome to do so; the van was full of boxes, which were taken to the watch-house, and Pichott also - he said all the boxes were his property; when we got to the watch-house, I got a light, and said, "I am going to search the boxes, which are yours?" he said, "The whole of them"- Mrs. Pichott was present at the time; I found this sheet and these table-napkins in the boxes - this centre-bit, these picklock-keys, and these tools, I found at Butler's.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was Butler in custody on the Sunday? A. Yes, on another charge - I found this key in one of Pichott's boxes, which has been altered, - I call it a skeleton-key; it did not open the prosecutor's box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Do you know what a skeleton-key is? A. Yes - I consider this to he one, because it has been altered; Pichott did say his wife knew more about these things than he did - it was on the Tuesday after I found these things at Butlet's, that I took up Pichott; I do not know whether he knew that I had found things at Butler's - I know that Pichott had only been minding that house for Mr. Robins, and he was obliged to remove that day; Mr. Robins' clerk was there - both Pichott and his wife persisted in saying they were all their's till they were going away, and then one of them said there was a little square oak box, which belonged to Watkins, a lodger; I took Watkins into custody - I received some information from Mrs. Murray, and took up another person, which I supposed was in this business; that was a person named Stevens, or Simpson, who I believe is here: I did not take up any other man; I have not confused the articles found at the different prisoners; I could not put any of the articles found at Butler's into Pichott's boxes, because they were locked up - some persons came to look at the things; I had them taken out, and put aside - I put them in, but one sheet was left out; I would not unlock the boxes again, as I was very tired, and I put it into Watkins' box - I am quite sure I did not make any other alteration; I returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140121"></xptr>to Mrs. Pichott those things which the Magistrate ordered me - I had given her things to furnish one room, and she was dissatisfied with it; she came before the Magistrate, and had every thing that was in the place -I had a receipt from her, and she wanted me to have something to drink, but I would not till one afternoon, when she and her friends urged me to have some.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.What day did you go to Butler's? A. On Sunday, the 6th of December -I do not know when Schofield went; I saw Mrs. Butler in the passage - a young woman lodges in the house, a little girl, and a lad; no resistance was offered to my searching.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You say one sheet was put into Watkins' box? A. Yes; that sheet has not been given back - it is at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>MRS. BELLINGHAM. These three napkins and this sheet are mine; I have some of the same - they are not marked, but I can swear to the work and the width of them; they were bought about two years ago - I have the fellow sheet, and this exactly agrees in size; it is Russia sheeting - I bought the remnant; each of these napkins are separate and complete - they are not cut out of one piece; they are all alike, and all perfect - this table-cloth was marked with ink, but it does not appear; all these things, and a great many more, were in the boxes I sent to Pichott's -I lost every thing but what I stood up in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is your husband in confinement? A. He is in prison for debt; I had the charge of my own property and linen - he had not applied to the Court; he had no schedule at the time - Pichott said he had called to let me know of the robbery on the Sunday, and he called on the Monday; I do not know that Butler was more acquainted with Mrs. Pichott than with him - the house in Chester-terrace is a large respectable house.</p>

            . I am coachman to Colonel Beechy, of No. 22, Chester-terrace. I live in the house, and my wife lives in the mews at the back of those premises; I heard of this robbery on the Monday, from Mrs. Pichott - there was nothing in the course of the Sunday, the 13th of September, to give me any alarm; my wife had locked the back premises of No. 25, and put the key in a secret place for me - I found it there; my wife took care of the back premises for Mr. Nourse, the builder.</p>
               <p>ANN MURRAY. I live at No. 20. Chester-terrace. I remember the robbery on the Sunday; I did not see any person waiting about, and did not give any information to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. On Sunday, the 13th of September, did you see any person with bundles? A. I saw a man coming out of No. 25, with bundles, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, while the bells were going for church; he passed me, and I remarked it to Mr. Jones, my next door neighbour - I do not know that I had seen that man before or since; I am quite sure he came out of the house - he did not shut the door, nor attempt to shut it; Mrs. Jones said she thought Pichott was out of work, and might be going in the country - I have seen Butler coming to the house - I have heard he is an acquaintance of Mrs. Pichott's; I did not know Pichott till after this - I have seen Butler watching till he went in.</p>
               <p>Picholt's Defence. I have only to observe, that on the Sunday morning I went out with my wife to a place of worship near Fleet-market; I dined with a friend in Fleet-street, and then went over to a friend in the Borought - I went to the same place of worship in the evening, and returned home at nine o'clock; I opened my house, and it had been robbed - I never saw such confusion in my life; I called in the watchman, and we went over the house - the bed and bed-clothes were thrown about the room; I cannot help saying that I am surprised at Mrs. Bellingham lodging a detainer against me, after knowing me for sixteen years, and I defy her to charge me with one blot in my character - I never was confined in a watch-house for half an hour for drunkenness or bad behaviour, much less for such a crime as this; I am innocent in the sight of God and to your sights - it will be proved by the watchman.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH JONES. I am married. On the 13th of September I lived at No. 21, Chester-terrace. I was standing at the hall door, and saw a person come out of No. 25, with a large bag over his right shoulder, and a large bundle; I know Pichott and Mrs. Pichott - I never saw Butler go in there soon after Pichott had come out; I saw Butler one morning stand at the end of the terrace, but I do not know whether Pichott was at home - it attracted my notice - it might be about ten minutes past eight o'clock in the morning; he was waiting at the bottom of the terrace, and then he walked too and fro - I did not observe any thing more; I do not know whether he went in or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you see the person come out of the house? A. No; he passed close by me - it was not Butler.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Chester-terrace on Sunday night, the 13th of September; my attention was called to No. 25, by Mr. Pichott at nine o'clock, he said the house was robbed - I went in and saw a great many boxes broken open - nothing was in them: Pichott said, "There is one box missing" - I went to the next watchman, and we searched the house - found it in the back drawing-room, broken open, and nothing in it; they said the property was missing - I think there were three or four boxes broken open.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you make application to any Police-office? A. No, I was not ordered; Pichott came and said "My house is robbed - you go in with my wife; I am going a little way, and shall soon be back;" I fetched Smith, the next watchman.</p>

I saw Pichott and his wife on Sunday, the 13th of September, between eleven and one o'clock, in the girls'-school, called the British and Foreign School, in Harp-alley, where we have Divine service every Sunday - I then went with them to show them where Mr. Hoskins lived in Fleet-street; they said they were going to dine there, and were going to some friend in the Borough to tea, and then were coming back to our place in the evening, but I was not there in the evening.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know the day? A. I have it in print in my pocket - it is a Methodist place, which we rent of the Committee of Ladies' belonging to the Girls' School; I heard Pichott preach there in the morning.</p>

On Sunday, the 13th of September, I was at the Chapel in Harp-alley, and saw Pichott there as near eleven o'clock as possible - he was late that day; I stopped there till one; I went there again in the evening, and heard Pichott preach till about eight o'clock.</p>

            . I live in Maze-pond, and am a tailor. On Sunday, the 13th of September, Pichott was at my house to tea; I think between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What makes you sure it was that day? A.On account of my other friends telling me it was that day - I have no other proof, only what my friends have told me.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.Did you understand where he was going when he left you? A. I understood to Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WELLS. I am a cheesemonger, and live at No. 58, Blackman-street. I have known Pichott seven years - he has had a very honest character; he came to me some time the latter end of last year, and said he had been robbed of some things of his own, but he did not care about them, but he had lost some things of a friend, which he was very sorry for - it was one Saturday night as I was outside my shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was that? A. I think he said he had been robbed the Sunday before; it might be in September or October, but I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>- WATKINS. I lodged with Pichott; Butler was in the habit of coming to the house, and I understood Mrs. Pichott had known him previous to her marriage - I do not recollect seeing Butler there above once, which was about a fortnight or three weeks before the apprehension of Pichott; I was at home, and Mr. and Mrs. Pichott, and I believe another person; I recollect Butler seemed a great deal agitated - he said he was determined to leave his wife, and he had been trying to make it up with her for two years - he had a great coat on his arm, and I heard that two bundles were brought in; I heard Pichott advise Mrs. Pichott not to have any thing to do with them, because Mrs. Butler might come; I do not recollect seeing the bundles, but I understood they were taken away again.</p>
               <p>MRS. DAINTRY. I live at No. 24, Walnut-tree-place, Lambeth - I happened to call at Pichott's about a fortnight before he was apprehended; I saw Butler come there about six o'clock in the evening; he rang the area bell, and Mrs. Pichott answered him - he came into the bed-room where Mrs. Pichott and I were talking; he passed the room in which Pichott and Watkins were sitting; he said he called for the bundle, and I saw two bundles produced, and two great coats - he took something out of one of the bundles, and took the bundles away; he put on one great coat, and took the other with him on his arm - he took something out of one of the bundles, gave it to Mrs. Pichott, and said, "I wish you would give these shirts to be made for me as soon as you can;" he was not in Pichott's or Watkins' company at all that day, unless he saw them in going down the area steps.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOSKINS. I live in Fleet-street, and am a merchant. Pichott came and dined with me on the 13th of September - we dined about two o'clock, I believe, and he left me about three.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know it was the 13th of September? A. From a printed plan; I have no memorandum of it - it was brought to my recollection when I heard of this; I do not belong to the congregation in Harp-alley - here is the plan by which I know he came.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Is it not a regular plan that one of your friends takes the preacher to dine with them? A. Yes - it was so then from a written plan.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Would he have dined with you if he had not preached that day? A. No - I have no acquaintance with him, but as a preacher.</p>
               <p>COURT to MRS. BELLINGHAM. Q. Had you taken lodgings there? A. I was to lodge there for six weeks or two months till my husband returned; I was to pay him for it, and find the bed.</p>
               <p>Pichott. She had not taken any lodging, it was a matter of favour.</p>
               <p>Butler. This man is innocent - James is the man who did the robbery, and the things found in his possession were left there.</p>

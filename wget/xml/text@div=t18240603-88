            . I am Mr. Dunhill's mother-in-law, and was at his house from the 10th to the 17th of April, on a visit. I accused the prisoner of taking some lace of mine, which is in Court - she denied having it several times. I put her into the dining-room, and said,</p>
               <p>"Stop here until it is found" - she at last said,</p>
               <p>"I will go, and find it;" - she went, and brought it. I then said, there was a lace cap of the baby's missing; perhaps she could be clever enough to find that - she went into her room and brought it. I said</p>
               <p>"There are several other things missing - there is one of the little girl's frocks." I followed her up stairs, looked through a crack in the wainscot, and saw her look into her box - when she heard me she pushed the box round, and said</p>
               <p>"Pray Ma'am, don't look into the box." I found this cap and several other things there, and took them down to my daughter.</p>

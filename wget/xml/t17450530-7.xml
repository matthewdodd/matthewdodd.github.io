            . The prisoners came into my master's house, and called for a pint of beer; I filled it for them, and put it upon the table.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Kyte. It was between seven and eight. I went round the house to count the tankards and mugs; when I came to the table where the prisoners sat, I missed the man in the blue coat [Collyer] and the mug (my master has seven silver tankards, and six mugs. )</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoners the silver mug to drink out of ?</p>
               <p>Kyte. They had a pewter pot first, but Collyer gave me the silver mug afterwards to draw the beer in. Collyer went out, and came in again presently, and then I charged him with taking the mug, and charged a constable with him directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Farmer. The young woman told me she set the mug down before me, and it was other people that had the mug.</p>
               <p>Kyte. I set the mug down before you.</p>
               <p>Farmer. Did I ever go out of the house or offer to go out of the house?</p>
               <p>Kyte. I don't know that you did; the pewter pot stood down by you, and the beer was poured out of the silver mug into the pewter pot.</p>

            . I went it into the house just before the prisoner came in, and had a pint of ale in a silver mug; they had a pint of beer in a pewter pot. Collyer came in with something in a dirty cloth; and they said, what have you got there? he said, a fillet of veal, what, said they, in that dirty bag? Upon that he threw it out, and there was two or three trowels of mortar in it, which he threw behind the chimney, and said, he would make a cross bunn of it. I went away soon after, and the maid said, the minute I was gone they gave her the mug to fill. I went from Mr. Creed's to the Founders arms in Founders court, and was sent for back again directly. I was not twenty minutes out of the house before I came back again.</p>

               <p>Q. Had it a name upon it?</p>
               <p>Pollard. I did not know it had, till the people said, they would be hanged if it was not Mr. Creed's mug, and they looked, and there was his name round the bottom of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Collyer. I bid the maid not to frighten herself about the mug, for I would not go out of the house till she was satisfied, and I staid till the constable came, which was eleven o'clock; it was about ten o'clock when the watchmen came down, and I said, Mr. Creed, I will not make any resistance, for I am innocents and we went with the watchmen to the watch-house, and from the watch-house to the Counter without any constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mug after Kennell was gone?</p>

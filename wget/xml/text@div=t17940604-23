               <p>I am an officer of the Finsbury division, in the parish of St. Luke's, I went to a house, <placeName id="t17940604-23-crimeloc112">No.4, Grub-street</placeName>

Rogers made answer and said, if you look, I fancy you will find one somewhere about, Pryor then with his cutlass pulled the carpet aside, and under the carpet that laid on the floor, there was a trap-door, he then took a little iron crow out of his pocket, and put it in, and listed up the trap-door, he looked down, and said d-mn me, Musprat, here they are, I then momentarily jumped down, Pryor staid up, and I see as I went down, a man stand by the side of the steps, who endeavoured to pass me, I told him he should not, if he dared to attempt, he should find what he did not like; I went down backwards, and the man was on my right hand, that man was the prisoner William Martin, I told him to stand, if he made any resistance I would blow his brains out; I looked about, and I saw three women, these are the women all of them, I then came up; they were standing all up, one at one end of the fly, and the other at the other, and according to the situation of the place, the other woman stood as near as could be before the frame.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation on their hands? - The women came up and followed me up, two of them, the man was attempting to follow afterwards; as soon as two women came up I coupled them together; they said, pray don't take us away in this manner, we have no stockings on, I must change my petticoat, I must have another gown; they desired time to change the dress.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040038"></xptr>Q. Did you permit them to do it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go into any other part of the house for that purpose? - No, they did it in the room where we were in, the clothes were in that room.</p>

            What became of the third woman? - The third woman followed them up, after the two came up; I think, to the best of my recollection, the third woman did not change her clothes at all. While I was hand cuffing Martin he says, what a pity it is, let a poor fellow go, it is in your power, I will give you a couple of guineas. Says I, if you give me two thousand I will not. After we had hand cuffed him, Rogers was tied with a cord, and the women had changed their apparel, we sent for a coach, and sent them to the Compter, and they were brought before a justice and committed. I examined the cellar, and I found a fly for coming the halfpence; I examined that fly, and in that fly I found this piece of copper between the dies; this die is for coining halfpence; the fly is a part of the press.</p>
               <p>Q. In that fly or press you found a pair of dies? - Yes, here is one, and Pryor has got the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find this piece of money in that die? - Yes, and these halfpence about the die, and I found several other dies. There was a sieve with some blanks in it, where we suppose the person sit to supply the die with blanks; the other dies were some for halfpence and some for farthings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any farthings? - Yes, a great quantity stampt, and a great quantity of blanks for farthings? - I found the farthings in a box by the side of the sieve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare any of these farthings with the dies? - Yes, I did; they corresponded. I found a great number of other blanks, and two pair of womens pockets, all containing blanks for halfpence. The same day we went to ask Mrs. Gilbert if she wished to have any clean linen, or any thing sent for, as we had got the key, Pryor and I went; says she, I don't know what we shall do in this, we would very willingly give you twenty pounds a piece, if you would make away with these dies, and only bring the other things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Rogers was at the door, he was not at work at all? - He was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. His hands were not all dirty? - I did not observe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not at work however. This is a piece of copper that you found between the dies, it is not a perfect thing I believe? - No, I believe it is not; but the others that were round are perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Martin is the wife of Martin? - They say so.</p>
               <p>Q. They were doing nothing at the time that you went down into the cellar, only standing by? - They were so; the candles were just blown out, the sulphur came up enough to stifle me.</p>

When I came to the house, Mr. Rogers was in the shop, and I told him I wanted to go into the cellar; he then told me that was the key that laid just at the entrance into the shop; when I came into the cellar I found a part of the cellar partitioned off; I called to the man, and told him that a part of the cellar was patitioned off, and we found no entrance; I came up and said to Mr. Rogers, this work shop is directly under this parlour, and there must be a way into it from here; he said, if you look about you will find it. I moved the carpet,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040039"></xptr>and found a trap door under that carpet, which led me into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any dies? - This is the top die that was in the press.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The other dies were not fixed? - They were not, they were about the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullan to Musprat. Is that money that you produce good or counterfeit? - Counterfeit I believe them to be.</p>

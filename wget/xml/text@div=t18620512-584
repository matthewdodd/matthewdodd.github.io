                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Brown, of 110 1/2, Aldersgate-street—is warehouse is in Red Lion-yard—the prisoner was in his employ as a labourer—he left on 14th December—Mr. Brown has a small private yard, which opens into Bed Lion-yard—there are gates which separate the two, and which were fastened on 28th December with an iron bar on a swivel, which shuts into a hasp—there are two doors from the warehouse into this private yard, side by side—when I left the premises the bottom door leading to the warehouse was looked—I shut the door next to it, on the left-hand side, and put two bags of rags against it to</p>

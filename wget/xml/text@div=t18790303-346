                  </hi>. I live at 8, Fairbank Street, Hoxton, and am delivery foreman for Messrs. Keeling and Hunt, orange merchants, Monument Yard—on the morning of Feb. 7th there was a sale at their warehouse at No. 9, Pudding Lane—after the sale we had 24 boxes of Palermo oranges for de<lb></lb>very to Lee, of Covent Garden; also 40 boxes of oranges and one case of lemons for Mr. Gibbons, of Enfield—my firm employ the orange porters' gang for the purpose of delivery—they carry them out into the vans for the different buyers—no other porters were employed—the prisoner Lake brought</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to William Taylor of High Holborn. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 8th of November, I was in the shop—the prisoner came in to purchase a comforter, which was 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he took one down from the door—he then wanted to purchase a shirt-front—I put down a half-crown on the counter from my hand, to open the window to take the shirt-front out—he picked up the half-crown, and ran away with it—I followed, and succeeded in overtaking him—I gave him in charge to the policeman, who brought him back to the shop—he was searched at the station, but the half-crown was never found—I never lost sight of him after he went out of the shop—I followed him close.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He has sworn that the half-crown was the property of his master, Mr. Taylor, but it belongs to the party who was in the shop before I went in, named Greystock. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. A person named James Greystock came to the shop to purchase a pair of stockings, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me a bad half-crown—I refused it, and said I would give him in charge—he said he lived in Little Queen-street—I said, "As you are a neighbour, I think you would not wish to give me a bad half-crown; let me see it again "—he put his hand in his pocket, and gave me a good one—I said, "You are a regular <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>, I will give you in charge "—I kept him in the shop—the prisoner came in while Greystock was in the shop—they were both taken—I put the stockings in paper, and he was going to take them away—the bargain was completed.</p>

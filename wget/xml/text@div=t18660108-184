Shortly after midnight on Christmas day, I was on duty in Commercial-street, Rotherhithe—the prisoner and three other men passed me, and went towards Mr. Lee's house—shortly after they passed, I heard screams of "Murder!" went to Mr. Lee's house, and Mrs. Lee and a friend or two of her's had hold of the prisoner—Mr. Lee gave the prisoner in charge for stabbing him—as we went to the station, he said, "I did not use a knife at all, I have not one about me"—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his inside coat pocket at the station—there were no marks of blood on it—he said that he was not aware he had a knife about him—his nose was bleeding.</p>

               <p>1 in the morning, I was called to the station, examined Mr. Lee, and found a large wound three inches long on the left side of his neck, commencing at the ear, and terminating at the windpipe—in itself the wound was not dangerous, but there are very important parts near there, and a very little change in size or position might occasion death—it was likely to be occa<lb></lb>sioned by a sharp instrument—there was also a wound on his shoulder, which I did not see till three days afterwards; it was a cut about three inches long—this sort of knife would inflict such a wound.</p>

I live in Commercial-street, Rotherhithe—on Christmas<lb></lb>day about twelve o'clock, somebody knocked at my door—my wife was in the passage, and I heard her talking to some one; I heard her say, "You had better go out"—I went up, and some men tried to force their way in—I understood they wanted some beer—one of them made a blow at me, which caught me on the neck, and inflicted a wound—I jumped forward and caught hold of him—I then let him go, but my wife kept hold of him—it was the prisoner, he is the man who struck me—I did not see the instru<lb></lb>ment—I did not know I was stabbed—I found another wound on my right shoulder when I went to bed—I was perfectly sober—I am sure the prisoner is the man—a little girl afterwards brought this knife to my house, and said that she found it outside my gate next morning—she has been chopping bricks with it since.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on 25th December, about midnight, I heard a knocking at our door—I opened it, and found from four to six men, who forced their way into the passage—they said that they wanted some one named Polly—I said, "There is no one of that name here"—my husband who came, understood that they wanted beer—e tried to force them out, and said that if they did not go out, he would fetch a policeman—he tried to pass the prisoner, who is the foremost man, and the prisoner stabbed him in the neck—I saw the knife in his hand, but my husband did not know he was stabbed till I told him—they got out' of doors and struggled, and another wound was inflicted—my excitement was so great, that I caught the prisoner by his hair—two friends came to my assistance and a policeman—I am certain the prisoner is the man who struck my husband.</p>

In December last I served at a refreshment stall in the body of the Agricultural Hall, Islington—it is lighted up in the evening, and open till 10 o'clock—on Friday, 9th December, about 9 in the evening, the prisoner came to my stall and asked for a glass of gin, which was 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a half-crown, and I gave her a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—she drank the gin and went away—I kept the half-crown in my hand, and after she was gone found it was bad, and put it on one side by itself—about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, afterwards the prisoner came back—I knew her directly—she asked for half a pork-pie, and gave me a bad half-crown—I told her it was the second one she had given me that evening—she said, "Oh, no, nothing of the kind, "and put down a good florin—I told her I must detain her until Mr. Rudkin came—an officer came up, and I gave him the two bad half-crowns.</p>

On 9th December I had a stall in the gallery of the Agricultural Hall, just above the last witness's—about half-past 8 in the evening she came to my stall and asked for a glass of stout—I told her we bad no draught stout, and she then had a bottle of stout, which was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she paid me with a half-crown—I took her and said it was a bad one—I called the barman, who bent it with his teeth in the prisoner's presence—I told her it was bad—she said she had no idea of it, she had changed a half-sovereign coming in at the gate, and had only got a good florin left—I said, "They don't give change at the gate"—she made no answer to that, but turned from me and drank her stout—she paid me with a good florin—I gave her I 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—she said that was all the money she had—and showed me her purse—the half-crown was bent in half—I left it in the barman's hands—the prisoner asked for it back—I refused to give it to her.</p>

On the evening of 9th December I was on duty in the Agricultural Hall—the prisoner was given into my custody, and I received these two half crowns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Whitehead—I asked the prisoner how she accounted for the possession of the half-crowns, and she said she got them in change at the gate of the hall—they do not give change at the entrance gates—the female searcher at the station told me in the prisoner's presence that she had found a good 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and a purse on her—the prisoner said that she came from Yorkshire, she had been in London only three days, and been lodging at a coffee-shop in Pimlioo, but she did not know the name of the shop, or the name of the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer shop, at Twickenham. On Sunday, 3rd Sept, in the evening, I was sitting in the bar—the prisoner came and asked for some beer—he had been drinking, but was not tipsy—he was a little intoxicated—I would not give him any—it was after the hour—he said he would have it then—I said he should not—he said he would break the door—he tried to draw some himself in my presence—he did draw a pot of beer—he went into the kitchen, and drank it with some others—I took them in from the King's Head—he was sleeping at my house—I told the police—they were standing at the door—they took him in the passage in the house, and took him to the police house directly.</p>

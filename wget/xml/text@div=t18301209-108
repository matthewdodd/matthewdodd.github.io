On the 24th of November I had a hamper, which I saw safe in my cart at the Basing-house; it was chained and tied with a rope - it belonged to Mr. Harris, of Tottenham High-cross, I was going home about twenty minutes past six o'clock in the evening, and gave my man charge to keep his hand on the hamper; I was told it was gone - I pulled up the horse, jumped down, and followed the person who had it; he had got above one hundred yards from the cart - it turned out to be the prisoner; he had the hamper on his shoulder - I came up to him, and said, "I have got you;" he threw it down upon my lap, and jumped over a six-feet fence, crossed a garden, and jumped over another fence; I jumped after him, he got into the road - I followed him close, and took him; there was no other person running.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. It was rather dark, I suppose? A. Yes; it could not have fallen with the shaking - it was fastened with a cord and a chain; I did just lose sight of the prisoner while he turned, but I followed him close - it is a place of great thoroughfare; it is the high road which leads to the North of England; the hamper was in my care.</p>

            . I am servant to Ward. He told me to take care of the parcel; it was safe at Stoke Newington - there was a hole in the cart, and I put my hand through on this hamper: it was a cold night - I drew my hand in to rub it, and the hamper was gone in a moment; I saw the prisoner running across the road with it - I gave an alarm: my master followed him - I followed, and my master told me to take up the hamper.</p>

               <p>came and asked for a pennyworth of cheese, and tendered a counterfeit half<lb></lb>crown—I told him it was bad—he seemed to doubt it, and I took it back, tried it, and marked it with acid—I came back and told him it was bad, and he said that his master gave it him at Turnham-green, and that he had not any other money—I gave him back the half-crown, and sent my boy oat after him to watch him—my boy soon came back and I then went into the street, and saw both prisoners walking together—when they came to another cheesemonger's shop I saw the female prisoner hand the male prisoner something, and he went into that shop—I then gave information to a constable, and pointed out the prisoners to him—I saw Jones come out of the cheesemonger's and go into a baker's named Taylor—while he was in the cheesemonger's shop the female prisoner was standing close in front of the shop—she walked across the road when he went into the baker's, and when he came out of there he joined her and handed her something—I then went up and took the woman into custody, and Bunting the constable took the man—one constable was in plain clothes, and as we were going along to the station I told him to watch and see if she dropped anything, and she dropped two pieces of coin—they were picked up in my presence by a constable—one was a half-crown, and the other a shilling—the constable was walking behind her—his name is William Pound—he showed them to me—one was the half<lb></lb>crown which the man had tendered to me in my shop a short time before—as we were going along, the woman took her hand out of her right-hand pocket, and gave me a packet, saying, "I will give you the whole, and will speak the truth"—I handed it to the constable behind—Pound has the half<lb></lb>crown that the woman dropped and he picked up—I saw the paper examined that the woman gave me.</p>

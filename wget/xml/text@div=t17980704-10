               <p>Q. Did the nail-holes correspond? - A. Yes. exactly; it was clear that nothing but the knife had separated them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a private watchman: On the 24th of May, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the bar, and another man, coming across a field at the back part of Gower-street; I asked Collins what they had got there; Collins made answer he had nothing; upon that, the other man threw the property down, and ran away; Collins had not got the property; upon that, I laid hold of Collins, and took him to St. Giles's watch house, another watchman went with me who is not here; the lead was carried there in my presence; I searched him, and found two or three duplicates upon him, but no edge tool at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the place, where you stopped the prisoner, from where the lead was taken from? - A. I suppose about five hundred yards; I was present when the lead was compared, and it corresponded, except the gutter.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040008"></xptr>Q.(To the prosecutor.) When had you seen these premises? - A. Between eight and nine o'clock the evening before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been to Sommers-town, and got very much in liquor; I came away between eleven and twelve o'clock, I fell asleep in a field, and there I laid; when I waked, I saw a man coming across the field with a load, I asked him what it was o'clock; and he said, between twelve and one; then the watchman came up, and the man threw down his load, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Ledwich.) How far were the two men from each other? - A. The man with the load was about four yards behind the prisoner.</p>

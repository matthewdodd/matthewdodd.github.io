Before she went she put a flat iron in the fire - I waited, when she returned, she took it out, and put the shillings on it, wetted her finger, and touched them, she then poured some hot water out of the kettle into a mug, took a white powder out of a paper, dipped her finger in the water, and rubbed them, she put them in the water again, and washed them; she then got a piece of yellow soap, rubbed it on the black part of the tea kettle, smeared them over with it; and after taking the black off, she gave them to me in a paper - I took them to Handley. I saw her again on the 12th, at seven o'clock in the evening, she called me aside, and asked how many I wanted, I said twenty, and gave her 6 s. 8 d.; but before the dealing was complete she was secured.</p>

            . The shillings are all counterfeit, and of one die, they have never been in circulation. The blacking is done to take off a brightness, and make them appear to have been in circulation - they use cream of tartar to restore the colour of the metal; the fire makes them sound well.</p>

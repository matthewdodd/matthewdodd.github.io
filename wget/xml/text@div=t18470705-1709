                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 272.) On Friday evening, the 18th of June, about seven o'clock, I was on duty in Gravel-lane, Southwark—I saw the prisoner go into a marine-store dealer's shop—I believe he spoke to the woman—he came out again, looked round, and went down a street that leads to Messrs. Easton and Amos' premises—there are two or three streets between them—I remained there from seven to ten minutes—he then re<lb></lb>turned seemingly in a hurried state—he went into the marine-store dealer's shop with this bundle under his arm, tied in this silk handkerchief—I went in, and asked what he had got—he said some old metal—I asked him what account he could give, or where he got it—he said he gave a man 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, in the Lower-road, Deptford, which is about four miles from where I took him—I took him to the station, and found on him this property.</p>

                  </hi> I am foreman to Messrs. James Easton and Charles Edward Amos—their factory is in the Grove, in Great Guildford-street, South<lb></lb>wark. On Saturday, the 19th of June, Burton brought this metal to our factory, I know it all; it is my employers' property—I have some patterns here, I know them by their being cast to these patterns—here is a mould on which this one was made—here is another, a valve pattern, it was made too long, and these pieces were cut off with a saw—this is the casting of this pattern, it is a new bearing—I produce this pattern from our premises—these two precisely correspond—I recollect this property being on the pre<lb></lb>mises—it is impossible to miss it amongst the quantity we have—here is one we did miss, and we had some fresh ones cast—I saw this one in May—I have seen these others frequently—I believe—I believe the whole of these to be my master's—the value of them as metal would be 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but we should not sell them as metal.</p>

                  </hi> I am agent for my brother, who has lead-works at Skipton, in Yorkshire. I have a faint recollection of the prisoner—I was on the 18th of june by Bermondsey new Church—I saw a cart there, and I think the prisoner was with it, but he was differently dressed then, as a working man—my attention was drawn, from the circumstance of a man bringing up some broken metal to offer to him for sale—I saw the sale take place—I saw him receive the metal, and he drove off in a direction towards town—I saw name on the cart—it was "Philip" something, at some place at Deptford—I do not know the prisoner nor his brother—I noticed it from having been in the line myself, and it being rather unusual to buy on the road.</p>

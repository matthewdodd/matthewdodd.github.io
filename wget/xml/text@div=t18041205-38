Willan and Co.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make use of any promise or threats? - A. I told him if he did know any thing about it, it would be better for him to confess the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. After that, I have no right to ask you any question.</p>

             left their defence to their Counsel.</p>
               <p>Cook's defence. I am perfectly innocent of the crime charged against me; I know nothing of the notes, except from Mrs. Haley, and as to the notes found in my lodging, they were given to me on Saturday morning; the day before she gave me five pounds in notes, and seven shillings, to go to the Excise-office to pay for the license. As I went along, I went to where my trunk was, at No. 10, Goswell-street, I always leave my trunk there; I never have any thing at my lodging barely, but my night-cap; I had locked up the notes in my trunk, because I was going to Wapping; I went to Wapping, and dined, and drank tea there; I returned the next day to the place where my trunk lodged, and I dined and drank tea there; on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050046"></xptr>morning following it was a rainy day, it rained from the time I went out till I returned. When I was apprehended, young Mr. Vidler came to my lodging, and told me that Mrs. Haley had left in my house 150 l. to change in small notes; my answer was, whatever was in my possession was safe, and I wished the right owner to have it. Soon after that, Goodenough rifled my pockets, and as to money I had but five shillings and sixpence in silver and halfpence; he then took me to Bow-street, and who should he see but old Mr. Vidler, as he told me, and the office was shut up, and the Magistrate was gone; he then said he must take me to the watch-house, as I must be taken care of for that night, and as to the conversation that I had with him concerning the notes, I said, if you will go with me to-morrow morning where my trunk is, I will go with you, I shall be happy when they are all out of my custody; I desired him, as we were going along, not to drive up to the house, but to stop an hundred yards from the spot; we stopped at the end of Long-lane, and we went to the lodging where my trunk has been for two or three years; as soon as we got into the room, I unlocked the trunk, and produced the notes; the clothes that were in that room have been in my possession for two or three years, and the reason I did not wear them was, I had not proper apparel to wear with them; I opened the trunk as soon as I got into the room, and said, there they are, and I am very happy they are out of my possession; this was at the woman's lodgings that has washed my linen for these two or three years; she is as good a woman as ever breathed in the world; there was nothing but a trunk that contained a few books, and some private memorandums; he insisted, after finding nothing in my first trunk, on searching the other; I opened the other trunk, and he searched every paper, he shook every book, and he found nothing more in it, as God knows, but the 150 l. delivered to me by Mrs. Haley; that is the truth. I have no acquaintance in London to speak for me, I have kept no company in London these four years; very fortunately for me, a gentleman has come forward to give me a character; he has always acted by me, and every person, as a man of honour.</p>
               <p>Haley called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Cook called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

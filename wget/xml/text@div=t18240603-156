            . On the 18th of February I lost a cap from a bundle brought to me two days before from Miss

            , to wash. The prisoner lodged in the same room. She heard me enquire about it, and denied knowing any thing about it. Schofield brought it to me about a fortnight or three weeks ago. She staid about a week after the cap was lost, and then left me. I went to her lodgings on the 26th of February; she still said she knew nothing about it. I am quite sure that it is the cap that I had lost.</p>

            . I live in Cross-lane. I did lodge with Mrs. Fletcher on the same floor, but not in the same room. I have seen the cap a great many times in Fletcher's possession, and I have seen it on the prisoner's head. On the 26th of February I went with Mrs. Fletcher to her apartments, and her landlady told us in her presence, that the cap had been on her head the night before - she denied it, and produced a cap, saying,</p>
               <p>"That is the cap I wore," which the landlady contradicted. I saw her afterwards with the cap on, and told Mrs. Fletcher of it.</p>

            . I do not think there is a possibility of my being mistaken in the cap. I have had it to wash for three years. She lodged with me about a week, and then went to Villiers-street, in the Strand, and then returned to me again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not show you the cap at the time when you were making enquiries about it - A. No.</p>

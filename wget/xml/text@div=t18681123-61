                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, of 43, Bedford Street, Commercial Road—my place was broken open on the night of the 7th—I saw it fastened up at 12 o'clock on Saturday, and between 1 and 2 o'clock on Sunday I was called by my son, and found the shutters forced open, the sash line cut, and the window taken off—the room was all in confusion, and I missed a lot of bronze boots and shoes—I went into the street and saw Tribe in custody—these boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—they were safe when I fastened the house.</p>

On 8th November I was in Nelson Street, about 1.30, with Drew, and met Tribe coming out of Frederick Place, immediately at the back of Mr. Petes' house—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he said "It is all right, I work for Mr. Salter"—at that time Hig<lb></lb>gins ran away, up Fenchurch Place—I took Tribe to the station, and as I did so he dropped two pair of boots, wrapped up in paper.</p>

When this policeman seized me I was standing against the wall; he searched me; that was 200 yards from where he saw a pair of boots in the road; he picked them up, and said, "I can make a charge against you." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. That is not true—I saw you distinctly drop them, it was 150 yards from where I first saw you, but they dropped from under your coat—I did not search you till I got to the station—I did not say that I could make a charge.</p>

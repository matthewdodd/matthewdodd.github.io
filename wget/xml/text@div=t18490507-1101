                  </hi> I am in the employ of Learning and Co., of Manchester, Messrs. Brettle and Co., worsted-manufacturers, deal with us. On 21st Aug., I packed ten bales of worsted <hi rend="italic">fox</hi> them, each con<lb></lb>tained twenty bundles of dark grey worsted, four-threads—I delivered them myself to the carman of the Grand Junction Canal Company—one of the bales was marked "760"—we use tickets for Messrs. Brettle's house—this is one of the packages which contained the dark grey; this ticket on it, "14 four-threads dark grey," is a mark we use for Brettle's house only—I cannot say that this bundle was packed in the bale 760—each of the bundles contained the same kind of worsted, and were each marked with the same ticket.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to the Grand Junction Canal Company, On 24th Aug. I received ten bales consigned to Brettle and Co., order from Learning and Co. of Manchester—I received orders from Brettle's to deliver eight of them, and the Nos. of them are entered in this book; 760 was one of the Nos., but that was not delivered; it ought to remain on our premises—I last saw that bale on 9th March when I took stock at the request</p>

               <p>of Brettle and Company—I afterwards received an order for the bale No 760 on 23d April; this is the order; I looked and could not find the bale.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many bales have you received for Brettle and Company, from Learning and Company since August? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 500 per<lb></lb>haps; the number is on a piece of paper, sewn on to the external part of the bale—those papers are sometimes rubbed off—on 9th March when I took stock, I found twenty bales, with the numbers rubbed off.</p>

                  </hi> I am in the employ of Brettle and Co., 119, Wood-street. We purchased the ten bales from Learning and Co. in August—each of these bundles has a ticket to it—this is the same ticket that we have—I understand this ticket is specially used by Messrs. Learning for us—on 23d April, I sent for the bale No. 760—this order for it is my writing—I received an invoice of these goods from Learnings—the bales are numbered in this invoice—here is bale No. 760 amongst them—this article is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you sell it in the same state that it is now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, with our own tickets on it—we sell from ten to twenty thousand bundles in a year, with our own private marks on them—twelve months ago, this article was not so valuable as it is now.,</p>

On Thursday, 19th April, about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon, I was with Bradley in Paternoster-row—I saw the prisoner carrying a parcel on his shoulder, which contained four of these bundles—I stopped him, and asked what he had—he said worsted, and he was going to Mr. Lee's, No. 36, Newgate-street—I said I did not think it was all right—he said, "You can go with me"—we went with him—he went into Messrs. Lee's warehouse, and threw the parcel on the floor, and said "Now are you satisfied"—I said, "No we are not"—we saw Mr. Baker, and asked him if this man was his porter—he said he was—I said, "He has this parcel"—he said to the prisoner, "James, what have you here?"—he said, "Worsted"—he said he bought it of a man at the Oxford Arms, Warwick-lane—I opened the parcel, and it contained this worsted—the prisoner said he gave a shilling a pound for it—I asked him who the man was—he said a big Yorkshire man, he had never seen him before—I went to his lodging, and found five more bundles of it in the parlour cupboard, which was unlocked.</p>

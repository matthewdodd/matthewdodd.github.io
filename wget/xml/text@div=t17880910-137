            , I took an old man out of Sussex, I cannot tell his name; I was watching the road from Lydd to Cranbrooke, and a tilted cart came past us with two men; it was loaded with tobacco and spirits; I turned it about in order to conduct it to Mr. Hayward, who was in the other road; expecting those men that were on horseback behind the cart to raise the smugglers, as there are a great many in those parts, I sent the man that was with me to fetch Mr. Hayward to my assistance, as I expected a rescue; and I had not proceeded more than a quarter of a mile before three men on horseback came up, two of them had large whips and the other a bludgeon, I am not positive whether the prisoner is one, but I believe he is; one of them was a stout man, but as it was night I am not positive; I told them to keep off, that I had got smuggled goods; they clapped spurs to their horses and came upon me all three at once, with two whips and a bludgeon, before I had an opportunity of defending myself; two of them had loaded whips and the other a very large bludgeon, one of the largest I ever saw used on horseback; the blow stunned me, so that whether they pulled me off or I fell off I cannot say; I fell to the ground, and was three quarters of an hour before I came to myself, and then I found myself in a pond; the cart of goods and my horse were gone; I proceeded on the road, thinking to find Mr. Hayward; I afterwards found him on the road with Message and the prisoner Gomery in possession, that they had taken with some part of the goods, and my horse; afterwards we found the horse and goods near, the goods were laid up along side the cart; the goods were tobacco and brandy; we only saved two gallons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous, Prisoner's Counsel. Hayward, who was regularly appointed, was not with you? - No.</p>
               <p>You had no commission? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you fire at the prisoner? - I levelled my piece to give an alarm; I knew my arms would not go off, they were quite wet.</p>
               <p>Jury. If the seizure had been made good, should you have been entitled to a part? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>Confirmed the above, and that they met three persons, two of whom run off, and Gomery struck at Message with his whip (which he produced in court) he was taken; he was leading Turner's horse; he asked what he had done with Turner, and he said he had left him with Clifford and Davis at Cranbrooke, and those men knocked him off his horse, and he said he would go and shew them where it was; they found eight bags of tobacco which had been cut off their horses, and found Turner in a very bloody fainting condition, all over blood and very weak.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rous. You was informed of the rescue, and pursuing the people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For the purpose of taking the persons? - We had no thought of taking the persons, only the goods, till we found the prisoner with Mr. Turner's horse.</p>
               <p>Did not you pursue these people for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100165"></xptr>purpose of apprehending them for rescuing the goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then two men escaped and the third bird you caught? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was not willing to be taken? - No.</p>
               <p>When you went to take him he struck with that whip? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You saw the horse belonging to Turner in his custody of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And seeing that horse you went up to take him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Were you struck, or was Message struck, when you were attempting to seize Gomery, or when you were attempting to seize the goods? - When I was attempting to seize him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. Message is no Excise officer? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the time that Message was struck, was after you had seized a part of the goods, and before you seized the rest finally? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then was the blow that Message received from this man for the purpose of saving the goods, or for the purpose of saving himself? - For the purpose of saving the goods, I look upon it.</p>
               <p>How so? - Because he tried to knock him off his horse; the goods lay on the road.</p>
               <p>Suppose the prisoner had knocked Message down and rode away, you would have seized the goods, would not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What this man intended, would have been effected; that is, as far as concerned the preventing his being taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Because I understood you to say, Message and I ran up to take him? - Yes, the goods we had seized and left on the road. We ran up to take him, having Turner's horse in his possession.</p>
               <p>And to prevent your taking him, he, the prisoner, struck Message? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you at the time, that there was any other reason for his striking Message, than to prevent his being taken by Message? - Yes, I apprehend there was.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you so then? - It did appear to me so then.</p>
               <p>How far off were the goods? - About 50 yards, part of them; the other part were forward on the road, about 3 quarters of a mile; we seized them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the prisoner going towards the goods you had taken, or from them? - - From them that I had seized.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. According to the place where this cart was driving to, was this man going to or from it? - Towards the cart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. Where the cart was, you know nothing, at the time of this affray? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the goods that you had seized were the goods that he had cut off, in order to increase his expediton, and left behind him 50 yards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he was still going away from you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was employed on the 15th of August, as assistant to Hayward. We went in two parties; and Mr. Hayward and I went in one party, and Turner and another man in another; the man came to us between one and two, and told Mr. Hayward Turner had seized a cart, and expected a rescue; and wanted us to assist him. Hayward and me went forward towards Cranbrook, to assist Turner: when we came to the place, where the man said he was, we did not find him there; and we went on a mile and a half, and overtook three men, with horses loaded with tobacco; and we pursued them, and got two of their horses; the prisoner was one, I am sure he was one of the persons, he was the man that struck me; when I came up and caught his horse, he struck me across the hand with a loaded whip.</p>

               <p>What was you doing at the time he struck you? - Stopping him.</p>
               <p>Was his horse loaded with tobacco? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were you stopping him for? - For Mr. Hayward to seize the horse; when we first came up to them, they cut off the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100166"></xptr>tobacco, and rode for it; I cannot say how far they rode; I pursued them, and caught hold of his horse, for Mr. Hayward to seize his horse; Hayward and I were together, and it was for Hayward to seize the horse and the tobacco: then the prisoner struck me with a loaded whip on the hand; then Mr. Hayward took the whip from him, and asked him what he did with Mr. Turner's horse; when he struck me, and said, what is that to you? he made another blow at me, but I saved it with my hanger; then Hayward took the whip out of his hand; then Hayward asked him what became of Turner; and he said he would shew him where he was. We kept Gomery, and made a seizure of his horse. We seized the tobacco.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. How often have you three been examined together, that your memory does not serve you? - We have not been examined much.</p>
               <p>You went merely to assist Haywood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To act under his directions? - Yes. We took two of their horses; two escaped, one with his horse, and one without.</p>
               <p>Hayward told us, you went up to seize him? - To lay hold of the horse.</p>
               <p>How did you lay hold of the horse, by the tail or where? - By the bridle.</p>
               <p>Did you not lay hold of the rider? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. You stopt Turner's horse, and Gomery's too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The tobacco you said was cut off, and they run half a mile, or a mile? - Yes, I should think they did; we went back and picked it up.</p>
               <p>Where did you conduct Gomery, the moment you took it from him? - To see where Turner was, and from thence to Hayward's, and to the justices; after we had been at Hayward's, and were conducting the prisoner to Cranbrook, to the justices, we met with the cart; we found it in a farm yard.</p>
               <p>What share are you to have? - I do not know yet.</p>
               <p>You do not know how much you have earned yet? - No.</p>

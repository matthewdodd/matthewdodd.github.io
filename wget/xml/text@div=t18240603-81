            . On the evening of the 19th, I found the screws of my till loosened - the officer called me a little after 12 o'clock - I found the prisoner in custody - the officer produced a chisel - I found my back door open; also the back and front kitchen doors, which were closed when I went to bed - they were on the latch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons have you in your house - A. Three men, a maid-servant, and my daughter. I went to bed about half-past 11 o'clock; none of the doors were broken, as he could get in by lifting up a latch - I tried the back door before I went to bed, and am sure that it was latched - I leave it so for the man who sleeps in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030029"></xptr>the back premises, to come in in the morning - my men went to bed before me - I saw their lights out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that he came to sleep in the house A. I do not; I should not have suffered it; he might have got in over the door, the same as on the 13th.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 19th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was watching the prosecutor's premises, and saw a light come into the shop. I got on the bench in the street, looked through the fanlight, and saw the prisoner come into the front shop, and draw some screws from the wood work of the till with a screw-driver, which I afterwards found in his breeches pocket; he was at the till for eight or ten minutes; he then went to the desk at the corner of the shop, and, in about twenty minutes he took the light to the back of the house. I had a key of the street door. I went in, and secured him at the foot of the stairs; the back door leading to the slaughter-house was open. I asked how he came there - he made no answer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to a friend's, and got in there to sleep, as I was locked out, and his man had often asked me to sleep there. I had no intention to rob.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. SHEFFIELD. Q. If he got through this open place, could he get into the house without opening a door - A. He must open one door to get to the till - it is the back shop door. The open place is over the door of what we call the pound - it is not part of the dwelling-house. He must open a door in the outer wall of the house to get in, but one door leading to the yard was open.</p>

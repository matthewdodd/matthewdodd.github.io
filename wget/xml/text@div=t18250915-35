               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This prisoner had been in your house some time? A. Yes, but he was kept at a distance - he tried to intrude his conversation upon me with vindictive motives against others; I know a gentleman of the name of Rumball - the prisoner came to me from his service, in a destitute state; I gave him livery, but I did not make him any other presents. I was unwell in the year 1823, and, in consequence of seeing an advertisement in the Papers, I went to a medical gentleman's house for retirement, and finding it a delightful situation, I made a temporary residence there; but I was in a state of recollection during that period. I will swear I never gave him these books and bottles. I did not, at Mrs. Willoughby's house, claim two bottles as mine which turned out to be hers. I saw a handkerchief there which I said might have been mine, as it was a new one. I had given him old handkerchiefs, but it is not likely I had given him a new one - but when Mrs. Willoughby said it was her's, I said, "Very well." I had never given him any books or wine in my life. I did not claim two bottles at Mrs. Willoughby's house - I said "These are my bottles I think;" that is all: the prisoner was not appointed to attend me in my confinement, nor was there any person set over me when I was in that unfortunate illness. I behaved generously to him, but did not give him any thing besides clothes and pocket handkerchiefs. I paid some debts out of his wages - I missed several of these books about two months ago, when I was looking for "Ash, on Mineral Waters;" I cannot tell how long before I had seen that book safe, but it was found at the Rectory-house - I did not claim other property which was not mine - I pointed out things which I supposed were mine, but when they were claimed by other persons I did not take them away - I was in Mr. Rumball's house, but I was not in such a state of mind as to forget what I gave, or what I said.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can the prisoner read French? A. No; some of those books are French: here are some old volumes of history, and I do not give odd volumes away, and leave my sets incomplete. When I lived in the physician's house in 1823, the prisoner was his stable-keeper - he was turned out of that service, and I took him in and gave him 9 l. a year.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody - he took me to the Old Church-house, at Stanmore-marsh - I searched the parlour first; he said he believed Mrs. Willoughby was in the house: I found six bottles, which Colonel Roberts said were his property, and he had some at home which would match with them - I asked Mrs. Willoughby where she got them; she said from her son, in London; I said, "You may as well tell the truth" - she then made no answer, but the prisoner said, "It is no use saying any thing about it - I brought them." I then went up stairs, and found those books, which he said the Colonel gave him; I said, "Did the Colonel give you these pickles too" - the Colonel replied that he never did; there were some other articles there, but the Colonel would not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What were the other articles which the Colonel claimed? A. There was a silk handkerchief which he thought was his, but Mrs. Willoughby said it was her husband's. I do not believe he claimed any bottles that were not his.</p>

            . I have been employed by the prosecutor as his professional adviser, for about two years. I never saw him irritated till to day, and I always considered him fully competent to manage business - he was not in such a state of mind as to give away his property, and not know what he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not the prisoner lived with the Colonel as a servant? A. Yes. I have not heard that the Colonel was at any time in a state of derangement. He keeps a tilbury, and I believe the prisoner has driven it, but I am not certain. I am not aware that the Colonel kept any other male servant.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had the prosecutor under his care at a private mad-house, kept by Mr. Rumball, at Stanmore, and upon the prosecutor leaving that establishment he engaged the prisoner as a groom, and at different times gave him the articles in question.</p>

            . I am a medical man. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150020"></xptr>The prosecutor applied to me in 1823, in consequence of an advertisement which I inserted in the papers - he was with me about twelve months - he was a short time under some restraint in a strait waistcoat; I believe twice, for a week each time - he had occasional aberations, not quite so violent. The prisoner was the principal person I had to assist me. It is customary for persons in the situation in which the Colonel was, to be sometimes extremely kind, and sometimes the reverse. I certainly never turned the prisoner out of my house so destitute that he had need of clothes - he left me of his own accord, without notice. - His dress was not such as any gentleman need have been ashamed of seeing him in his house. I believe the Colonel had given him a pair of boots while he was in my service. I should not be surprised at persons who have been in such a situation as the Colonel, being subject to occasional excesses of kindness and unkindness.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did not the prosecutor come voluntarily to your house in consequence of an advertisement? A. Yes, he did. I considered him sane about two months before he left me - I had called in another medical gentleman to give his opinion as to the state of his mind, who agreed with me that he was sane. He would sometimes drink a little too much, and be a little violent. I have had opportunities of seeing him since he left my house, in consequence of his raising persecution against me. This letter is my writing (looking at it.) but I do not know whether I wrote it before the prisoner left me to go into the Colonel's service or not. I believe I still owe the Colonel some money - he was to be with me at ninety guineas a year, and it was raised to one hundred, including washing, and I do not consider it was too much, because during part of the time he was very violent. Part of the time he was with me his friends paid me, but when he got better I considered him capable of managing his own affairs. I received at one time, I think, 50 l. from him, and a day or two before he left me he offered me another sum of money, which I would not accept of, and he was offended with me for it; the prisoner had a good situation with me. I wrote these words in that letter, that</p>
               <p>"I would not suffer Colonel Roberts to be ignorant that Edward was a deserter of the worst description," and I repeat them now. I do not know whether the Colonel is likely to do things and forget them - he would while he was in my house. I have seen nothing to day which indicates a want of memory.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 21st of Dec., between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was at work on a new building in Cambridge-street, Isling<lb></lb>ton—I saw the prisoner—he was not at work there—he came into the back yard of the building—I said, "Well, mate, you hare been drinking!"—he said, "No, I have not "—he took a scaffold board off the ledge of the premises—he put it on his shoulder, and carried it away—I followed him* and Saw him stopped by a policeman—I did not know at the time whose it was—he appeared to have been drinking, but knew what he was about.</p>

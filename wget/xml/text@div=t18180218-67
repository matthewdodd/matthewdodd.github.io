            . I live next door to Mr. Cassanet-my back-yard communicates with his. On the 31st of January, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in at my back-door with the bag of copper, and asked me to get somebody to help her to carry it to Hatton-garden, as her mistress sent her to pay it away, and she would pay the porter out of her own pocket, as it was heavy, and she did not wish her mistress to think her lazy - I told her my son should take it. She went back again, and returned with a bundle, which had halfpence in it. I chinked it, and said, there was copper in it. She said she was going to pay the baker, and asked if my son was ready? I did not think all was right, and took the bag in to Mr. Cassanet-when I returned, she had escaped with the bundle.</p>
               <p>THOMAS VANN. I am an officer. I examined the box. It appeared to have been forced with some instrument like a poker. She told me she opened the box with the poker, and took the bag of copper out.</p>

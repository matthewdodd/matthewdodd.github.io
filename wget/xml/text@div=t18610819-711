                  </hi>. I am employed in the Arsenal as store-keeper, and live at Union-street, Woolwich—I was at the Gun public-house on 27th July, and saw the prisoner there between 7 and 8 o'clock, I think; I cannot say exactly—she was served with a glass of peppermint by James, the barman he is not here—she paid with a half-crown—the barman took it up, looked, at it, and told her immediately that it was bad—she said that she did not know it and would go and get change, and she went out of the house—I saw her about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after she went out, a little way from the house, standing in the road talking to an elderly female—I saw her pass something to the female, and the, female took something from a bag she was carrying and passed it to her—I do not know what it was—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what I saw I went to the Oak public-house and saw the elder woman there—she called for half-a-quartern of port wine and paid with a; half-crown, which the barmaid put in the till—I do not know whether it was good or bad—I asked the landlady afterwards to look at it, as I thought it was bad—I saw the landlady give it to the policeman, Wilkinson—I do not know whether it was the same half-crown; I could not swear that it was.</p>

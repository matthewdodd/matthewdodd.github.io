               <p>Q. What was you doing there. - A. I was buying a pair of breeches which I gave eighteen pence for, I took out a tin box which I had five shillings in to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of the prisoner being by and saw you. - A. No, not at the fair to know him. I was in the fair, I agreed to buy a waistcoat. I put my hand in my pocket to take out my box, then I missed my box.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the box. - A. There was six duplicates and three and sixpence in money. I went to Mr. Dobson's the same evening, I told him I had lost the duplicates and desired him to stop them. The next day about eleven o'clock I went to Mr. Dobson's in Chiswell street, there I saw

               <p>Q. How did you know the man was there with your property. - A. The pawnbroker sent for me. The prisoner offered me the pocket book, but the box he said he had not got with him. Mr. Dobson said I must not take it, he said I had nothing to do but to give charge of him.</p>

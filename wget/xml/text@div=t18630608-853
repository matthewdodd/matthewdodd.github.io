                  </hi>. I am a shipwright, of Charlotte-row, Rotherhithe—the deceased William John Stephens, was my brother-in-law; he was a shipwright, and about thirty years of age—on Monday evening, 18th May, we went together to Peckham to visit two sisters of mine, who are both in service in the same house—I took a parcel to them, and got there about 9 o'clock—the deceased left me there, and said he would wait for me at the Heaton Arms public-house—I joined him there at half-post 9, and we remained there till about ten minutes to 12—we had two pints of half and half and a quartern of gin between us and the landlord, and just as we were leaving we had another drop of gin, half a pint between five of us—we did not have it with water—the deceased and I were sober when we left, we went towards Rye-lane towards home—after leaving the public-house we bad just got into the middle of the roadway when we saw two men coming towards us, one on the roadway and the other on the footpath; the man in the middle of the road, who was apparently drunk, reeled between me and the deceased, who put his arm up in this manner, pushed the man away, and said, "What is your game?"—he had no sooner done so than the prisoner came off the footpath and struck the deceased with his fist on the right side of the head, somewhere close behind the ear—I did not see any weapon in his hand—the deceased reeled round with the force of the blow, and fell with his forehead on the kerb, face downwards—the kerbstone is about six inches above the road, the ordinary height—there is a sort of gutter outside it—when he was down—his head laid right on the footpath, and his body across the road—I could not say that his feet were one way or the other—the man who struck him came from the other footpath, where there is no kerb—he fell in a direction immediately away from the blow—he did not appear to save himself at all as the blow struck him; he fell like a piece of wood, and lay at full length, lifeless—I never saw him move after he fell—I said to the prisoner, "What did you do that for?"—he then struck at me, but I stepped back and avoided the blow—I then called "Police!" as loud as I could—the police answered me directly some distance off—I looked round and saw the prisoner and his companion standing about ten yards off—when they heard the police answer they ran off in the direc<lb></lb>tion of the Rye—that was the last I saw of them at that time—a policeman came up and assisted me to take the deceased to the horse-trough, where I bathed his head with water, but it was of no use—I ran for a doctor, but he was not at home; I came back—we got the deceased into a cab and drove him to Dr. Griffiths, who pronounced him dead, and we took him to Camberwell workhouse—I saw no blood coming from the bruise; there were two slight scratches, as if done by a grit stone—I went to the station and gave a description of the two men, and then went with the police in search of them—we went over the Rye into some garden-ground, and in a water-closet found the man who was apparently drunk in the road—I did not see the prisoner that night—the deceased gave the prisoner no provo<lb></lb>cation except pushing him on one side, and saying, "What is your game?"—I only saw one blow.</p>

I am coachman at Napier Lodge, Rye-lane—I know the Heaton Arms and the Little Wonder beer-house—the Heaton Arms is exactly opposite my window, and I can also see the Little Wonder—there is fifty yards between the two—on 18th May, about 12 at night, I was at my window which looks into the street, and saw two men come out of the Heaton Arms—one of them was singing, and two men came out of the Little Wonder—they met each other, and were calling to one another in a friendly manner like, <hi rend="italic">"Yah, hoo</hi>," or something like that—they came along towards my window, which is on the side with the pavement—I saw Upston go back again—he like passed them and then returned, and there were some slight words between them; with that I saw another person come up dressed In light clothes—he spoke a few words to the others, I could not hear what, but I could hear talking, and there was fighting—a few minutes after<lb></lb>wards I heard Upston say, "Not two to one; that is not fair"—with that, knowing Upston, I went down to my door, with the intention of persuading him to go home—I met him and the person in white clothes, who I recog<lb></lb>nise an the prisoner—I knew him before, and be said, "Don't know me Charley"—I said, "why do not you go home?" and with that they ran down the lane, not towards the Rye, but a private lane adjoining my house—my door is on the side—at that time I saw something like a person sitting, and a person standing, on the pavement—I only saw four men—it was after Bampton left the pavement that the fighting took place.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a surgeon, residing at Fulham—on Monday night, 18th May, or rather, Tuesday morning, at a quarter to 1, I was called to see a man in a cab—he had a large bruise, the size of half an ordinary orange, on the centre of his forehead, and there were abrasions on the bridge and apex of his nose, and on his lip and chin—they might have arisen from a fall on a kerb-stone, or some hard substance—he was quite cold—I gave my opinion that he had been dead full half an hour, and ordered him to be sent to the workhouse—an inquest was held; and, by the Coroner's direction, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem examination</hi>—I found blood ex<lb></lb>travasated between the skin and the frontal bone under where the bruise existed; and on removing the upper part of the skull, and examining it from within, I found the frontal bone fractured, split through vertically downwards at the internal angle of the left orbit, through the roof of the left orbit as far as the centre of the base of the brain—it was a very extensive fracture as regards its length—it extended almost directly back<lb></lb>wards to the back of the skull, to the sphenoid bone—I do not think that would kill him at once—I think he died from the shock to the brain; he died from concussion of the brain, produced by the force which produced the fracture—the force would cause great concussion of the brain, which would produce immediate insensibility—this fracture might have been caused by a fall on a kerb-stone—I should judge from what I saw, that the man died without an effort to save himself—a blow struck with great violence behind the ear, might disable a man on the instant, fell him, and he might be utterly unable to help himself—supposing he fell from his feet to the pavement without any external violence, it would not be very likely to produce such an extensive fracture as that—I am not prepared to say that behind the ear is the most dangerous place in which a man could be struck; the bone is rather harder there; but if you go a little above, the bone is thinner, and you would have a greater concussion—I am not prepared to say that a heavy blow behind the ear is more likely to cause concussion than any other part, or to point to any particular part of the head where a blow would produce the most effect—I found the other organs healthy—he was a healthy man.</p>

We went back, and asked them what they meant, and Cadman buttoned up his coat, and pretty nearly pushed me down. I went up to him, and we sparred, and he and I had two or three rounds in the road; Cadman and I. We were hugging each other against the wall, and Stephens was coming up. I pushed him, and he reeled against the wall, and down he fell. My head began bleeding, and then I went away.</p>

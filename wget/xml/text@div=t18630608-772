                  </hi>.—In consequence of information, I went, about 7 o'clock on Saturday morning, 23d May, with other officers, to 5, Little Pancras-street—I found the street door open—it is a lodging-house—the prisoner has two rooms there—we went to the first floor, found the door closed, broke it open, and found the prisoner there in bed—I said to him, "Well, Mr. Horton, I have received instructions from the Solicitor to the Mint to endeavour to put a stop to your very extensive dealings in counterfeit coin"—he said, "What do you mean? What do you want? Who sent you?"—I said, "We come here with a search warrant, granted by the Magistrate, to search your place for counterfeit coin"—I called Leather's attention to some white metal which I saw amongst the cinders under the stove—some time after, Fyfe brought me this bag, containing seven florins and five shil<lb></lb>lings, separately wrapped in paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner then became very excited, and said, "Perhaps the scoundrel who sent you here served me with them"—he afterwards expressed a wish to go up stairs—I said, "What is it you want from up stairs? you shall go up presently"—he said, "I. want my coat"—he then all of a sudden rushed up stairs—I followed him—he got into the room before me, and I saw Sergeant Elliott struggling with him for the possession of a coat—Elliott put his hand in the breast pocket and pulled out a paper packet—the prisoner said, "I never put them there—the packet contained eight counterfeit shillings, wrapped in paper—a narrow staircase leads from the room we found the prisoner in bed into the upper room, where the children were—the prisoner saw Elliott go up stairs.</p>

I went with Brannan and other officers to the house where the prisoner lodged—on 23d May he was in the first floor front room—I went through that room to the second floor, and found three children lying on the floor on a bed—I found about 200 different articles, all new, in small packets, stationery, cotton, tape, sugar, fronts of bonnets, and something of every description. Mr. Brannan called to me, and said I should find a coat there, and to throw it down, as the pri<lb></lb>soner particularly wanted it—I found a coat on the back of a chair in the room—I was taking it up, when the prisoner came up and attempted to get it from me—Brannan followed him up—I searched the coat, and in the breast pocket I found a paper packet, which I handed to Brannan—he opened it, and found eight counterfeit shillings—I then went down stairs to the first-floor room—I fetched a purse off the mantelpiece up stairs, at the prisoner's request, which contained 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in good money.</p>

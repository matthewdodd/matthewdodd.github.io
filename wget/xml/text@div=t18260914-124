               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up Earl-street, and this woman came up and said to a boy, that was with her,"Now, which is the boy, I will give you a shilling to pick him out."</p>
               <p>MRS. JONES re-examined. Q. Had you a boy with you? - A. I ran out after the prisoner, but lost sight of him; I went out that evening and found where he lived with two girls; he was quite alone; I found a boy, who was one of his acquaintance, and told him I would give him a shilling to tell me when he came home; the prisoner had been in my house several times; and I knew the other knew him.</p>

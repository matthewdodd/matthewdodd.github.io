                  </hi>. I live in Sydney-street, Mile-end, and am a cabinet-maker. I have known the prisoner about seven mouths—his son is apprenticed to me—on the 12th of December, the prisoner came to me, and said he had a shipping order for my description of articles—he men<lb></lb>tioned several articles—I believed that he had such an order—as he was going away, he saw a table in my shop, and said he thought that table would suit the persons he had the order for—I let him have it to show them, and if not approved, it was to be returned—he asked what would be the price, and I said 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (the retail price would be 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—I have seen the table since at Mr. Macrow's, and I know it to be mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It was to have been included with the remainder of the order—he told me he would send five more, and this would be six. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, he felt about his pockets, and said he had left the order at home—he said he wished to show this table to a gentleman in the City—it was about six o'clock, or a little after.</p>

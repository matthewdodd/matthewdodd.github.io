                  </hi>. I am foreman to Robert Richardson, a bootmaker in Tunbridge-place, New-road. On the morning of the 4th of October I put a hamper of boots and shoes outside master's house—the prisoner came to the door, looked at several boots, and asked the price of them—it was soon after ten o'clock—they were all too dear for her—I went into the shop to fetch another hamper out, and she took a pair of boots and put them under her shawl—I received information, and came out and asked her for them—she took them from her shawl and gave them to me—she was about ten yards from the shop—she said she was going to take them home to fit them, and if they fitted her she should bring the money back.</p>

            , No. 16, Hart-street, Bloomsbury; I asked how much there was of it; he said about six or seven yards - I asked how much he gave for it - he said 2s. 6d. a yard - that it was his own, and he had bought it at East Grinstead, about a month ago - that he had been there three months. He said, "Why don't you think it is mine?" - I said, "No; I will send my boy to Hart-street;" he said he would go with him: I told him to wait there; he went to the door - I followed, and brought him back - he then said he lived at No. 16, Holborn, which I found was true. The silk measures thirty-five yards.</p>

                  </hi>., I am a labouring man, and live in Collingwood-street, Woolwich. On Friday night, 26th Dec., I was at Astley's theatre—I left it about 12 o'clock—I went into a pie shop, and then into a public house just below the railroad bridge in the Westminster-road—the prisoner came in while I was there—I stood there drinking—I said I had no conveyance home, and I should have to take lodgings in London till the morning—the prisoner said she would show me where I could get a lodging—I went with her—she took me to a house, and up stairs—I do not know the name of the place—I could not see anything, it was dark—I beard some one on the bed—I said I was not going to stop in that place—the prisoner turned her back to the door, and said if I offered to move out of the place she would break my head with a candlestick—the other one then spoke, and</p>

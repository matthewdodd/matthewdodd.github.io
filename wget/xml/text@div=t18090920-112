             was with her when she laid hold of me; Sullivan was in the same house where they went to; Ellis and Butler were the only persons that laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did they take you - A. Not above ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. So then they dragged you, a poor helpless creature, such a young man as you, ten yards up Dyot-street - why do not you, when you tell the story, tell the truth - did not you go with them - A. I went along with Butler up stairs into a little room; this was about twelve o'clock; we went up stairs together, there were two beds in the room, and Butler and Ellis were in the room, Sullivan was in a room close by; I had my watch in my pocket, and my money; I asked Sullivan if I could be safe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay with the women - A. I had not been there ten minutes before I missed my watch and my money; when I missed my money I alarmed the watch; I accused Butler with having my money she said she had not got it, nor the watch. Ellis was gone out; I gave charge of Butler to the patrol, he searched her, he found Ellis at a cook's shop just by. Butler stopped with me; he brought Ellis to me and searched her; we found some money, but not the watch or note; there was a shilling found which I had given me in change at the King's Head; it was a remarkable shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What watch was it - A. A silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you about you when you came out of Coventry-court - A. I had a good deal of silver, to the amount of a dozen shillings, and halfpence, and a one pound bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against Sullivan - A. No further than she was the person that said I might be safe in the place.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober - A. He had been drinking; he seemed collected. He told me he had been robbed; he had lost his watch and two pound in money; he took me to a house in Phoenix-yard, it is a shocking place; I went up stairs with him into a room where there were two beds; he pointed out the bed which he had been sitting upon; I turned down the clothes, I picked up a one pound note, I gave it him; I found

             some time after, I took her in custody; I left her in custody with him; I found Butler two hours afterwards in a room at another part of the house. The prosecutor claimed a shilling that I had of Mrs. Leonard, at the cook's shop.</p>
               <p>Butler's Defence. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, I met this man by the Maidenhead public house, he asked me to have a glass of liquor, I said if he liked; he treated me. He said it was very late, could I get him a bed; I told him I could not get him a decent bed, he said he did not care what bed it was, he was tired, he said he would give me two shillings to sleep with me, he would give me more money in the morning, I said I could not sleep with him for that. I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Ellis's Defence. I was not near the place since nine o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>Sullivan was not put on her defence.</p>

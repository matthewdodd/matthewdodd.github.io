Hammersley, in favour of myself; I got it cashed, I received a 10l. note, two five pound notes, and a one; on Saturday I changed the two five pound notes for a ten pound, for a friend; I afterwards took out the one pound note and put in a two pound note; I had occasion to leave town on particular business, suddenly, on the Saturday, and I put the notes somewhere, I do not exactly recollect where; on Tuesday I had occasion for the notes, I looked round the house but could not find them; it continued in that way till last Saturday, when Mr. Dibdin came to town; the prisoner was a <rs id="t17980523-23-deflabel126" type="occupation">chair-woman</rs>

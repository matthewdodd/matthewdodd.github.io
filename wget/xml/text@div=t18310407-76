The prisoner was in my employ for the last twelve months, and for the last few months he slept in my house - my wife was confined about a month before he was taken, and in consequence of that he slept in my room; on Sunday night, the 20th of February, his bed and mine were about half a yard from each other, but he put his clothes on one side of his bed, and I mine on the other side - on the Monday morning I got up about half-past six o'clock, and between eight and nine I examined my trousers pockets, and then found but 14s. 6d. in them - I knew I had 16s. 6d. in them the night before; I had taken 3s. or 4s. that morning, so that I should have had about 1l. in my pocket; in consequence of this, I marked fifteen or sixteen penny-pieces, which I put into a desk in my room below, with some others - there were 4s. worth put up in shilling piles, and five over, all penny-pieces - seventeen of them were marked; four in cash of the shilling piles, and one in the 5d.; I locked my desk, put the key into my pocket, and the next morning, between six and seven o'clock, I went to it again - I found it locked; the key of the room in which the desk was had been in my sister-in-law's possession; the door had been double locked that night - on opening the desk I missed fifteen or sixteen penny-pieces, and five or six of them were those I had marked; the prisoner could not have got to that room in the night, but in the daytime he frequently had his meals there; he could not have got the key of the desk; I never left it unlocked - when I missed the money, I sent for Mr. Wayling, the officer; he searched the prisoner, found some copper money on him, and among the rest three penny-pieces, which I could swear to - he also found some silver, and eight sovereigns on him; I have a stable to my house; I saw the officer find some copper between the joists and the brick-work, and among them two which I could speak to, as I had marked them - the prisoner was almost always in that stable; I allowed him 4s. a week with board and lodging; he could not have saved these eight sovereigns - I suppose I have lost 40l. in all; I have lost form 1s. 6d. to 8s. or 10s. a day; when the prisoner had been with me some months, he purchased a seal of me, for which he was go give me a guinea, and he agreed to pay me 1s. a week; he paid me the first week, and the second week he gave me a sovereign; I asked where he got it, and he said some person had paid him some money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Who kept the key of the room the desk was in? A. My sister-in-law, but I kept the key of the desk; the prisoner used to go out with my horse and cart, and carry out goods - he very rarely paid money for me; I do not know that he ever did - he has received money; my desk has not been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070051"></xptr>left open for three or four months, as I had lost so much money - I think no one but the prisoner and myself had access to the stable; it was not locked, but no one could go to it without going through the shop.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You did not put the penny-pieces on the rafters? A. No.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-constable. I went with Mr. Cox to his house on the 22nd of February; I took the prisoner into custody - I went into the stable, and there told him to empty his pockets, and produce what he had about him; he pulled out two half-crowns, a sixpence, and six penny-pieces - three of them had a cross on the head, as Cox had described to me before I got to the house; I asked the prisoner how he came by them, and he said he had taken them at different public-houses, but he could not tell where - I then asked if he had any thing else about him; he said No, but I searched, and found a small lump in some black stuff - I found in it eight sovereigns; he said they were what he had saved from his wages - I then searched the stable, and on one of the rafters I found a watch; I asked if that was his - he said Yes, and alongside the watch I found ten penny-pieces: I asked if they were his - he said they were, and two of them were marked as Mr. Cox had described; I asked the prisoner how he got them - he said at different public-houses; I then searched his box, and found plenty of good clothes, another watch, and a new dressing-case, which I am confident cost 30s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did his master claim the dressing-case or the sovereigns? A. No. I found plenty of keys on the prisoner, but none that fitted the desk - I had to hunt to find the penny-pieces; he made no hesitation in producing the sovereigns.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. COX. Q. Did you mark these penny-pieces yourself? A. Yes, in the presence of my sister - they are all marked in the same way, with a cross; they have been in the possession of the officer ever since he took them: I can safely take my oath this is the money I marked - I never paid the prisoner any money that I had marked; I never marked any before - they were all marked on the head side, but I have not had them since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What money did you miss from the desk? A.Sixteen penny-pieces, I think.</p>

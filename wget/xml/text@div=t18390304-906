                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Evans, a haberdasher, in Crown-street, Finsbury. On the 12th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the shop, near the door, and saw the prisoner come into the shop, reach his arm as far as he could, and pull down some handkerchiefs which were fixed against the door—be broke two strings and the bell-wire, to which they were fastened, for the purpose of detecting any one, as we had lost several things in the tame way—my husband was writing at the counter, and my son, George Marshall, was in the shop also; but I being on the outside of the counter, ran to the door first, and saw the prisoner drop the handkerchiefs inside the shop—he did not take them out—my ton went in pursuit of him, and brought him back in a very few minutes—he is the person.</p>

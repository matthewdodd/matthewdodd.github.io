               <p>How long had they left you before Mr. Evans came to you? - I do not know; it might be fifteen or twenty minutes; there was some little interval, but certainly they are the two men that were at my house.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - Francis had a white surtout coat over a jacket seemingly, and the other had a soldier's jacket seemingly, as he has now; they had drank three half pints of gin as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Court. What! the two men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had they any thing with them? - I did not observe any thing.</p>

               <p>Why you seem to treat that as of course? - No, but it happened to be the case then.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder that these robberies are so frequent! what is the charge of three half pints of gin? - Three fourpences; my servant is not here.</p>

               <p>I am a soldier, I live in Queen-Ann-street; I know the prisoners; I know this great coat and watch; on Saturday, the 22d of December, the two prisoners at the bar, and Malpas, a soldier, who is an evidence, and me, were all four drinking together in Pye-street, at the Red-Lion, we went from there to the Horse Guards Cellar, and had several pots of beer together about half past seven I was sitting by the fire, and Green came in, with his regimental coat on his arm, says he, I wish you would lend me your coat a little; says I, for what? that was this jacket I have on; it was his regimental coat he had on his arm, accordingly I pulled off my jacket and hat, and gave it to him, and his coat and hat laid there for an hour and half; he put on my hat and jacket, and left his own on the bench; he staid there till a quarter after nine; I saw no more of him; Green and Francis went out together; I do not know what became of them; I never saw them any more that night; Malpas staid with me till a quarter after nine; my wife fetched me home; it was five when we came into the Horse Guards; it was between seven and eight when he went out; I went home, and went to bed immediately about nine; the next morning, about two o'clock, (I live in the one pair of stairs backwards) there was a knocking at the door by Green; the landlord came and called me, I got up immediately, and went down, and Green was there with Howarth, who is a witness here; Green asked me if I had seen Francis; I told him no; I went and shut the door immediately, and went up stairs to bed again; I did not let them in; about five in the morning Francis came, and the landlady came up and told me, I went down in my shirt, and he asked me if Green had been there? I said he had; he asked me if I knew where he was? I said I did not; he asked me to get up, and have something to drink, accordingly I did, and we went to look for Green, and found him in Howarth's apartments, in the same street; he was asleep, we opened the door, and Howarth got up, and let us in, and Green was awake when we came into the room, and he spoke to Francis, and asked him how he could use him so ill the night before, for his shirt was tore as if he had been fighting, or something of that kind. Green got out of bed, and put on his things, and Francis had on that great coat that lays there, to the best of my recollection, which coat was found afterwards in my box, and Green had on Francis's brown great coat, to the best of my recollection, and Francis took his own coat off the bed and put it on, and took the great coat off, and we all four came down stairs together; Francis had his coat on his arm when we came down, and he said, we will go and have a pot of beer together; and he gave me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090008"></xptr>coat, and said, I will be obliged to you if you will put that in your room till I call for it; we went and drank two or three pots of beer, and stopped at the public house, which was the Angel, in Tothill-street, then from thence to another house in the Broad-way, Westminster, and had two or three more pots, then we came to the George and Bell, in St. Ann's-street near where I live, they went up to my room to have some breakfast, in the mean while I was toasting some toast at the fire, Green and Francis had a watch in their hands, which I believe that to be it; they had it in their hands looking at it; they called me, and asked me if I would put that by with the great coat, and take care of it till Monday morning, that they would call for it.</p>
               <p>Which of them called to you? - I cannot say, but I believe it was Francis; I immediately took them, and put them in my box, and locked the box, and put the key in my pocket; after that Francis wanted a shirt and stockings washed; I told him I would not let my wife do it being Sunday; he said, will you lend me one of yours? I did so; and he took half a guinea out of his pocket, and said, if I do not return them, you may take pay out of that for them; after that we all went out together; I called on Malpas at his house; Howarth and Francis went on to go down to Tothill-fields; I went up and called Malpas out of bed, and me and Green, and Malpas, came and found Francis and Howarth at a house joining to Tothill-fields, that they call the Blue-coat-boy; he ordered in a can of beer into the gaol, and we sat there till it was all drank; when we came from there, we had a glass a piece at that public-house, and then we parted; I was ordered for a regiment party on the Monday morning, I was getting my things ready to march, and just as I was getting into bed the constables came; the watch and great coat I had from Green and Francis, I put into my box, I put in no other.</p>

               <p>What did he want at Parsons's? - I cannot say; nothing passed only what I said; he desired him to go home.</p>
               <p>Did he ask for any body, or any thing thing there? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what he said to Parsons? - He did not say any thing particular, only wished to come in, and Parsons wished him to go to his lodgings; I took him to my lodging, where he staid all night; in the morning came Francis and Parsons between five and six, and knocked at my door; and I asked first who it was; they answered it was Parsons, he wanted to speak to me; I asked what he wanted; he said, is not Green here? I said yes; he is asleep in bed; I let him in and awaked Green, and he got up and dressed himself; both Parsons and Green came in, and we went out to the Angel in Tothill-street, and there we had two or three pots of beer, and at several different public-houses, and had some beer, or one thing or other, from that we went back again to Parson's room, there we had breakfast; after that we went down to Tothill-fields.</p>
               <p>When you was at breakfast, did any thing particular pass? - Nothing in particular passed.</p>
               <p>How was Francis dressed when he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090009"></xptr>to your room that morning? - I could not perceive; we had no light, I struck a light; there were some clothes changed, but I cannot say what they were.</p>
               <p>When you saw him in the light, had Green the great coat on you saw him in over night? - No, he had a jacket on; Francis had the great coat; I did not perceive any thing else; I never saw any coat at all.</p>
               <p>Look at that coat? - That coat was not there; I did not see that coat.</p>
               <p>Was you there the whole time of breakfast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What had you for breakfast? - Tea.</p>
               <p>What had you to eat? - Only bread and butter, and tea, that was all.</p>
               <p>Nothing else? - No.</p>
               <p>No toast? - I believe there was something toasted, but I do not recollect who toasted it; I eat nothing but bread and butter.</p>
               <p>When they were at breakfast, did you see any thing pass between Francis and the other men? - Yes, I saw Green, and Francis, and Parsons, looking at a watch at the window.</p>
               <p>What became of that watch? - Green gave it to Parsons to take care of.</p>
               <p>Was any thing else given to Parsons to take care of? - No, I heard nothing said, but only give it to him to take care of it; then we went to different public houses and had some liquor to drink, and we went to Tothill-fields.</p>
               <p>Who paid for the beer there? - I do not recollect, I did not see any paid for; I paid for none.</p>
               <p>Court. Who were the people that changed clothes at your lodgings? - Francis and Green; Green had the great coat on, that I believe to be Francis's; Francis put it on; it was a great brown coat, an oldish coat to my thinking.</p>
               <p>What under-coat had Green under that? - He had a red jacket under the great coat; when he was dressed in the morning, he had only a red jacket, not a regimental coat; I never saw any coat he had there, only a jacket.</p>
               <p>So then Green gave

             a great coat; did he? - He did not give it him; he laid his clothes on the bed, when he went to bed; and when the light was struck, he saw his clothes, and put them on.</p>
               <p>Why did he have the red jacket on; did you see Green put it on? - I cannot say, it might be his own; I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it the red jacket that Green went out in that morning, after he left your lodgings? - I did not see them change any clothes.</p>

               <p>What else did he say to you? - Nothing in particular.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him why you should go to Bow-street? - He said he was in company with him, and he heard he was in trouble, and he wanted to know what was become of him.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to say this was all that passed? - I asked him if there was any thing the matter; and he said no; that was all that he said to me.</p>

               <p>You know you was examined at Bow-street, and there it was taken down? - He said there was something in Parsons's room, and if it was not removed, Parsons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090010"></xptr>and his wife, if they were taken, would be done; I asked him what it was; he said it was nothing to me, or to him; that was all that passed.</p>

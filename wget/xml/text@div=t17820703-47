             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a midwife? - Yes. I was fetched on the 26th of May, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, by Mr. Wicks, the constable, who said I was wanted to a labour. When I came to White's-alley, I met the prisoner's mother coming out at the door. She turned back, and said the child was up three pair of stairs. I went up. There lay the child, dead, wrapped up in a dirty coarse apron. There was a mark under the throat, like two fingers and a thumb, and the thumb-nail had rather scratched it. I took it to the work-house. I did not see the mother till the afternoon. I washed it in the afternoon. I was fetched about five o'clock. There I saw the mother of it.</p>
               <p>How did you know she was the mother of it? - I knew she was the mother of a child, that she had been lately delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it was that child? - She acknowledged it. I asked her whether it was born alive. She said she would not say. I asked her if she had pinched it, in helping herself. She said she did not help herself at all.</p>
               <p>Might this have happened in the delivering herself? - It might have happened in that way; that made me ask her that question.</p>
               <p>I suppose she was just brought to the work-house? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a surgeon, and live in Chancery-lane? - I am.</p>
               <p>You saw this child afterwards? - I did.</p>
               <p>You examined it, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of violence upon it? - There was the appearance of a bruise on the forehead, and on each side of the windpipe.</p>
               <p>What do you think was the occasion of that child's death? - The naval string was torn off, at a few inches distance from the belly of the child; it seemed to be torn, and not cut.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken, do you believe this child got her death by violence? - I am not clear in it. It might happen, if the mother was delivered on the vault, by the child's falling, the naval string might break. I examined the lungs of the child; it was plain, by the appearance of them, that the child had lived.</p>
               <p>I don't understand that that is a certain sign of the child's having been born alive? - If there are no signs of putrefaction.</p>
               <p>You will not take upon you to say that this child received its death by violence from any person? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. I have understood that that experiment upon the lungs has of late been held not to be conclusive: in one way, it has been held to be conclusive, if the lungs sink; but not to be conclusive, if they float: it is a common experiment, and, in that case, gives a degree of probability; if the lungs sink, it is conclusive? - Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030036"></xptr>But I understand the floating of the lungs may be occasioned by other circumstances, than that of being inflated. The bruises upon the forehead, you say, might be occasioned by the fall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the bruises upon the neck, you think, might be caused by the woman, in the agony of child-birth, endeavouring to free herself from the child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I did not know that I was so near my time, or I should not have gone to such a place; but I never intended to do the child any injury.</p>

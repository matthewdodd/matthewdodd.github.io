On Wednesday, 15th Aug., I went to No. 21, Spring-street—I went by myself—Mr. Watts asked me to go and ask for the rent—he did not give me any paper—I asked Mr. and Mrs. Browning for the amount of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for rent due to Mr. Watts, jun.—they said they did not owe that, and that Mr. Watts, jun. owed Mr. Browning money for tailoring—Mrs. Browning said that—I said, "If Mr. Watts, jun. owes you any money, Mr. Watts, sen. will pay all his debts"—I sent for Mr. Watts, sen. to ask him whether he would pay it—he came in about twenty minutes before I left the room—Mrs. Browning immediately began abusing him—she called him an old scamp, and said that he had drawn blood from her—she went to the street door and called, "Police"—I went and shut it, and she said that her agreement was to have the street door kept open—when she came back into the room nothing took place beyond altercation by words—she called him an old scamp, or words to that effect—after that I came away—I heard her say that he had drawn blood from her—I saw her husband come and hold her back not to make a disturbance—he took hold of her and held her back—she was trying to get at Mr. Watts—he was only talking and arguing—he used no violence whatever from first to last—he did not put his fist in her face, or touch her nose, while I was there—if he had done anything to her finger or thumb I must have seen it—I left with Mr. Watts—we all came out of the passage together—I do not suppose I was in the house ten minutes after that—I left Mr. Watts there—Mr. Knapp was there and Mr. Target—there was an elderly female in the room—I did not see her before the Magistrate—I do not remember that there was any other man there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were not at all violent, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the least; I was quite cool—I wanted the rent settled—they might have fancied I was angry—I did not go into the room—the door stood open, and I went into the doorway—I did not call Mrs. Browning a liar that day—the day I went for my rent I got grossly insulted, and Mr. Browning threatened to kick me out of the place—he said something about owing him money, and I said I would rather he did not tell me a lie—I do not know that I said I would pay it, I was in duty bound to pay it—I was there when the police was called—Mrs. Browning called the police at the door—the police came not long after—I did not hear what she said to the police<lb></lb>man—the policeman sent for me—I did not hear him desire her to get a warrant—he said he had an order to take me in charge—I said if he had he had better take me—he did not take me—I have never said anything to the prisoner about the evidence she had given in my son's case—I never said to her that she was trying to swear my son's life away—I swear that—I never said that I would be one with her, and have her up for perjury—I never uttered such a thing—my son was charged here at the last Session with murder—the prisoner was a witness on that trial, and had been before the Magistrate—I knew that she was to be a witness at the trial last Session—Mr. Foley was the attorney who conducted my son's defence—he is also the attorney for this prosecution—I have instructed him—I instructed him to prefer a bill last Session—I first applied to the police court for a summons against her for perjury—Mr. Foley did not advise me to do that—the Court did not grant me a summons; they gave me a certificate, and advised me to prefer an indictment—I did not apply to the same Magistrate who heard the case—it was at the same Court—I knew myself that I might prefer an indictment against her—the bill was found last Session, the day before my son's trial—I could not get it before, because the Jury was not sitting—no one told me to say that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor. I know Mr. Browning, the prisoner's husband—on the day in question I was in Mr. Browning's room—I was not there immediately preceding the affair—the first I saw of it was two or three men endeavouring to force their entrance into Mrs. Browning's room, and she was endeavouring to keep them back—she had previous to that been struck, I should say ten minutes previously—she was bleeding at the time—I did not see the blow struck—it was struck previous to my coming in—I saw the blood on her finger, or thumb—it had been torn—it was a scratch—I advised her not to take the law into her own hands, but to seek pro<lb></lb>tection from a Magistrate—there was not a great deal of blood from her thumb—it was a tear, I should think, half an inch long—I saw the blood flowing from the thumb—I saw it drop on the ground—I heard Mr. Watts use a great deal of violent language—he demanded his rent—a policeman was sent for—I advised him to be sent for—I believe the daughter went for him—I saw Mr. Watts draw, or try to draw, Mrs. Browning out of her room—she was standing in the passage at the time, near the door—I am quite satisfied that I saw her thumb cut, and blood flowing from it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a pool of blood on the floor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; spots, not particularly large spots—I should say I saw three or four spots—it was sufficient to say that she had been torn—Mr. Watts was there when I went there, inciting the people to force their entrance into the room—there were several people there, I should say four or five—Mr. Watts was there, in the passage—the men were endeavouring to force their entrance—I was then in the room—I and Mrs. Browning prevented them forcing their way in—I endeavoured to keep them out, because I considered she was being very much ill used—nobody struck her but Mr. Watts, to my knowledge—she had been struck previous to my going in—I did not force my way into the room—I knocked at the door, and it was opened by some person inside—I can<lb></lb>not say who it was—it was a man—I had been in there about ten minutes before I saw Mr. Watts use this violence—there had been a great deal of disturbance before I went in—the first thing I saw when I went in was Mrs. Browning standing in the room, in a very agitated state—I did not pass Mr. Watts and the rest of the people to get into the room—I believe Mr. Watts was behind one or two more that were in the passage—I had to go through a portion of the passage to get to the room—I did not go through the whole passage—I did not pass Mr. Watts—he was in the passage—the door is in the centre of the passage—I passed the one that opened the door—I have no doubt he was one that was forcing his way into the room—there were two or three in the room—Mr. Browning was there, and a man of the name of Lee—I was not before the Magistrate—I have not been in Court to-day, I have been outside—I was not subpoenaed here to-day—I was not told to come here—I came voluntarily—I told the prisoner's attorney, Mr. Henning, that I had seen the affray—I saw him this morning, when I came down to the Court—I am a tailor—Mr. Browning is a tailor—I merely called there on this day—we call on one another occasionally—this morning was the first time I mentioned to anybody what I saw, with respect to being here—I have told it to my wife—I have not talked about it to Mr. Browning—he saw me there, and so did Mrs. Browning.</p>

                  </hi>. I know Mrs. Browning—I was in her house on this day, when Mr. Watts came with three or four more men—he came into the room, and said, "I want my rent"—Mrs. Browning said, "I have not got your rent; I don't owe you any rent, it is your son I owe it to"—he said, "I will have my rent"—and he said, "I don't owe you any rent"—he said, "You are a thundering liar"—I was not there when the other men came in—they did come in and interfere, but what they said I could not say—they were by the passage door when Mr. Watts called Mrs. Brown<lb></lb>ing "a thundering liar"—Mr. Watts came up with his two fists, and I will not say one did not touch her nose—it went close to her, he held it up to her face—he did not say anything while he was doing that—he took her by the two wrists, and dragged her out into the passage—he was very vio<lb></lb>lent indeed—Mrs. Browning was not very much agitated, she was very much hurt, and when she came in again, she had her thumb all in a gore of blood; I saw that myself—I saw the blood all about the room, and in the passage—she has the mark of the scratch still—they called the police<lb></lb>man, but I went out before he came—I called the policeman out of the window—the street door was closed, and Mr. Watts would not let any one pass in to save her—the men were in the passage when I left—I saw Barry in the room, he came in before Mr. Watts dragged Mrs. Browning to the door—I said to Mr. Browning, "That man will kill your wife, go and fetch her;" and he went to drag her back, but he could not, Watts held her so tight—I was before the Magistrate.</p>

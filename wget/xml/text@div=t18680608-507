On Saturday, 30th May, I was on duty in plain clothes in Swallow Street, Regent Street—I was in a public-house called the Goat and Stag—the female prisoner came in and asked for a glass of porter, which was a penny—I saw her give a bad shilling in pay<lb></lb>ment—the landlady tried it in the tester, and told her it was bad—she said she did not know it, and paid with a good one—I then went out and watched for her—when she came out she went up Swallow Street towards Glasshouse Street, where she joined the male prisoner, and they walked on together—at the end of the street I saw the male prisoner's hand go to her, and saw money pass—the female immediately went into a public-house, the male prisoner remained outside—she came out again and they went along Coventry Street together to Leicester Square—I got the assistance of another constable and took the prisoners—I pushed the male prisoner inside a shop and searched him—I found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wrapped in tissue paper, and one half-crown, all bad, in his left hand pocket—he had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in another pocket, and some pieces of tissue paper—this purse and a good half-crown were found on the female prisoner.</p>

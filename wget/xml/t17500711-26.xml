            . I have been abroad in his Majesty's service, and brought a little money home with me, and was going down to my mother's in the vessel the prisoner was in, which was the Robert of Lynn. I went on board at Cotton's-wharf, but did not miss my money till I came to Lynn; we failed to Tilbury Fort; the prisoner made a proposal to me to go by land to Lynn together, and wait the vessel's coming in; I consented, we walked about two miles together, I had an occasion to do a chare for myself, and the prisoner walked on before; when I had done, I walked forward, and could not find him; I went quite to Lynn, and waited there three weeks; when the vessel came in, I went to the mate, and said, what chear? he said, it is very bad chear to you, your consort has taken all your money out of your chest. I had put 46 guineas in my chest, I search'd it before the owner and his wife, all was gone. The prisoner took that opportunity to slip from me, and went back to the vessel, and demanded, in my name, the key of my chest of the owner's daughter, to whom I had given it, for her to take care of it till she saw me again at Lynn, and had taken my money away. The prisoner had given Mr.

I went to enquire after the prisoner; and by my letter which I sent, he was taken. His confession was taken in writing before a magistrate, wherein he says, he feloniously took the 46 guineas &amp;c.

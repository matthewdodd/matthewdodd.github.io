             MORGAN. I am a constable, and was with Thorogood; I watched the prisoner, who was at the corner of Sweeting's-rents - she came back to the corner, as if to look towards the biscuit-shop; (the man was discharged by the Magistrate;) when she crossed the road I said, "I want you," and I saw her put something into her left hand - I said,</p>
               <p>"You have something in your hand;" she said,</p>
               <p>"No, I have not;" I took hold of her hand, and took her into a house - I found this bit of rag in her hand; I asked what it contained - she said,</p>
               <p>"Money - good money to be sure;" I asked whether it was shillings or sovereigns - she said she did not know, she had found it; it contained these five shillings.</p>

            . These five shillings are all counterfeit; they are cast, and appear to be from the same mould.</p>

               <p>JURY to CHARLES THOROGOOD. Q. Did the man who went into the shop offer any bad money? A. Yes, this bad shilling.</p>

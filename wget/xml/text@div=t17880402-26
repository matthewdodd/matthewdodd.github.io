               <p>Isaacs. Parlemain was frightened at seeing the search-warrant, and denied having any thing, but afterwards produced several articles which were matched with things which the prosecutor had at home.

               <p>Parlemain to Dilworth. Did not you deal with me yourself, and did not I always give you a fair market price? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Parlemain. The metal was brought to me by a child, Dilworth was waiting by me, and received fourteen shillings for the file dust he brought; I asked the child, whether her father sent it; she said, yes; after which, Dilworth went about his business; some time after, Mr. Pinchbeck came in, and asked several questions, and then went off, and returned again with Isaacs, at which I was intimidated, not knowing their errand; being informed of their business I readily consented; they informed me they wanted a chuck; I informed my wife, I believed there was one; I searched in a basket, which I emptied on the floor, and Mr. Pinchbeck found the chuck, which he claimed.</p>

I was a good deal intoxicated at the time; on entering the room, a man with a wooden leg sat on the table. I cannot swear that it was the prisoner - a man and a woman, (who were tried here two years ago) followed us into the room. I wished to get out, thinking I was not safe; it was the general desire that I should treat all the company. I wished to go for the liquor myself, in order to get out, but was not allowed; a man stood at the door, and seeing my alarm, the wooden legged man said I owed him 3 l. - he threw me on the floor with the black woman's assistance, and took 12 l. 7 s. from my pocket, I have recovered none of it; they seized me by the neck-handkerchief, and attempted to strangle me; the man with a wooden leg asked if he should cut my throat two or three voices answered him</p>
               <p>"Do so." I was left insensible in the room - when I came to myself, I made my way down, and called the watchman.</p>

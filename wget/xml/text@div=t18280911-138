On the 3d of July, about three o'clock in the morning, my sister came into my room and requested me to get up; I dressed myself, went down stairs, and saw through the window the prisoner in the yard - he jumped on the dust-bin, and then on the wall; I opened the window, and called Watch! and Stop thief! the watchman and officers were in wait<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110091"></xptr>ing, and after a few minutes, seized him, searched him, and found my property on him; I saw it at the watch-house - I did not see him searched myself exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man you saw that night when you were alarmed? A. Quite sure, for I saw him at the watch-house, and saw him in the yard; he jumped from the yard to the dust-bin, from there to the wall, and then into some vacant ground, where he was seized - I found my house had been entered by breaking in at the back kitchen window; they had cut a square of glass, then drawn a bolt back, and got in - when I came down into the parlour I saw the lock of the sideboard was broken open all the things scattered about, and all the plate gone; I had gone to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock - every thing was then secure and safe; the prisoner was searched on the vacant ground, before he got to the watch-house - I did not see him searched; I had left the sideboard all secure - I lost property amounting to about 50l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CHURCHILL. Q. How is your house situated? A. In Finsbury-place South; I saw him in the back yard as I came down stairs; there is no gaslight in the yard; there is a vacant ground there - it was a very stormy night, which every one may remember; there was no light there - it was between two and three o'clock; I swear to the man - I did not see his face till I got to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, did you not swear you saw that prisoner? A. Yes, because I saw him in the watch-house, and he was taken coming from the premises - I saw him in the yard, and called the watch and officers.</p>
               <p>Q. What enables you to distinguish that man more than any other? A. His back was towards me when he went over the wall.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the watch. On the night in question, on going round the Circus, which is near Mr. Friedeberg's house, I was called over by the last witness, who informed me he had seen three men behind Mr. Friedeberg's house. I placed two watchmen round, and then went off to the watchhouse for assistance. I then proceeded round the corner of North Buildings, where I supposed they had got in, and staid till I got assistance, when an officer came up with a watchman - we proceeded to examine the ground - we broke open the door of a stone-mason's yard - could find nothing - we then jumped from there into the vacant ground, and continued searching there till ten minutes after three o'clock. We then spoke together, and agreed to leave the ground, placing two watchmen in the stonemason's yard to look out - we withdrew and had not got many yards before we heard rattles spring and a call of Watch! I was the first who came up to a folding-gate, which was fastened with a chain; I burst the chain open, and saw the prisoner coming towards the gate as if endeavouring to make his escape; I hallooed to my brother watchmen,"Here is one;" they immediately went into the stone-mason's yard; Burridge jumped over into the yard, where the prisoner was - he then made his escape towards the London Institution, but was taken by Burridge, and I saw the property found on his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you watching? A. From ten minutes past one o'clock to ten minutes past three - and at a quarter-past three, the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. If anybody has sworn the prisoner was caught in less than ten minutes, it is not true? A. He was caught within ten minutes after the rattles sprung; the information was given to me before the alarm.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the nightly watch. On the night of the 3d of July, I received information with my brother officers, that three men were supposed to be in this back ground. I got there five or ten minutes after two o'clock, and was in dilligent search, as the ground leads to a good many houses; I searched the stone mason's yard - a man might be concealed there for half an hour, and not be found; it was a heavy rain with thunder and lightning - we placed two men to watch, and as we went away, there was a cry of "There he goes - there is one on the wall." I ran back to Northbuildings - we had broken open the stone-mason's yard before; the prisoner came in contact with the waste ground, but seeing us two there, he ran along the wall - I jumped over, and caught him as he endeavoured to escape from the wall - I caught him on the dead wall of the Institution; he then had the bottom of the silver candlestick in his hand - he said he would make no resistance if I would not hurt him; I said I would not - I found the property on him; he had thirteen yards of linen wrapped round his body - my brother officer found a pint pot, a half-pint pot, a milk jug, several spoons, and different property on him.</p>

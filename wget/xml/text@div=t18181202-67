On Saturday night, the 7th of November, the house was broken open. I was in the country at that time. I came to town on Monday morning, about eleven o'clock. I found no marks of violence on any part of the house. There were marks of violence on the adjoining counting-house, which joins the same building, and is part of the warehouse. I found the drawer of the counting-house desk broken open. The money deposited there belonged to us. The prisoner was apprehended about a week after. I saw him at the Mansion-House. He begged to speak to me in private, and then said he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020036"></xptr>the guilty person, and begged I would be lenient with him. I neither threatened or promised him. He said he wished to be sent to the Penitentiary, if he was cast for transportation, and that he would tell me how he did it. I told him he deserved no favour. He said, that on Saturday night, the 7th of November, after coming and talking to some workmen in the warehouse, he went into the front yard, and shut the warehouse door after him, and concealed himself among some piles of hats and puncheons in the yard; and when all was quiet, he got on the shed in the yard, and in at the dining-room window, walked down stairs into the kitchen, and took the keys of the warehouse and counting-house from where they hung in the kitchen, opened the doors, and went and broke open the desk, and took the money out, but did not count it; and that he got out the same way he went in. The yard is shut up at night. The money that was kept in the drawer, belongs to the firm, which is myself, William and

Borradaile, as he had been seen with a great deal of money lately, which rose the suspicion. He said he had received 15 l. 15 s., from a man, who owed it to him. I told him if he could account for it, I would not detain him, and I would go anywhere with him to find the man. He said he was gone to sea. I searched him at the Mansion House, and found eight 1 l. notes, and 17 s. in silver, on him. I then went to his lodgings, which he directed me to, and found a great many new clothes, which he told me he had bought with the money he took out of the desk.</p>

Dear Sir,—Mr. Armstrong has called upon me, and, after some conversation, he has agreed to pay the 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and half a quarter's rent, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He wishes to have the deeds which you hold, and proposes calling this after<lb></lb>noon, at 4 o'clock, to settle. I shall feel obliged, therefore, if you would call on me at that time with the deeds, or deliver them to the bearer")—That was the substance of what Armstrong had told me—the prisoner said he was very pleased that I had succeeded in getting half a quarter's rent for him, and proposed making me some present, which I did not accept—I said, "He tells me that you have some deeds of his that you hold as secu<lb></lb>rity for the 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "Oh, yes; they relate to his wife's property; I have deposited them with a friend of mine, who has advanced me some money upon them; would you let me have the money to get them, and I will let you have them before 3 o'clock, in order that you may settle when Armstrong calls?" and, believing him to be the Mr. Howe with whom I had business, I gave him a cheque for 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have that cheque here—it has been returned to me by my bankers, as paid—the amount of the cheque is 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the debt was 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said to me, "I have agreed with the tenant who has taken my house to pay 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the lease; will you do it for that)"—I said I would—he then told me to deduct the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the amount which I had to give him, which I did—he said he would return to me with the deeds at 3 o'clock, without fail—I never saw him again until he was apprehended upon some other charge—I think he was then going by the name of Rickaby—that was in 1853 or 1854; I am not sure which—he was apprehended upon another charge, and I went to the police office to have a look at him—at the time this matter occurred I did all I possibly could to meet with him—I had large handbills printed, and circu<lb></lb>lated about London, one of which I have here—I took every possible step to have him apprehended—when I saw him at Worship-street, I did not pursue him; I had been put to so much expense and trouble—I did not see anything more of him until the other day, when he was apprehended upon another charge—I then felt it right to go on with this; I had so many communications made to me with respect to him, that I said I would prose<lb></lb>cute—I never saw Armstrong again until he was apprehended, and tried here, in 1851.</p>

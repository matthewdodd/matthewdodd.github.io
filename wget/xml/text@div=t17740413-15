               <p>Gahagan's Defence.</p>
               <p>I worked for this gentleman in the burying ground in Russell-court; I was in the burying ground the same day; it was a snowy day, that broke off my work; I worked the day before this Tuesday night he was robbed; at night a little after six, as it is common, I went down to him for some money; he gave me two shillings in halfpence; about six o'clock I went down the end of the court; turning the corner two or three doors from my master's house, I saw Little hanging the lamp, standing upon the steps; he asked me if I would have some beer; two men were with him; one I knew, the other I did not; Relly was one; we all went in together and had three pots of beer; we sat for an hour; then we all came out together to the end of the court; Relly and the other went to the left hand, and we came to the right; I came to Little's door with him; we parted about seven o'clock; he went up stairs and I went home. One of my witnesses will tell you where I was the rest of the night. Relly wrote a penny-post letter to a friend about four miles off; what it was about I cannot inform you.</p>

               <p>Cheeke. While he worked with me I took care to make him do his duty as near as I could; sometimes he would get fuddled as other workmen would do; I had no reason to suspect him before; I kept him when I turned other men off, therefore I thought him a good servant.</p>

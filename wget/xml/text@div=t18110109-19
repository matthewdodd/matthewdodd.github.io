               <p>Q. In what situation did you find your shop - A. I found two of the shop window shutters taken down, they had been barred on the outside, and by getting them above the hooks they might be taken down. A pane of glass was cut out of the shop window so as to put an arm in. I went to bed about eleven, the shutters were put up and fast, there was no pane of glass broke; I missed cheese, butter, and lard, but what quantity of cheese I could not tell at the time; there were a pile of cheese in the window, the whole pile was gone, and the pile stood right opposite of the glass that was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any butter standing there - A. Yes; it was gone, and the lard was gone, they were all within an arms reach of that broken window. The watchman told me they had taken up a person with such articles. The next morning at ten o'clock I went to the watch-house, I saw the prisoner in custody, three cheeses, about eight or ten pound of lard, and four or five pound of butter.</p>
               <p>JURY. How large was the pane of glass - A. Large enough to let a cheese out.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Ann's. I was calling half after one o'clock on the 14th in the morning I was in Wardour-street, I saw two men at a distance coming down Wardour-street, they were walking gradually together with two bundles, one had got a large one, and the other a small one, they perceived I was coming, he with a large bundle crossed over the street to St. James's side, at that time St. James's watchman was calling the half hour at a distance behind me; I passed the man with a little bundle and took no notice; the other passed the same; I stopped to see whether the man with the large bundle would meet the St. James's watchman or not, and before he met him he crossed over of my side, I then followed after them as fast as I could; I passed the man with the small bundle, and got within eight or ten yards of the man with the large bundle, he began to run; I sprang my rattle, he threw down the goods and ran off; I then turned and seized the man with the little bundle by the collar, I said let us see what you have got, he let the handkerchief drop, it fell on the ground, it contained butter and lard; I then called to the St. James's watchman, and one of St. Ann's to come and pick it up; they did; I took the prisoner, he was the man with the small bundle; they took the cheese, butter, and lard to the watchhouse, and there the prisoner was searched; he had two bad dollars, and two duplicates in his pocket. The watchman that I called picked up the property, and I saw the other man drop it; there were three cheeses, and four lumps of butter. Mr. White's house is on the St. James's side; I did not go there. I saw Mr. White at the watchhouse the next morning.</p>

I am a private in the 1st Royal Surrey Militia—the deceased, John Lynch, was in the same regiment—on the evening of 29th April, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was at the Magpie, at Richmond, in a room on the ground floor—some other militia men, some civilians, and the prisoner were there and three females—they were talking and drinking—just as I went in I saw the prisoner rush into the room, Lynch was close to the fire-place—I did not notice what he was doing—(he prisoner stabbed him in the groin, and then gave it a little touch up—I saw a knife in his hand—I rushed at Lynch, caught hold of him, and hallooed put "Police!"—the witness Jones went for a policeman—the prisoner was very roughly handled afterwards by the people in the room; they struck him several Blows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the militia—I was at the Magpie on that night, between 9 and 10 o'clock, in the front room—there were other militiamen there, with Lynch and the prisoner, and one woman—the prisoner was standing with his back against a dresser, I believe—Lynch was talking to the woman—I believe it was the prisoner's wife—Lynch asked her to fetch in a pot of Beer—I did not hear him say anything else to her—he touched the prisoner with his hand under the chin, and told him not to be angry—I did not see that he did anything to annoy or provoke the prisoner—he appeared irritated and annoyed at his wife being told to fetch the Beer, and struck Lynch with his fist—Lynch hit him back with his fist in the face, and they got to fighting—they went out into the passage, and there was a fight there, which continued about five minutes—they then came into the house again—the prisoner went into the back room and Lynch into the front—in about five minutes the prisoner came in at the door of the front room, and went back to Lynch—he made a Blow at him with his left hand, and stabbed him with his right—I saw part of the knife as he came in at the door—he did not say anything before he struck Lynch—Lynch immediately called out that he was stabbed—Dwyer caught hold of the prisoner, and I went and fetched a constable.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Gillespy and Co., carrying on business as merchants at 2, Brabant-court, Philpot-lane—Mr. Gabriel Raine Ford, of Constantinople, was a correspondent of our house—he died recently—he was in the habit of drawing bills on our house, on my father, Mr. Thomas Gillespy—this bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was presented at our house for acceptance in the beginning of January, 1857—it is dated, Constantinople, September 25th, 1856—it is drawn by Mr. Ford on my father at 30 days' sight, and indorsed to the order of Mr. Joseph Ruscovitch—it was accepted and taken away from our counting-house the same day by the prisoner, and that was paid in the usual way—on 15th August, 1857, the prisoner called at the counting-house, and brought this bill for 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn by Mr. Ford on my father, payable at sight—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:"25th September, 1856.

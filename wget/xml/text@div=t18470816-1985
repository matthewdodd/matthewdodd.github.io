                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman R</hi> 56.) I was on duty at Woolwich Dockyard on Friday evening, the 30th of July, at the Watergate—my attention was drawn to the prisoner Daniels, who was on the upper deck of the ship called the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi>, which was lying in the stream opposite the dockyard—she is a hulk, for the accommodation of seamen while ships are fitting out—the <hi rend="italic">Spite<lb></lb>ful</hi> steamboat was lying alongside the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi>—the men on board the <hi rend="italic">Spiteful</hi> had been paid off the some day, and there were none on board—I saw Daniels passing some rope and canvas down the accommodation-ladder of the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi> into a boat, which was between the two vessels, moored at the bot<lb></lb>tom of the gangway, alongside of the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi>—I saw one man in the boat, but I cannot say who it was, he appeared to be assisting in putting the things into the boat—I then procured the assistance of Sergeant Glascock, and went to pursue the prisoners in a boat—I had noticed Daniels get into the boat, and about ten minutes before the boat left, I noticed that there were four other men in it—when I got near to the boat I saw the prisoner Daniels in it, the four rowers, a female, and a man who is boatswain of the <hi rend="italic">Spiteful</hi> steam-ship—they</p>

               <p>landed the two passengers at the Bell Water-gate—there had been no opportunity for anybody to have got into the boat from the time I noticed Daniels handing the things down—whoever was in the boat must have been in it at the time I noticed it originally—I followed the boat with Glascock—it first went to Bell Water-gate, Woolwich, where the female and the boatswain landed—I then called to Daniels, I did not know his name—I called to the persons in the boat, and told them to stop and return, that I might see what property they had got in the boat—I got no answer—they did not return—they went in the direction of Barking Creek—we did not follow them—I saw them go about a quarter of a mile—we got within about twenty yards of them—I was near enough to identify the persons—I saw Daniels, I could not recognise any other person—I saw a quantity of rope and canvas in the boat—it is impossible for me to tell whether it was the same that I saw handed down the companion-ladder—it had the same appearance—they had not an opportunity of getting it out of the boat again—it must have been the same—I did not lose sight of them—I made a state<lb></lb>ment to an officer at Woolwich, I received orders, and went on the Saturday morning to the <hi rend="italic">Royal George</hi> revenue-cutter, at Barking Creek, in company with Sergeant Glascock—I searched the cutter, but did not find any rope or canvas—I saw all the prisoners on board the cutter, but whether they were the men who were in the boat, with the exception of Daniels, I cannot say—I left Glascock on board.</p>

I received information, on Friday night, the 30th of July, from Turner—I took a boat and rowed round the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi>—a boat had just rowed away from it, with the five prisoners, and another man and a woman in it—I was near enough to it to identify all the prisoners—I have seen them about, and know them all by sight as be<lb></lb>longing to the coast-guard; and Daniels had come to the yard several times—they rowed down the middle of the stream, towards Barking Creek—I ap<lb></lb>proached to within three or four yards of their boat—I hallooed to them, and Angove stood up—I told him to stop, and asked him what they had got in the boat—he said some old stores, which they had been up to Limehouse to get—I saw some rope, similar to that produced, in the stern-sheets of the boat—I did not notice anything else—after I had called to Angove, and he had said that, he sat down, and they pulled away as hard as they could—the next morning I went to the <hi rend="italic">Royal George</hi>, at Barking Creek—I obtained leave of the officer in command, and searched her with inspector White—I pulled up a flap and saw a board loose, I pulled it away and saw this canvas—the men were then mustered on board—the prisoners were amongst them, with the exception of Callaghan—the rope and canvas were brought on deck—Williams said he took it for the use of the service, and he did not think there was any harm in taking it—Lieutenant Simpson was the officer in command.</p>

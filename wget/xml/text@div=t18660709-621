                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I live at 16, Sunderland Terrace, Paddington, and practise as a surgeon-dentist, in partnership with my father—I am 29 years old, and am married, and have two children—on 29th May I was living at home with my wife and children—I went to Watford that day on business, and returned to the station to meet the six o'clock train—I saw the prisoner on the platform, she asked me if the train which was approaching was the train for London—I said, "Yes"—she asked me if I was going to London—I said, "Yes"—the train drew up at the station—I walked to the first empty second-class compartment and entered it—the prisoner followed me into the carriage—it was the compart<lb></lb>ment nearest the engine—she was carrying a large bouquet—she began talk<lb></lb>ing about the aspect of the country, and said that she was very fatigued; she had been to Watford to see her children, who were at school there, and had been rambling in the fields—after a short time she alluded to her children again, and said that the youngest was a very fine little fellow, something like she was—I had asked her if she had any objection to smoking before we got to Pinner, and she led me to infer that she rather liked it than not—I then lit a pipe, it was almost immediately we started—I then took a book from my bag, not wishing for conversation of that description, and commenced reading—on the train arriving at Pinner there were a great many people on the platform, and I observed to her, "You have no objection to smoking. As there seem a great many people here, somebody may get in who has, and if you have no objection I will lock the door of the carriage"—I locked the door with a key which I had in my pocket—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186607090043"></xptr>
               <p>the train stopped at Harrow, Sudbury, and Camden Town, where the tickets were collected, and I unlocked the door either just before or after we got there—we both gave up our tickets, and the train arrived at Euston Square—from Camden Town to Euston Station it takes six minutes—the train was due at London at a quarter to seven, leaving Watford at five minutes to six—I cannot say whether it was late or not—I took up my bag and got out of the carriage first, and was proceeding along the platform, when a railway inspector came up to me and said that a lady desired to speak to me—I went back to where the prisoner was; she accused me of having grossly insulted her and asked me for my card, I refused to give it to her and denied the charge—she said that she must have my card, or she would give me in charge for haying insulted her—I was asked my name, and I gave the name of Jackson—I then asked to be taken to the police-station and to have the case thoroughly investigated before a magistrate—several railway officers accompanied me to the station with the prisoner—I gave my correct name and address at the station—the charge was entered against me, and I was locked up that night and taken before a magistrate next morning—I took no indecent liberty with the prisoner during that railway journey, nor did I attempt to throw her on her back on the seat of the carriage—I did not pull her about, or throw her clothes over her head, or touch her, or commit any act; nor did I expose myself in any way, or use any indecent language—she had her bouquet on the platform, and at the station too; it was not injured in the least, nor were her clothes or her bonnet in any way rumpled or injured—her hair was not disturbed that I observed—my dress was in the ordinary way—she was a perfect stranger to me—the matter was investigated next day, Wednesday, at the police-court, and I was discharged—on the following day I applied for a summons, and she was arrested on a warrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You describe yourself as a surgeon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. I am a M. R C. S.—I practise, in partnership with my father and brother, at 19, Grosvenor Street, Grosvenor Square, also at Watford, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, and all through the counties—we have certain days of attendance—we advertise—I have never given the name of Jackson before—I did so on the spur of the moment to the railway porters and Mrs. Allen—they were all standing together—I do not know whether the prisoner was told that she had better give me in charge, but I insisted upon being taken.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186607090044"></xptr>
               <p>I moved back again, because the platform where we got in is not on the same line as where we got out—but they had the other stations to stop at on the side on which I was sitting—nobody came into the train—I was still smoking at Camden Town—I fancy I finished my pipe there, and unlocked the door—it was just before or just after—I make an invariable rule to get into an empty carriage, for the purpose of smoking—I noticed that the first compartment was empty, and walked in without taking notice of the others—I got out before the train stopped, and had got some distance on the platform before I was stopped—I think I was very near the engine—I had walked some yards, certainly—I was walking fast.</p>

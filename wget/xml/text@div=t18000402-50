            , lottery-office-keepers and stock-brokers, at Charing-cross, and Cornhill: On the 5th of March last, the prisoner came to the office at Charing-cross, to demand the sixteenth part of a one thousand pound prize, (produces it); it is now exactly in the same state in which he brought it; he presented it to the numerical book to be examined, I heard another clerk inform him that the figure had been altered; I examined the share to see whether it was drawn or undrawn, I told him that the figure o had been altered to a 2; he said it was in the same state as when he purchased it, he insisted upon its being a 2, and that it had been drawn a one thousand pound prize; by that time Mr. Richardson came into the office, and we gave him that share; Mr. Richardson desired him to walk into the back office, which he did, and I also accompanied him; Mr. Richardson informed him, that what he had uttered was of very serious consequence, and, if he persisted in it, it might affect his life; Mr. Richardson then asked him who he was, and who he lived with; he said he lived with a Mr. Moore, a tin-plate worker, and had been intrusted with a great deal of property, and could have a very good character; Mr. Richardson informed him that the figure had been altered, by whom he could not pretend to say, but if he would bring Mr. Moore with him, and some of the other members, for it belonged to a club, he would convince him of his error, by having such books from the City-office, that would convince him the original figure was an o, and that we did not share that ticket that it purported to belong to; he still persisted, and Mr. Richardson informed him, after what he said, that if he persisted in demanding the payment of it, that he must take him to Bow-street; he demanded payment of it, and of course he was taken there.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe there is a bar above and under the o, which you suppose it originally was, are those bars above and under any thing but an o? - A. No, they are not; they are put to prevent its being altered to a 6 or a 9.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they fixed in such a manner as an o can possibly be made to resemble a 2, as you make it? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these; are these original tickets before the lottery began? - A. The two first are original tickets from the Stamp-office, they have been shared.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the figure 2 ever made with a strait bar? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, in this which has been produced, the bottom of these two bars which is now made to be the bottom of the 2, is below the centre bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Is that ever the case in the genuine figures of 2? - A. It is always placed upon the line of the centre bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is not the 2, both at the top and the bottom, made in the same line with the other figures of that number? - A. Yes; the figures in our shares may not be made so well as in the original ticket, but they are all made in one way.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe the ink with which your figures are written is of a particular colour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the object of that particularity? - A. To prevent the figures being altered or taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the connecting stroke of this o, and the lower bar, made with that ink, or a different ink? - A. With a different ink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.You are perfectly conversant with tickets, and all the different forms in which they are made? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This ticket being presented, it was impossible to impose upon you? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the custom of the office when the shares are exposed? - A. They are never exposed but at the time of felling them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many clerks might there be in the office at that time? - A.Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Men or boys? - A.Men; there are two lads, but not in the share department.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not in their power to get at them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not pens and ink about the counter? - A. Yes, of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Do your customers never come and use pens and ink? - A. Not upon the shares.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner came to your shop with great confidence? - A.Apparently with confidence.</p>
               <p>Q. He was immediately apprised it was a forgery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He still persisted it was in the state in which he bought it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Richardson advised him not to persist, but to go about his business? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And told him, if he persisted it might affect his life? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And, notwithstanding all this admonition, he did persist? - A. He did; Mr. Richardson refused to return him the share, or else I believe he would have gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the registry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020044"></xptr>of these numbers that he had bought? - A. Yes, they were registered; we have a copy of the register. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when the registry was made? - A. I believe the 1st of February.</p>
               <p>Q. A month before the drawing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the share registered by you correspondent to this register, 9392? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And made a month before, at your office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When any body purchased that share was it registered as 9390, or 9392? - A. It was registered as 9392.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so registered when it was purchased? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it so registered? - A. The 1st of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day it was purchased? - A. I cannot say; it might have been bought three weeks before, or it might have been that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not then the practice to register the share at the time they buy it? - A. In general it is the practice; but it is very often registered after it is bought.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the purpose of registering? - A. To send an account when it is drawn, whether it is a blank or prize.</p>
               <p>Q.Then a person may register a share that is not bought at your office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the register you are now speaking of, 9392, registered as a share or a ticket? - A.As a sixteenth.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q.Have you inspected your book so as to know whether this ticket was not registered at the very time it was bought? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Have not you an opportunity to know from your books the day of the month when this was registered at your office? - A. Yes; but we cannot pretend to say the day of the month that it was sold.</p>
               <p>Q. The 1st of February was above a month before the drawing of the lottery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When were you first desired to look at your register of this ticket? - A. Before the prisoner came, we found that it had been registered wrong, knowing that we did not share the ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon finding that you had a wrong register, did you conclude that some mistake had happened in your shop? - A. No; we concluded that he called the o as a 2.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you discover you had registered the wrong number? - A. Immediately upon the ticket being drawn.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon the ticket being drawn, and your referring to your register, you would suppose of course that your office was liable to pay the one thousand pounds? - A. No; we did not share the ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate this mistake to Mr. Richardson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon the ticket being drawn, you say you found you had the register of 9392, but that you had not sold that ticket? - A.Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Richardson say any thing with respect to that? - A. He said we had called it wrong, or the prisoner had; or we had copied it wrong; Mr. Richardson sent to Mr. Arnull, and Mr. Arnull said it was a mistake; it was 9390 that we sold; people very often call a 2 for an o in registering, though they are not at all alike.</p>
               <p>Q. This number was drawn on the 3d of March? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell this young man that you had discovered the mistake? - A. He was told it was a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any share registered from the party who registered this list of numbers, of 9390? - A. None at all; I can very easily account for the register being wrong; the prisoner mentioned at Bow-street -</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken down in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell us what he mentioned. - When he came to the office, and Mr. Richardson saw him, did he communicate to him that you had discovered the mistake in the register, about that very ticket? - A. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a month before the drawing of the lottery that this was registered? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.Does the registering-clerk copy the ticket, or does the person holding the ticket tell him the number? - A. Sometimes one way, and sometimes the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible the registering-clerk could take this for a 2, if he saw it himself? - A.Impossible.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a clerk in the Stamp-office, in the department of receiving tickets that are to be shared, and give them stamps back in return; we retain the original ticket; we keep the ticket three clear days after it is drawn, and then they have a right to demand it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you do any thing to the shares to authenticate them before you deliver them? - A. Yes, they are stamped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this very ticket, 9390, shared? - A. Yes, into sixteenths; which sixteenths we stamped.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this one of those that you so stamped? - A. I would not take upon me to swear that this did not pass through in the state that it now is; it was stamped, no doubt, by the stamper in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether 9392 was shared? - A. Yes, by Mr. Hornsby; and divided into two quarters, two eights, and four sixteenths, on the very same day that the other was divided by Mr. Richardson, the 29th of January.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NORMAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a clerk in the Stamp-office; it is my business to enter the original ticket, with the number of shares into which it is divided, the day on which it is divided, and the name of the office-keeper by whom it is divided.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they entered to see that no more shares than they purport to be, are passed? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that share; should you have passed that for 9392? - A. By no means, on account of the difference there is between this 2 and the 2's which are in general made.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. You do not think it would pass upon you or any lottery-office keeper? - A. Certainly not, because there is no figure that has a bar to it but the o.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon your oath, was not this a number registered by you as a number bought at your office, for which your office is responsible? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not registered as a ticket bought at your office? - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. As No. 9392, bought at your office, and which you were to pay if it became fortunate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, was it not registered at the very time it was bought? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You registered it yourself? - A. Yes, on the 1st of February.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. It must have been bought before it was registered? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say you have any doubt that it was bought on the 1st of February? - A. I have no doubt, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not enter in a book the day the different shares are sold? - A. No, not the shares.</p>
               <p>Q.How many days after this was shared at the Stamp-officer, was it before it was sold? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Norman.) Can you say you passed the shares of 9390? - A. It was divided on the 29th of January; they were delivered to the office-keeper that day, from the entry in the book, I should imagine between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Frost.) Did you register this singly, or with a number of others? - A.With a number of others, from the same person.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020046"></xptr>Q. I believe to the amount of ten? - A. I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the lottery begin drawing? - A. On the 3d of March.</p>
               <p>Q.Were all the other numbers correct which you registered at the same time, except 9392? - A. I cannot say, I have not examined them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner there at the time of the registry? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p> Do you believe he was there at the time you registered them? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not believe he was the man that registered these numbers with you, on the 1st of February? - A. Yes, I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not give you his name and place of abode, to enable you to send him an account of what was the fate of that ticket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not know that it is his real place of abode? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you any doubt that that was his real name and place of abode? - A. No, I have no reason to have any doubt; he said his name was

               <p>Q. What part of the day, on the 5th, did the prisoner come to claim his share? - A.After two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, from the time that you discovered it was a prize till the time he came to claim it, send him any notice of it? - A. No, I did not; because I knew we had not shared that number.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I should be glad to know, for it wants a little explanation, when you found that this man had really registered this number, and then found that register a mistake, and knew where he lived; how came you not to inform him of it? - A.Knowing that he did not hold a share of that number.</p>
               <p>Q.But you had taken the sixpence for registering that number, and therefore at the least you might have informed him it was a register of a forged share? - A. We did not know it was forged at that time.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. On the 5th of March, I saw the prisoner in our office; one of the clerks in the office came to acquaint me in the back office, that I was wanted in the fore office; in consequence of that, I went into the front office, the prisoner at that time was in an altercation with my clerk, seemingly warm; I therefore desired him to come into the back office, with Mr. Goddard; Mr. Goddard informed me, in the prisoner's presence, that he had brought a share of ours, the number of which had been altered; I received the share into my possession, and immediately discovered the alteration; I observed to the prisoner, that the had presented an instrument to me that would be attended with very serious consequences, if he came to demand payment for it, and desired that he would be very cautious in what answer he made me; he then told me that it was a sixteenth of a one thousand pound prize, and that he came for payment; I told him the number had been altered form 9390, to 9392, but that it had been altered in such a manner as could not impose upon us; I begged of him to bring his friend or any body that he thought proper, and it would be explained satisfactorily to them what the number of the share really was; he answered me, that he knew it to be 9392, as such he had bought it of us, it had not been altered since he bought it, that he had that number with others, printed on a card, and that he would not be hummed, or humbugged, that it was registered, that he had copied the numbers upon a piece of paper, and that he had so registered them; I told him, that in consequence of the o's having bars at top and bottom, they were very frequently read for 2's, that he must originally have made a mistake, but that mistake could transfer nothing to the real share; he persisted in the same over and over again, and I thought it proper to recommend it to him to wait till the next morning; but he observed, as I had threatened him with taking him to Bow-street, he certainly would go there, and I took him there.</p>

               <p>Q.When you have registered tickets, you send notice to the persons so registering? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to give him notice? - A. There were very strong reasons to induce me to believe, that the prisoner or some other person had made a mistake in registering that number; I saw that number in the midst of nine others, all of which, excepting that number, were sold by us; I believe this was the strong circumstance which induced me to think that a mistake had arose in the registering; I therefore did prevent the letter from being sent to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You have told my Lord, that notwithstanding all your expostulations, and all your menaces, the poor fellow insisted upon it that he would not be harmed, and would go to Bow-street? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had an opportunity of seeing, by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020047"></xptr>your book, when that share was sold? - A. No; we have issued twenty-six or twenty-seven thousand sixteenths-alone, it is hardly possible to do it; whole tickets we do make a memorandum of.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner said it was so registered, did you refer to the register? - A. No; I knew before that it was a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. That register was made by your clerk; from what he made it you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That was made a month before? - A. Yes; it is impossible that the prisoner could have a design, previous to the lottery being drawn, nor could we.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact, in that registery, there was no such number as the real number 9390? - A. No. (The share read. )</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The numbers were called over to that gentleman by another clerk in the same office, from the original numbers on the Saturday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take any particular notice about it? - A. I chose it because it was a nine thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remark, whether it was written with one ink, or altered? - A. No, I did not take it up in my hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe there is no other nine thousand among them but this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Did Mr. Crump write the names on the paper before they were registered? - A.Not that I recollect; he wrote the casting up what they came to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not take them down? - A. No; there was a card printed with the numbers, three weeks before the drawing.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that card printed from? - A. A paper copied from the original tickets, (produces a card with the number 9392); I had this card three weeks before the drawing of the lottery.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you remember that particular number? - A. I repeated them to my brother, and he took these numbers down as I repeated them, upon a piece of paper; after that I repeated them again-and they corresponded with the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that one of those numbers was 9392? - A. Yes; after I had repeated them twice over, I particularly remarked that number to my brother, saying, Thomas, this is the date of the year that you and I came to London, 92.</p>

I do; I took a list of them upon this piece of tin, from the shares themselves; (produces it;) I took them down on Monday morning, the 3d of February; when he brought the shares into the shop, he said it was very necessary that somebody should take down the numbers from the shares, for their own satisfaction, and I did it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you know when he bought them? - A. On the Saturday night before; I had not seen him till the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular occur to you upon the shares? - A. No; after I had taken them down he wrote them upon a piece of board with chalk over the fire-place; and then we compared both what he had wrote, and what I had wrote upon the tin, with the original shares, and found they were correct; I was very particular about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at that share? - A. I can swear it is the same number; but I cannot swear it is the same sixteenth.</p>

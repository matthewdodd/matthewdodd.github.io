On the 16th of December, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour at tea, with the glass door open, and saw a person in a white fur poodle cap, look into the shop two or three times, and in three or four minutes he came into the shop, went up to the window, took a cloak, and ran away into the road - I ran out, followed him, and saw him go towards Hanover-square, dressed precisely the same; he got between a coach, and cart in the middle of Oxford-street, and there I lost sight of him - I called stop thief! and when I got to Hanover-square gates, two or three persons standing there, directed me down Oxford-street; I could see a long way down the street, as there was a number of lights, but I could see nobody before me - a Policeman came up to me at the corner of Bond-street; he went to Hanover-square, and I down Bond-street, and Brook-street, and at the corner by the Earl of Crawford's, met the prisoner with the cloak under his arm - I collared him; he struggled hard to get away - I called for assistance; a lady and gentleman came up, and with assistance, I took him back to the shop- he was dressed in a white fur cap, and an apron tucked up round him, exactly the same as the man; I do not swear to his person - the road was particularly dirty, and he said he found the cloak in the road; it was quite clean - I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Do you swear he said he found it in the road? A. Yes; not on a railing - our parlour door directly faces the shop door, and is about fifteen feet from it; it was quite dark - he was taken in five or six minutes after he left the shop; I described his person to the people at the square gate - I spoke to the Policeman without stopping; I had slippers on, and left them in the road - I could not observe his face; I saw him two or three times - he was dressed as a working man; nobody told me they saw the cloak taken from the rails - the Magistrate thought it unnecessary for the Policeman to be here.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you any fence to your shop window? A. He came three feet into the shop to take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing in Regent-street, and saw the cloak laying inside some railings on the right hand side of the way; I saw somebody on the other side of the way - I picked up the cloak to see what it was; a plasterer on the other side of the way saw me pick it up, and told the prosecutor he need not hold me, for he saw me pick it up - the prosecutor said, "That is nothing to me."</p>

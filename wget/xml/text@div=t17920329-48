I had lost a great number of clothes from time to time out of my shop, off the shelves: on the 23d of March I lost the things in the indictment; I concealed myself on one of the shelves, behind the clothes; and discovered another man and the prisoner come down to go to dinner at twelve; he brought down this superfine cloth coat, which he had been at work on; he put it on the counter, and asked my nephew if I was at home; and he said to the man that came down with him, take sixpence, and go get your dinner; he came to the private door, and my young man was at the upper end of the shop; he took the coat off the counter, and put it over his arm, and reached his arm, and took something off the breeches shelf; he was very quick; then he reached again, and took a pair of black velveret breeches; he wrapped them up in the coat; he came out of the shop again into the entry, and went up three or four stairs, and I saw him placing the breeches and this coat very smooth, to go into a small compass; he came down to go out; I jumped down and stopped him; says I, William; I have caught the thief; my young man came up; I said, you have a pair of breeches inside this coat; he said, no, he had not; I opened them, and saw the breeches; then he let the coat and breeches fall to the ground.</p>

               <p>the 9th of December—I kept them in the back part of my house, enclosed in a fence three or four feet high, in a field belonging to Mr. Theobald—the prisoner lives three doors off—I did not lend or borrow any ducks of him—I saw them next in the officer's possession, about a quarter before twelve o'clock the next morning—they were mine—the heads of two were cut off—one remained on—I have no doubt they were mine, from some particular feathers—I reared them from ducklings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to the prisoner's house and traced these feathers from where they were stolen, to the back of the prisoner's premises, and that led to the discovery—the prisoner was in his back bed-room—he seemed to wish me to keep back, hut I went in and found the three ducks, and two ducks' heads were in the pail—I asked if they were his—he said yes, he had bought them of a man in the Brixton-road for three half-crowns, at twenty minutes to sir o'clock—I said—"Where are the feathers you had?"—he said, "I had none"—I took some logs of wood off the fire and found a quantity of feathers there—I took them out of the fire, and they are similar to what I traced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you put down his answer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have had no other cases since, I am sure I am not mistaken about the time—the feathers I traced on the track were the same at those I found in the prisoner's house—they are of a similar kind—they appear as if from the neck, and their being ducks' feathers made me go over the fence—I traced feathers for about thirty yards, and I saw the foot-mark where it is an unusual thing for people to go over, and then I went to the prisoner's house.</p>

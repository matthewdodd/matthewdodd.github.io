             . (The Prosecutor was very resolute in her Deposition; and charged the Prisoner with more heat than became her in a Court of Justice; it being the Prosecutor's Place only to Swear to the best of their knowledge, and that too, with Decorum, Caution, and a calm undisturbed Disposition of Mind, not forward to give their own Opinion, but with Reverence submit their own Judgement to that of the Court, who are not to be dictated by a Witness, but informed of the Circumstances with relating to the Affair, that Justice may be executed with Ease, and a due Regard shewed to those in Authority.) The Prisoner had 4 or 5 Evidences on her Behalf, who severally depos'd, That she had for some Years been disordered in her Senses, and frequently fell into such Extravagancy at Times, as discovered her Lunacy, which was occasioned by the sudden Death of her Child; but Mrs. Hamilton was the most particular in this Account, who depos'd, That she had lain with the Prisoner, who would start out of Bed with such dreadful Agitations, as frightened this Deponent out of her Wits, of which she scarcely seemed to be recovered.

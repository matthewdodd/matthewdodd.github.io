On the night of the 15th of October, I was alarmed by my wife; she was alarmed by thieves; my wife got out of bed; I did likewise; my wife stamped her foot on the floor to disturb the thieves, that we understood were in the house, and immediately after we sprang the rattle; the watchman came and got into the back yard; the watchman got over the paling, to a skittle-ground; my boy went to look, and let him into the house; I went down immediately afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find the back of your house - A. The back parlour window was open, one window: that window had been fastened the night before, by my servant; it was opened on the inside; there was not the least appearance of violence having been used. I found an old stool and a pot-horse, they were standing by the washhouse door; they had been left in the skittle-ground; I found them removed to the washhouse door.</p>
               <p>Q. By means of them could any person get access to your house - A. Yes, to a window of the room we call the lumber-room, over the washhouse side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that window open - A. No, there were no fastenings; the sash had been lifted up and put down again. I found the shutters of my bar forced.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your bar inside of your house - A. Yes, on the ground-floor, in a room in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, any person could not force these shutters, except they had been in the house, on the ground-floor - A. Impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left these bar shutters secure when you went to bed - A. Yes, I had fastened them myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270043"></xptr>Q. Did you find any thing left in the house - A. Nothing. The shoes the watchman found outside of the door; I found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you told me your back-parlour window had been opened - A. Yes, on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the prisoner taken - A. In less than twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he taken - A. In a neighbour's premises adjoining of mine; I saw him directly after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. In the space of two minutes before he was taken, had the watchman shewn you any shoes that he had found near the back door, or window - A. Yes, he had; that watchman's name is Swinland. When the prisoner was taken he had no shoes on</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. I had known him three years; he had been in the house four months before I took possession of it; he acted for Mr. Petrom fifteen weeks, very near four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing from the bar - A. I did not. They were disturbed too soon.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no tool to force your shutters - A. No; a person that knew my shutters might easily force them without any tool.</p>

Not on the first search; in about five minutes after the first search, I went to step from the fence in an adjoining yard, then I found him in Mr. Jewell's yard; I placed my foot upon something, I did not know what it was at first; I stooped, and discovered it was the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. You are on your oath not only to speak the truth, but the whole truth, therefore if you suppress any circumstance, from any motive whatever, you are as guilty of perjury as if you speak falsely. - They were in a bundle, I pawned them directly, they met me on Snow-hill all three of them, and which gave me the bundle I do not know, they were tied up in a handkerchief, I believe it was a young man in black that gave them to me, three men met me on Snow-hill, I believe it was between ten and eleven, I was going down to Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Who came to you on Snow-hill? - There was two besides that young man.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - He works with his mother, he wickers silver handles and tea pots.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of these three men? - Yes, he was, they asked me if I would go take them things, they had a bundle.</p>
               <p>What were you to do with the money? I gave it to the young man in black, that was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who had the money? - The young man in black, he was taller a great deal, and very much pockfretten.</p>
               <p>Do you know him? - If I saw him I should know him, I did not know his name, I knew the prisoner, they all stood on Snow-hill, and I brought them the money.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath which of the three was it that desired you to pawn the things? - It was the tall man in black, who is very tall, I did it seeing the prisoner with them, whom I know, the prisoner's mother is a good sort of woman and lives a little decent, I pawned them with this young man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, when she was before the Justice, she said, the prisoner gave her the things. - As for that I was in a fright and I did not swear it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. You did? - I did not, it was before the Justice, I will speak the truth, but Mr. Seasons and all of them frightened me in such a manner; I have lived there this ten years, every body on Snow-hill knows me, Seasons said, if I did not say that the prisoner was the person, he would have a warrant out against me for perjury, and now I tell the truth, I was very much frightened, and I was in labour, as it was very well known to every one that was there, I have been brought to bed since, and this is my little child.</p>

               <p>How came you to go to the pawnbroker's? - I was inquisitive enough to go to see what it was, and I went into Fleet-market on my own business, and I went into the pawnbroker's to know what it was, curiosity led me, I wanted to know what it was.</p>
               <p>What business had you to know what it was? - No other business than my curiosity, my business called me down to Fleet-market, I did not go on purpose, I asked the pawnbroker what it was, I went merely from curiosity.</p>
               <p>Court. Take care what you say. - I asked the pawnbroker whether it belonged to him and he said yes, I asked him what it was and he told me, he said, where did you get this, I hardly know now what I said.</p>

               <p>On the 5th of June I was at my own house the Magpye, Clerkenwell-green, a young man came from the corner of Stone-cutter-street, where they usually send to me in case any thing of this kind happens, I went there and I saw Mrs. Parker and one Mrs. Grice, they said Mr. Seasons I am glad to see you, and she said she found it on the side of Fleet-market, on the next day she sent for me to the Poultry Compter, she then fell into a flood of tears and said, Mr. Seasons I will not get myself into trouble for any person in the world, in consequence of what she said to me I went after the prisoner and took him up, the landlord said he was gone out, says I you are a rogue, and I shall report you to the sessions, I went into the cellar and again into the tap-room, says I you are a very bad man, I then went up in the landing-place in the dark, I laid hold on Groves, I brought him down stairs, says I what is your real name? says he, Damn your eyes! Then I asked him to open his mouth, and he did so, and held down his upper lip, I then turned up his upper lip, says I, you are the man, his teeth are very rotten and bad; he then swore he would not go, we were about four or five times on the floor of the tap-room, I struck him several times with a pistol, he gave me three cuts with that knife, here is my coat cut twice, the landlord of the house would not assist me, the landlord is since dead of the fright, I then took him to my house, his face was very bloody, and I got him water and washed his face, and gave him some porter, and took him in a coach before Alderman Hart, he said, says he, Seasons I was determined whenever you came to take me to try whether you was good or not, that is what he said upon my oath.</p>

               <p>How came you to threaten her with a prosecution of perjury? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Topping. Yes, you did, you said if I did not say the prisoner was the man, you would have a warrant against me for perjury.</p>
               <p>Seasons. I said you should say what you said before, because she deviated last night; the prisoner's mother lends her money to buy butter in Fleet-market, they live in a court together.</p>

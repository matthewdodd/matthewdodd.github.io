                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 80). I am stationed at Leyton. On the morning of 14th July, I was out with my fellow constable Browning, and met the prisoners at 4 o'clock coming in the direction of Walthamstow, near Reeve's Green, and going towards Stratford—I spoke to Davis first, and asked their business there—he said they had been to see a man who was a plasterer, living near the Chestnut Tree, which is about a mile from where we stopped them—they both said that—I asked them the man's name, but neither of them knew it—I asked where they came from, Davis said that he should decline answering any more questions—I then put the question to Reaves, and he said the same—J felt in Davis's right hand coat pocket, I found this life preserver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a blue bag—I saw Browning take two chisels from Reaves—we took the prisoners to the Walthamstow station house, I searched Davis there and found these two knives, a door key, and five skeleton keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); also this gimlet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a side pocket, and this portable saw in the same pocket with the life preserver—these are common keys with the wards filed away, they were in his waist-coat pocket under a Guernsey—I also found two lucifers in his top coat pocket.</p>

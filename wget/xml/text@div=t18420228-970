On the 13th of February I was in High-street, St. Giles, between twelve and one o'clock. in the night—Mr. Telford was with me—I saw the prisoner coming out of a public-house—my friend and I went along—I felt something at my pocket—I thought it was not right—I turned, and caught hold of my handkerchief at one end, and the prisoner had hold of the other end of it—I turned round, and told him he ought to do things a little cleverer than that if he was about that business—my friend accused him of it—he turned', struck him, and knocked his hat off—I picked it up, and said, "We had better not have any of that"—the prisoner then struck me—this is my handkerchief, and the one I had in my pocket.</p>

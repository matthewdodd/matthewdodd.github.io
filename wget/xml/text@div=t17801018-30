               <p>I was in my father's (the prosecutor's) shop. The prisoner and another man came up to the show-glasses, between five and six o'clock on the 18th of this month. They stood there a good while; then they went away. I went to the little parlour; when I came back I saw the same two men at the glass again; and I saw the shorter one, which is not the prisoner, have his hand in the glass. I went up to the window (the prisoner saw me) while the other was taking the buckle out of the glass. The prisoner made a kind of an halloo; he ran a little way not quite the length of the window, and then stopped till the other man got the buckle out of the glass. I saw the buckle in his hand. Then they both ran off together. I ran out to the door, and Mr. Scotcher, who is a neighbour, pursued them; the other man ran off; the prisoner was secured. He was searched but nothing found upon him. He said he did not do it. This was between five and six in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was it not dusk then? - Not so dark but I could plainly discern their faces.</p>

               <p>I was standing at my door, which is opposite Mr. Salmon's. Miss Salmon advanced towards the window seemingly in great confusion. At that time I observed the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180031"></xptr> and another man standing close to the window; they seemed to stagger. I did not see them do any thing. When Miss Salmon came to the door she turned about, as I supposed to call her father or some of the family. Her father advanced towards the door and I observed the prisoner and the other man to run away very precipitately. I ran after them. The prisoner was the hindermost; I took him, and brought him back to the shop.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He made no resistance. I asked him where his accomplice was? He said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I say I had nobody with me? - No. I asked him where his accomplice was? He said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me where my accomplice was gone? I said I had nobody with me. - His accomplice was within eight doors of me when I laid hold of him, but I had not the presence of mind to call out stop thief!</p>

               <p>To Mr. Scotcher. Did they turn down Buckingham-street? - They might make a feint to turn down Buckingham-street; I never lost sight of them; I am sure they did not go down Buckingham-street.</p>

I am assistant engineer to the locomotive department of the London and South Western railway—the prisoner has been in their employment, I think, nine years, as warehouseman in the locomotive de<lb></lb>partment—his duties were to send goods to country stations—he got them from the general store department, on the authority of request-notes, which I signed—he would get the goods from the stores department, and send them—the request-note would be left at the stores department—a counterfoil is kept in the locomotive stores office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the locomotive department—I know a person named Springett, and I also know the prisoner—on 1st September, at 2 o'clock, or a little after, I saw Springett leaning across the window in the locomotive store, which is divided into two parts, one for carriages, and the other for locomotives—at that moment the prisoner came to me, and said, "Keep a look out at the store, see that nothing goes away without an order, I am going to the general store for something"—while I was speaking to Springett, the prisoner came in with a brown paper parcel, which he carried over to his own department, and I saw no more of either of them until I saw the parcel brought back again by Keats—I did not see Springett and the prisoner leave the office, because I had returned to my duties—they went to the part of the stores that Fuller had charge of, but I did not see them go out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had Fuller charge of the locomotive department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of the carriage side, when the other servants were absent—on the same day when I was taken into the office by Keats, I saw a similar brown paper parcel to that brought in by Fuller—it was not at all unusual for him or warehousemen to have parcels, he had them every day—the parcel was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective, employed by the South Western Railway—on 1st September I saw Springett go in at the gate, on the loco<lb></lb>motive side, about half-past 1 o'clock—I saw Springett drive a horse and cart away—he drove to Steward's-lane, Battersea, about a mile off, where Fuller lives—I saw him deliver the brown paper parcel—I took it from Fuller's wife—it contained 3 brushes and 1 piece of flannel, six feet long and eighteen inches wide—I took it into the department in which Fuller was, and asked him if he knew it—he looked at it, and said, "I do"—I said, "What does it contain?"—He said, "Some brushes and a piece of flannel"—I asked him where he got the brushes from—he said that he bought them—I said, "Where and when did you buy them?"—he made no answer—I asked him how he came by the flannel—he said that he had had it in his possession some time—on the same afternoon he said, "Osborne's man," meaning Springett, "sometimes buys brushes for me, and he bought them"—Mr. Osborne lives, I believe, in Skinner-street, Bishops-gate, quite the contrary direction from Fuller's house at Nine Elms, which is nearly a mile from the station—I afterwards got a policeman.</p>

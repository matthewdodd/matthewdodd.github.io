                  </hi>. I keep an hotel at 13, America Square, Minories—the prisoner came to lodge there one Sunday morning about a month ago—the next morning about 8 o'clock I heard him say he was going on board his ship, the Austria, of which he said he was the first engineer, to put the second engineer to work—he went away and returned in about an hour and a half, and said his vessel was not in dock yet, that it was outeide the basin, as there was not enough water for it—I said, "It is a very large boat, isn't it?"—he said, "It is a very large boat"—I said, "What line does it belong to?"—he said, "It belongs to the Anchor line"—I said, "Don't you know Zambruski, who serves your line and receives passengers from your steamers?"—he said, "Zambruski, Zambruski, I don't remember exactly"—after breakfast he came to the bar and asked the barmaid, Agnes Cato, for a sovereign, as he had no money till the ship came in—she came to me, and I said "It is not cus<lb></lb>tomary for me to lend money to any one"—he said, "As soon as the vesseliomes into the dock I shall have my wages"—I looked in the visitors' book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in which he had written "J. Leslie, Engineer, New York"—I said, "I will let you have a sovereign, don't ask me for any more"—he said, "I will receive the money to-day, and will bring the money for you to keep"—he brought me a paper between 10 and 11 o'clock which purported to be an order from the captain to the ship-owners, Messrs. Henderson and Co., 19, Leadenhall Street, for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of wages—I kept the' paper, which I thought was good—he asked me for another sove<lb></lb>reign, which I let him have through Miss Agnes—he said he was going with two gentlemen to the Kilburn Show—he went out after dinner and returned again about 12 p.m.—he said, "I left the two gentlemen at the European, opposite the Mansion House; they wish to go out for a little amusement, and I too, and we have not got enough money for that"—the gentlemen were staying at my hotel—he asked me for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. further on account of his money, which he said he wanted to share with them for this spree—I gave him the 21., and he said, "I have a friend outside in a cab waiting for me," and he brought a young lady in—he went away with her—next morning he came down about 8.15, took out two or three keys and a pen-knife and said, "If I had taken your advice I would not have been like this"—he said, "I am going on board the ship now to see the engineer's work. I am penniless to-day; now give me a sovereign and don't have breakfast till I come back"</p>

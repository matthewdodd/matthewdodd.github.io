                  </hi>. I am servant to the prisoner at Portland Villa, Hillingdon—on 6th May, about 4.30 p.m., I was helping my mistress putting some feathers into a new bed in a room at the top of the house—I heard the breakfast-room bell ring; that is on the ground floor—there are three storeys to the house—I came down to the first landing—my master called "Mary"—I said "Yes, sir"—he came to the bottom of the landing and said, "Damn it, what are you laughing at up there?"—he had a revolver in his hand; he pointed it at me, and said he would shoot me—he said that twice—I ran back to my mistress and told her—the prisoner ran after me and came into the room—he said "I will shoot your mistress, by God I will, and I mean it too," and he moved a few steps and fired—he,. held the revolver pointed straight at my mistress—she was struck, and the blood was streaming down her face—I jumped at the prisoner, and took the revolver out of his hand and put it in my pocket, and went to fetch Trotman, the gardener—he was not at home, but he came a few minutes after I came back—I had seen the prisoner that morning before I heard the bell; he was not drunk; he appeared to me to be sober—I had not heard him quarrelling with my mistress that morning—he had gone downstairs before Trotman came—I came with my mistress to her bedroom on the first floor—I sent for the doctor—my mistress was sitting down when the pistol</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187905260028"></xptr>
               <p>was fired at her; he was standing two or three yards from her—I afterwards picked up a bullet and a tooth in the room by the side of where my mistress had been sitting—the prisoner is of no business or profession—I remember on 13th April his wanting to go out; my mistress wanted him not to go, and he took up the poker and said he would kill us if either of us came near him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. When I first went into the service the prisoner was away at Dr. Harland's—he was there for six months on account of ill health—he came home about Christmas—he gave way to drink a good deal—he did not have an attack of delirium tremens while I was there—Mr. Mac<lb></lb>namara used to attend him—he was in a peculiar state on Easter Sunday (13th April)—he had been drinking for two or three days—he used to get very excited after that—he did not rave—I noticed that his eyes glared and looked wild—that continued for a few days after he left off drinking—he wanted to go out on Easter Sunday, and my mistress and I tried to prevent him; we thought it would be dangerous to let him' go out—he had been drinking a good deal before the 6th of May, brandy and beer—he was not a great deal excited that day—it was about 3.30 when I went upstairs to pick the feathers—this occurred about 4.30—I had passed him in the hall as I went upstairs—I had no opportunity of watching him during that day—I had not been laughing upstairs; I was smiling when I came to master—when not under the influence of drink he has behaved nicely to my mistress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. He had taken a little beer that day, about 2 o'clock, and he had a little egg and brandy shortly before this occurred, about 3.35—he dined at 2 o'clock—after Easter Sunday he went about the house as usual.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife; I have been married to him nearly seven years—on Tuesday, 6th May, I was upstairs with Mary—we had dined about 2 o'clock—after dinner the prisoner struck me on the side of the head with his hand; he did not say anything to me at the time—I thought he was sober—I had objected to his spitting in the fire, I asked him not to do so, and then he struck me, I believe with bis open hand; it was not a violent blow, but it hurt me, because I was suffering from head<lb></lb>ache—I was sitting by the fire after dinner in the down-stairs room—I left the room immediately after he struck me, and went up to my bedroom—that was about 2.30—after that I was in the top room with the servant picking feathers—I heard the bell ring; the servant went down; I heard my husband threaten to shoot her—he said "Damn it, what are you laugh<lb></lb>ing at upstairs? I will shoot you"—I had not heard her laugh; she was smiling when she went down—she ran back to me into the room, and he followed her immediately—she said "Master is coming upstairs with a revolver in his hand"—I should say he was near enough to hear—when he came into the room I noticed that his face was very red, and his eyes glaring—he said "I will shoot your mistress, by God I will, I mean it too;" he said that just as he came into the room—I saw the revolver in his hand—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—he came and stood about two yards from my left side—I was sitting down—he then moved nearly opposite to me, and fired without hesitation—my head was leaning down—I was struck in the left cheek, just below the eye; the bullet passed down inside my cheek and knocked out one of my upper teeth and one of the lower teeth; both teeth came out in the room, one has been found just lately; I was bleeding—I did not see what Mary did, I saw her leave the room—my husband did not help me at</p>

               <p>all; he was looking about the room for the revolver—I said "No, no, no"—he said "What will they do to me?"—assistance came, and Mr. Mac<lb></lb>namara attended to me—I thought, in fact I know almost that my husband was sober after dinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He is a confirmed drunkard—I sent him away last year to Dr. Harland's establishment in the hope that he would be cured—he did not take to drink again for three weeks after he came back, but soon after he did—he has had several attacks of delirium tremens—when not in drink he has behaved kindly to me—he has had the revolver for nearly two years; he got it on account of being afraid of burglars—I hid it for some time—I thought it an unsafe thing for him to have—when he fired at me I was sitting on a chair with my head bent down; I was not looking at him—I can't say whether his hand was not much higher than his hip—I was not alarmed when I saw him with the revolver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. It is some time ago that I put the revolver out of his way—I did it because he threatened to shoot me—it is only a few weeks ago—I took very little notice where he kept it; he put it in one of his own private drawers—he has many times threatened to shoot me, and himself too.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES-TROTMAN</hi>. I am a gardener, and have worked in that capacity for the prisoner about 12 mouths—on the 6th May, just before 5 in the afternoon, I was fetched to the house by Mary Podbury—I found the prisoner just coming out of one of the lower rooms—I said, "What have you been doing?"—he said, "I am going upstairs to see my wife"—I saw that he had blood on his hands, and he was very much excited—he wanted to pass me to go upstairs—I caught hold of him and threw him down, and held him there—I did not then know what had happened upstairs—he asked me to let, him get up and sit in a chair, and I did so—he then said, "Is Mrs. Gardner dead? I am afraid she is; I am afraid I shot too straight"—on several occasions prior to this I had been called in when he was suffering from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—on one occasion he tried to stab himself with a knife—in the beginning of 1878, when I was in care of him, he asked to see his wife—she came into the room—he was talking to her for two or three minutes—he then caught her by the shoulders and began to shake her—I prevented him from doing so—after she loft the room I asked why he had done it, and he said he had no recollection of having done it—he was a confirmed drunkard then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He was very excited through drink—if he heard people talking he always fancied they were talking about him, and became very angry and excited—if any persons came into the house and were speaking, he always thought they were talking about him—Mrs. Gardner always treated him with great kindness, only tried to prevent him from drinking—he said she did not use him kindly.</p>

               <p>he appeared very excited—I considered him to be sober—I went back to the house and saw the bullet and tooth found by Mary Podbury in the room upstairs among some feathers on the floor—she handed me this revolver—it has six chambers—one appeared to have been recently discharged; one had not been loaded—I found a cartridge in the prisoner's pocket which fitted it—I have drawn the other charges, and have the cartridges here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Uxbridge, near the prisoner's—on 6th May, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's house—I found Mrs. Gardner in bed bleeding from the mouth, and also from a wound in the cheek—the bullet had entered just under the left eye, passed inside, and came out behind the upper lip, knocking out the eyetooth of the upper jaw and a tooth of the lower jaw—such a wound would be inflicted from the firing of a revolver—I saw the prisoner about 5.30—he was not perfectly sober, he had evidently been drinking—he knew what he was about—I saw him later in the evening at the police-station; I spoke to him—he appeared then to know what he was about—I have attended him since September, 1877—I attended him three times in the course of a year for delirium tremens—on one occasion I took possession of the revolver; he had it in his writing desk; that was in September, 1877, the first time I saw him—-from the state he was then in I took the revolver from him and kept it for six months, I then gave it to Mrs. Gardner—she' is out of danger; there will be disfigurement; she has not quite recovered from the shock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I believe she will completely recover—when I took the revolver from the prisoner he had been threatening to shoot everybody and himself too—delirium tremens sometimes arises from depression from abstinence from drink; they always leave off drinking before they get delirium tremensthe quantity of alcohol stops them from drinking, the whole digestion is upset, and they leave off drinking and delirium tremens follows—glaring of the eyes is one of the first symptoms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—the prisoner was suffering from a complication of diseases before he went to Dr. Harland—he was suffering recently from Bright's disease; that is an incurable disease; it is very much the effects of drink—he is not suffering so much from it now as he was two years ago—he also had con<lb></lb>gestion</p>

            . I am chief constable at Lambeth-street office; I went to the prosecutor's on the 19th of February, between five and six o'clock - the prisoner had her bonnet and shawl on, and was standing in the parlour - I said she had some stolen money about her; she opened her hand, and gave me these four marked shillings - I asked where she got them; she said out of her master's drawer - I found this bottle of wine on her, and these three keys, one of which opens the drawer - she said she supposed Miss Burnell had left the wine out on the Friday evening, when she went to the wine-cellar, as it was standing near the safe - these books were in her box; she said she took them to read, and I found this handkerchief, of which I believe she gave no account.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My fellow servant and I took these books to read them and return them; they were put into my box for fear mistress should see them - my fellow servant was privy to all I did; the neckcloth was not in my box, it was in the room.</p>

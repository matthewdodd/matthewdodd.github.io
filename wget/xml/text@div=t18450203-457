                  </hi>. I am a traveller in the employ of Mr. Blythe and another, of Friday-street. On the 14th of Jan. I looked out a parcel of goods, and packed them up—I took them in my chaise round the West<lb></lb>end of the town, but did not part with them—I brought them back, and took them out of the chaise, and gave them into Scott's hands to take up into the warehouse—the chaise was then at the corner of Friday-street, in</p>

               <p>Cheapside—I left it to go to the stable in Blackfriars-road—I found it the next morning at the corner of Friday-street, and it had a number of parcels in it—I reprimanded the porter for having put them in—when I opened the gig I found that two of the parcels, Nos. 4 and 7., which ought to have been in it were missing—they had all been cleared out of the chaise the night before—the goods here produced were a part of the parcel No. 4—I know them because I looked them out the day before, and twenty-one of these pieces have our private mark on them—the other six have no mark, and I cannot swear to them.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the 15th of Jan. at my house—he had a sample of these muslin trimmings, and one dress—he asked if I could get a customer for them—I said I thought I could—he told me he had had the goods offered by a party, and he wanted to know their value, and whether I could obtain a customer—he said there were about twenty pieces of trimmings, and six or eight dresses—he waited at my place about an hour, and then he accompanied me to Messrs. Kidd's, in Tottenham Court-road—I went in, and saw one of the partners—I came out and told the prisoner I had obtained a purchaser—he and I then went to Mr. Dry's, in Tottenham Court-road, and had some refreshment—Mr. Dry said to me, "Kirby,</p>

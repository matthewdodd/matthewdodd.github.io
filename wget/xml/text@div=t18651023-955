On the morning of 30th September, about a quarter past four, I was on duty in Piccadilly, and saw Wiggins and Lockyer and two other men leave Mr. Quartermaine's premises, three of them carrying bundles—three of them crossed the road—I called 106 C, and ran after them—I captured Wiggins and Lockyer, the third man, Clements, ran away—I have not seen him since—I asked them what they had there—they both said nothing but what they had given to them—they threw the bundles away—I took them to the station—Wiggins said that he had been over to the Borough the evening before and got a situation, after that he went back to Westminster, where he lived, and there met three men who he went with to the Sun music-hall, at Knightsbridge, and had several pots of beer with them, and then walked up Piccadilly with them; that one of them let them in at Mr. Quartermaine's back gate with a key, and told him and Lockyer to go round to the front and wait for them, which they did, and the foreman and little George camp out at the front gate, and gave him and Lockyer a bundle—I found these pieces of merino (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in Wiggins's trousers, next his shirt, and in his left breast pocket this time-piece—the bundle he had contained this dressing-case, a card-box with 390 counters, a packet of cards, two pieces of needlework, several bodies of dresses, and some fancy articles—in Lockyer's bundle was a table cover, a towel, four muslin dresses, several pieces of muslin, and an anti-macassar—at six on the same morning I went to Mr. Quartermaine's, and took Clements and the prisoner Chapman—I told them I took them for being concerned in a robbery at Mr. Quartermaine's that morning—they said that they knew nothing of it, they were at home and in bed at the time—I searched Clements, and found nine orders for the Sun music-hall, and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—I inspected the premises; the doors were all unfastened, and the three boxes in the coach house were broken, and the property strewed over the place—in the back yard I found this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), done up in this piece of canvas, ready to be removed.</p>

I live in Piccadilly, and am a horse dealer-Chapman was in my employment at this time, and Wiggins had been the week before for a few days—Henry Clements kept the door—he had the key of the entrance into the yard, which would let him into the premises—it was not possible to get in in any other way, because the doors were locked with padlocks as well, but I have a small door cut for the man to go in at—this is my property, and was safe the evening before—it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it was in a coach-house adjoining my dwelling-house—nobody could possibly get in without having the key of the little door—I locked the fastenings myself the night before, at 6 o'clock, and saw them padlocked.</p>

I left them at 11 o'clock, and went to the railway-station to meet some horses, which were to arrive at 2 o'clock; they did not come, and I went to Piccadilly, and met these two men and another. They went into Mr. Quartermaine's premises with a key, locked the door, and one said, "Go round to the front gate and wait till I came round." They came out with a bundle each; one said, "Catch hold of this." I did so, and a time-piece dropped out, which I put in my pocket. He said, "Go on to Hooper's—court, I have got a bundle to fetch myself; I must go in this way and lock he doors, and come out the other way.

On the 18th of April, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop for some cambric, which came to 4d.; she then asked to look at some purple handkerchiefs - I turned my back to get them, but kept my eye upon her, and handed her several sorts; I saw her take the four handkerchiefs and put them under her apron-none of them would suit her. She was going to leave the shop - I called my master, and told him to search her. I saw him take three handkerchiefs from under her apron. He asked her what she had in her pocket - She said "nothing." He found a muslin handkerchief in her pocket, which had our private mark on it - She begged forgiveness. I gave her in charge.</p>

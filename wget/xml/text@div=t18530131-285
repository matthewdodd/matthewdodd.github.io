                  </hi>. I live in Old Pye-street, Westminster, and am a grocer and cheesemonger; I am in the habit of receiving these tickets from the poor fund—the prisoner presented this ticket on 25th Jan., about 6 o'clock in the evening, "Mr. Rees, give the bearer one shilling"—this is the usual form—it is understood to be goods to that amount—I asked the prisoner where she got it—she said from Mr. Malone—I said, "Did he give it you himself?"—she said, "No, he sent it by the servant"—I said, "I doubt its being genuine; will you have any objection to go with me to Mr. Malone?"—she said, "No"—I went for my hat, and she went out—my niece said, "She has run across the road"—I ran and called her, and asked where she got the ticket; she said a woman asked her to come for the goods—this woman had lodged in my house, and had a few words with me, and she knew that if she brought it I should not give her the goods—when the policeman came and took the prisoner she said she gave 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and afterwards she said she knew the person from whom she had it, but she would not betray them—I have had tickets in this form before, for which I have given goods—I never give money.</p>

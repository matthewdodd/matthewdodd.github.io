                  </hi>. I live in Peter-street, Clerkenwell. I had occasion to go to the hospital, in consequence of illness—I knew the prisoner for about a month before I went to the hospital, she was living at No. 6, Peter-street, with Dungate—she persuaded me to leave my things with her, and I did—I was living along with her—she did nothing for her living—I used to take in needlework—she said, "I will bring you in some clean things, and you will never want a clean thing while I am here, and I will come and see you on Wednesday," but I never saw her while I was there—I kept my things in a box, and she told me to leave them—I did not ask her to let me leave them—the key of my box was turned, but remained in the box, as she was to bring me my clean things—when I came out of the hospital I came to No. 11, Peter-street, as she had moved to No. 11—I did not find my box nor yet the property—I lost the articles stated—she pledged one petticoat before I went to the hospital, without my knowledge—I did not trust her with my box till I went to the hospital—I kept my box in the back parlour—it was on the Thursday, at Bartholomew-fair time, that I went to the hospital—the fair began on Saturday—I should know the petticoat again if I saw it—she had offered the duplicate for sale—it was found in her pocket.</p>

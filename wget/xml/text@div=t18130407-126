After talking with her some little time she pushed against me, and ran off. I felt a piece of paper in my pocket, which I first thought were the notes, but on examining it, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you that piece of paper in your pocket before - A. No. Finding that I had not taken the right, I ran out of the alley the same way that she did, but I did not find her. I saw nothing more of her until I saw her before the magistrate, and there the notes were produced. I am sure she is the same woman.</p>
               <p>RICHARD GREGORY. I am brother to the last witness. I am in partnership with my mother. I gave notice of the number of the notes at the Bank of England. I produce a thirty-pound note which I received at the Bank of England. I traced this note to a person of the name of Hopps in Cranbourn-passage.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took this pelisse off the prisoner's back, and what the prisoner said to me was perfectly voluntary. I asked her what had become of the money. She told me if I would come home with her she would give me the remainder. She had paid some bills with part of it. I went home with her to John-street, St. George's. She delivered me a thirty-pound note, two two's, and three ones, and seven shillings and sixpence in silver. She told me that she had changed a thirty pound note to pay for this pelisse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hopps. That is the pelisse I sold to the woman that changed the thirty pound note.</p>

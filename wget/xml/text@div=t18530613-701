On 6th May, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, Smith came and purchased some articles—she paid me with a half crown—I examined it, and did not like the look of it—I tried it with my teeth, and returned it to her—at that time Mr. Shepherd came in and took it from her—she was given in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher. On 6th May I saw the prisoners and a man together for about half an hour in Cross-street, Balls Pond-road—they then separated—the man and Smith went down a short street leading to the Balls Pond-road—the other two women went another way—I followed them first—I then came back, and saw the man going away in a direction from Mrs. Ellis's shop—I looked in the window, and saw Smith in Mrs. Ellis's shop—I went in, and saw Smith standing at the counter, and a half crown, which looked like a counterfeit, was on the counter—Mrs. Ellis took it up, examined it, and returned it to Smith—I snatched it from her, marked it with a cross, and put it in my pocket—it was not out of my sight at all—I am sure that the one I took was what Smith uttered—I left Smith with a greengrocer whom I had called in, and went out, <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> the man, and brought him back to the shop—he had some skeleton key's in his pocket—he got away—I then followed the other two prisoners till I found a constable—I told him, and got him to conceal himself, and as the prisoners passed they were taken—I gave the half crown to the officer after I marked it.</p>

On 6th May I was on duty in the Lower-road, Islington—I received information from the last witness, accompanied him, and found Horner and Newman together, standing on the footpath in the Lower-road—I took Horner, and the last witness took Newman—I told Horner it was for being concerned with the others in uttering bad money—she said she knew nothing about it, and she had no bad money about her—I said I would search her—she refused to be searched in the street, and I took her <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Mrs. Ellis's shop—I there found Smith in custody—I saw the sergeant take out of Horner's left hand a parcel, which being opened contained six bad half crowns wrapped in paper—she said, "They were merely put into my band to hold for a short time"—they were then taken to the station.</p>

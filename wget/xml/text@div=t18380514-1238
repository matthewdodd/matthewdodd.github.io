                  </hi>. I lodge with my husband in the house of Mrs. Elkins, in Dorset-street, Marylebone. On the evening of the 24th of April, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoners come to Mrs. Elkins's window—they stood talking about a minute, and then I saw them go to the prosecutor's shop—Mason went into the shop, and Watson was walking outside—Ma<lb></lb>son came out with a bundle, and they walked away together—they did not shut the door—I went and gave an alarm, and called the servant—the prisoners turned round the corner of Baker-street, and as they turned they saw me push the door open—the servant and I followed them, and found the bundle in the first door-way in Baker-street.</p>

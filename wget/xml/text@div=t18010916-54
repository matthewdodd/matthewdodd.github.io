             sworn. - On the 6th of July the prisoner was delivered into my custody, charged with stealing the notes; after he was locked up I searched him, and in the inside of the lining of his coat, which was cut, I found these notes, (produces them); after that I saw him writing something and requested him to let me look at it; it was a long time before he would give it me, I was under the necessity of unlocking the door and taking it out of his hand. (It was produced, and read as follows.)</p>
               <p>"My dear Lady, I am very sorry for my misconduct, but it was distress that drove me to it; but my master lives at No. 54, Park-street; but if you will go there I know that a word of your's will go a great way; for, if you will say that I had some notes of you, that will clear me. My dear lady, if you go, do not - pray, go to my master not to appear against me; do not, pray, write to my father. Your humble servant, J. Pratt."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was so much intoxicated with liquor and vexation of mind, that I don't know any thing I did while I was at the office; I was told they would take all my money from me, that was my reason for concealing the notes; the five-pound note my father gave me just before; he is here.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>PARKER-TURNER PRATT sworn. - Q. Have you lately sent the prisoner any money? - A. Within four or five months I have sent him up several sums of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a five-pound note shortly before the month of June? - A. Not particularly; but he is a favourite of my wife's, and she has frequently sent notes up to him and likewise cloaths; I have missed notes several times, and when I have enquired for them, I have been informed that she has sent them up to Jem, because he was in distress.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010916-54-verdict283" type="verdictDescription">

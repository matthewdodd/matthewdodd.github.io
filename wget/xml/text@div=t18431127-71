                  </hi>. I keep the Goat public-house, Tash-street, Gray's-inn-lane, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On Monday night, the 20th of Nov., about seven o'clock, ray servant, M'Carthy, said something to me, and about an hour afterwards I missed the key of my cellar off a nail in the bar, where she ought to have put it—I went with her to the cellar, but did not find the key—when I was in the beer-cellar I observed that the spirit-cellar door was all safe—it is within the beer-cellar, and I carry the key of that about me—Sullivan was in my tap-room that night—I shut the house up at one in the morning, then went into the cellar, and the railing of the steps were broken, which were quite safe when I had been there before—there ought to have been a three-gallon keg of spruce beer in the beer-cellar—I did not observe that then—I found the lock of the spirit-cellar broken off, and laid on an ale-barrel—I missed a two-gallon bottle of rum, some bitters, some empty bottles, and a stone bottle was in the beer-cellar which ought to have been in the spirit-cellar, and a keg of spruce in the yard—I went to the street door, and a man gave me information—I went with an officer, and found Howran and Flynn in a house in Tash-street, about ten doors from my house—Flynn was lying on the first floor stairs, drunk—the officer followed Howran up stairs, and found him on the second floor, drunk—the officer pro<lb></lb>duced a bottle—I went to Sullivan's room, and found him—I found some spruce-beer spilt in my yard—I think oneperson could move all that was taken.</p>

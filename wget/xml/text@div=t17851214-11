(Produced, and deposed to.) I asked him how he came to tell me they were clothes; then he said he had been to fetch them from the mangler's, I asked him if he had anything else in his pocket, he said no, I searched him, and found two silver tea spoons in his pocket.</p>
               <p>(The spoons deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. These tea-spoons and the handkerchief are your property? - Yes.</p>

               <p>They were entirely under your care? - Entirely.</p>
               <p>Which of you went out last on the evening of this robbery? - I went out last, pretty near two o'clock in the afternoon, and was not at home till pretty near ten.</p>
               <p>And was not your wife? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the house left entirely? - It was left entirely, only some lodgers up stairs.</p>

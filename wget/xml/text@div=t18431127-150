                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Lane, and keep a Beer-stop, in Newington-crescent. About half-past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of Nov. I saw the prisoner reaching over the counter, with the till half out, and her hand on it—hearing the sound of money drew my attention—I said, "Halloo, halloo, what do you do with the till drawn out? you have been robbing me"—I found the money gone from the front part of the till, and I saw no other person—the prisoner said, "You wicked woman, for ac-cusing me so, I will never come into your house again"—she had had half a pint of beer, and been reading the newspaper—she opened her apron, and had two loaves of bread in it—she kept her right hand clenched—I did not follow her, for I was very much confused, and had no one in the house—she left the shop hastily—she lived a very little way from us—I am confident there was 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. gone—6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was in copper—there was some copper remaining in a bowl at the further end of the till, which she could not get at—when my husband came home I went to the prisoner's house—she put her fist in my face, and told me to get out, or she would kick me out—I said if she would give me up the money I should not proceed against her, or I should give her in charge—she said she would kick me if I did not go—an hour after I gave her into custody.</p>

He has known me three years, and therefore I think you will take his evidence before Martin's; he will nay that the tools were constantly passing from my hands to his. It is two miles off; and it would be impossible for me to go two miles there and two miles back in the time he stated at the Police Court. I am innocent. Nothing was found in my possession.

               <p>I am a married woman, I had the care of this house, No. 2, Chesterfield-street; this man, the prisoner, came and rung at the bell between eight and nine o'clock, the carpenter was gone to breakfast; he asked me if the carpenter was up stairs at work; I said, I believed he was; and as I had not heard him go out that morning, I went up stairs to see if he was gone; I said, the carpenter was gone to breakfast; he said that did not signify, he only came for a few tools he promised to lend him; he stooped down and filled his basket; I opened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140107"></xptr>the door, and let him out, and never saw him for a fortnight after; the carpenter came and told me a man was taken that answered all the description I had given of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; can you swear to him? A. I can swear to the prisoner from a thousand; I am sure he is the very same man.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Woolley). Q. Have you ever found the tools? - A. No; I searched among all the pawnbrokers; I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

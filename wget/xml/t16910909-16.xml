The Evidence was numerous, who deposed in the general, that the Prisoner was a Person of a very Rude behaviour, and had beat his Wife upon the Breast, back and Belly, by kicking and striking her, insomuch that she was very much Bruised in several parts of her Body, of which she complained to her Neighbours when she lay languishing upon her Death-Bed, and to some Ministers that came to visit her; and just as she was departing the World, the Prisoner came to kiss her, but she immediately screekt out and refused to Imbrace him: After which he said, That he had done her wrong, but it was chiefly the Devil that put him on; besides this, he had Tore her with some Instrument in her Privy parts, in a most horrid manner, and when she died she laid her Death to her Husband, &amp;c. He oftentimes threatned the Neighbours to do them a mischief whensoever they reproved his Insolency,   they witnessed against him: But the Prisoner alledged, That his Wife had been sick before, and called several Witnesses, who seemed to say, That it was Malice in the Prosecutors.

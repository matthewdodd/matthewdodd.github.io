                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper in partnership with Joseph Harvey, in Westminster-road. The prisoner was in our employ between seven and eight years—in consequence of missing something, I went to his lodging, 33, Isabella-street, and saw his wife—I saw a Brussels carpet on the floor, the pattern of which was recognised—we believed it to be ours—we came back, had him called up stairs, and questioned him about</p>

               <p>his being married, and asked what furniture be bad—among other things he named a carpet—we asked what kind—he said Brussels—we asked what colour—he said a kind of drab ground—we asked him where he got it—he said his wife bought it somewhere in Holborn—we asked what she gave—he said, "I do not know exactly, about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or something, it was second-hand"—my partner asked if he could not tell the number of it, and the name of the man who made it, and if his wife said she did not buy it, what would he say—he said "I will tell you the truth about the carpet; I took it, it was three remnants, and my wife made it up"—we took him, and I went to the house and took the carpet—and in a sofa bedstead we found a hearth rug, with our private mark on it.</p>

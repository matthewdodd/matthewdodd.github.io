                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister, and am one of the directors of the Medical, Legal, and General Mutual Life-Assurance Society, to which the prisoner filled the situation of secretary and actuary, from 1846, when it was completely registered—he had been employed previously to that—in conse<lb></lb>quence of circumstances that attracted the attention of the directors, the prisoner was suspended, I think, on 18th April—I went through the accounts with him on 24th April, after his suspension—he had the account of premiums and the interest account—I went through the interest account with him—this is the ledger—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at page 136 here is an entry headed "Interest on Shares"—amongst the entry of paid dividends, here is a dividend entered as paid to Dr. Chalmers—I do not think I called over these names to the prisoner—I had been through the account previously by myself, and I said to him, "Mr. Morris, here are several entries here of money paid for interest for which I have no vouchers"—he said, "The vouchers, I think, are in the iron safe"—this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is the form of a receipt used in reference to the payment of dividends due on 31st Dec.—this account in the book refers to dividends due at that period—this form is a voucher to our bakers who pay it—this came to us as one of the vouchers for the paid dividends—this, to the best of my recollection, is one of the vouchers which I found in the iron safe—I had possessed myself of them before, though the prisoner did not know it—there were other payments entered in the book for which no vouchers were found—there was a further investigation, the prisoner's attention was called to it, and he resigned—the directors accepted his resignation—the filling up of this receipt is in the prisoner's handwriting, and here is his signature to it as attesting witness to its genuineness—the prisoner putting his name would be to attest the correctness of the document, and that the signature is that of the person receiving the dividend, but not that saw him sign it—this document being taken to Messrs. Praed's would be paid as a check, and come back to us as our voucher—the bankers would not pay it without the prisoner's signature—here is an account for Stallard, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; T. W. Fletcher, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Davies, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and Richard Hey, of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these others are similar documents purporting to be signed in the same way, all filled up by the prisoner and witnessed by him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have referred to the ledger in which there is reference to half-yearly dividends being paid to Dr. chalmers, in whose handwriting is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The handwriting of Nixon the clerk</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210096"></xptr>
               <p>—the name of Fletcher and the whole account is in the writing of Nixon I be<lb></lb>lieve—when I read over the ledger to the prisoner, I read the items put in by Nixon—the deed of settlement directs the books to be kept by the prisoner—Nixon was a clerk in the office, and he had access to the strong box—it was the duty of the secretary and actuary to keep the key—Nixon would only get it by applying to him—I think there was no counterfoil to these vouchers kept—the prisoner never made a representation to me that there should be a counterfoil—the prisoner did not make the Company—I should think it was made by the medical gentlemen, I do not know that he was their agent—when these became vouchers they were filled up and kept in a bundle—I do not know where they were kept in blank—the prisoner was the resident actuary; if he were absent, Nixon remained in the office—the prisoner went an excursion in Aug. 1846—I had occasion to reprimand him once when he was absent a whole day—Nixon remained in the outer office—the receipts were to be made out when they became due, if an application were made for them they would be paid, if the actuary were there—I do not know that these receipts were left unsigned—I have never known them to be left filled up—an account was made out of who the dividends were to be paid to—I do not know that, with the exception of the word "witness," these forms were left out filled up, in possession of any person in the office—(<hi rend="italic">Form read</hi>)—"Re<lb></lb>ceived the 5th of Feb., 1848, of the Medical, Legal, and General Life Insur<lb></lb>ance Society, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for half a year's interest, due 31st of Dec, 1847.—Signed, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM CHALMERS</hi>, proprietor; <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, R. W. <hi rend="smallCaps">MORRIS</hi>. "—these receipts never ought to have been given but by the defendant—there was not another clerk under Nixon—there was a messenger called Richard, who is in the office now—I never heard that Nixon and Richard had a key of the strong box—they had no authority to have such a key—Nixon left on 2nd May—he was called to account and resigned—his resignation was accepted—he confessed to the directors that he had received a premium which he had not entered—I suppose he pocketed the money—these forms were kept filled up, but the "witness" ought to be put to it only at the time of the application.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose an application had been made to Nixon, and the proprietor got this form, and left his signature, when the defendant came, and saw this, and believed it to be William Chalmer's signature, he would be entitled to sign it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if he believed it to be his signature—Dr. Chalmers would take this to the banker's, and there receive the money, if it had the actuary's signature to it—I do not know that our actuary has been in the habit of advancing the money instead of giving these orders—I have not sanctioned his cashing these orders; he would have no authority to do it—it would prevent there being a check from the banker's—if a customer were to say, "Will you be kind enough to give me the money for this?" if he were to do so, he would do it on his own authority, because we should have the document.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he never authorized to issue these with his own name, as witness, previous to the signature of the proprietor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but in two instances my mother-in-law and sister could not attend for their dividend, I received it for them, and guaranteed to the directors the genuineness of their signatures—those were the only two instances—I cannot charge my memory whether the prisoner signed them before I got the signatures of my relations attached to them, or afterwards—I did not request him to send one of these documents witnessed to Mr. Dolman, or to anvbody else—Mr. Dolman has a brother</p>

               <p>residing in London, who is a medical practitioner, and I made an application that the brother in the country might receive it through his brother—I have not taken any step to produce Nixon here—I have suggested that it was right he should be here—I heard you intimate that he (Nixon) was pro<lb></lb>bably the person who had committed these acts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know, that in consequence of that suggestion, a subpœna has been issued, and an endeavour made to find Nixon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it has—I did not, in the instance of those two relations of mine, ask the prisoner to put his name before they had signed; but he trusted to me—if he did it, he did it knowing me to be a director—I firmly believe the sig<lb></lb>natures of Hey and Fletcher to these documents to be the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have no doubt that the signature, "R. W. Morris," is his writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt of that—I have no doubt that the writing of the body of both these documents is his—I am not equally sure about the signatures of the proprietors; I speak to it from my belief—I cannot divest myself of the belief that it is his writing—I have not heard that this has been shown to the messenger, and that he has declared it is not his writing—these signatures are not the prisoner's genuine writing; it is a feigned hand—I believe that from the general knowledge of the character of his writing—I have seen it for two years—it approaches very nearly to his ordinary writing—I have the same reason for my belief in the character of Fletcher's signature—I have the same belief of that from the character of his writing—I should say the "D" in "Davies," in this signature, is so very pecu<lb></lb>liar in the formation, that I could almost stake my belief on that only—I know that the body and the indorsement are his writing—I am not sure that I did not see him write this indorsement in Mr. Hey's case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and am one of the directors of this institution. I am acquainted with the prisoner's writing—I believe the signature to this receipt of Mr. Hey's is the prisoner's writing, and this of Mr. Fletcher also.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are these what you call his natural writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not quite—there is some concealment about them, but there is a strong character of his writing—I had a letter from the prisoner—it was shown me to-day by one of the witnesses—it brought the subject of the letter, I cannot say that it brought the character of his writing, to my mind—the answers I have given are founded on my knowledge of his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined. Q.</hi> Open the ledger at any part where there is a considerable portion of Nixon's writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Here is folio 36, which is all Nixon's, in his ordinary writing—I have never seen him write any other hand—he writes formally, not quickly—it is the handwriting of a schoolmaster—both he and the prisoner left on the 2nd May—the prisoner did not go out of the house that day, but he ceased from his office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner himself make complaints to the Society of the misconduct of Nixon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On one or two occasions he com<lb></lb>plained of his being dilatory and late—he did not do all that he could to get Nixon turned away to my knowledge—I have an impression that on one or two occasions Nixon's conduct in not opening the office till late, and not keeping the windows clean, and so on, were made subjects of complaint.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant in the Commercial Bank of London, in Henrietta-street. In Feb. last the prisoner kept an account there—on 18th Feb. I have an entry to the prisoner's account, amounting to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was composed of different drafts, as follows: 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these amongst others made up 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid in to his credit—I think the whole amount paid in, were drafts on Praed and Co., with the exception of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—these three drafts bear the stamp of our Bank, denoting they were paid in there.</p>

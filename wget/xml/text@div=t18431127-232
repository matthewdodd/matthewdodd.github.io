                  </hi>. I live in Pump-row, Old-street. On the 18th of Nov. I met the prisoner—I had two half-sovereigns in my trowsers pocket—I did not go to bed with her, but was with her about five minutes—immediately she left I missed my money—I came out, and described her to the policeman—he took her—I am sure she is the person—there was another person in the room, but she left—I picked up a half-sovereign when she was taken—it was half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 230.) On Saturday night, the 18th of Nov., I was on duty in West-street—I was told of this—I went and saw the prisoner and another female going into the Coopers' Arms—I took the other, and the sergeant took Smith—I saw the prisoner swing her left hand round—I turned on my light, and picked up a half-sovereign—I am sure it was what she threw away—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>

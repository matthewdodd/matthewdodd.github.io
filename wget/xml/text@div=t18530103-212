I was in Woolwich, shopping—it was about half past 8 o'clock, or from that to a quarter to 9 o'clock—when I left home I took my purse; I had in it a sovereign and a crown-piece—after I left home, I lald the sovereign down at Mr. Reynolds', where I paid a small grocery bill—he gave me change for the sovereign, a half sovereign, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—there was one sixpence, one half crown, and I think the rest was shillings—I put them with the crown piece in my purse, in the pocket of this dress that I have on now—I went to Mr. Andrew's, a china dealer's shop in Hare-street; I was there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I had got this change, and put my purse in my pocket—about ten minutes after I was standing at Mr. Andrew's shop I went to a pastrycook's at Market-head, to purchase a bun, and I said I had lost my purse—that was the first time I missed it—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), it has some of my work in it—I saw it again at the station—my mother was out that evening.</p>

            </rs>. The Evidence against him was, first, That he led a very ill Life, having married another Woman; That his first Wife having been in the Country, he in the said Month of March sent for her up, caused her to lodge several Days at a House near Knights-Bridge; That about the Time she was Murdered he was known to go out with her, and that she was never more seen alive by any. It appear'd also, there was an old Grudge between them; for he upon the Discourse of sending for her, said, if they came together there would be Murder; that he offer'd 5 l. to one Young Fellow to prevail to lye with her, by which means he might have a Pretence for a Divorce. Many other very strong Circumstances were against him, and he himself making little or no Defence; Pretending, if his Tryal might be put off till the Morrow, he could produce more Witnesses: but he having had a considerable time to prove them, as being brought to Newgate before the last Sessions, it appeared to be only an Excuse.

I was present here on the trial of Owen Sullivan on the indictment now produced—I was examined, and so was Mr. Pearce, and then the prisoner was called—he was sworn and gave evidence (<hi rend="italic">See p.</hi> 100)—he said that he had known Sullivan for the last two years, and had been living in the same lodging-house with him all that time, 21, Mint Street, Borough, and that he had never been away more than three nights at a time—the alleged day of the robbery was 13th April—he said that Sullivan was with him in the lodging-house at 8.30 that night, and remained there all night—the Judge examined him—he said that the clock was in the next room to the kitchen, and that he went out and saw the time when the man came in—the prisoner appeared sober.</p>

I live at 12, Windsor Terrace—on 13th April, about 8.45 p.m., I was in the Great Dover Road, and as I passed Leicester House Sullivan seized me at the back of my neck, and as he pulled me round, two others pinnioned my arms while they took my watch and my money—there was a light—I am quite sure Sullivan is the man who seized me—I gave evidence in the other Court and he was tried for the offence—this prisoner was examined, and said that he was in their lodging at 8.30, and remained there during the night, and that the prisoner had been there ever since he had been there—the Judge said, "Has ho not been absent during that period?"—he said, "Three days, not longer," ever since he had been there—the Judge asked him if there was a clock in the room—he said that there was, but not in the kitchen where he was—I think he said that he looked at it, but I am not positive.</p>

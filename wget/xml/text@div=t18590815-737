                  </hi>. I live in Pell-street—I sell tea and coffee—I have known the prisoner between three and four years—he came to my house on 18th June and inquired for Mr. Gibbons who used to lodge in the house—he asked me if I knew him—I said, yes, and that he was gone away—I had no quarrel with the prisoner—I saw him again on Monday, 20th June, in Jer<lb></lb>myn-street,</p>

               <p>about 1 o'clock—I felt something, and heard the report of a pistol—I put my hand behind me and felt blood running down from my neck—I staggered, and should have fallen, had not a gentleman caught hold of me—I saw the prisoner as I was falling, and saw him in the act of throwing the pistol in the road—I became nearly unconscious, but I heard him say that he meant to do it, or intended to do it, or words to that effect—I was taken to the police-station, and then to Marlborough-street, and after that to the hospital—I was attended there for a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Newington, and am a waiter—I was in Jermyn-street about half past 1 o'clock that day—I heard the report of a pistol—I walked across the road and the prisoner threw it down—I took it up and it was warm—the prisoner was about three yards off—I went towards him—he said, "I have done it, and I give myself up"—he did not say anything about the pistol going off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 20th June I went to the prosecutrix at the police-station—I examined her—I found a black spot at the back of her neck, about the size of a shilling—it was scorched, or burnt—it did not appear very deep at the moment—it was deep enough to destroy the outer skin—I saw no blood—it must have been caused by a pistol being discharged—it smelt of powder, just as one might expect from the wadding of a pistol.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see the pistol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it had the appearance of having been loaded—it was impossible for me to tell whether there had been a shot or a bullet; I think the wound must have been caused by wadding—if it had been loaded with shot or a bullet, it must have struck her.</p>

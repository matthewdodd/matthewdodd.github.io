                  </hi>. I am now living at Boundary Terrace, Camberwell—my father, Joshua Gamble, died in 1859; he also resided at Camberwell—at that time I was at the gold diggings in Australia—I have a brother named Henry still living, and a sister married to a Mr. Giffard—I received a communication in Australia from my brother about my father's death; that was about the middle of 1860—there was some information in that letter as to how the money was left—I returned from Australia last April, and shortly afterwards met my brother-in-law, Mr. Giffard—in conse<lb></lb>quence of some conversation I had with him I went to the defendant's house—at the time of my coming to England I had not received any money under my father's will—I think it was at the end of last September that I went to the defendant's house with Mr. Giffard—I saw the defendant, and had some conversation with him—I asked him where was my share of the legacy that my father left—he said, "I paid it, and all the papers are burnt"—I said, "Who did you pay it to"—he said, "Into a bank"—I said, "On whose account, and what bank"—he said he did not know—he next said he paid it to my brother Henry at Hereford—I was not satisfied with that—he said, "Well, rather than pay it, I will lay and rot in prison," but he did not say, "not pay it again," there was no "again" at the end of it; it was, "rather than pay it"—I then went to Mr. Chance, the Magistrate, and he gave me instructions to take a constable—I don't know that the defendant went anywhere or did anything after saying he would rot in prison—)<hi rend="italic">paper produced</hi>)—I have not seen this paper before; wait a moment—I beg pardon; no—he went upstairs and got some papers, a paper signed in lead pencil—I am very short-sighted—no; I have never seen this before—I am sure he went upstairs and got the papers; that was the second time I saw him—I went twice to his house, but the second time he went to get the papers from upstairs or his room—I am positive this is not the paper I saw at Lambeth Police-court.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On Tuesday, 1st of September, I was on Tower Hill with Halse, and saw the two prisoners and a man not in custody about three o'clock in the afternoon—I saw a cart there—Sweeney went to the tail part of the cart and took this glass case containing a stuffed bird, from behind and put it under his coat—he then ran across into Rosemary Lane, followed by Sullivan and the other man—we followed them some little distance, and then Sweeney gave it to Sullivan, and Sullivan put it underneath his coat—just before they got to Dock Street, Sullivan gave it back to Sweeney again, and they went into the Star public-house in Dock Street—I followed and took Sullivan into custody and Halse took Sweeney—Sullivan said "What do you want me for, I have not done anything"—I brought him into the bar, and Sweeney said he knew nothing about it: he had not seen it before—after we got to the police-station he said he gave 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, to a man who was going hop picking—I went on to Tower Hill, but the horse and cart were gone.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective.</hi>) I was with Keniston on Tower Hill, and saw the two prisoners and another man—I saw Sweeney go behind a cart that was standing there, and take this case out and run across into Rosemary Lane, followed by Sullivan and the other man—when in Rosemary Lane Sweeney gave it to Sullivan who put it under his coat and carried it some distance—I followed them to the corner of Dock Street where Sullivan gave it back to Sweeney and they all three went into a public-house—I spoke to a uniform man, and we went into the public-house—the other man made a rush out—I caught hold of Sweeney—he pushed the case under the seat in the bar.—I said "I want you"—he said "What for?"—I said "You will be charged with two other men with stealing this case from a cart on Tower Hill"—he said—"I never saw it before"—I took him to the station and when the charge was read over to him by the inspector, he said "I bought it for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of a man who was going hopping."</p>

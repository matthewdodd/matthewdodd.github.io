            , his master.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WASP. The prisoner was in my service, and entrusted to receive postage of letters and monies paid at my shop. On the 19th of June I showed the prisoner this letter, and asked if the words "paid 9d." on it was his writing - he said Yes, and I knew it to be his; he did not say who took the letter in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is the postage money put? A. Into a till, but this letter never belonged to me; if we have wanted change for the shop, I have known it taken from the postage at times, for a few minutes, but not often. I have kept the office twenty years; I do not believe it has been done twenty times in those twenty years.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. At what time do you close your box? A. At five o'clock; if a letter is brought after that it is left on the desk for the bellman, who calls at six o'clock; the money is laid on the letter for the postman to take away with him.</p>

This letter is my writing (looking at it) - it is addressed to Mr. Talliser, Lynn, Norfolk; it is only dated Thursday afternoon; I believe it was on the 12th of June - I took it myself to Mr. Wasp's receiving-house; it might be before five o'clock, but I think it was between five and six o'clock - I took it into the shop: if it was after five o'clock I should pay 10d. for it; if before, only 9d.; I paid the postage to somebody in the shop - I cannot say to whom.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the place open to every body in the shop? A. Yes. The prisoner went home to dinner every day; the board is behind the counter - customers cannot go there.</p>
               <p>MRS. WASP. I had never seen the letter before it was found and had nothing to do with the postage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask the servant about the key? A. No - it might be lost for three or four months; I never knew the boy seal the bags alone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Letters which are brought after five o'clock are put on a cutting board close to the door with the money on them, for the postman; anybody could take the money, and if brought before five, it is put into a box which is never locked; I recollect once there was 6d. or a 1s. too much in the drawer; the son asked Mrs. Wasp if she knew of it; she told him to look behind the desk to see if any letters had fallen down.</p>
               <p>MR. WASP. When a letter comes after five o'clock, it is put on the first counter, which is not near the door; people who bring them generally know where to lay them.</p>

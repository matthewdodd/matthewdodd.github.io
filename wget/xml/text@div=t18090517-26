            , a constable - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call on him on Thursday the 2nd of March - A. Yes; and in consequence of what past between us on the Saturday, after I went to the flatting mills in Wild-street, Drury-lane, I saw Mr. Miller, I told him I wanted to purchase a few goods, meaning bad shillings and six-pences; Mr. Miller readily gave me one bad shilling and two good six-pences; I gave him one good shilling for them. We appointed to meet again the same evening at the Lemon Tree public house, at the top of the Hay-market; he said he would meet me there with half a piece, he thought he could make up meaning half a guinea; if he should disappoint me, he would meet me on the Monday following, at the Hog in the Pound, in Oxford-street; then we parted. On Monday morning I received two good shillings from Mr. Burton, they were marked; I received directions from him. I went to the Hog in the Pound on Monday morning at ten o'clock. I took the two marked shillings with me. The prisoner met me within ten minutes of the time he appointed.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you when you met at the Hog in the Pound - A. I asked him if he had got the goods ready, meaning two guineas worth, he said no; I said when will they be ready, Mr. Miller; he said about two o'clock this afternoon, I said have you none now, he said I think I have nine; I said I would take four, he gave them to me; the four in the street, not in the public house. We first met in the public house and drank there, we came out together. I gave him the two good shillings that I had of Mr. Burton, marked, and he gave me the four. We walked down Oxford-street, a little way further.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were going along the street, did you see Burton - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any signal been agreed upon between you and Burton - A. Upon my seeing of Burton, I touched the right side of my bonnet; Mr. Miller and I went into the next wine vaults to have something to drink; Burton came in directly and took Miller and me into custody; he searched me, and took from me the four bad shillings; I had put them into my pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you any bad shillings in your pocket before you saw Miller - A. No, I had not; he took and put us all three in a coach together; he said where did you get these, I answered from Mr. Miller.</p>

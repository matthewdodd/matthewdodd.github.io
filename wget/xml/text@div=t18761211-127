                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and carry on business' at Cutler Street, Houndsditch—McCarthy had been in my employ about five months before the 5th of November—his duties were to take parcels out—he never sold; my wife and I sold—on the 5th November, in consequence of my suspicions, I went to Bishopsgate Street police-station, and in the presence of Thomas Roper marked fourteen sovereigns, fifteen half-sovereigns, six half-crowns, and some smaller silver—I placed them in my cashbox in my bed-room—I left the cashbox unlocked; also the door of the bedroom—this was about 9.45 in the morning—I went into my bedroom about 12.15, and</p>

               <p>on looking into my cashbox I missed one of the marked sovereigns and one of the marked half-crowns—I went for a police-constable and gave McCarthy into custody at my other shop—I have two shops—that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sovereign and the half-sovereign—in the evening I was sent for to the police-station by a constable—I went there, and saw McCarthy in the cell—he said to me "If you don't go hard against me, I'll tell you where some of your property is"—I said "It is a thing I cannot promise and I must not promise; I might be placed in the same position that you are"—he said "You have been a very good master to me, and I am very sorry. You'll find some of your property at Howe's, Gravel Lane, the coal shed; there is four sheets and four tablecloths; I sold them two or three days ago for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the man said 'Get as many as you can'"—I then went with the con<lb></lb>stable to No. 117, Gravel Lane; he knocked at the door—Howe looked out of the window; he said to Roper "Is that you, Barney?"—the constable answered "Yes"—Howe came down and opened the door—there were two constables—I believe the constable said "<hi rend="italic">Davy</hi>, I have come here; you have bought some goods of <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> named Dennis McCarthy"—Howe said "I have not"—I then asked leave to go upstairs—he said "Yes, you may go upstairs"—we went up—directly I got into the room I went over to the bed—I found two sheets belonging to me, with my private mark upon them—the private mark is the cost price—Howe was present—Roper said "Have you got any tablecloths?"—Howe replied "We havn't got any such thing in the place"—Roper found a cupboard, and asked for the keys—he there found five or six more of my sheets—they then proceeded to search generally and found some tablecloths, pillow cases, toilet covers, a table cover, pillow slips, and jacket—I have seen them all at the police-station—they all have my private mark on them—they are all my property—I have been missing things for the last four or five months, both money and goods—none of those goods had been sold by me—McCarthy had no authority to sell at all—they were taken from 25, Cutler Street—that is about four minutes' wait from Gravel Lane—the value of the lot was about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., cost price—I have sold no linen sheets for the last four months—after all this property had been found, Howe said "My late wife bought the sheets seven, eight, or ten years back"—he said nothing with reference to the other property.</p>

I am son of the prisoner Howe—I live with him; I have lived in the same house for some considerable time—I have seen the different articles that have been produced to-day and also at the police-court—the name of my uncle, my mother's brother, was Patrick Foley—I recollect his coming. home from America on more than one occasion; I remember his coming three times—the last time he came home was about four years next summer—he used to deal in all kinds of articles; not one article in particular—I recollect seeing sheets, blankets, pillow cases, boots, stockings, comforters; all kinds of other articles in the drapery line which he used to take over to America—about four years ago he took some stock<lb></lb>ings, comforters, sheets, blankets, pillow cases, and other articles—I saw these things packed up—he is dead now—he has not been over since that time—I have seen the sheets which were produced here to-day; they are marked with my father's name—I recognise those sheets as being in daily use in our house for the past three or four years—my father's name is in full upon some and his initials on others—the different articles, including the light and dark blue stockings, I have seen there about four years; since my uncle went away—my mother is dead now; she assisted my uncle in making purchases, to my knowledge—I never saw my uncle buy anything, as I used to stay at home—I have seen them brought home—I have seen the prisoner McCarthy in our house—there is a lad named Driscoll connected with my father, and I know that McCarthy and he were keeping company together—he was a friend of McCarthy's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The last time I saw McCarthy at my father's house was—he brought nothing with him—I have never known him bring anything to my father's house—I swear that—it was generally in the afternoon about evening when he came—he never came to see my father—I knew that my during the Jews' holidays; I can't say exactly; about two or three months ago father had some china in his house; it came from Defines; my uncle bought it—my uncle and my mother went to the sale about twelve years ago—I know they went, because I was in when they returned—I shall be twenty-one next September—when the china was bought I was about nine—it was brought in in baskets; I—was in the house when it came—I swear that the stockings were in my father's possession about four years ago—my mother bought some of them down Whitechapel Road, (<hi rend="italic">stockings produced</hi>). I identify them—I can swear to them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I have known the prisoner Howeforsome years; I recollect his brother-in-law coming from America on one occasion—I re<lb></lb>collect him particularly, because he was taken to the station for making a disturbance; I never saw him in the possession of any property at any time—I do not recollect any bundles at all; I do not recollect seeing him one evening with some bundles; I do not recollect stopping him to see how he</p>

               <p>came by them. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here asked leave to make a statement, which, was granted by the Court</hi>). On Thursday last, Howe came to my house, and said "Davis, of course, you have known me for years?"—I said "I have"—he said "I want you to do something for me"—I said "What is that?"—he said "I want you to go and say that my brother-in-law came home four years ago from South America, and that you stopped him with three bundles which were on the top of a cab, and that these bundles, when you stopped him, contained stockings, guernseys, scarves, and other things"—I said "Well, I don't see how I can say that"—he said "Very well, you will, perhaps, consider of it, and I will see you again"—on Sunday night last he came to my place about 9 o'clock; I live at 27, Red Cross Street, Cripplegate—he then said "If you will only say what I said to you the other night it will get me out of this trouble, and I'll make you a present of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." which he offered to me in a purse—I said "No; perhaps, you had better see me another time"—he said "Where will you make the appoint<lb></lb>ment? anywhere you like?"—I said "Of course, I am not going to do anything to get myself into trouble to save you, but if you like, you can <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> me at 10.30 to morrow in front of the Mansion House; he met me there, and asked me to go to the European public-house; he again offered me the purse—I communicated the circumstances to Mr. Carter, my in<lb></lb>spector—yesterday afternoon Howe saw me again—he said "I wish you would come, those b——b——when they searched my place wasn't clever enough; I've got a stocking at home which they left behind when they were searching"—I then said "Will you wait a moment; I want to go to the back"—he followed me out, and again offered me this purse (<hi rend="italic">producing purse</hi>)—I said "No, I won't take it"—we went into the bar again—he then said "You can get me out of trouble; this is a purse containing 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "and he asked me to try this gold ring on (<hi rend="italic">producing ring</hi>)—"That fits you very nice," he said, "You can keep it till I ask you for it, and that will be a long time; wait a minute, and I will go and fetch the other things"—he brought back a stocking, and said "take this stocking"—I said "What is this for?"—he said "So as you will be able to swear to the other things"—I said "I suppose you want to get me into trouble, and get me five years for perjury"—he said "If you will get me out of this trouble, I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more."—I thought it was my duty to make this statement.</p>

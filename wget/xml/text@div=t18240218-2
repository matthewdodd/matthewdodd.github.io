On Thursday, the 11th of December, the prisoner came to the shop, accompanied by a young woman, who asked for some cloth to make a pelisse; she had had a pattern in the morning - the cloth was taken down. I asked how much she wanted; she said,</p>
               <p>"Enough for a pelisse, how much will it take;" I said two yards and a half; she said she wished to have a cape - I said a quarter more would do. She did not seem satisfied with the quantity, and the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I will have a waistcoat off it, and you may as well cut three yards and a half," which was done. It came to 2 l. 9 s. The prisoner threw a 5 l. note down on the counter, which I took up; he said,</p>
               <p>"Here give me change of this" - I suspected it to be forged, and asked his name and address - he said, Stevens or Stevenson, No. 218, Tottenham Court-road, which I wrote on the note, with L. L., my husband's initials. (Looks at a note.) this is it; it has</p>
               <p>"Mr. Stevens, 218, Tottenham Court-road, L. L.," on it. I called my son, and told him in the prisoner's presence, to get change, and said something to him to Hebrew - I gave him the note; he went out with it, and was gone above a quarter of an hour. Mr. Levy said the boy stopped a long time; I spoke to him in Hebrew - he then opened the door and went out, and in a few minutes the prisoner also went out, and returned to the door in about a minute, and said to the woman,</p>
               <p>"I cannot stop for the change, you stop and take it, and I will meet you by and by;" he went away. The note was brought back by my brother-in-law; I told the woman it was forged - she still remained in the shop, and was afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you certain that I said Stevens or Stevenson, or did I say Simpson - A. No, he said Stevens.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked what name you should put on it, I said,</p>
               <p>"Put Simpson on it, it is a note I took of a person of that name, who lives in Tottenham Court-road - A. I am certain that he said nothing of the sort. I am certain that he is the man.</p>
               <p>LYON LEVY. I am a clothes salesman. The prisoner came to our shop on Thursday evening, the 11th of December, between 6 and 7 o'clock, with a girl - I was in the parlour, and remained there till Mrs. Levy called me to cut three yards and a half of cloth - I cut it off and tied it up. He threw the note down, and said,</p>
               <p>"Give me change of this." Mrs. Levy asked his name and address; he gave it, Stevens or Stevenson, Tottenham Court-road; I do not recollect the number, but my wife wrote it on the note immediately; she spoke to me in Hebrew, and gave the note to my son, who went out with it, and was gone a quarter of an hour, but before that I went out, and the prisoner followed me, and saw me at the corner of the street, and said,</p>
               <p>"I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180004"></xptr>stop, but will go and tell Mrs. Levy to give the change to the girl;" he went back, and came out; and suspecting him, I followed him down towards St. Clement's church, then turned back again towards my house, but did not go into Hollywell-street; he went into a public-house in the Strand, and came out in an instant with another man - they went towards New church, and crossed over to Somerset House. I ran back to see if my son had returned with the note; I saw him, ran back, and found the prisoner standing at Somerset House gateway, talking to a man. I said he must come back for there was something not right in the change of the note - I insisted on his coming back: he said,</p>
               <p>"I shall be back in a quarter of an hour;" I said,</p>
               <p>"You must come back now," he said</p>
               <p>"If I must I must," and went quietly with me. I found the woman in the shop - nothing was said to him. An officer came instantly, and took them both. The woman was afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had I not plenty of time to go away - A. He did not attempt to go; I think he could not have got away if he had attempted. He was never out of my sight after I accosted him.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 9th of December, he came and asked me to give him change for a 5 l. note. I asked what he was doing; he said he was selling cloth on commission, and had business in the neighbourhood, and could not get change. He lived with his father, who kept a wine-vaults, when I knew him, which was twelve years ago, and after that he was a police officer. He said he had been asking at several shops for change, and could not get it, and believed they thought the note was a bad one. I gave him change, and asked his address - he said,</p>
               <p>"No. 27, Tottenham Court-road," which I wrote on the note; (looking at one,) this is it; it has</p>

               <p>"Never mind, let me have a sovereign, and the difference of another sovereign, and give me the rest on Sunday, when I intend having the honour of dining with you." I gave him 1 l. 17 s.; he said he would come on Sunday, and that he was happy to inform me he had got a situation of 20 s. a week in the West India Docks, and expected to have his wages raised in about six weeks. I gave the note to my wife, and somebody came to me next day, and on Saturday he came himself, and got his full change from my wife - I did not expect him on Saturday; he did not come on Sunday. My wife gave me the note again, and on the Monday following, I paid it away at the West of England fire-office. I had no other 5 l. note, and know it to be the same.</p>

            ," in my writing upon it. It remained there from Thursday till Monday not mixed with any other 5 l. note, and on Monday I gave it to my husband, to pay at the Insurance-office. I saw the prisoner at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180005"></xptr>house on the evening on which he paid the note. I knew him before. He came again on Saturday night, and I gave him the rest of the change.</p>

            . I am an inspector of notes of the Bank of England, and have been so above twenty-five years. (Looking at the note uttered to the prosecutor;) this is forged in every respect, paper, plate, and is not the signature of Whiting, which it purports to bear - there is a clerk of that name, but he never signs 5 l. notes. The three others are also all forged in every respect, and are all four from the same plate.</p>

               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. What has been his business during the last year - A. I do not know his employment; he called on me a fortnight before his apprehension, and appeared distressed, and asked for relief - I gave him 1 s.; he said he should be happy to take a potboy's place - that he had not broken his fast for twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what his occupation has been for the last two years - A. I was only acquainted with him by meeting him about. His father lived near me fifteen years ago.</p>
               <p>MR. SCRIVENER. I knew him fifteen years ago. I never heard a flaw in his character before this.</p>

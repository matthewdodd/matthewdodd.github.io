On the 20th of January, about ten at night, my maid came and told me four boys had been at my shop (my wife keeps a haberdasher's shop) and had stole some stockings: I went home immediately: I mist two pair of stockings and an odd one; they had dropt the fellow stocking in going out. On the Monday following, being the 23 d, the maid came and told me she had got one of the boys; I went home; the boy confessed where they had sold the stockings for 2 s. in Monmouth-street. I went with him there, and he showed me the cellar. While I went down to speak to the woman, the boy ran away. He was neither of the prisoners; his name is

My mistress asked the two first whether the others belonged to them, after they came in; they said no. I ran out, but could see none of them; when I came in again, there lay one stocking that they had dropt.

He came the next day for it, I took hold of him and sent for my master; he came and got a constable; then he owned he was in the shop when the stockings were taken, but said he did not take them, but if we would let him go, he would bring the boys that did take them. We took him before the Justice, there he told where the other boys were to be taken: he said they were

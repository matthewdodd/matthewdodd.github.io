                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Scace, a pastrycook, of No.22, New Road, St. George's-in-the-East. On Saturday, 12th Feb., the prisoner came and asked for two lemons; he offered me three halfpence for two, which I agreed to—he gave me a half crown—I tried it with my teeth, found it was bad, and returned it to him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); here are three marks of my teeth—he was quite sober—my husband gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, living at the Sailors' Home, Wells Street, London Docks. On Saturday, 20th Feb., I was at Mr. Scace's shop, and saw the prisoner and another man together walking on the pavement on the other side to the shop—the other man said, "That shop will do,"but did not point to any shop—the prisoner then crossed over to Scace's shop, and the other followed him and stood outside—the prisoner came out and looked round; a policeman came up, and he ran away, and threw a piece of money over the railway arch, and I saw something like a half crown in his hand—Iafterwards went with the policeman, searched the place, and saw a butcher pick up this counterfeit coin and give it to the constable.</p>

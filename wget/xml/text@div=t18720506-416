                  </hi>. I am a signalman on the District Railway—on 11th April, about 8.30 in the morning, I was on duty in my signal box, and saw the prisoner handling a pair of points for about five or six minutes, on the West London Extension Railway—he was about fifty yards from me—I saw him stoop and pick up something close by the points where he was standing and working the handle—I saw him put it between the points, I could not tell what it was until I went to it afterwards—he then left those points and went in the direction of another pair of points on the West London Railway—I could not see what he did there on account of some trucks of coal standing in the way—I then saw him go over a fence six feet high—I called the attention of Lansdale, one of the plate layers—I got out of my box, and went to the first pair of points, and saw the clinker there—I and Lansdale followed the prisoner over the fence into the road—Lansdale caught hold of him and said "If there was a policeman here I would give you in charge"—the prisoner said nothing to that—Lansdale told him that we had taken the clinker out of the points—he said he had only kicked his foot against it—there was a conversation with the prisoner and Lansdale—the prisoner was not then taken into custody—I believe he lived near there at a public-house—this is the clinker I took out (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I could not take it out without pushing the handle over; it was placed between the rails; the points were about two inches off from the metal on each side—that kept the points half-way open—after we came back, Lansdale and I went to the other pair of points, and there found this piece of brick in</p>

               <p>Between the points, which were also partially open—I have been on the railway there just on twelve months, and am familiar with the working of it; if a train had come by while these things were there, it would have been thrown off the rail—the line is sometimes used for passenger traffic, but mainly for goods; there are many trains in the course of an hour—one came up three minutes after we came back over the fence, we stopped it—it would not have been stopped unless I had known of the things being there—if the train had passed on without being stopped, it would have been thrown off the line at the points where the brick was—the points where the clinker was is not a point for trains—they are running about there shunting all day long—trains frequently pass over there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a platelayer, working on the West London Extension Railway—on the morning of 11th April, between 8 and 9 o'clock, Morrish called to me—I went to him, and in consequence of what he said I went after the prisoner—I saw him get over the fence before Morrish called to me—I caught him in the Fenelon Road, and Morrish came up—I said to the prisoner "What have you been doing with them points?"—he said "Nothing"—I said "You must have done, for I took this clinker out"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060027"></xptr>
               <p>he said "I did not mean to do it"—a policeman was coming along and I told him he had been doing something to the points, putting this in—he said "If you give him in charge I will lock him up"—I looked at the boy and said "I know where you work, therefore I will tell my foreman"—I let him go then—when Morrish called me I went with him and assisted in taking the clinker out—it was fixed tight in between the points—it was necessary to open the points to get it out—it could not have been kicked there or got there by accident—after letting the boy go I went back and assisted in taking the brick out—it was in the same position as the clinker—when the prisoner was getting over the fence he was not above ten or fifteen yards from where the brick was—I did not not actually see him at the point where the brick was found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew the prisoner by seeing him at Mr. Davis's—there are a quantity of clinkers like this about the line—I did not hear the prisoner say he had kicked it by accident—he said "I did not mean to do it"—I have been to Mr. Davis's to have beer, not very often—beer is not sent on the line to the gangers, it is not allowed, I never saw it done—I have heard of pots being left on the line for the boys to fetch, but I never saw it—there are coal wharfs near the line—I believe beer is sent to the men there—the pots are not left on the line, they may be on the wharf—this happened on Thursday, the boy was not given into custody till Saturday—I did not know that I was justified in locking him up before I told my foreman—I depended upon the information given me by Morrish—I did not see the boy do anything.</p>

I keep the Kensington Arms, Warwick Road, and have done so eighteen years—the prisoner was in my employment three weeks and five days—before that he was with Mr. Johns twelve months—I had a character from him—I found him a very steady; honest, truthful boy, everything I could wish—I send beer out to the men on the coal wharf, not on the railway; the railway men fetch it in cans, and when they are empty they lay them down and our lad collects them—they lay them down alongside the line very often—the coal wharf is near the line—it is a siding—they are in the habit of laying the empty cans and pots there, and the boy fetches them—the prisoner should go every morning at 8.30 and every afternoon at 2.30, collecting cans—on 11th April he went out as usual about 8.30, to collect the cans at the coal wharf and calling down on the side of the line—I know the spot where the clinker was found; it is no thoroughfare except for persons on business; it is not exposed to the public, persons can get there—there is a shunting there—the men lay cans, if they have them, in between the metals, or outside the metals, close to them—the prisoner returned about 9 o'clock—he did not tell me what had happened—he told my wife: she told me so on the Friday—I first heard of the charge then from the constable, Bradley—he was apprehended on Saturday night—I know Morrish, the signalman—I have frequently served him with beer—I can't say that he has mended cans for me, they have had them over at the signal-box—he has a fellow-servant who relieves him—I don't know his name—I never bad any conversation with Morrish about mending cans—he has asked me to send beer to him on credit, I refused—I told him I would not lend cans as well—he asked me why—I said "I am losing two or three dozen cans a week, on an average, and I shan't lend any more cans on The railway"—he said "B you and your cans too, you shall suffer for This"—I know the fence spoken of, it is a wooden one, the boy could climb up it.</p>

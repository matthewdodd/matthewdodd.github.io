                  </hi>. My husband's name is Thomas—we live at Col<lb></lb>chester-terrace, Stratford New Town; I let a lodging to Isaac Mason and the prisoner, his wife. On 13th June I went into my parlour, of which I keep the key myself, to a drawer, where my husband's clothes were kept, and they were gone—among the things that were gone there was a handkerchief—I called the prisoner into the parlour, and said, "Mrs. Mason, my husband's clothes is all stolen out of that drawer"—no one else had been in the room since, I had seen them safe on the Friday, and this was Monday—on the Wednesday I followed her to Mr. Phillips's, a pawnbroker at Stratford, and saw her put a ticket for a ring on the counter—the foreman said to me, in the prisoner's presence, "Mrs. Calvert, have you found your husband's clothes? "—I said, "I have not, but I have lost a silk handkerchief also, an old-fashioned one, yellow, with white spots; has any one brought you anything of that sort in pledge?"—be said, in the prisoner's presence, "Mrs. Mason has pledged one of that description," and produced this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—It is my husband's—I know it by a stain on it—the prisoner said, "Yes, Mrs. Calvert, it is yours; and I will pay you the money to get it out"—I gave her into custody.</p>

               <p>they often give us a great deal of trouble; and we can tell whether they have pawned before—I think the first time she came Mrs. Calvert was with her—I have seen her three times alone, and five or six times with Mrs. Calvert—I think she knew the value and importance of our tickets—there is another person in our shop, and we have both served her—when the handkerchief was produced, the prisoner said to Mrs. Calvert, "That is your husband's, and I did not pledge it"—she afterwards said, "I will take it out and pay for it."</p>

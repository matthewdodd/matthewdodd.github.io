                  </hi>. I am parish clerk, of Northam, in Devonshire. I know the prisoner perfectly well—I remember hit being married on 17th July, 1841, to Susan Sussex Judd—I was present—I produce a certificate which I have examined with the registry in the Church, in the presence of Mr. Peters, the Vicar—it is a correct copy—I was one of the witnesses, and signed the register—I saw the prisoner sign it—he appeared perfectly self-possessed—I was perfectly well acquainted with him—he had been in the habit of coming to my house—they lived there after their marriage, and had two children—I was present at the baptisms—on 21st June, I law the wife alive, and in the service of a clergyman at Topsham.</p>

I took the prisoner at his residence, adjoining the Kennington Schools, and told him it was for marrying Mr. Peters' daughter, his first wife being alive—on the way to the station, he said it was a bad job, and he did not think his first marriage was legal as he was not conscious what he was doing at the time—I said there were two children—he said, "Yes; but they were provided for.

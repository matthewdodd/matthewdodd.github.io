She took it home to her Husband, (the other Prisoner) and they together broke it open, and found in it several valuable Goods, about 40 l. in Money, some Bonds and other Writings.

They were apprehended, and confess'd the Particulars aforesaid. The Woman in her Defence said, that she expected a Box to come by the Bristol Carrier; and that when she had brought this Box home, and found that the Goods did not belong to them, she would have carry'd it back to the Inn; but her Husband swore he'd stab her if she did.

Upon which the Jury acquitted them of the Felony; and they were the next day indicted for a Trespass, in defrauding

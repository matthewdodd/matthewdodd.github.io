The prisoner came to the house on the 10th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock at night (Sunday), and asked if he could have a bed - seeing him respectable, I said he could - he said "How much is it;" I said sixpence - he pulled a purse out of his pocket, and held one end<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040054"></xptr>in the left hand, it appeared heavy; he pulled out sixpence and gave it to me - and said he wished to go to bed directly; I called up the servant, and told her to give him a bed to himself, for I thought he had a deal of money about him - he wished to be called at six o'clock - next morning I heard a bustle up-stairs, he had gone into the club-room - I had heard a bustle, and thought something was the matter, and had the door locked - I then heard him jump out of the window; my girl brought the sheet down to me folded up - I found the club-room window open, and the prisoner was gone; I had seen him that morning and told him it was the custom to stop every body in the morning while the girl went up to see if every thing was right - he said "Is that your custom?" and slipped from me, and went up-stairs, saying,"I have left something up-stairs, which I have forgot," and the next thing I heard was the servant scuffling with him - the sheet produced is mine.</p>

I am servant to Mrs. Tomlin - I was sent up to the prisoner's room, and missed the sheet immediately from his bed - there had been two sheets on the bed - I looked round the room to see if I could see it anywhere, and, on turning out of the room, the prisoner was standing on the stairs - I said, "Young man, you have got a sheet" - he said,"Yes; I have;" it laid on his shoulder - he said,"Don't say anything, and I will give you anything you like;" I said, Master had been robbed so much; I ran down, called out, "Lock the door, I have got the sheet, here it is;" he had unbuttoned his coat, and given it to me from his back on the stairs - I brought it to mistress - he opened the club-room window and jumped out into the street - the people called out,"Stop, stop him;" I ran out and caught him by the collar, and said "You vagabond, you shall not go;" I shook him, and assistance came and he was secured.</p>

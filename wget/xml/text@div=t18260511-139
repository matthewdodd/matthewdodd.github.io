On the 7th of April I met the prisoner, who was a stranger, at the tavern at the back of Portland-town; I went there between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and staid till about four in the afternoon; my father and mother, and some other persons were there drinking - the prisoner was there before, and drank with me - we took a walk in the fields; I was not drunk, and had my watch with me; she drew the watch out of my pocket; we did not keep walking all the time; I had my watch when I went out, and missed it on my return to the house.</p>

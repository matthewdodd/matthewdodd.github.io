            . I am an errand boy to Mr. Walker. I saw Mr. Walker's watch before Griffin, came in, he came in between two and three o'clock, on the 22nd of February, and directly Griffin was gone, we missed the watch; I went to Mr. Jones, the pawnbroker, and found that Griffin had pawned the watch there.</p>

               <p>PHILIP JONES. I produce the watch; I took it in pawn of the prisoner; in about three minutes after, Briggs came, and asked me if Griffin had been, and pawned a watch with me; I told him he had, he had pawned it in his own name; I have known Griffin ten or twelve years; I really believe he is not right in his mind, or else he would not have come to me that have known him so long. I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time this offence was committed I was in a state of intoxication, and when I am so I am in a state of insanity.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Was he a distressed man - A. I have every reason to suppose that he was distressed; I have heard his father say that he was insane at times.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Salmon and Cunningham, the prosecutors. On the 24th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160061"></xptr>September, I saw the prisoner Barrett in the machine-room knocking up some tallow with his fists - it was in a wrapper of paper - he asked me what made me come from dinner so soon - I left him, and went into a little room - he came there, and looked to see if we were looking at him - he asked if we had any money to lend him - we said, "No" - he then went out of the room and looked in the window, and then went down the court - we went up to the engine to see if the tallow was gone, and missed it - we then went out, and met a workman at the bottom of the court - I saw Mr. Smith in the shop - I did not see any tallow in the possession of Barrett, out of my master's premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever tallow you saw elsewhere, how can you tell it belonged to your master? A. Because I had seen it in the machine-room, and it is particular tallow which we use - I saw it in Smith's shop, and saw the prisoner Barrett in the shop where it was - I did not speak to him - when I got back to the machine-room, I saw Barrett again - he asked if we had told Mizen, the foreman, any thing - we told him no - he came to us several times, and said he would give us half-a-crown not to tell about the tallow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use the word "tallow?" A. No - he said, "Do not tell about that" - he did not say what.</p>

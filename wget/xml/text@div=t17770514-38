               <p>I am keeper of the round-house: this man brought the prisoner to me and gave change of her; I took her to the magistrate who was then sitting; he said she had his stockings on, and the magistrate ordered me to pull them off.</p>

               <p>I unfortunately happened to go into this house very much in liquor; this young man asked me to go to bed with him: I am not guilty of doing such things; he took me to a place where they harbour nothing but such people; he paid 6 d. for a bed; I told him I did not like to go into the house, but he would have me in; we went and lay down and I fell asleep; when I waked I could not think how I came in that place; I got up and put on these stockings by mistake; I knew nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177705140020"></xptr> that I had had a man with me; there were some young women in the next room, I don't know who they were.</p>
               <p>To SOUTHEY. Were the woman's stockings left there? - I cannot say whether her stockings were, her shoes were left; I was forced to come down in them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was, I suppose, a good deal in liquor as well as you? - I cannot say; I never saw her before in my life.</p>
               <p>Who proposed going to the house, you or the prisoner? - I paid for the bed myself.</p>
               <p>Who proposed the house? - She herself; she knows she did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. O my God! he came to me to New Prison and wanted me to give him 5 s. to make it up; I told him, I thought it very hard to pay for what I knew nothing about.</p>
               <p>Did you offer to make it up for 5 s.? - I offered to make it up if she would give me 5 s. or my property.</p>

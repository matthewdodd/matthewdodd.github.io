               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Council. You are an old officer, I believe, you say the prisoner dropt some money? - He did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath don't you know his hand was in his breeches pocket, and that you pulled his hand out of his pocket, and he dropped 2 s.? - I don't know whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was not? - I will not swear either one way or the other.</p>

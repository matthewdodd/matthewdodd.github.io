                  </hi>. I am a Greenwich pensioner. On the 19th of April, about twelve, or half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I met the prisoner in the street, between Deptford and Greenwich—I never knew her before—I do not know whether she spoke to me, or I to her, hut we went and drank to<lb></lb>gether outside a public-house, sitting on the bench—before I met her I had a purse with three half-crowns, three shillings, six sixpences, two halfpence, a knife, and an old ring in it—it belonged to me—I lost my purse—I cannot say whether I dropped it on the ground, or how it was, but it was found in the prisoner's lap—I did not feel anything happen to my person while she was with me—this is the purse, knife, and ring, now produced—I was not sober.</p>

I was sitting at the beer-shop, taking refreshment, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor drinking together—I saw him take the purse from his pocket, shake it on the stool, and say that money was to take him home—he put it into his pocket again—about five minutes after, I saw the prisoner get up, and take the purse from his pocket—this is the purse.</p>

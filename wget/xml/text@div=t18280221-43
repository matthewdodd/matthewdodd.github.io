I first saw the prisoner on the night of the 10th of July, in Norton-falgate, with a person named Humby, a baker, whom I knew very well; we went into a public-house in Shoreditch - I staid with them about half an hour, and then went to the watchhouse, freely, with my two bundles, for security; they came in there afterwards - I had left a situation at a wholesale grocers, in High-street, Mary-le-bone, the day before. On the morning of the 11th we went from the watch-house together, with the night constable, to the Ship public-house in Shoreditch, staid there about three quarters of an hour, and then the prisoner, Humby, and myself went to Mr. Fearn's, the <placeName id="t18280221-43-crimeloc229">Blue Last public-house, in the Curtain-road</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Humby was an acquaintance of your's? A. I knew him by sight; I do not know that the prisoner was in the service of a respectable baker at the time he was taken.</p>

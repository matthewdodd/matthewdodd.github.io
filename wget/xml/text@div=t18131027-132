Yes; he came again in the evening, he went into the tap-room, and sat down; about a quarter after six he went away, and came no more. About two hours after, I went to make the bed; I found a sheet was missing from the bed; the candlestick was in the same room as the sheet. The candlestick was not missed until a week after. When I went up to make the bed I saw the prisoner on the landing-place; I took no notice, as I found he was going to sleep there. I came down stairs, and told my mistress I missed a sheet.</p>

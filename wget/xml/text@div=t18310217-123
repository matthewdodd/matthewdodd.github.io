On the 16th of February my mistress called my attention to two women; I went out, and came up with the prisoner and another in Farringdon-street; I took the goose from under her apron - she said she took it in a lark - I asked a man to hold her, but he would not, and I was forced to let her go; but I saw her again in half an hour, pass on the other side of the way; I followed her to the Anchor public-house - I knew her by her features, and I had seen her before; she passed the shop almost every evening - I gave her into custody.</p>

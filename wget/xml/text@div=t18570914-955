                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, of No. 29, Field Lane, Holborn. On Monday, 24th Aug., the prisoner came to my shop about 5 o'clock, and said that he had some chains which he could sell me—I said I did not feel inclined to buy any—he talked to me about them several times—I looked at them, tested them, and found that the gold was so common that was in them, that I should not like to buy them on my own judgment—he said that I might take one to a pawnbroker—I said no, but if he liked I would take one where I thought proper, and I took part of one to a refiner's, Mr. Jones—they were on a ring—I left him in the room with my wife, and the chains on the table, while I went to the refiner's—the chains were wrapped up in a piece or whity brown paper, tied with red tape—I returned, and told him that the gold was not worth more than 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ounce, and I should not like to give above 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the thirteen chains—he said that he would not take it, and put them into his outside coat pocket behind, wrapped up—I said, "Never mind, I will give you 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them"—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I was present on 24th Aug., when the prisoner came—he had a lot of chains wrapped up in whity brown paper—I know that he can read English because he read some bills which were stuck up opposite the house—my husband told him that he would not buy the chains on his own judgment, but wished to take them to a pawnbroker's, and the prisoner lent him one for the purpose—he said that my husband was a long time gone, and said, "I do not value 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I shall not stop any longer"—I said, "Do not go without the chain"—he looked out at the window, and said, "Here he comes, with his long pipe in his mouth"—my husband came in, and said the chains were common, he did not like to buy them at all without having them assayed, and might he cut a piece off—the prisoner consented, and he did so—my husband went away for an hour while the prisoner waited—he came back, and said, "They are very common, I cannot buy them"—the prisoner said, "What will you give?"—he tied the parcel up with a bit of red tape, and put it into his pocket—my husband said he would give 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said, "No," and then my husband said he would give 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said, "Yes"—my husband put the 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into his hand, and the prisoner took a parcel from the same pocket, and passed it to my husband—it was done up just in the same way—he then went away to get a receipt, and we detected that it was the wrong parcel, and the piece of chain that had been cut off was not in it—on 31st Aug. I met the prisoner in Leather Lane, at 10 o'clock in the morning—I followed him—he crossed over to the other side of the way, and stopped; I then stopped—he said, "Are you following me?"—I said, "Yes, I am looking for a constable, to give you in custody"—he turned round, came back, and said, "Me go to police station with you"—I said, "Yes"—he got a little further, and said, "No, me come down this way"—he got very restless, and tried to get away—I said, "If you run, I shall call, "Stop thief!"—he said, "Me come down to your house"—I said, "Well"—I then saw a policeman, and asked him to follow me home—we walked in, and I said to the prisoner, "You have robbed me of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., what are you going to give me back?"—he said, "Me</p>

               <p>got no money?"—I said, "That is a pretty thing, I shall give you in custody"—he said, "Me give you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>".—I said, "I shall not take it," and gave him into custody, with the chains—he did not show me any money—I did not know him before—he said that he took the chains in exchange, and that he was a dealer.</p>

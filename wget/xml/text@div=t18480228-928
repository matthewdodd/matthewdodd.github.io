                  </hi> I live near Ilford, in Essex. On Wednesday night, 3rd Feb., I had some turnips brought to me—I covered them over—I lost some of them, but I was not at home—I saw some afterwards, but could not swear to them—I know this barrow to be mine, but I heard that my wife had lent it to Harrison, who is her brother.</p>

                  </hi> I am in Osborne's service. On 3rd Feb. we had some turnips, which I covered over—I missed some, and tracked the wheel of a barrow which we had in our yard about a mile and a quarter, to a brook—I there found Mr. Osborne's barrow and the prisoners, who were washing some of the turnips—I cannot swear to the turnips—I think some were his, and some another person's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you say they were your master's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Harrison said they were not; and Perry said, "I neither know nor care whose they are; I was employed by Harrison, that is all"—Perry bore a good character.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 36.) I went to the brook and found the barrow, the turnips, and the prisoners—I told them the charge—Harrison said he got the turnips out of two fields belonging to Mitchell and Butler—Perry said he was employed by Harrison to wheel them form Ilford; that was all he knew about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, and live at Leeds. On Thursday night, 8th July, I was at the Crown Tavern, in Cranbourn Passage about half past 10 o'clock—I was rather affected by drink. I lost a gold watch—I don't know how I lost it—I am certain I had it when I went into the public house—I saw it about ten minutes before I missed it; it was in my waistcoat pocket—it had an Albert chain attached to the watch, and the chain was, through the button-hole of the waistcoat—when I missed the watch, the chain was gone with it, and my waistcoat was open. On the following morning, I went to the same tavern, and spoke to the landlord about it—there were several parties in the room—I offered the publican a reward of a sovereign first, and there were persons present who could hear me. I believe I saw the prisoner there—he came in while I was speaking about the watch—he sat down for a short time when he came in—the landlord spoke to him; he told him about the affair altogether, he said, "This fellow lost a watch here last night, do you think it can be got back again?"—the prisoner said he would go out and see for it—the landlord asked him how much he thought it could be got back for—the prisoner went out to look for it; he came back when he had been absent about ten minutes; he said it could be got back for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said, "That is too much money, you must say 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." I at last agreed to give 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I went out with the prisoner to Mr. Walker's, in St. Martin's Lane—I there got change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and gave the prisoner 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—when I gave him the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he said, "The watch will be at Massey's in about ten minutes"—he did not say how it was to come back, nor who was to bring it. I went to the house about 2 o'clock, the barmaid made a communication to me. I received from her this parcel, containing my watch—this is my watch which I lost. I saw the prisoner about ten minutes after I had the parcel delivered to me. I showed him the watch, and said, "It is come back again,"—he said, "I told you it would come back in a short time"—the chain was not with the watch; I had got the chain from a friend who was with me, and who seized the man who stole the watch.</p>

I went to the police station about the watch—I did not give Mr. Pollick in custody on a charge of stealing it, nor any person—I did not tell the Inspector that I did not believe it had been stolen at all, but that I thought I had lost it; nothing of the kind—I told the Magistrate I had lost it—it was the next morning when I went to the public house and saw the prisoner. I changed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at Mr. Walker's—no one was present when I gave the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner; I gave it him in St. Martin's Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder; the prosecutor is a friend of mine. On the 8th of July I was with him at the Crown public house—he was very much intoxicated—he seemed to be asleep. I saw a man in the room go up to him and stand over him—I saw that man had a guard in his hand, and I said, "You are robbing the man." I laid hold of him, and took the guard from him and gave it to Mr. Massey—I collared the man, and others interfered, and he got away; but I took the guard out of his hand.</p>

SALTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been to a number of houses with the prosecutor that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: to three or four other houses besides Massey's—we went out in the morning, and had been drinking in various houses—this might have been about 12 o'clock. I won't swear that I saw the man drawing the watch away—I saw the guard in his hand, and I took it from him. I should think seven or eight persons were present—this was at Mr. Massey's in Cranbourn Alley—the prosecutor was on the floor at the further side of the room. I was charged with stealing the watch by several persons in the room—when the prosecutor heard of it he gave me in custody. I woke him up, and several parties said to me, "You have robbed your friend yourself"—I told the prosecutor what I had seen, and yet he insisted on giving me in charge. I was taken to the station by my own wish as well.</p>

I searched him, and found 8 sovereigns, and one half-sovereign—I took him about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, on Friday the 9th of July.</p>

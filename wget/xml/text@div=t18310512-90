On the 18th of April I sent the two prisoners with my cart to Kentish-town, to fetch half a dozen water-pipes from the water company - I gave Russell 2l. in silver to pay for the pipes; Haynes was not present - I afterwards met Russell on Hampstead-heath; he appeared rather fresh in liquor - he told me he had put the water-pipes into a field, which I rent of Mr. Platt; I asked him for the bill - he said Haynes had got it; I called him back, and said, "You must have it;" he then gave me a bill, amounting to 1l. 18s. - Haynes was afterwards brought to me by a Policeman; he was not intoxicated - I showed him the bill; he said it was correct - he said I was not going to take him to the watch-house, he had done nothing wrong; I told the officer to take him - I said the right price for the pipes was 1l. 4s.; he did not say that he had nothing to do with the bill - he had only had a little beer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say Russell was quite in liquor? A. Yes; so much so that I would not trust him to town with my horses and cart - that was before I knew how this transaction was; he can write; I have seen him set down things - I should not have liked to take a bill of his writing in that drunken state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long was it after this that Haynes was brought in? A. I saw Russell between one and two o'clock - Haynes was brought about five; I had spoken to Haynes about the pipes on the Sunday, and asked what they would come to - he said about 2s. a foot, which proved to be as near the price as could be; Haynes can neither read nor write - he said he knew nothing about the bill, but when I stated the amount of it he said it was all correct - I had been to Kentish-town, and got the right bill; this case was heard at High-street; they admitted Haynes to bail, and strongly recommended me to drop the prosecution, as the men were in that state, but I have lost a great deal.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what money did you give the 2l.? A. All in silver; there were shillings and half-crowns - I do not charge the prisoners with having received any money for me - I can swear I gave him 2l. in silver; I cannot swear I gave him any shillings.</p>

On the 18th of April I saw Haynes at our door - he said he wanted some pipes; I told him I was very ill and could not attend, but I would send one of our men - Russell was with him; I received eight half-crowns and 4s. in silver from Russell - he had some other money, but I do not know what.</p>

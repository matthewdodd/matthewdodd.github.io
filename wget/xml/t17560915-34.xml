I heard her confess she carried brass to sell for a carpenter and his wife divers times. We took her before justice Keeling, and Davis was fetch'd thither.

            . I am a brass founder. Between eight and nine o'clock on Thursday morning last Davis's apprentice came with some brass to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150015"></xptr>Wright. He keeps an old iron shop within three doors of Mutton-Lane. It weigh'd twelve pounds, and I gave him nine shillings for it, at nine pence per pound. After the boy was gone I observed some pieces of it look uncommonly black. I took it to have been in the fire, in order to burn off the leather. Then I ordered my wife to let it continue in the scale, to see if any body would come to enquire about it; and in about half an hour's time there came a young man and woman, and ask'd if there was any such brass brought that day.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was my servant, who went there to enquire.</p>
               <p>Wright. They brought a housing with them. I then judged it was the same they inquired about. Upon comparing it, they desired me to let them have some of it to carry to their master. I readily granted it. When the man was at justice Keeling's I was there. The man said, he bought it of a woman, and he could lend her [She was taken by his deferioing her the same night, and brought.] There she correcyed she had a full pot and a dram for selling it to Davis. said, he gave her four shillings and six-pence for it, and I gave him nine shillings; but then I believe there was but a little above eight pounds of that brass, some of the parcel being old because and other sort of stuff.</p>

On the 13th of September, in the afternoon, I had occasion to go down stairs, leaving my room door open - I went up in about three minutes, and found the prisoner about half a yard in my room; this property was taken out, and laid on a chair near the drawers, which were then open - I had left them closed; I missed the key out of my room door - I asked why she was there, and she asked for a name which I cannot recollect, and said she was not doing any thing; I asked her how the drawers came in that state - she said a boy had done it, and he had given her 2d. to stay there till he returned; I asked who had got my key, and had opened the door, and she said the boy - an officer was sent for, and she was taken; there was nothing missing from the room; I have since found my key - she was a stranger.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not say he had given me 2d., but he said he would when he came back. Witness. Yes, she did; I am sure I had not taken the things out of my drawers - my room is up two pairs of stairs; I know nothing of another key.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Police. I took the prisoner, and found on her these two keys between her frock and her stays - one of them is Mrs. Busher's; they were tried to the door, and this one opened the door, and is Mrs. Busher's; she lived near half a mile from the prosecutrix's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The boy gave me the two keys, and put them down my bosom; I did not take her things -I did not know the boy - he took them out of the drawers, and laid them on a chair; he told me to go up, and told me it was his room, and to mind it till he came back, and then he would give me 2d., and told me to mind the keys.</p>

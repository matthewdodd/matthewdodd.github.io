            . I am a constable of Hammersmith. On the 25th of August I searched the prisoner's apartments, and found the articles stated in the indictment there-the prisoner was not there. Some of them were found in his bed-room, and the remainder in a cupboard. I found two hammers and a reel in the cellar. Next morning I took him; he said he was in want.</p>

             re-examined. There was a fight between the prisoner and prosecutor about his not paying him his wages. He had got the prisoner's things in his place. I went to the prosecutor, and told him the prisoner was innocent. He said, "Never mind-if he gets over this I will have him another way."</p>

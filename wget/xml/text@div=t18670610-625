                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Chapman, who keeps the Albert Arms, London Road, Southwark—on a Saturday night, six or seven weeks before the prisoner was given in custody, the prisoner came for half a quartern of gin, and tendered me a bad shilling of 1858—I said, "You know this is bad"—he said, "No, I took it when I was sent out for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of change; look, I have plenty more," and paid me with good money—I showed the shilling to my husband, who said that it was had, and kept it in a closet some time and lost it—on 2nd May the prisoner came again for a glass of ale, and one pennyworth of tobacco, which came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I recognised him, and pressed forward to serve him—he offered me a bad shilling—I said, "Why did you come here again?

               <p>the shilling was bad—he said that he had just changed a half-crown at a public-house—he paid me 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the ale, and left the tobacco on the counter—my husband came in and gave the prisoner in charge—I kept the shilling in my hand and gave it to the policeman.</p>

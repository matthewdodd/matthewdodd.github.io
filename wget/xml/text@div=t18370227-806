                  </hi>. I am the wife of the Rev. Thomas Heathcote. In November, 1835, I was lodging in the house of Mr. Codd, No. 12, Alsop-terrace, New-road—I occupied the first and second floors, and the prisoners occupied the ground-floor—on Sunday afternoon, the 15th</p>

               <p>of November, I went out, about four o'clock—but it is so long ago I may be mistaken in the hour—I had a dressing-case in my bed room, which was the front room on the first floor—it contained the articles stated in the indictment—I left it locked and took the key with me—I returned about half-past eleven o'clock, but I did not miss it till the following morning at half-past eight o'clock—search was then made every where about the house—the ground-floor which the prisoners occupied was searched—they objected to it—they did not like it, and said it was a most extraordinary thing that a policeman should enter their room; and I felt for them ex<lb></lb>ceedingly, because I did not at all suspect them—no part of the property was discovered at that time—I have since seen a pair of gold earrings and a pair of jet earrings at Hatton-garden.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house No. 42, Alsop-terrace, New-road. The prisoners came to lodge there on the 29th of October, 1835, and occu<lb></lb>pied the back and front parlours on the ground floor—I knew them by the names of Mrs. and Miss Newman—the elder one stated that she was an officer's widow—she did not give any reference—on Sunday, November the 15th, I remember Mrs. Heathcote going out, about one o'clock—the people were coming from church at the time—I went into the front room on the first floor after she was gone, about two o'clock, to draw the windows down, and on the dressing-table I saw what I took to be a box—there were no female servants in my house—we keep none—I and my wife attend to the lodgers—my wife was at home at the time—after going into the bed-room I went down stairs into the kitchen where my wife was—she was busy at the time—about three o'clock the younger prisoner came down and brought down two glasses of wine on a slate—she said we were so very quiet, she did not know what part of the house we were in—she remained in the kitchen, I suppose, from three to five minutes—my wife and I drank the wine—she had never brought us wine down before—they had dined—I believe their dinner was about clearing away about two o'clock—as I was sitting by the side of the fire about five o'clock, I thought I heard the street door open—it was neither light nor dark then—it was getting dark—I did not get off my chair—I merely looked up at the window and saw Miss Newman going down the steps of the front door—I could see that by turning ray head—there is a garden in front of my house—she had a dark cloth cloak on—I had seen the mother wear that cloak before—I did not see the younger prisoner again that evening—on the following morning the loss of the dressing-case was dis-covered—I went to the police-office at Marylebone—a policeman came, and the house was searched, but nothing found—the prisoners' rooms were searched—I did not hear them say any thing—the prisoners remained till the next Wednesday—the younger prisoner said she could not remain any longer under such very disagreeable circumstances.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police inspector of the G division. I was in a coach coming from Hatton-garden, when the prisoners were in custody—I received this paper from the younger prisoner—she desired me to give it to her mother, and let no one see it—her mother was not in the coach—I gave it to the magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Answer no questions, don't be terrified into answering any"—"<hi rend="italic">Fais semblant ou bete le boire."</hi>

               <p>and six sovereigns—I have never seen the dressing-case since—Mr. Codd may possibly be right as to the time I went out—it is so long ago I have no recollection of it—I recollect I came home about half-past eleven o'clock that evening—the bank post bill was indorsed, and would be paid without further writing on it—I made inquiry about it at the Bank of England, and it was stopped the next morning.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Heath Cottages, Woolwich—on Sunday evening, 4th August, I saw the prisoner in a beershop—I had known him before—I called for a pint of beer and paid for it, and I asked him to have some—I then asked him to come home and have some supper—he had an opportunity of seeing my purse when I was paying for the beer—I went home to my lodging with him—my landlord saw him, we went up into my room and locked the door—my purse was then in my waistcoat pocket—I then went to bed and the prisoner slept by my side—when I woke tip he was not there—my trousers were turned inside out and my money was gone—he left my purse with some tin tickets in it—I afterwards saw him again and said, "You have stolen some of my money"—he said, "Here is the money, you can have that"—I gave him into custody—he wanted to say that I was drunk.</p>

                  </hi> I am the landlord of the last witness—on Sunday, the 4th August, he brought the prisoner home with him and they went upstairs—about twenty minutes to six I was called up by the prosecutor—from information I received from him I went to the police-station—there was a man and woman in the house sleeping downstairs at the time—I did not hear anyone go out.</p>

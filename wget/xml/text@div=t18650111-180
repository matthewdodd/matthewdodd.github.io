I have been in the Army—I have been in the police force eight years—on Sunday morning 4th December, about two o'clock, after midnight, I was on duty at Millwall—I was by myself—Mare's gate is the end of my beat—when I was near Mare's gate some men made a communication to me—in consequence of that I walked on—walking on I heard cries of murder and police—in consequence of that I ran to the Great Eastern public-house, and then into Cahir-street—I saw a woman coming out at a door there—she called out, "Oh, oh, you murder<lb></lb>ing brute"—I went across the street and saw a tall man come out of the house, and before I had time to speak to him, I saw he had something in his hand—he made a blow at my head—I bobbed my head on one side, and my hat fell off—he then struck me across the head with some hard substance and knocked me down senseless—I have the mark still, (<hi rend="italic">Pointing it out</hi>) across the temple—when I came to myself I crawled upon my hands and knees ten or twelve yards towards the main road—when I had somewhat recovered I walked to the time-keeper's office at Mare's—I spoke to the</p>

I was in Cahir-street—I had got ten or twelve yards down Cahir-street when she used the expression, on the opposite side of the way, nearly opposite the door—it was not 39 yards from where I stood in Cahir-street to the main road, only 10 or 12—I saw Clares the night before—I do not know whether Mrs. McGeehan spoke to me the night before; some woman spoke to me.</p>

I was on duty at Millwall, on Satur<lb></lb>day night 3d December—my beat is next to Brown's—about two o'clock in the morning I heard a disturbance—T was then close to the Ironmonger's Arms, which is not far off Cahir-street, on the other side of the way—I went to Cahir-street and saw a woman there, and saw the prisoner strike Brown on the side of the head with a poker, or a bar of iron—there was a</p>

               <p>about half-past 12—when we got to the pillar letter-box at the corner of the turning to my house we stopped—I had not noticed any constable before that—I had hold of Mr. Barber's hand wishing him good-night, when a policeman came across the street to me—it was the dark-complexioned man—I saw him at the Thames Police-court, and identified him there—I don't know his name—(<hi rend="italic">Claret was here called in</hi>)—that is the man—he came cross the street from a tinsmith's shop—he left another policeman standing there—when he came across he looked in my face, and gave me a chuck in the neck with his open hand, nothing to hurt me, and asked me what I was doing there at that time of night; before I could reply, he turned round to Mr. and Mrs. Barber, and Barber and he had a scuffle—Barber said, "If you are doing your duty," or something like that, and then there was a scuffle—when the scuffle was going on the other constable was coming across the road—the prisoner is that man—he had a stick or a staff of some description in his hand—he made an attempt to walk towards Barber, and got very near him, and Mrs. Barber shouted out, "James, run"—he turned round, passed me, and said, "I will soon do for you," and he hit her a violent blow on the back of the temple—he was about three yards from Mrs. Barber when he said, "I will do for you," and about half a yard from Barber—it was not a second after his saying that before he struck her—the blow was in<lb></lb>tended for her, because he could have struck me if he wished, but he stepped past me, and struck her—it was a very heavy blow—she would have fallen, but I caught her—I put my arm up to her head, and my sleeve was full of blood in a moment—when Brown had struck the blow, the second policeman turned immediately upon Barber, and she shouted again to James to run, or they would murder him—he ran backwards three or four yards, and then turned and fled, and those two after him—I wanted Mrs. Barber to come into our house, but she would not, and in a couple of seconds she ran out of my arms after her husband—I saw that the police<lb></lb>men were so determined that I went into my own place—I afterwards went down to Mrs. McGeehan's, and found Barber there and his mistress, who was bleeding dreadfully, and Mrs. McGeehan was holding a bit of wet cloth to her head—this was between 12 and 1 o'clock—it was ten minutes past 1 when I got to McGeehan's—I stopped in my own house ten minutes or so, and then I went down to Mrs. McGeehan's, and found Mr. and Mrs. Barber there—I saw no weapon with Barber—I had only been drinking a glass or two of wine, I was quite sober, and so were Barber and his wife—I was not making the least disturbance, only bidding them good-night.</p>

On Monday, the 10th of March, I and my boy Liddell, went round the west end of the town to procure orders - Liddell carried two boxes for me; I came home alone, leaving him to bring the boxes, which contained laces, silk, and worsted braids of different colours; the property stated in the indictment was in the boxes; he came home about half an hour after me without the boxes - I went to St. Sepulchre's church with him, but could find nobody; the contents of the boxes were worth 40l.; in consequence of information I went on Wednesday to the house of Venables, in Highstreet, Whitechapel - I went there again on Thursday with Gardner, the constable; Venables then produced some property to me, from which I selected as mine nine gross and a half of silk braid, four gross and three quarters of nine-bobbin, five gross of thirteen-bobbin, a quarter of a gross of twenty-one-bobbin, and a gross of twentynine-bobbin, which were worth about 10l.; before we went to Venables that morning I went with Gardner and found the prisoner at the house of a man named Nichols, in Maiden-lane; Gardner asked if he knew me - he said he did; he asked if he knew I had lost any goods, and I think he said he had not heard of it; he had two boxes with him - Gardner asked what he had in them - he said braid; Gardner asked to see it - he opened his boxes, and I selected sixteen gross of worsted Russia braid, worth 24s., which I can swear is mine; Gardner said he wished to go home with him and search his place - he said he had several houses to call at, and could not conveniently go then; Gardner said he would go with him, or they could have a coach; he said he did not wish to have a coach - he ultimately agreed to go with us to his house, and when we were in Wood-street, he said it was a pity it could not be settled without going to a Magistrate, and all he could say was, that if any of my goods were among them I might have them; Gardner replied, that would not do for him, he must take him before a Magistrate; we proceeded as far as Shoreditch - Gardner then put him into the watchhouse, and we went to his house, No. 82, Sebright-street. Bethnal-green-road; he is a braid manufacturer: I selected from his goods there, eight gross of fine worsted nine-bobbin, four gross of thirteen-bobbin, twenty-two gross of common nine bobbin, and thirteen gross of fine nine-bobbin braid, which is worth about 15l., and which I can swear to; we then went to Venables, and found the pro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100048"></xptr>perty I named; I am certain the goods are mine, and part of what I lost on the Monday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You are an extensive manufacturer? A. No - perhaps two or three hundred gross a week pass through my hands; the prisoner is a manufacturer - I cannot say whether his manufactory is in Middlesex or not; I have not indicted him for stealing it - he was admitted to bail at Bow-street; I think that was after a little conversation passed - I cannot say whether the Magistrate did it of his own accord; I found about thirtythree gross at the prisoner's house - he was not charged with stealing the property at Bow-street; the boy was asked if he was the man; but he knew the prisoner before he went there, and said he was not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What sort of braid does the prisoner make? A. The same as I sell - both worsted and silk.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Marshall's employ. On the 10th of March he left me to bring these boxes home, and when I got opposite St. Sepulchre's church I was looking at a play bill, a man in a white great coat came up, tapped me on the shoulder, and said I was wanted - he pointed to a man in the porch of St. Sepulchre's church; the man in the porch asked me to fetch a coach - I hesitated, and he said he would give me 1s., and would mind my boxes; I put my boxes into the porch, and went to the corner of the Old Bailey and called a coach - I ran before the coach, and when I got to the church the man and boxes were gone; the prisoner is not that man - I went home and told my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been a servant in the braid business? A. About eight months - I know nothing of the manufacture; I know poor makers go round to the shops to sell it - I am certain I did not see the prisoner near the church for I knew him before this happened.</p>

            . I am a mercer and haberdasher, and live at No. 100, Whitechapel. On the 10th or 11th of March, I bought nineteen gross and a quarter of silk braid of the prisoner, which I have given up to the prosecutor - that produced is the same; I gave him 7l. 14s. 6d. for it; I bought no more except a dozen laces, which I sold for 3s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you known the prisoner a long time as a respectable dealer and manufacturer? A. Yes; he dealt in these articles to a considerable extent - it is common for tradesmen, under a temporary difficulty, to carry about goods for sale; I gave him a greater price at times than I should have given to a wholesale house in the City - he employs about twenty men; I never heard his honesty impeached - the goods I bought of him I mixed with about 40 lbs. of the same colour, and very likely what were made by the same person; I have dealt with him two years, and gave him a fair price.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. As a dealer do you mean to say you gave a fair price for those articles - do you believe they were manufactured for that money? A. I cannot exactly say that.</p>
               <p>- GARDNER. I am a Bow-street officer. I was with Smith, another officer; Mr. Marshall was with me in Maiden-lane, and met the prisoner; a boy, who was with him, had two boxes; I asked the prisoner if he had been out and offered any silk braid for sale the day before; he said No, he had not been out all that week; I told him I understood he had, and asked if he objected to my searching his house; he said it was very inconvenient, as he had to go to three or four places: I said we would go in a coach, and I would not delay him longer than necessary: I asked if he knew the prosecutor, who stood on the opposite side he said he did: I said he had goods in those boxes; he said Yes; I asked him to let Mr. Marshall look at them - he did so, and as soon as the boxes were opened, Mr. Marshall claimed a handful of things, and said he was positive about them; I then told the prisoner he must go with me. for I must search his house, and in Wood-street he said,"Well, I don't know, if there is any of your property, you must have it, I suppose; I don't know anything about it:" I said No, he must go before a Magistrate; I asked how he came possessed of it: he said he bought it a bargain: I asked of whom: he said he could not tell: I asked what he gave for it; he said he did not know, he bought it a bargain - I put that question to him more than once: he said,"It is a pity it cannot be settled without going before a Magistrate;" I said it could not, and locked him up in the watch-house; I asked him there if he made any memorandum relative to this transaction; he said No, he kept no books: Smith searched him in my presence, and took from him a pocket-book, which I opened, and took out of it one of his printed bills of parcels; (read) "Bought of J. Peters, silk, cotton, and worsted manufacturer, No. 82, Sebright-street." I then went to his house, and in the first floor back room found a lot of braid; Mr. Marshall selected what belonged to him; I went to Venables, and got some silk braid from him; I then went to the watch-house, and asked the prisoner if he recollected who he bought the property of, as he stood in a very serious situation, and I had found more at his house; he said No, he could not recollect: I asked him the same question in the coach; he said he was not bound to answer that question; I said I did not want him to hurt himself - I produce the braid.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. On what grounds did you suspect the prisoner? A. From information I had received the night before - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you brought the rest of the goods which were in the boxes? - A. No; I have brought what he selected - there was a great quantity of other goods of the same description; I asked the prosecutor if he could he positive to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not appear to you as much like each other as water taken out of the same river? A. Certainly so - this is but a small quantity compared to what was in the box; if I had been stopped with property I think I should have told who I bought it of - he seemed in a very large way of business; he had sixteen or eighteen boys at work.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the information you received, from Mr. Marshall? A. It was: I received it on Wednesday afternoon, about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prisoner was not present when Marshall selected the goods? A. No; I requested his foreman to see what we took away; Sir Richard Birnie admitted the prisoner to bail.</p>

            . I am a braid manufacturer, and know the prisoner; he employs a good many people, and bore a respectable character. On the afternoon of Tuesday, the 11th of March, I was on his premises, when a person came to sell him some braid. I cannot name the quantity - he gave 12l. for it, which I considered a fair price; for it was a very unsaleable commodity. Kendal was present - there was no concealment about it; he asked my opinion about it - it is very common for small manufacturers to go round, and sell to larger ones - it appeared to me a transaction of that nature.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Does the prisoner keep a shop? A. No: I cannot say whether he could make the goods for the price he gave.</p>

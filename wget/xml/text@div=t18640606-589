I am in the service of John Corby Thompson and others, warehousemen, 21, Bread-street—I am salesman in the silk depart<lb></lb>ment, which is on the first floor—there is a warehouse on the ground floor, with stairs leading up to the silk room—the prisoner was a porter in the house—on 16th May there were 10 pieces of silk that came in that morning left on the counter in the silk room—I opened them myself about 10 o'clock that morning, and placed them on the counter—this is one of the pieces—I was in the room all the morning till 2 o'clock—two or three buyers came in—I attended to them—they were respectable persons from the wholesale houses in the City, who I am accustomed to see there—I saw the silk safe after they had gone—I left it safe at 2 o'clock when I went out to my dinner—Mr. Court, the manager, then succeeded me—he came in before I went out, and I left him there—I left the silk safe at that time—I returned about half-past 3, and then missed one of the ten pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Thompson—I was left in the silk room when Mr. Court went out—while he was out the prisoner and another porter, named Wood, came into the room—they came in about the same time, but not together; one after the other—the prisoner came in first—he said it was very hot—it was hot—I was writing out an invoice at the time on the counter—I kept on writing—the prisoner came and leant on the counter about a yard from me—the silk was on the counter behind him, further from me—he was between it and me—I still continued writing all the time he was there—he remained about five minutes—he had nothing to do there; only to leave his boards—those are boards that he carries to put outside the silk to prevent its being crushed—he brought the boards in and left them—he said that he ought to have had a cart to take the goods out in—the load was too heavy for him—I did not give him anything to. take out—while I was there I did not remove the silk, or part with any of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it the prisoner's duty to bring back the boards after he had taken out silk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and to leave them where he did—no one was in the department with the silk while I was there—it was my duty to watch it—I did not look at it while the prisoner was there, he being one of the porters in the warehouse, I did not think he would touch it—I saw him go out—I did not see whether he had anything with him or not—I did not see him with anything—the piece of silk that was missed contained ninety yards—the prisoner was in his shirt sleeves, and had an apron on—he had no coat on—if he had had anything in his hand, or under his arm, I think I must have seen it—I did not see him with anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gloucester-street, Queen-square. Be<lb></lb>tween twelve and two o'clock in the morning on the 8th of June, I met the prisoner in Holborn—she began pulling me about, and by way of getting rid of her, I went to a public-house, thinking to leave Her there—I left her there with a full glass of liquor before her, and I left her to take the change—I slipped out, but she was out as soon as I was—I went on to Museum-street, and while there the prisoner suddenly left me, and I missed two sovereigns which I had had in my right-hand trowsers' pocket—I do not know how she got her band into my pocket, bat I will swear she did do it—I did not feel her hand in my pocket, but I know I had the sovereigns when I was in the public-house—I had the same coat on that I have now—I am not certain whether it was buttoned—I had wanted her to leave me, but I could not shake her off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You asked what countrywoman I was—I said Irish—you asked if I could fight, and I said no—you was pulling two women about in the street—I went on, and you left them and tapped me on the shoul<lb></lb>der, took me into a public-house, and called for a pint of ale—you got quarrelling with two women in the parlour—I went on, and then you came and charged me with taking two sovereigns—the money I had was my own.</p>

I was on duty, and saw we prosecutor and the prisoner talking together—I passed them about twenty yards, and all at once the prisoner left him—she came on, and stooped down, and sounded first one sovereign on the pavement and then another—she then stood up, and was passing by me—I asked her if they were good ones—she said she thought they were shillings till she sounded them, and she asked me where she could get any thing to drink—I told her—the prosecutor came up and charged her—we took her, and found one sovereign, and at the station I saw her swallowing something with great difficulty.</p>

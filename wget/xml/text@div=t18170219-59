            . I am shopman to Messrs. Jones and Simons. On the 7th of February, about half-past five o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop and asked for some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed him some. I saw him put his hand on two of them, they were together. I said nothing but watched him. I shewed him several, he objected to them all. I presently saw him put the two handkerchiefs into his great coat pocket. He offered me five shillings and sixpence for those that I asked him eight shillings and sixpence for. I came from behind the counter; and asked if he really would give five shillings and sixpence for one; he then said, he would rather give one shilling, and moved towards the door. I followed him and got before him; he drew back to the counter, and as he was pulling them out of his pocket, I secured him. He had been to the shop several times before, but never bought any thing. He struck me twice in attempting to get away.</p>

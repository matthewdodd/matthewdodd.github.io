                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the City police. For some time previous to the 18th of April, I had been attending to what was sup<lb></lb>posed to be going on at the premises of Messrs. Magnay—I understood Ell was their warehouseman—I took him into custody on Friday, the 18th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, at a public-house opposite Messrs. Magnays, at the corner of College-hill—he had been told by the constable, Hay don, what he was taken for—I took him at once to the station—he was examined on the Saturday, at Guildhall, on a charge of robbing his employers—on Monday, the 21st, I went with a warrant to the house of the prisoner Nicholson, in St. Thomas the Apostle—he keeps a stationer's and bookbinder's shop—it is an open shop, about two mi<lb></lb>nutes' walk from Messrs. Magnay's place of business—I got there about two o'clock—he was out—I found his wife there—I told her I was an officer, and had come to search the premises—I produced the warrant—Mr. George Magnay was with me—I found a great deal of paper about, on shelves and other places—Mr. Magnay examined it, and I took some which he claimed—I have it here—we might have been in the house about two hours—I saw Nicholson at the station two or three hours after I had been at his house, about five or six o'clock—he had been taken by another officer—I showed him the paper which I had brought away—he looked at it, and said, "Mr. Magnay will find himself in the wrong"—I had before that told him where I got the paper—Mr. Magnay was with me, and I told him to state the charge I had against the prisoner, and the charge was entered accordingly, in the police-book, of having in his possession a portion of paper which Mr.</p>

               <p>Magnay claimed as his, and which had been stolen—that was stated in Nicholson's hearing, and on that I produced the paper, and showed it to Nicholson, and said something to the effect that it was but fair that he should see it—he took it up, looked at it, and said, "Ah! Mr. Magnay will find himself in the wrong, I had this paper from so and so,"mentioning two names which I had not heard before, and do not recollect—I will not say whether he mentioned the name of Price—there is some handwriting on some of this paper—Nicholson had not seen the handwriting when he said "Mr. Magnay will find himself wrong," and mentioned the two names—his attention was not directed to the writing during the conversation.</p>

Turner, Thick Laid"—Ell wrote it—this was a discarded wrapper—we sell brown paper wrappers, but these are perfectly, useless, except to light fires—we are—not retail dealers, in the common acceptation of die word—if a customer wants a ream we sell it, but not a sheet of paper—we sell a quire of vellum paper, or half a ream of post paper—on looking through our ledger, I see Ell had two reams of post, and one of yellow-wove foolscap which came to 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about four months ago, and previous to that some more, making, within the last twelvemonth, about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the clerks in our establishment sell—I take the out-door department, and am out front eleven o'clock in the morning—I am out about half my time—I should think there are not hundreds of these covers in our warehouse—there ought not to be any—they generally go out again on the outside of the paper—it would not be in due course for this to have gone on inside writing paper—this would be put on outside paper—it might have gone out with tome. sort of paper in due course, but it would have been very irregular to have put "Turner Thick Laid Post" on Turner's superfine demy—this would have been a proper description for some kind of paper—this wrapper has no date on it—it is certainly dirty—a dirty wrapper I should call it—it is quite evident it is not a new one—our books are not here—it is only from them that I know what was sold to Ell—there would be nothing irregular in his buying paper of our clerks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live at No. 13, Friday-street. In the beginning and middle of April I was in the habit of seeing the prisoner Ell—in consequence of something that occurred to my mind I made a communication to Messrs. Magnay, and to Haydon the officer, I believe, on the 7th or 8th of April—on the 18th of April, the day Ell was taken, I had made an appointment to see him at six o'clock—I did not see him—on one occasion when I saw Ell, he said Nicholson had been buying outside paper of Magnays, and that they were taking shavings in ex<lb></lb>change—this was on the 17th of April, the day before Ell was taken—I heard that Ell was taken soon after the Friday—the examination took place on the Saturday—on the Monday afterwards Nicholson came to me about half-past nine o'clock in the morning—he said this was a sad affair, and that we were all in the mess together; that he felt very ill, and he had not eaten anything since Ell was taken into custody; that he had come out without any money in his pocket, and would I send for a little brandy for him—I sent for some, and we retired to the workshop at the back of my shop—(this conversation was in the front shop)—previous to going into the back shop he told me to fasten the front door of the shop—we went into the back shop at Nicholson's request, he said he wanted to speak to me, and we had better be quiet—the front door was fastened, and we went into the back workshop together, and also fastened the door of that—he then said he was. commissioned to go round to all that knew anything of the business, to cause them to hold their tongues, and not to tell anything they knew, and what we knew ourselves we had best keep to ourselves—he then went away, and said he would come back and let me know the result, how he got on, about six o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 24, Windsor-street, Islington. I am in the employ of Mr. Paradise, a stationer—I was formerly in the employ of Nicholson for about six months—I left him about two months ago—he then carried on business in the same place, in St. Thomas the Apostle—he had a pretty fair trade—I know Ell by having seen him at Nicholson's—he was there once every day all the while I was there—when he came he gene<lb></lb>rally spoke to Mr. Nicholson—I had not an opportunity of hearing what they conversed about—it was generally in whispers—he used not to stop very long—there was no particular time when he was in the habit of coming, different hours—I do not know of any dealings between Mr. Nicholson and him—Nicholson kept books of the things he purchased—I heard of Mr. Nicholson being taken into custody the day afterwards—I went to his house on Friday, the 2nd of May, because Mrs. Nichohon wanted to see me—I saw her, and in consequence of what she said I went to Giltspur-street Compter—I there saw Mr. Nicholson, and he asked me if I remembered going to a sale and fetching some things away—I said I did—he then said that the paper Mr. Magnay had seized I had brought from the sale, and he wanted me to go on the following Tuesday to Guildhall to swear to that paper—I said I would—I had no paper at that time shown to me, nor had I seen any—I meant I would go, not that I would swear to the paper—he asked me if I would go on the Monday and help Mrs. Nicholson's brother take the stock of what was in the shop, and he would pay me for my time—the sale which I remember fetching the paper from was at Price's, in Chancery-lane—I had left Nicholson six or seven weeks when he sent for me—the sale took place nearly two months before I left him, nearly three months before I had this conversation with him—I fetched the paper from Price's by desire of Mr. Nicholson—he was at home when I brought it home—I did not examine it at all—I do not know that he knew whether I examined it or not—it was tied up in par<lb></lb>cels—I did not open it in his presence—it was put away with other papers—I cannot say who put it away, I think it was Mr. Nicholson—the paper that I brought had a common wrapper on it—I think it was demy—it was either post or demy—post would not be letter paper in the folio—this paper is demy—post is rather smaller—I do not think they were brown paper wrappers round the paper I brought—I have no distinct recollection about the paper or wrappers—I went up to Guildhall on the following Tuesday, but I was not examined.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Nicholson in the habit of buying paper at sales? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I know of before—I have not carried paper from the sale marts to his place—I took a ream of medium paper to Mr. Magnay's to be changed, which had been broken, and I got another ream of medium back—medium is larger than this—Mr. Nicholson used to buy paper sometimes of different makers, and sometimes job lots—he was a ruler and marbler—paper of this sort is sent to be ruled and marbled—he was a binder—when paper is sent for ruling, the good paper is taken off the outside and supplied with common paper to paste against the backs of the books, and the good paper is laid aside till there is sufficient quantity to make up a quire—I am certain the paper I took to Messrs. Magnay's was medium, and not demy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Ship public-house in Worm<lb></lb>wood-street, Bishopsgate. On Monday, the 21st of April, about two o'clock, Nicholson was at my house—he remained about half an hoar—he asked me to go round to Dutton's for a book—I went round for some wafers for myself—when I came back, he asked me whether I had seen Dutton's place in any confusion—I said, "No, I saw no one but the boy"—I told him there was a man outside in private clothes, and the policeman on the beat—I think I told him I believed it to be a policeman in private clothes—Nicholson was in my bar parlour—I have known him about eighteen months, occasionally, not regularly—I may have seen Ell once or twice—Nicholson had never been in my bar parlour before, to my recollection—he would not be seen there by persons passing by, nor persons coming into the house, unless they looked over the glass—after I came back from buying the wafers, Nicholson wished me to go round again, to see whether I saw Mr. Dutton—I went and returned, and told Nicholson I saw the house in the same order as before—he did not say anything to that—he did not tell me why he did not go himself—he said there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> standing at the end of the court—that was all he said.</p>

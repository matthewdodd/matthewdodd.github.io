I am quite blind, I can only see a little light—I get my living by charity—I know the prisoner, he lived next door to me; he sent for me to his house—I was in my own room smoking—I had my tea first, and then went to him—he spoke to me in my own language, and said, "What for you no come to my house"—I said I had been out all day, and I was very tired—he said no more, but gave me a very hard strike—I did not know how to place myself, and I fell down—one of my countrymen picked me up, and I know no more, I lost my senses—I found I had been beaten over the shoulders—I have known the prisoner two or three yean—I knew his voice—I did not strike him or his wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police. I was called to the Leman. street station about 1 o'clock in the night, and found the prosecutor with a contused wound on the forehead over the right eye, about an inch and a half long—it bled a great deal—the hair was all matted together—the skin and the muscles were cut through, but not the covering of the skull—he is a very feeble man—I saw him again about ten days afterwards; it had not healed then—it was not dangerous of itself, but erysipelas might have followed—it might have been inflicted with a poker.</p>

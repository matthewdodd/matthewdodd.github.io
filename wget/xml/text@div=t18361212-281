                  </hi>. I have been in this country four months, and live at the Sailors'-home. I had a watch from home, from my parents—I saw these girls on Monday morning the 12th of December, in Ratcliffe-highway—there were two sailors in public-house—I was very much distressed, and wanted to sell my watch—they asked what I wanted—I said 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the man said, "I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I put my watch into my pocket, and came out—Johnson came, and said, "You fool, don't sell your watch for that money"—I said, "Yes, I will sell it"—she said, "Let us look at it?"—I gave it her to look at, and she said, "Come along with me, don't be frightened for your watch, come along"—I went to the room—she ran up stairs with the watch, and would not let me come into the room—Osborne was with her—she told her to take the poker to me when I came into the room, and she did, and struck at me, and said, "You young <hi rend="italic">smouch,</hi> if you come in, I will knock your brains out"—I said, "I want my watch back"—there was a boy there, and I sent him for a policeman, who took the watch from her—I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Johnson.</hi> He gave me the watch to go and pawn—I went to get my clogs on to go—this young girl knew nothing about it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, she told me to give it her to look at, and she would go and pawn it for me—I waited about a quarter of an hour—Johnson had not got the poker—she had got the shovel—I walked a hundred yards or more with her—there was a pawnbroker's shop just over the way.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable</hi> K 223.) I went to the house and found the prosecutor outside the door—he told me the girl had stolen his watch, which he gave her to look at, and she ran away up stairs with it—I went inside, and Johnson came down stairs with the watch in her hand—I said, "What are you doing with the lad's watch?"—she said, "I merely kept it out of a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>"—I did not take Osborne then, but in consequence of what the prosecutor told me afterwards I took her.</p>

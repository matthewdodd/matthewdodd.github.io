                  </hi>. I now live in Brook-street, Ratcliffe—I formerly lived in Bennondsey, and kept the house. On 23rd Aug. I came down-stairs, about six o'clock in the morning; I am sure it was before six—I was the first per<lb></lb>son that came down—I found the window adjoining the shop wide open, and missed the cruet-stand from the sideboard, the snuffers and tray, and half a pound of tobacco—this is the cruet-stand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it safe the night before—my wife and sister were up after me; they are not here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 187). On Friday morning, 23rd Aug., between two and three o'clock, I was near Folly-bridge, Dockhead, and hearing a dog bark at the back of the prosecutor's premises, I went into the adjoining yard, and saw two persons—one was attempting to escape over the wall, and the other, who was the prisoner, was assisting him over—I asked what business they bad there—they said they came there to sleep in a cart—there were several carts in the yard—I took them into custody but the other got away—I kept the prisoner, and took him to the station—I found on him some tobacco loose in his pocket, a tobacco-pouch, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a comb, and a quantity of lucifer matches.</p>

About half-past six o'clock on the morning of the 23rd, I received information from Mr. Clark, and examined his premises—they had been entered by the back-parlour window—I saw marks on the wall where persons had got over—I fonnd this cruet-stand on the adjoining premises in the corner of the yard close by where I saw the marks—I have found the snuffer-tray, and half a pound of tobacco.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went into this place, to sleep in the cart; the tobacco I had on me I bought with some money. I earned during the day; I know nothing of the robbery.</p>

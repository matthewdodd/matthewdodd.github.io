            . I am the pot-boy. On Sunday evening the prisoner told me to get up soon in the morning - I got up at a quarter before six o'clock and said to her,"Shall I go now?" she said, "It is too soon;" I said,"I will go, and get some of my pots in;" and at ten minutes before eight I said, "Shall I go now?" she said Yes - she went into the bar-parlour, and brought out a tin box, took a watch out of it, and told me to go and pawn it at the corner of the street for 1l., which I gave her; there was one five shilling piece, six half-crowns, and the duplicate wrapped in a little bit of paper - she gave me 1s.; I did not tell of this as soon as I heard it was lost - I heard of the watch being lost, but did not know it was the same; I told this to my father on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who do you think ought to be standing at the bar now? A. It is not a tobacco-box that she took it from; it is a little oval box - I will swear it was ten minutes before eight o'clock; after I pawned it I said to her, "What has that young man lost up stairs?" she said, "A watch;" she went in directly - I was almost out of my mind; I did not know what I was about - it never struck me that it was the same watch; she said she had had it ten years, ever since her mother's death -I did leave the house without giving notice.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

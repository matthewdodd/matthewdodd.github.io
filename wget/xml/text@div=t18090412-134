               <p>Q. In December last did you quit the service of Mr. Britten - A. Yes, on the 24th of December I left Mr. Britten, and on the 27th I went into Messrs. Hodson and Hager's service; they have a warehouse in Mark-lane, and another in Cooper's-row in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that in the city of London - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>A gentleman in court. It is in the city of London.</p>
               <p>Q. to Barret. Did you work on the 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th of December - A. Yes, at Cooper's-row one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120070"></xptr>day or two, and at Mark-lane; on Saturday the 31st of December I went to work at Cooper's-row.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Biggs, Kingsbury, and Laremouth work for Messrs. Hodson and Hager - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to work on the morning of the 31st of December did they either of them. or all of them, say anything to you - A. Yes, Biggs, Kingsbury and Laremouth told me that they could not and would not work with me, it would subject them to a guinea fine if they did, by a new rule of the society; and while they were talking about it Mr. Hodson came in; they said if I staid there they should leave the employ; this was on Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from them what night the club met - A. They told me on the preceding night - Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you what had been done at the club - A. Nothing more than they could not work with me; they said if I staid they would leave the employ; if I would wait another week for the decision of the club, most likely the club would decide it favourably for me; then they told me they would issue summonses for the week following, for next Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. You said while you were conversing with them, somebody came in - who was that - A. Mr. Hodson: He remonstrated with them on the impropriety of their conduct, and requested they would go to work; Mr. Hodson heard the particulars what they told me; Mr. Hodson asked them what court of justice would sanction their conduct; they said they did not know that that the law had any thing to do with it; Mr. Hodson then asked them if they were going to make laws of their own, or something to that purpose; they said no, they did not know that they were going to do that; then Mr. Hodson left them, requesting them to go to work.</p>
               <p>COURT. What did they say to that - A. They said they would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they assign any reason why they would not - A. They said a guinea was of consequence to them, they would not do it; then Mr. Shaw came after Mr. Hodson was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that they said that they would issue summonses for the club to meet the next Friday night - who was to do that - A. I suppose by the stewards; they said it should be done; they did not describe by what authority it should be done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say Mr. Shaw, the foreman, came after Mr. Hodson was gone - A. Yes; he requested me to go to the mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that in the hearing of the three - A. I believe he did; they were in the same warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak in a voice that they were likely to hear - A. Yes, I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. However they were there - this was Saturday, the last day in the year - A. Yes; I went to the lord mayor on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did they say any thing to Shaw when he said that to you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went to the mansion-house - A. Yes, on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the Monday go to the warehouse - A. Yes, on Monday the 2nd of January, I went to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the three again - that is Biggs, Kingsbury, and Laremouth - A. Yes, I did; I told them that I had been to the mansion house to seek for redress; one of the clerks at the mansion house told me that if I would bring witnesses that these men had resisted working with me, something good could be done for me.</p>
               <p>COURT. What reply did they make - A. They laughed it off with a joke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass at that time, or before the next Friday, respecting the club - A. I went to the warehouse two or three times; I saw them once or twice; I learnt from them that the business would be brought forward on Friday night at the society; they requested me, one and all, to attend the society on Friday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Then from Saturday, when you had quitted the warehouse, until the Friday that you went to the club, had you done any work at Mr. Hodson's warehouse - A. Not any; because there were other men in Mr. Hodson's employ who belonged to the society, they all declared they would leave if I continued in Mr. Hodson's employ.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any of the other men make these declarations in the hearing of these defendants - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There were other members of the club working there, you understood also they would have left if you continued working there - A. Yes; Mr. Hodson did send me into his employ into Pickle Herring, over the water. That was on the 14th of January.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. You left on Saturday the 31st - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You now come down to Friday night, the 6th of January - on the 6th of January, in the evening, did you go to the Crown and Cushion - A. Yes; I went to the house the society is held at.</p>
               <p>Q. The house where the society meets - at Moorgate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there see either of the defendants - A. Yes; Biggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to Biggs - A. Yes; after waiting in the tap-room about an hour. I went at eight o'clock; I was coming out of the house, I had not seen any of them; I met Biggs in the passage; I asked him if the society had discussed the business; he said no, not yet, they were going to proceed upon it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where they were - A. No, he did not; they were in a room over my head; I believe he went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again in the course of that night - A. No; I waited there till eleven o'clock at night. On the next morning I called upon Biggs to know the determination of the society; he told me that the society had agreed to allow me seven shillings a day for my loss time, until the Friday following. I went to the warehouse, Cooper's-row, then I understood from Mr. Hampton that it was for a week only.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what could you have earned in that week that you were idle and out of work - A. I could have earned upon an average three pounds ten shillings, if I had been in Mr. Hodson's employ; I received two pounds for the week before; I had worked four days; that I received on the Saturday night when I left work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that see either of the other men of the society - A. Yes; I went to Mr. Hodson's on the 14th of January and told them how the society had settled it; they said they could not work with me; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120071"></xptr>told them Biggs told me if I did wait till next Friday night they would allow me seven shillings a day; on Saturday sennight after the 6th (the 14th) I went to Mr. Hodson's, Cooper's-row, I saw Biggs, Kingsbury, and Laremouth, the same three; I told them that Mr. Hodson had, sent me to work. - I must recal that if you please.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them there when you went on the 14th - A. No, I do not believe I did. On the 8th of January I saw Biggs at my own house, the day after he told me about the seven shillings a day, he told me that Mr. Hodson had given him notice, and the other two defendants, to quit; but he should not have the week's notice, he should not go to work again.</p>
               <p>Q. Why - A. Because he found himself much hurt that Mr. Hodson should give him a week's notice on this account. On the Monday following, the 9th of January, I went to Mr. Hodson's house and told him these three men had left.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that conversation did you see either of the defendants again - A. No. He desired me to go to Cooper's-row to work on the 9th of January; Mr. Shaw, the foreman, said it would turn the house into confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the defendants there at the time - A. Not either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact Mr. Shaw did not admit you to work - A. No; he said it would throw the house into confusion again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Were there at that time other members of the packer's club present when Mr. Shaw spoke - A. There were two or three, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. You quitted on Saturday, the 31st of December - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any meeting of the club had taken place upon this business - A. There had been some meeting before that.</p>
               <p>Q. These defendants told you something had passed, and that they hoped it would be got over in another week - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you was discharged from Mr. Hodson's employ - A. The 31st of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Who discharged you on the 31st of December - A. I believe I may say Mr. Shaw.</p>
               <p>Q. He paid you when he discharged you - A. No; it was not the usual custom to pay before the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You were paid in the evening and then you were fully discharged - A. Indeed I was discharged in the morning, because these men would not work with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you go to work for him, or do any work any where - A. On the 14th of January; Mr. Hodson said he would try me a second time.</p>
               <p>Q. These defendants were not there - I do not want to know what passed between you and him - have you continued working for him since then - A. No; I went to work on Saturday the 14th and quitted on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you have not worked for Mr. Hodson since - A. No; I went to work for Mr. Britten on the 16th.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you work for between the 31st of December and the 14th of January - A. If I may call it work, I was at work for Mr. Britten.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost a fortnight's employ, and for the three first days you were working for Mr. Hodson - there was no dispute about your working - A. Yes, there was; there had been some alteration before.</p>
               <p>Q. You went working on till the morning of the 31st - A. Yes; I worked at Mark-lane one day; they carry on the same business at both; there was members of this benefit club there. On the 31st of December I was working at Mr. Hodson's, Cooper's-row, with Pearce, he worked with me at both places; I did not work with either of the defendants.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say that for three or four days that you had been at work for Mr. Hodson, there were alterations - A. Yes, they said they had; it would turn out favourable to me; they said I was not a packer, whereas, it may be said, two thirds of the society had worked with me at packing; the objection was made because I had not served my time to a packer only; because Mr. Britten was a packer and presser.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say on the morning of the 31st of December, you considered Mr. Shaw as discharging you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been suffered, was it not your intention to come to work on the Monday morning following - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to believe they should not have continued you in their service - A. No other than it was of consequence to him, so many in his house, that they should all leave his work on my account.</p>

            . You are a packer, in Mark-lane - A. Yes, my partner's name is Hager, in Cooper's-row.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the defendants - A. Three of them I do; Kingsbury, Biggs, and Laremouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in your service in December last - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing take place with these men; on the 31st of December - A. On that morning I was going from my house, in Crutched Friers; on my journey there; I met Mr. Shaw, my foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you did in consequence of what Mr. Shaw communicated to you - A. I went on to Cooper's-row, and heard what these men had to say; they all three alternately spoke in turns; Biggs was the chief spokesman; they told me they had a law in their society, which prevented them from working with Barret, they were liable if they did to the forfeit of a guinea; and if they repeated it again, they were liable to be expunged from the society.</p>
               <p>COURT. Does that society still exist - A. I believe it does; I told them not only that they were acting imprudently, but unjustly, and in a way that the law would take cognizance of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this house is that they meet at - it is very proper that the house should be noticed by the magistrate - A. They said there was such a law in existence, and they must abide by it; I further remonstrated with them, and wished them coolly to reconsider the matter fairly over, and told them they were wrong; I believe their answer was exactly the same; I believe I further added, they would see if they considered it fairly, that it had the effect of a direct combination and conspiracy again this individual, to starve him to death; they seemed to be totally inattentive to any thing said, and continued to alledge that he was not a packer, that he served his time to Mr. Britten, who was not a packer by trade, but a presser; I made answer, that I had worked myself with Mr. Britten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120072"></xptr>thirty years ago at the packing business.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this remonstrance of your's, meeting with no attention from them, what did you do - A. I was compelled, under the necessity of the case, and if the fact had been ten times worse I must have submitted; I was compelled to discharge him, I desired Mr. Shaw, the foreman, to do it; I said if you persist I will discharge him, but mind, you compel me to it, I shall not do it of my own will. I did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Through their compulsion Barret was discharged on Saturday - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time after employ Barret - A. I did; although I did not consider myself in a situation to employ him in the packing business in the city of London, yet as we had some hops to press down for the merchants; I said he would do this surely, without giving offence, in the county of Surry; he was there a day or two, he did what there was to do in a day; there was nothing said to him that applies to these men; there was by others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him to work on the 9th of January - A. I should have observed that our foreman is at liberty to take in men and discharge men without our knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have discharged Barret without you had been desired by the men - A. No, I should not, most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. What day was it you discharged the defendants, these three men - A. Whether it was that Saturday sen'night, or that Saturday fortnight, I cannot tell; it was not the fortnight; I said I would give them a week's notice.</p>
               <p>COURT. How many men had you working with you, members of this club - A. I think we had five or six others, besides these three.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that makes eight or nine men who were members of this club - how many men were there in your employ at the time - A. There were these three that I have named, six, and five others; those five are out of the question.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that you should have lost these six men if Barret had continued there - A. I did; they saying that we must leave; I believe I may add that it was by compulsion, thy must leave.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you would have lost nine men out of the fourteen if you had not discharged Barret - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any thing in the conduct of Barret that made you wish to discharge him, or would you have continued him if they had not done this - A. I was entirely satisfied with him; I should not have discharged him only on this account.</p>

               <p>Q. And you said just now you believed Smith was a steward, and he was there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Why do you believe that Smith was a steward - A. Because I have heard it mentioned since by one of the trade, I do not know who.</p>

               <p>Q. Do the stewards keep the books - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How are these books kept by the society - A. The accounts of the society are kept in a book, and a book for the articles; the books are kept in a box.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys are there to that box - A. I believe three.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember which of them - A. I am not positive whether it was one of the stewards or not; it is the custom of the society for the stewards to take the ballot - the ballot was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the result of the ballot - A. A majority against Mr. Barret to work; I think the number 31 against him, and I think 10 for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you had forty-one journeymen meeting for this purpose -</p>

               <p>Q. You have no belief on the subject, have you - A. I do not know - it may be six or seven hundred pounds; I cannot tell; it is only speaking at random.</p>

               <p>COURT. How do you know that they change every quarter - is that one of the rules of the society that is in writing - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. Has it been the rule and practice ever since you have been a member of the society, to change stewards every quarter day - A. It has; and to relieve sick members, and to bury their wives.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the business the stewards are to superintend - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when these men made any objection to Barret, and in consequence thereof he was discharged - A. I do not recollect discharging of Barret at all; I think he went away of his own accord, at Mr. Kingsbury and others saying that it would be settled in the society.</p>
               <p>Q. You think he took himself away, and went to work at his business of a hot-presser - A. I do not recollect who discharged him, but he went away from us to work at Mr. Britten's, I believe. I heard that after he had been to work at Mr. Britten's.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us that you were at the ballot - A. Yes; I was only at one meeting; I should not have gone then, only at the request of Mr. Hodson and the young fellow, it was by their desire.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th of February this man came to work again - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day after the ballot he came to work a single day - A. He came to work after the ballot, but I cannot remember the day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I understood you to say that Slade spoke in favour of this man's continuing at work - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. He is one of the parties that is indicted for keeping this young man from his work - you do not know the fact that Smith was a steward - A. I do not speak positive, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that neither Smith or Paxton at this moment are stewards - A. They are not stewards at present, because they serve only a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not stewards last week, of course, because they only serve quarterly - you of your own knowledge do not know that ever they were stewards - A. No, except Slade.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are all these defendants members of this society - A. I have no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went to the meeting where the ballot was, at the desire of Mr. Hodson and Hager, to make observations - A. I went there by their desire, but it was never said to make observations; I went there to hear what they had to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect a little now what they had to say - A. What I say is a fact.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the practice of the society with respect to any of its members that work with a presser that is no packer - A. They are to pay the fine of a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. And if he works a second time what is the practice - A. I think an erasure.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it - A. No, not in my own mind.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever belong to the club of packers - A. Yes, at the Crown and Cushion, Moorgate.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the practice of that club with respect to any man that works for a presser - A. I can tell by myself: the first offence was a fine of a guinea, and the second time an erasure - he was expunged from the society. I was a member of the society, and employed a person of the name of Wilson; this person was six or seven years in my service, and had been a foreman over these men, but when I removed into Suffolk-lane, they had a ballot on it and fined me a guinea; they wrote to me that I was fined a guinea for employing Mr. Wilson. I paid my quarter-age. This was somewhere about July or August last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen upon your not paying that fine - A. They expunged me; and to this hour, no man of the society can work for me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. You are a master packer - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. And you belonged to the club - A. I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. And now you are no longer a member of this club - A. I am not.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at the Crown and Cushion when the ballot was held respecting Barret - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the stewards at that time - A. I do not know the stewards; Mr. Slade was one; I believe Mr. Smith was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it - A. I think there is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Paxton one - A. To the best of my knowledge, but I will not be positive; I do not recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120074"></xptr>seeing him in the room that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. He might be a steward without being in the room - A. Not having looked at the books, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the steward now, and has the custody now - A. I cannot say - the stewards were changed at Lady-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubts that Biggs is one of the stewards now - A. I have not; I think there is no doubt of that, Mr. Biggs is one. I cannot answer to the other men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You were present at the ballot, were not you - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Kingsbury, or Laremouth there - A. I cannot say, I do not recollect seeing them; I was there one night when the subject was discussed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Laremouth a steward now - A. I believe not.</p>

               <persName id="t18090412-134-person1150">Paxton</persName>
             a steward or not - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the question that was discussed - A. About Barret; there was a difference of opinion about Mr. Barret; some looked upon him as a packer, others as a presser - whether he was to be continued as a packer or a presser that was the question, and if he was to be continued as a presser, then he was not a packer; it went to a ballot - thirty against him and ten for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the resolution - A. He was not a packer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the three stewards present at the meeting of the ballot - A. I answered that question - I doubt of Paxton being present.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of Smith and Slade being present - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was 
               <persName id="t18090412-134-person1151">Paxton</persName>
             a steward when the ballot was taken - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was to be done with Barret after the resolution, that he was not a packer - A. There were different opinions about it; it was nothing to me what others do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he allowed to work as a packer - A. He was not, as I understood it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. Was every thing done by the society by a ballot - A. Every thing that arose to a dispute, be it what it will.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no contrivance of ballot upon this subject, but every thing of all kind was settled by a ballot - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Then I understand you to say that Paxton was not there - do I understand you right - A. I cannot undertake to say I saw him there; I noticed Mr. Slade more than any of the rest, because he was of Mr. Barret's side.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to Smith, you do not undertake to say he was there - A. Smith and Slade were present.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not mean to be positive that Smith was there - A. I believe so; when a thing is doubtful I put my believe to it; I think he was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Have you any doubt that there were two stewards present - A. It remains rather a doubt in my mind, because I cannot answer it upon oath.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Barret working for him - A. I do; he left on the 31st of December last.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know why he went away - A. Of his own pleasure, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Hodson talking to him that day - A. Not particular to him; I saw him talking to Biggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Biggs, Laremouth and Kingsbury work for Mr. Hodson at that time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge about Barret's going away - A. He was told by Biggs that it would be settled the next meeting in his favour, and went away on that account.</p>
               <p>Q. What was meant by being settled in his favour - A. That he would be continued a packer by the society.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had made any objection against Barret not being a packer - A. Some persons in the society; he had served his time to Mr. Britten, who was not considered a regular master packer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Biggs, Kingsbury, or Laremouth, make any objection to him - A. No further. than there was a fine if they worked with him, or any person who was not considered a packer.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were your stewards, were they there at that time - A. There were three; I do not know all of their names; Slade was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith one - A. I believe he was one; I have some doubt, because I have not the pleasure of knowing him.</p>

               <persName id="t18090412-134-person1154">Paxton</persName>
             a steward - A. I believe he was; I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these three stewards was present at the first evening of the debate - was the ballot the first night or the second - A. The second night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Paxton there the first night - A. I do not know whether he was there or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith there - A. I believe he was; Slade was there, and Biggs; I do not think that Laremouth I think was there; Kingsbury was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the debate of the first night - A. No particular debate; some said he was a packer, and others said he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The society met again, did they not, upon Barret's business - A. Yes, they balloted; then the question was, whether he was to be continued a packer or a presser; he was thrown out, he was not considered as a packer, the number was about thirty against him, and nine or ten for him; then he was not continued a packer.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that affect Barret - A. That he must work at the pressing and not at the packing, and if any man worked with him at the packing they fined him a guinea, and excluded him the second time; I believe there was only one instance of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. You worked for Messrs. Hodson and Hager at the time the other men did - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the question originated with the society - A. It originated with individuals; some person called for a ballot; I cannot tell who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that you heard Biggs and Barret talking together - tell us what conversation passed between them - A. I heard Biggs and Kingsbury say that in all probability it would be finally settled in his favour, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120075"></xptr>he would be considered as a packer.</p>
               <p>Q. I would now ask you whether he went away upon that intimation, or was he turned away - A. He went away upon that intimation.</p>

               <p>Q. You say this man went away of his own accord - A. Yes; he went away without stopping to be dismissed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you heard what Mr. Hodson has said - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all paid on Saturday night as well as this man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. Had Kingsbury, Laremouth, and Biggs been discharged from Mr. Hodson's service - A. They were discharged the following Saturday night that Barret left; Barret went on the 31st, and they were discharged on the 7th; the ballot was held on the 6th; I believe it was finally decided on the 6th.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it decided the first meeting or the second meeting after Barret quitted - A. I cannot tell that; I went on the first club night.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said they told him that in all probability it would be finally settled in his favour, on the next Friday - do these questions usually take place whether a man shall work or not - A. I never knew such a question take place before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I do not understand you to speak to any of these three men, who were stewards, being present, excepting Slade; with respect to Smith you say you cannot be positively - A. No; I cannot undertake to say he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. And with respect to Paxton you do not know him, and therefore you cannot undertake to say whether he was there or no - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You say that Barret went away of his own accord - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that he went away of his own accord - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard what Mr. Hodson has stated - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Mr. Hodson had an occasion of remonstrating with these men - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Upon the oath you have taken do you believe that Mr. Hodson dare to employ them after this - A. I think he might have run the risk of these men paying the fine.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to have it understood that you could believe that the workmen would have gone on with paying the fine of a guinea, and the second time they would have been excluded - do not you know that - A. I know it now.</p>

               <p>THOMAS COWPER. I am a journeyman packer; I work for Mr. Hodson.

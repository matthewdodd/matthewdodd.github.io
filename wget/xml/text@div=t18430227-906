                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ANN LORD</hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Lord. I paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the pri<lb></lb>soner, for the purpose of delaying my husband's departure—I paid him ten sovereigns on the 3rd of Dec, which I had received from my brother at Bir<lb></lb>mingham—I paid that to the prisoner to take to the office of Captain Murray, and it was to be returned in the event of its not serving for my husband's dis<lb></lb>charge—the prisoner did not tell me whether it would be sufficient for that purpose—I parted with it on the understanding that if it was not sufficient it was to be returned—I gave it to the prisoner in a public-house in Bateman's-buildings (I think it is the Mitre), and required him to bring me a receipt for it—he afterwards brought this receipt to me in the public-house, and told me he had paid the money to Captain Murray.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> On the morning of the 3rd Dec, do you recollect going to a loan society, in Hackney-road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I went to make inquiries respecting hireing a loan, not exactly for the purpose of obtaining a loan—I wished to know their terms—there were three letters written at the loan society by my direction, to try if I could succeed in getting a sufficient quantity of money to purchase my husband's discharge—one of them was to my husband's mother, and one to his aunt—I did not consider that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be sufficient to pur<lb></lb>chase his discharge—I considered I was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—I have not received any promise from Captain Murray of my husband's discharge in the event of prose<lb></lb>cuting you—I did not make my uncle and aunt acquainted with this—Cap<lb></lb>tain Murray acquainted my uncle with it on the 10th of Dec.—I applied to the police at Lambeth-street respecting having been defrauded of this money on the 10th of Dec.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you saw Captain Murray for the first time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 10th of Dec—I did not know before then that my hus<lb></lb>band was not to be discharged—I imagined the prisoner had succeeded—I had not seen the prisoner—he sent two letters to me to say he would call on me in the evening, when he returned from Chatham.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES MURRAY</hi>. I did not at any time receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner—this receipt or memorandum is not my writing, or written by my, authority—I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at Lambeth-street office.</p>

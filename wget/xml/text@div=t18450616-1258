                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live in Great Titchfield-street, Marylebone. On the 16th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I went to St. Katherine's Dock with my horse and van—I saw both the pri<lb></lb>soners</p>

               <p>there together—they told me where to back on to the crane—after unloading my van, I gave the horse a feed under the crane—leaving the horse and van there, I went to get refreshment, returned in ten minutes and the horse and van were gone—I gave information to the gatekeeper—I received information, and went with Russell, and found my van at the Greenwich Railway, at half-past ten o'clock at night—I found the horse and harness in custody of the police, at Smithfield.</p>

                  </hi> I was in Smithfield-market on the 16th of May, about six o'clock, and saw the two prisoners with a horse and harness, leading it towards the entrance of the market—both had whips in their hands—Sullivan had the whip now produced—the other had a snorter one—I went up and asked them if the horse was for sale—Dawson asked me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I asked whom it belonged to—they said a man named Lancaster—I asked what it had been doing—Dawson said, drawing chaff and pota<lb></lb>toes—I asked where his master was—he said, "Somewhere about here"—I said, "Can you sell it?—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What do you mean to take for it?"—he said 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after some talk, he offered it at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I bid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—many people came round, and at last be allowed it to me at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would have it, and took him towards the police station to pay him—we stepped into the door of the George—I said I would pay him before a policeman, to make myself right—I went to the police-station, but they took very little notice of it—Russell came up in private clothes, and took him into custody.</p>

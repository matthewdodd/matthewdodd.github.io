                  </hi>. I live at Southall—I am a gardener in the employment of Dr. Stewart, of that place—on the Thursday morning, 29th July last, about 445, I was proceeding to my work at Dr. Stewart's,—which is in North Road; it is the next house to the Elms on the left-hand side, it is called the Shrubberies—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a plan</hi>) the carriage door is just opposite the lamp post—the Elms is at the corner, the end abuts on the North Road, the front faces the High Road—almost directly after I turned the corner, about 6 or 7 yards, I saw the body of a woman, it was just in the gully grating, the middle of the body was over the grating—it was quite daylight—the head was towards the Uxbridge Road—I went up to the body, the clothes were turned up to the chin, leaving the whole of the body quite exposed—I saw Police-constable Cooper coming in the opposite direction; I made signs to him to come to me—before he came up I touched the body to ascertain whether she was cold; she was quite cold on the face and legs, and quite dead—I noticed a bruise on the left side of the neck, I noticed nothing on the face—the tongue was slightly protruding from the month—she was lying on her back, the right leg was extended straight from, the body and the other drawn up, but yet extended from the centre of the body—I noticed a swelling, a large lump on the bottom of the stomach close to her private parts—I noticed that because it was so prominent, not from the colour but from the size of it—I also noticed a quantity of dirt in or on that part—the constable procured a cart ladder and with my assistance he placed the body on it—on moving the body the constable picked up this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and immediately after<lb></lb>wards I picked up a pair of cots, to the best of my knowledge these are them, they are things that brickmakers use to handle bricks with, they are made of leather, principally from old boots—one of her boots was off and lying 3 or 4 yards from the body in the road; I can't say whether it was the right or left boot; it was on the edge of a trail that I noticed, the dust had been disturbed above the body towards the Uxbridge road and a little towards the left hand side of the road, on the opposite side to that on which the body was lying; it was a little towards the side but near the centre of the road, between the body and Dr. Stewart's, only higher up, it left an irregular mark about a yard in width—I mean the mark where the dirt looked as if it had been first disturbed; extending from this was a trail leading to the place where the body was in the form of an arc—it looked as if the dust had been disturbed, sweeping round in a circular form, it was one continuous sweep; there was a trail from that to the body, it looked as if the body had fallen in the centre of the road and the trail led right up to the place where the body lay, as if her clothes had flopped down in the road—the body was close up to the hedge, there is a slight bank up to the hedge, and it was just at the bottom of the hedge—the length of the trail was about 8 or 9 yards—it had been a fine night, the ground was quite dry, there was a quantity of dust, there had not been</p>

               <p>any rain for a week—the boot was on the edge of the trail, about half-way: down the trail and on the side nearest the hedge, it was an old spring side: boot, but the springs were almost gone, it would have been very easy to. have pulled off—nobody was about there except the constable—I observed two marks just below the woman's legs, they were two indentations in the ground, the ground was very soft there—I formed an opinion from the appearance of the marks that they had been caused by the toes of a man's boots sticking in the ground, they looked like that—they were almost in a line with the centre of the body, between the two legs, but about a foot below—the legs were open and wide apart—I noticed a bruise on one of the legs, near the knee; I could not say on which leg, I think it was slightly below the knee, but I could not say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> By the High Road I mean the Uxbridge Road—the North Road is a thoroughfare—I know Adams' farm; it is not shown on the plan—it is situated in the bend of the road, on the right hand side going from the Uxbridge Road; it is below Hunter's farm—I do not know of any-way to Adams' farm from near the gully grating, I know that part well—there is a stile about 70 or 80 yards further down, which leads into the back premises of Adams' farm.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 71). On the morning of 29th July I was on duty at Southall, near the North Road—I saw the last witness there—he made a sign to me—I went to him and saw the body of a woman at the side of the road—she was on her back—her clothes were up right over her waist, the lower part of her body was all exposed, and resting naked on, the ground; the legs were extended—I noticed a large lump partly on the thigh—the boot was off the right foot and lying about a foot from the feet—I felt her arms and legs, she was dead and quite cold—I noticed a bruise on the neck, the neck was very much discoloured, as though she had had a blow or kick—there was a scar on the left temple, but not any blood flowing from it—a handful of dust or red sand was thrown into her person—I went to the Red Lion yard and got a cart ladder, called up the landlord and got assistance, and removed the body to the tap room of the Red Lion, and sent to the in<lb></lb>spector at the station—as I lifted the body to carry it away, I noticed this cap, it. was lying right under the centre of the body, and these cots were lying underneath the cap—the body was not very stiff, because I straight<lb></lb>ened the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>—the trunk was not <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> when I stripped the things off two hours after—after removing the body 'I went and examined the state of the road—it was about 4.50 when I took the body away, and about 5.40 when I examined the road—I found a trail in the centre of the road opposite where the body lay, of about 8 or 9 yards, as though she had been dragged along the road, which was swept by her clothes—there were marks of feet as though some one's feet had been trampling about, about a foot from the place, just in a line with the body—I noticed nothing else—I had been down the North Road about 2 o'clock that morning, it is my beat—I did not notice anything then—there was no moon; if the body had been there then I might have passed with<lb></lb>out seeing it—there was some quarrelling going on in another direction—I went down the road from the Uxbridge Road on the left hand side, by the Elms—the road is about 7 yards wide there—it was rather dull towards the morning part—there is a little grass at the side of the road where the body was—there is a lamp post there, but it was not alight; they do not light them in the summer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon living at Hanwell, and am divisional surgeon to the police—on the morning of 29th July, I was sent for by the police to go to Southall—I went to the Red Lion and there saw the body of a woman lying dead in the tap-room; that was about 7 o'clock—I carefully examined the body; I made notes when I returned home—the bonnet and clothes were on the body—the first thing that called my attention was a bruise on the left temple, it was a bruise and an abrasion as well, and a few drops of blood had oozed from it—the bruise extended from the temple down the left side of the neck under the lower jaw, and the parts were swollen under the jaw and at the side of the neck—the bruise was about from three to four inches wide from the side of the neck under the jaw; the abrasion was on the left temple; that was not more than an inch long—I did not measure it—I had to unpin the bonnet to see a portion of what I have described, it was pinned under the chin with one pin—I also unpinned a bit of ribbon that was round the neck; they were not tightly pinned on—it was all discoloured from the temple down the side of the neck and under the lower jaw, it was a bluish black; that was owing to effusion of blood under the skin—the lips were congested, that is, of a bluish colour, darkish—neither the ribbon under the chin or that round the neck could have produced any injury during life—on removing the clothes I found the body still warm round the waist, where it had been covered by the clothes—the rest of the body was cold—there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> no marks about the body—between the legs on the right thigh and partially on the lower part of her person, there was a swelling, on the right external labia, about the size of an <hi rend="italic">egg</hi>, and on pressing it some slight blood oozed from the parts, showing a communication—there was no abrasion, only the swelling;' the internal parts must have been injured to have caused what I saw—there was a rupture of the mucous membrane lining the vagina—there was a quantity of gritty dust and sand in the vagina—there was a slight abrasion on the left knee about an inch long, just over the knee cap; in my judgment the cause of death was direct violence applied to the head and neck—I should say death had taken place from four to six hours when I saw the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE GUILTY</hi>. There was nothing but a bruise and swelling; that was caused by violence, but how caused I should not like to state positively—there must have been very great external violence to have done that, such violence as I considered sufficient to cause death—a fall would not account for the injuries, nor could they have been done by herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Supposing a fall, the result of a push, I do not think that would cause such injuries as I saw on the head—it would be violence, but not sufficient to produce what I saw—it would depend on the force that came in contact with the body, there should have been some protrud<lb></lb>ing body to have got under the lower jaw to produce what I describe, and I have no evidence to show me that there was anything of the kind—if she was expelled from the house and fell on the edge of a stone step, in my opinion that would not account for the abrasion and discoloration I observed on her head—I do not think that would account for what I saw—I made a careful examination—I did not open the body or head, my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200020"></xptr>
               <p>opinion was founded on the external appearances—I considered the external examination sufficient to enable me to account for the death—I am a surgeon of twenty years' experience, I have been an army surgeon, and have seen every kind of wound—I have been for many years in the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, where we have every kind of injury—I was nine and a half years in the army, and have seen every possible kind of injury that could be inflicted by force—I describe the abrasion as a slight one—the ribbon was tight but not sufficiently tight to—cause strangulation—it was pinned in the ordinary way—I described it as tight before the Magistrate—I should say it fitted accurately round the neck, but not so as to produce any injurious effect—I cannot suppose that it could cause strangulation if she were drunk and rolling about the road, because on re<lb></lb>moving the ribbon there was no mark of tightening, which must have been there if it had produced any injurious effect—there must have been a regular mark left on the neck, but there was not—there would have been a line all round the neck if it had produced congestion of the upper part of the head—I did not smell her breath, there was no breath to smell, it was all gone—I had no means of ascertaining whether she had been in liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I should say that death might be almost instantaneous from such an injury as I saw, or in a very few minutes—it would affect the senses at once—there was no dirt or grit about the neck, nor any mark of any jagged thing having struck it, except on the temple—I do not think that the discoloration, which extended all down, was consequent upon the abrasion on the temple—I think there must have been more than one act of violence, one on the temple and another under the neck or under the jaw over the large blood vessels and nerves—I should say her age was from about fifty-eight to sixty, as near as I could judge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Southall—on the night of 28th July, I was at the White Hart, a few minutes before 11 o'clock—I heard a bother outside the Black Horse, and went out and saw five men and three women, and one of them had a little child—one of the men was very drunk, an old man, neither of the prisoners—I saw Stone Street there; I did not see the other prisoner, not to know him; I am not able to say whether I saw him or not—I saw Stonestreet taking hold of one of the drunken men's arms trying to get him up as he was down on the ground, and I saw another man talking to a woman over against the porch of the door of the Black Horse; I could not say who that was, it was not Stonestreet—I don't know who the woman was; she looked an oldish woman—I went away towards Uxbridge, some of them followed me, but I could not say which or how many—I did not see the deceased next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hillingdon—I am an ostler at the White Hart, at Hayes—on 28th July last, I was walking home from London by way of Southall—I got to Southall, about 12 o'clock, the clock struck 12 as I went by the Three Horse shoes, at Southall—just beyond there by the smithy, I saw five persons, two females, and three men—they were sitting on the side of the road, and one man was lying in the road on his back—one of the women was trying to get him up—there were two carts coming towards London, and she asked him to get up; he did not answer, he seemed almost too far gone—I heard her say to the man with the cart, "Master, there is a man in the road, don't run over him," and he pulled aside and passed him—they were wrangling and one of the women said "It is just what I expected if we came over here, you would get drunk and quarrelsome"—I passed them, and after I got by I heard one of the females say "You are like all the rest of them, Stone Street"—I kept on my way, and when I had got from 80 to 100 yards, I heard cries of murder five distinct times, that proceeded from behind me where I had left these parties; I should say certainly without a doubt the cries came from that spot—when I got 30 or 40 yards further, I met my brother-in-law, Henry Clark coming to London, and I then heard cries of murder again, four or five times from the same direction—the moon was rising; it was a beautiful moonlight night—my brother-in-law went on to London, and I went on my road for Hayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was in the main road to Uxbridge, I did not go back again, on hearing the cries, because I was quite exhausted; I had been laid up for a long time with a broken thumb, and as my brother-in-law was going past, I told him to look out; he lives at Hillingdon Heath—I did not think the cries were distressing cries, nor yet as though the woman was hurt; they were quarrelsome cries, as though it was man and wife quarrelling, and the man might have struck her in a case of intoxica<lb></lb>tion,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Taylor, a labourer, in the employ<lb></lb>ment of Mr. Whittington, a farmer at Yedding, about 2 miles from Southall—on 28th July we had been hay-making there—Stone Street was also employed there; he had been at work with us for a week or more—I have known him for the last three years and his family; he lives just past Mr. Whittington's—on this evening I was at the Black florae, at Southall, with my husband, Sarah Ware and her husband, and her brother Richard Wilkins, and Stonestreet—we left Mr. Whittington's between 7 and 8 o'clock, and met Drinkwater on our way—he went with us to the Black Horse; I don't know what time we got there—we called for several pots of beer there, and were drinking in the tap-room—about half an hour or twenty minutes after we were there I noticed an elderly woman come into the tap-room; she had fusees in her hand to sell—I did not notice how she was dressed—she stood there two or three minutes, and we asked her if she would drink out of our pot—she said "Yes," and then she said "<hi rend="italic">Now</hi> you have asked me to drink I will go and fetch a pot of beer and you shall drink with me," and she went and fetched a pot into the tap-room—we drank some of it; it was more to associate with us two women, she did not care for the association of the men much—she stayed there till it was time to close the house—I saw her leave—I left first with my child in my, arms, and was waiting outside for my husband and the rest to come out—she seemed rather obstinate in coming out; the landlord told her it was time to go out, and she did not seem to take heed to his words, and he took her by. the shoulders and put her out of the door, and after I saw her put out she fell—she seemed to fall right in front—I was standing by the side of the step and she fell to the left—I did not notice whether she hurt herself—I saw her get up and turn to the left, and I never saw anything more of her—by that time my husband and the rest of them were out, and we went to the right, towards the blacksmith's shop, and then all our men sat down; they were very drunk—Stonestreet was with us; he was helping Thomas Ware home, who was very drunk and insensible—I did not see Drinkwater at that time; I did not see him come out of the public-house, but when we were at the smithy I heard him come and call Stonestreet—we were then sitting down close opposite the smithy, because our husbands were very much in drink, and we had a job to get them along—Thomas Ware was lying in the road—Drinkwater called "<hi rend="italic">Joby</hi>, I want you a moment," and Stonestreet. went back with him in the direction of the Black Horse—we then went on a little further, within about 20 yards of where we had to cross the fields, and our husbands sat down again—I was persuading my husband to come home; he was rather ill-tempered in drink, and said he would not—I said something that he did not like, and he went to strike me—I was afraid he would strike my child, and I cried out "Murder!" Three times—after that we turned to go across Mr. Rice's fields, and when we got into the hay field Stonestreet overtook us—I can't exactly say the time, but I believe it was about three quarters of an hour after he had left us—he came into the hayfield were we were—we had sat down there again in the haycocks—I did not notice then whether he was wearing any hat or cap, because it was very dark—at the time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200024"></xptr>
               <p>he left us he was wearing a black hat—he came across the fields, the same way we had come—I did not see Drinkwater again till between 4 and 5 o'clock, when we were going home—he had on a black cap—Stonestreet asked him where the old woman went to, what had become of her—Drinkwater said "I don't know; I woke up and found myself laid alongside of her, and there she lay, just as we left her"—Stonestreet said nothing to that—Drink-water was wearing a round black hat, a billycock, and he said "Ah, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Joby</hi>, I have lost my hat, but I shall stick to yours till I find mine"—Stone-Street was then wearing a handkerchief round his head—we then all of us went to Mr. Whittington's, and about 11 o'clock in the day we started to go away, looking for harvesting—we had finished our haymaking for Mr. Whittington the night we went to Southall, but we went back for our things—the prisoners went with us looking for harvesting till we came to Littleton, at Shepperton Green, about 3 miles from Staines, and we all took a piece of corn each at General Wood's—the prisoners both worked there for two or three days, and when we had finished they went away—a great many rabbits were caught and killed while we were cutting the corn; the prisoners took part in killing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think we went to work at General Wood's on the Saturday and went away on the Wednesday; the prisoners went away an hour before us—I saw them carrying rabbits and the rabbits were bleeding very much; that was while we were at General Wood's—both the prisoners wore white jackets, but I could not swear to the jackets—they were similar to these (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On Saturday, August 21st, I went with Mr. Wills to Guildford and found the two prisoners there at the station—I know Drinkwater well—I heard Mr. Wills tell them what they we're charged with—Drinkwater's father has been to me on several occasions, and has assisted me with all the information he could give—he told me that his son was at Sutton, and I proceeded there with the inspector, I found he had been at work there, but could not trace him at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a contractor for burning bricks—Drinkwater worked for me eight or ten weeks up to five weeks before 28th July—he was not at work for me that day, but he was with me that day; I was burning bricks at that time, and he said "Can I come to work in the morn<lb></lb>ing?"—I said "Yes, there is a job for you, Joe, if you have a mind to come"</p>

               <p>—he said "I shall be there in the morning; here is a pair of new cots, look, that I have got to come to work with"—these are the cots, they were new, made out of old leather; they have not been used for bricks—he did not come to work next day, and I did not see him afterwards till he was in custody.</p>

I am a farmer at Yedding—that is about 2 1/2 miles from Southall across the fields—I know both the prisoners, they are natives of Yedding—Stone Street worked for me on 28th July—I finished my hay making that day, and he left with the rest—on the morning of the 29th I saw the prisoners together at my premises about 5.30 or 6 o'clock, and they left that morning with three men and two women.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Clarke. I was walking with her, and saw the prisoner and another young man come forward to meet her - I saw the prisoner take hold of the bag, catch it from her arm, and run across the heath - I am not certain whether it was him cut the bag from her arm, or the other young man, but the prisoner took it from her arm - a gentleman pursued him, and he threw it away - I saw it picked up, on the spot where I saw it thrown - I never lost sight of the prisoner till he was taken - I saw him delivered to the policeman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near was the other young man to your mistress? A. He was close by my mistress - the prisoner and him were both close together - the young men were quite visible to my mistress.</p>

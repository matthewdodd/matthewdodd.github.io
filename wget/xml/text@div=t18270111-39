             keeps the house. The prisoner came to lodge there that day - we slept in the same room, which has three beds in it; he slept alone, the landlord and his son slept in one, and a young man slept with me. On the 30th of December I left my room, about twenty minutes before eight o'clock; my box was then safe; there were twenty sovereigns in it, wrapped in a piece of paper, and two or three Bank notes, wrapped in another paper - I returned about half-past twelve o'clock that morning, and went to my box for some money - I found the moulding split off the top, so that it could be opened without breaking the lock; the twenty sovereigns were gone - I came down and mentioned the robbery, then went and gave information at Bow-street; I made inquiry at the White Horse Cellars, and from information I received there, I found the prisoner drinking with the coachman at the Star and Garter, Kew Bridge - I told him I had been robbed, and he must return with me, and make his own case good - he said he was going to Hampshire, and if he did return, he would make somebody pay for it - he had a bundle, which he wanted to send on, but I would not let him - I brought him back; he said, on the road, that he had only two or three shillings to pay his way with; he was searched at my lodgings, and a sovereigns found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not tell you, the day before, that he was going to see a friend at Brentford? A. That was in the Christmas week - he said he had lived with a lady in Hampshire; he returned with me without an officer, and threatened me with an action for taking him off his journey.</p>

            . I was visiting at Leapard's on Saturday morning, the 30th of December. About ten o'clock the prisoner came and asked me what was due for lodging- I sent the servant to ask; she came down, and said 2s.; he gave her half-a-crown, and told me he was going to Epping, in Essex, and that he had got a job there as a gardener, at 12s. a week - he used to pay for his lodging nightly, till the Tuesday, when he agreed to pay weekly, as he said he was short of money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Anybody might have gone upstairs while he was waiting with you, and seen the things were right? A. Nobody was up-stairs but Mr. Leapard; he was very much agitated when he paid me.</p>

            . I lodge in his room. On the morning of the 30th of December, I got up a few minutes after Haycock; I closed the door, and left the prisoner alone in the room - when he first came, he had just left a situation at Mr. Owen's, where he said he had received 15s., and it must last him till he got another place. I met him in the passage about twenty minutes past nine o'clock that day, going into the tap-room; he had a pint of beer, which he paid 2 1/2d. for, and said it was the last money he had got - he told me he had met a countryman of his, and was going to Essex, where he could have 12s. a week as under gardener, and the countryman would pay his way down, as he had no money himself - I saw him go away, with two small bundles in a handkerchief - he had some old clothes in the room, but no new ones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you intimate with him? A. No; he told me he had no money, and I gave him part of my breakfast; the servant locks the room when she makes the bed.</p>

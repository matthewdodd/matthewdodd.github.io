                  </hi>. On 24th July, about seven o'clock, I was at a public-house, in Whitechapel drinking—the prisoner came in, and asked me if I would go home and take tea with her—I went and did so—I had a breast<lb></lb>pin safe then—she asked me for money to get some drink—I was with mother girl pretending to sleep—the prisoner came back, took my pin out of my breast and my watch from my pocket—she told the girl to put the watch back again, she did so—I asked her two or three times for the pin—she said she had not had it—I said I would give her in charge—she said she would give it back if I would stop with her till morning—she then put the pin back again—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I fetched a policeman.</p>

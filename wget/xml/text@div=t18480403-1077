                  </hi> I live at 29, Caroline-street, Pimlico. On the morn<lb></lb>ing of 17th March, about 7 o'clock, I was dressing in my bed-room on the parlour floor, and fancied I heard an unsual noise in the kitchen—I heard some one come up stairs whistling—I went into the passage, and saw the prisoner; I said, "holloa! young fellow, what game have you been <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> down below"—he said, "Not anything"—I said, "Oh, nonsense, you must have been up to something, what brought you in here, how did you get in?"—he said, "I found the door open, and I have been down stairs and knocked at the kitchen door, to inquire of the servant girl for the wash"—I said, "What wash? that is nonsense; where are your pails to carry it away in" He was then on the door step, and I said, "I have a great mind to give you in charge, "but I could see no person in the street—he said, "I can have a very good character, I am very well known, I have not been up to anything whatever"—I felt round the outside of his smock frock, and found nothing on him—I then said, "Come down stairs with me, and if you have removed nothing, I will let you go"—he objected, so I detained him—a milkman came up, and he detained the prisoner while I went down stairs—the kitchen door was open, which had been locked over-night, and one drawer of a chest open—I immediately missed a pair of black trowsers and two coats—I fetched a policeman, and he went down stairs with me and the prisoner, and after some time, I found the missing things tied up in a bundle just outside the kitchen door, in a recess—these are my property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this handkerchief they were tied up in—I had seen them the day before in the drawers.</p>

On the morning of 17th March, the prosecutor fetched me—I went into the kitchen with him and the prisoner—I looked for the property, and found it in leaving the kitchen—I took the prisoner to the station, returned to the prosecutor's house, an in con<lb></lb>sequence for information, I got a light, put it down the water-closet, and there saw a key—I took it up—it will not open the latch of the house door, but it is a very common latch—it appeared to have been recently dropped in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Albion Stores, High-street, Shadwell, and was so in August last—the prisoner came in there about 10 or 11 o'clock one morning in August—he asked for half-a-pint of beer, which came to one penny—I served him, and he offered me a shilling—I found it was bad, and knowing him previously I did not take it off the counter—I told him that I knew very well what he was, and that I knew him before; that it was a bad one, and it was no use his trying his games on me there—I had seen him before—I said if he did not leave the house I would lock him up—he offered to pay me with a penny, which he handed me—I refused to take it—I took the beer away, and he left the house—before he left I broke the shilling in two, gave him one part and kept the date part, which I afterwards gave to the constable—that was the first time I saw the prisoner in that house, but I have seen him previously at another house where I was in service—that was in Whitecross-street, St. Luke's, about eighteen months ago—I served him with some beer—I do not know whether it was a pint or half-a-pint—he tendered me a bad shilling—I do not know what I did with it afterwards; it was lost—I told him at the time that it was bad, and he left the house as quickly as possible, and did not drink the beer—I also saw him on the Thursday or Friday before Christmas, about 19th or 20th December—he asked for a pint of beer—I served him—I recognised him when he came: in—I called the attention of the master and mistress, and of the other barman, to him—the beer came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me a bad shilling—I told him it was bad, and broke it in two—I told him I should lock him up if he did not leave the house quickly—he then left—I was going to give him half of the shilling, but did not—I kept the two pieces—I afterwards gave them to the constable, K 149—there is an under-barman in our house, named Wasp—he never serves any one in the morning—on 1st January, between 9 and 10 in the morning, I was behind the bar, down on my knees, doing some cleaning, and my hands were dirty; the prisoner came and called for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum—I said to the under-barman, "Just serve that gentleman"—I said, "What did that man give you?"—he said, "A shilling"—I did not see him come in, but I saw him go out—he could not have seen me—I recognised him as being the party that was in before—from something Wasp said I looked in the till—there was only one shilling in it, and it was a bad one—Wasp ran out after the prisoner, and brought him and a constable back—I gave that shilling also to the constable.</p>

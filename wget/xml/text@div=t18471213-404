                  </hi> I am a tanner at Alnwick, in Northumberland, which is thirty miles from the bordesr—Lamberton-toll is supposed to divide the countries—it is outside the boundary of the borders—when you are through Lamberton-toll you are in Scotland—I do not know whether there is a house on the other side of Lamberton-toll at which marriages are solemnized—I was only in one house where the toll place is—that was at Lamberton-toll, in Scotland—I was married there myself fifteen years ago—it is a regular custom for persons to be married there—I dare say I know 100 who have been married there—I know the forms that are gone through, perfectly well—I had a sister named Elizabeth, who was married there on 8th Aug., 1836—I was present—she was married by Edward Gray, to the prisoner—I had never seen Mr. Gray before—I and Mary Purvis were the Witnesses—they were married in the same way as other persons—I was never present at any marriage there but the prisoner's and my own—the ceremony was the same as in the church—the prayer-book was had down, and the marriage service road—the whole of it—their hands were joined, and the ring used—the prisoner lived with my sister seven years—she had three children when he left her, four years ago, and she was then pregnant—I saw her alive last Saturday—I am quite certain that they were married at the usual place where marriages are celebrated in that part of Scotland.</p>

             in the act of pulling out ear-rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before that - A. Yes, on the 6th of March. I saw Donald Forsyth endeavouring to push out a piece of glass in the shop window, he could not do it on account of the putty being so hard; the pane of glass had been cracked before, there was no hole in it; upon my seeing him attempting to do this he was followed down the Strand, he was by himself; that is all I saw then.

             in the act of taking out the ear-rings; the other prisoner was standing by him at the time; he had a hook wire. The glass had been previously pushed out, I did not see it pushed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him move any thing - A. One earring. I had observed the window half an hour before, the piece of glass was not pushed out then. We were watching the window every half hour, expecting he would come.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you observed him take out an ear-ring with an hooked wire - A. He 
               <persName id="t18100411-47-person519">drew</persName>
             the ear-ring to the front of the tray in which it was laying, there was no glass in the front of the tray, and when he

             the ear-ring to the front of the tray he put his finger within the window and took it out; the two other rings that were found on him were previously taken out; Mr. Field went out of doors, took them both, and brought them into the shop.</p>


               <p>Q. At the time that Forsyth was doing this, what did Doran do - A. He appeared to be covering him, he was dressed in a soldiers great coat, standing close to him. I saw the prisoners searched when the officer came, three ear-rings were found upon Forsyth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that ear-ring found upon him that you saw him take out of the shop - A. It was. Doran had his forefinger cut, it appeared to have been recently done.</p>

On the 6th of March I saw Forsyth leave the window, and after he had gone five or six paces I saw Doran join him: I followed them along the Strand, they went up Southampton-street. On the 7th, about one o'clock, I saw Forsyth at the window; I had observed the window about a quarter of an hour before that time, there was only a simple crack in the glass, no hole whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. After you observed the boy Forsyth there what further did you observe - A. I observed that they were both very close to the window, I called to young Mr. Miers to come to observe what they were doing, while I went to the door, and when I went to the door I laid hold of them both and brought them in; I stepped in between them and took them one in each hand. I took this hooked wire from Forsyth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Brooker, of 2, York-street, Bamoudsey New-road—on Saturday morning, 17th August, between 2 and 3 o'clock, before daylight, I was in Bermondsey New-road—a wagon loaded with greens passed along—two bundles fell off; I picked them up, I was going to take them to the owner of the wagon—the prisoner came behind me—I am positive he is the man—he asked me for the greens—I said, no, they were not his and they were not mine, I would go and give them to the owner—he took a knife out of his pocket and stabbed me in two places. through my hand and on the back of it—my hand was considerably injured; I have been at the hospital ever since—he took one bunch of greens away from me and the other fell when I ran after him; he got away with one bunch—it did not take above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I had a full opportunity of seeing his face, I was close to a lamp—I distinctly saw the knife in his hand, it was a pocket-knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Guy's hospital—about 4 o'clock on the morning of 17th August the prosecutrix was brought into the hospital—I examined her—I found an incised wound at the back of the wrist sad an incised wound inside the thumb; the cut on the back of the wrist was about two inches long—she has been under my care ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are the wounds pretty well healed now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the wounds are—it is possible they might have been caused by falling upon a piece of a broken jug, but I should consider that the wounds would have been much more lacerated; they were not very deep—the laceration would depend upon how the jug was broken and upon the force of the fall.</p>

This lard is the property of Thomas Acocks. who trade under the firm of Yates and Acocks—Mr. Yates died five years ago—I am clerk in the service of Mr. Acocks—Bell and Sell were in his service—Bell was occasionally carman—between three and four o'clock, on the 17th of February, I received a communication from Sutton, and went to Farringdon-street—I there found this hamper, containing line bladders of lard—we have got these sort of things at our warehouse—to the best of my belief these bladders came from Mr. Acocks' warehouse—we opened a cask of lard and found one deficient—the hamper was directed in Bell's handwriting, to "Henry Sell, 4, Little Cambridge-place, Cambridge-street, Hackney-road"—Sell had no right to sell any—Sell was called down and asked what goods he had sent out by Bell—he mentioned certain articles, and then Mr. Acocks asked if he had not sent out a basket of lard directed—he said. "No, he was certain"—Mr. Acocks said, "Have you not sent out a basket of lard, directed by yourself, to your own house?"—he then said, "I had better not say any more."</p>

               <p>Q. Had she given you any notice that she was to quit your lodging? - A. No; I expected to see her when I came back; the next morning I missed the watch, three spoons, two new cotton gowns, and two guineas and a half in gold, I never found any of my property again; when I saw her, I asked her if I could recover any of my property; I told her she had acted very wrong to me, as I had known her many years; I told her I would not give her into the hands of any Justice whatever, if she would return me my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more? - A. Only from her own confession before the Magistrate.</p>

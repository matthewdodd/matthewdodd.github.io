                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>). On 19th, April, about 3 o'clock—I was in Tower Dock, a very little distance from Tower Hill, with. Halse and Forrester—there-was a great crowd on the free opening of the Tower, there was also a crowd round a man with performing cats—watched them and saw the prosecutor come into the crowd—Anderson placed himself by his side, and Thompson immediately behind—they remained there a minute or two, left and crossed Tower Hill, and Anderson gave something to Thompson, who looked at it, and they <hi rend="italic">went through Savage Gardens, and Crutched Friars, to the corner of Mark Lane, wheh they</hi> appeared <hi rend="italic">to notice</hi> that they were being followed—they commenced</p>

               <p>running, crying out "Stop thief!"—100 or 200 gentlemen were coming out from the Corn Exchange, and they wedged them in—Thompson ran up a court where there was no thorough fare, he put his hand in his trousers' pocket, and threw something up against a lot of cases against the wall—we searched the cases and found this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced) in a</hi> number of pieces—Halse picked it up—when I saw the prosecutor there, I noticed a chain hanging from his pocket—I conveyed Thompson to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor did not go into the middle of the crowd, but outside—I did not know any one else behind him except the prisoners and myself; I was standing by, just on the pavement—I, was watching them for some time—I did not see either of them take the watch—I noticed the chain gone from the prosecutor's waistcoat—I did not speak to him—I did not ask him whether he had lost anything, because I knew he had—he went away and I saw him afterwards at the station—if he had not gone to the station we might have had an indictment here for stealing the watch of somebody unknown—I am guided by circumstances in asking if anything is lost; perhaps I know how to manage those things better than you do had spoken to the prosecutor, the prisoners would have been-off. and I should have got neither prisoners nor watch—it is very possible if I had spoken to the prosecutor that they would have got away.</p>

I was with the last witness, an exhibition of birds and cats was going on—I saw the prosecutor go into the crowd; I saw that he had a chain—I saw the prisoner Anderson was close to him and Thompson close behind him—I remained watching and saw the two prisoners leave the boy, and in consequence of a communication Downs made to me I followed them—I tried, to get as close as possible—at the corner of Mark Lane, Thompson Iooked back—I ran round some courts and found they were running down the opposite side of Mark Lane towards Great Tower Street as fast as they could and some gentlemen pursued them across the road and caught Anderson who I took hold of-Thompson ran up a gateway—I took Anderson up the. gateway where Thompson was, and saw Halse pick up this portion of the watch—I found the case of the watch in Anderson's right hand pocket.</p>

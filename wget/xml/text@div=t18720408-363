                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 26, Chicksand Street, Brick Lane—on the night of 25th March, about 11.15, I was proceeding home with my daughter and son-in-law, and as I was coming along Colum<lb></lb>bia Place I saw the two prisoners Standing in the middle, about six or eight yards off—Ditton came up to within about two yards of me, and said "Go<lb></lb>vernor, do you know such a street?"—I said I did not, and as I took a second step to go home I was caught by the neck, and received a violent blow in the mouth from Joyce—as soon as I was on the ground the two fell on the top of me, and wanted to rob me—I halloaed out for assistance, which brought two persons up, and a woman called out "Oh, there is Mr. Krekel on the ground"—I held my watch, and they could not get that, but they got the ring off it, and when they saw the neighbours open their doors and windows they walked away—the blood fell down from my head, and since then I have been fit to do nothing—I have been very nervous all over—I lost so much blood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ditton.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Hill, of 10, Lumley Place—on Sunday night, 25th March, I was at my street door, listening to the clock striking eleven—I saw four or five rather rough-looking men come by my door, and I saw Mr. Krekel talking to a neighbour—I had just got inside my door when I heard him say "Good night"—I looked out of the door, and saw the two prisoners in front of him—I saw Joyce take him by the throat, and Ditton <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at his watch—I screamed "Murder! police!" and they ran up the court—my husband ran out, and asked what was the matter—I said "Look at Krekel"—he was lying in the gutter—I knew him—I was once a lodger of his—my husband went to lay hold of Ditton—he made use of bad language, and offered to hit my husband—Joyce turned round, and said "It is all right, governor"—my husband said "I don't think it is all right; I think it is all wrong."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Joyce.

                  </hi>. I am shop-boy to Mr. Thomas Purvis, of Foley-street. On the evening of the 14th of January I was in the corner of the shop, and happened to took towards the door—I saw the prisoner come up to the door, and either cut a pair of boots or untwist them off the nail out<lb></lb>side the door, where they hung—I saw her take them—I ran out and caught her—I am sure she dropped them—there was a scuffle between us—she tried to get away from me—my master came up and secured her.</p>

               <p>was in the parlour, and was called into the street—I saw a pair of boots lying at the private door, and found the boy hanging to the prisoner at the corner of the street—I went up and took her into the shop, and gave her in charge—she said she was innocent, would I let her go—I said, "No"—she said would I send for her infant—I said, "No"—she was searched in my presence at the station-house, and eighteen duplicates found on her—a neighbour brought a pair of scissors in.</p>

            . My husband keeps a butcher's shop in Distaff-lane. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, in the morning of the 24th of May, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked for half a pound of beef steak, it came to four pence halfpenny, and he gave me a three shilling piece to pay for it, which. I put into the desk, and which was the only one of the new coin I had, for the new coin the head is considerably larger than in the old. As soon as he went out at one door, Mr. Johnson came in at the other, and asked me what money I had received from the prisoner; I gave him the three shilling piece, he marked it in my presence, but I did not. Mr. Johnson called for it in about half an hour; I am positive as to the person of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should wish to ask that witness whether there were not other persons in the shop, and whether they might not have given her a three shilling piece - A. I might have taken three shilling pieces before, but never a one of this sort; and while the prisoner was in the shop he was the only person from whom I took a three shilling piece at all.</p>

             who keeps the Cock and Bottle in Cannon-street. The prisoner came to our house, between ten and eleven o'clock, on the morning of the 24th of May, had a glass of porter, and paid for it with a three shilling piece; I observed, that the three shilling piece was quite a new one; I marked it, I had but one other three shilling piece, which was an old one.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSON. I am an officer, I saw the prisoner on Wednesday the 24th of May about ten o'clock in the morning, in company with another man in Thomas-street; they went down Distaff-lane, and there the prisoner went into Mr. Pocklington's While the prisoner was in the shop, I slipped myself up a Court opposite, I knew that situation; I commanded a view of the shop; I saw him receive some meat, and some change; there were two doors, to the shop, and as soon as the prisoner came out at me I went in at the other. The prisoner and the other man joined company; I found they passed a bad three shilling piece there which I marked, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210029"></xptr>then followed him into Cannon-street. The prisoner there left his commission and went into the Cock and Bottle, the other man went up Abchurch-yard; I went in when the prisoner came out, and by enquiry of Mr. Hale, I learned what had happened; she gave me a three shilling piece, which she had marked; I left the three shilling piece until I returned, I then went in pursuit again; and in crossing Corn-hill I saw the prisoner crossing the 'Change and I think I saw the other man going down the Hill; I took the prisoner into custody; and on searching him, I found upon him two three shilling pieces wrapt up in paper, and there were eight others where I found them seperate; there was other money in the other breeches pocket, here they are. This is the one I received from Mrs. Pocklington, and this from Mr. Hale.</p>
               <p>EDMOND HOMMERSHAM. I am a teller at the Bank, and am in the habit of inspecting base coin. All these three shilling pieces are counterfeit, and exactly of the same manufactory, they are merely washed.</p>

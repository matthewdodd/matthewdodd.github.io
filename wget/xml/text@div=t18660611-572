I am a grocer, of Mill-street, Deptford—on 13th May, about twenty minutes to 5 in the morning, I was awoke—I got up and found my shop had been entered—the outer door was open, which I had fastened at half-past 12 the night before—I had the key in my bedroom—I found my tobacco-drawer empty—there had been about 11/2; lbs. of tobacco in it, value about 6s.—6 lbs. of bacon, and some cheese, had been moved from one part of the shop to the other, nearer the door—they had taken a square of glass out of the fanlight, and the space was large enough for any<lb></lb>body to get in, and then by pressing a finger on the lock, they could get in at the door—I found the prisoner at the station—some tobacco similar to mine was shown to me—I know the prisoner—he was lodging in one of my houses—he appeared at the station to have been drinking—that was between 5 and 6, or half an hour afterwards—he had very likely been drinking over night.</p>

I am a boiler-maker, of 6, Mill-street, Deptford—at about half-past 4 o'clock on this morning, I was standing at my door, which is about thirty yards from Mr. Wood's house, and saw a young man pick up a pair of boots outside the shop, and hold them up—the shop-door was two or three inches open—I rapped at the shutters, and the prisoner opened the door—he had no boots on—he asked me what I wanted—I said, "Some tobacco"—he said that he had plenty of tobacco, showed me a bundle of it in his handkerchief, and offered me some—he then claimed the boots, and put them on—he appeared to have been drinking—Mr. Wood was called up, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

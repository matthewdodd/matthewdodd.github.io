             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am keeper of the New Gaol, in Southwark; I was at the Croydon Assizes in July last; the prisoner was tried there; I have the certificate of his conviction, (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. Was he tried by the same name that he is now tried by? - A. Yes; Thomas Atwell</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get that certificate? - A. From Mr. Knapp, clerk of the assize; I saw Mr. Knapp sign it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. This is a copy of it, I take it? - A. No; it is the original, (it is read).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you this man in custody before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that this is the same Thomas Atwell that was tried for stealing that trunk? - A. Yes; I have known him some years.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is the same man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had him in custody before his trial? - A. No; I took him in custody the 8th of August; I was present when he was tried at Croydon, and I am certain he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know what became of him afterwards? - A. I took him on the 29th of December; I went down to Reading, in Berkshire, in consequence of an information I received; I found him at the barracks at Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Q.Not in any custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You found him at the barracks? - A. Yes; I found him there as a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. He had enlisted, had not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a conditional pardon? - A. He had, I took it back to the Duke of Portland's office; I never broke the seal.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You understood he had enlisted? - A. In the Duke of York's regiment of foot guards; he was to go to join Colonel Maitland's regiment, to go to the West Indies.</p>
               <p> - HILTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to the keeper of the county gaol of Surrey: On the 9th of December, I was ordered,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170060"></xptr>by the gate keeper, and the keeper that is at present, to conduct the prisoner at the bar to Portsmouth, with a letter received from the War office directed to Lieutenant-Colonel Maitland, &amp;c. &amp;c. Portsmouth; that letter I delivered to the keeper, when I came back.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Alport). Q. Have you that letter? - A. No; I carried it to the office as I was ordered.</p>
               <p>Halton. I went with him to the Spread-Eagle, Gracechurch-street, and conducted him to Portsmouth; when I came there. I enquired for Colonel Maitland; I could get no intelligence of him; I applied to the Governor, and was informed, that the fleet had sailed, and he was gone with the fleet to the West-Indies. I was then directed to the Transport office, I found I could get no conveyance to deliver him; I then took a place for myself and him, to bring him back to London. I walked about with the prisoner, I had no place to lodge him in, he had no irons on, till about five o'clock; when he made an excuse that he wanted to go to the privy; the privy was in a small yard along-side the dwelling where we were, and I followed him at a little distance; and the door that let out into the yard was a door that opened towards me, in a narrow passage, he turned the door before me, and I walked gently after him, and when I turned the door I missed him; I thought he was gone to the privy, I looked there and found he had made his escape. I then proceeded round Portsmouth to discover him, but I could not hear any thing at all of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. I believe the first tidings you heard of him was, that he was in the barracks at Knightsbridge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Through what channel was it that you received information of him? - A. I had received information that he had enlisted as a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know of any letter he had written to the Duke of Portland, specifying that he had enlisted in the Duke of York's regiment? - A. I did not see the letter, I heard that there was one.</p>
               <p>Court. In strictness of law I cannot ask the Jury to trisle with their oaths; this man is guilty of being at large; but when I find that that man immediately after enlisted, I shall direct the Jury to find him guilty; and offer my recommendation to his Majesty, that he may be sent to the West-Indies now; the fleet had failed, and he could not join it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesmonger, and live in Well-street, in the parish of St. John, at Hackney. On Monday, the 28th of December, I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—I was the last person up—I fastened all doors, and the windows also—I got up the next morning, about half-past seven o'clock, or a little later—it was then hardly light—I have two warehouses under the same roof as the dwelling-house—there are three doors from the warehouse to the garden—there is one door into the shop, and from the shop you go into the dwelling-house—all the three doors were fastened when I went to bed—I</p>

               <p>left in the back warehouse that night, a turkey, a box of raisins, and 4lbs. of plum-cake—as soon as I opened the middle door in the morning, directly I was up, I missed them—the three doors were all safe—no door was meddled with at all—I found a little recess open which let the stream out from a copper which I had there—it was a little door, which had been fastened the night before, about nine inches wide, and fourteen inches long—the articles were several feet from the recess—the prisoner lives a little way from me—he came in for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco, about half-past nine o'clock the night before—he had been a customer of mine for two or three years—I made my loss known to the police, and saw the turkey at Mr. Thornhill's, who lives very near me, at about eleven o'clock on the 29th of December—I knew it was mine, by the tie of the string—I had tied it up myself—it had come a good way out of the country—I weighed it before I lost it, and weighed 12lbs.—it weighed the same when I found it—examined the crop, and it was full, and so was the crop of the one I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hackney. I have known the prisoner three or four years—I saw him on the 29th of December, be<lb></lb>tween eleven and twelve o'clock, in Mr. Bradshaw's field, leading from Retreat-place to Mead's-place, Hackney—he had a turkey with him—he offered it to me for sale in the field, and said he had it from the country—I said if he would come home with me I would try if I could buy it of him—he did so, and showed it me at home—he asked 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said I would give him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and let him off 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he owned me—I paid him the money, and soon afterwards he said he had some raisins to dispose of—I told him I did not do business in that way, and he left my house—I then went to my neighbours, and found the robbery out—I went to the prosecutor, and he saw the turkey while I was absent.</p>

The recess goes out into my back gar<lb></lb>den—I went into the garden, after finding it open, and saw the piece of the door lying down—I could not observe any foot-marks in the garden, for it is nearly all brick—nor in my warehouse, as it is strewed with straw—I cannot tell whether the hole is large enough for the prisoner to get through—a person could not have reached them for the outside—besides, a box was removed off a basket—the prisoner had never been in the warehouse, to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with two other gentlemen as stationers and booksellers, in Ave Maria-lane; we carry on business under the old firm of Whittaker and Co., and occupy 13, 14, 15, and 16, Stationers'-court; 13, 14, and 15, are warehouses, and are in the parish of St Martin Ludgate. The prisoner has been in tour service, I believe, about fifteen years; his wages at first were one guinea a week, and latterly 235. a week, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the duties of locking up—it was his duty to be last on the premises at night and first in the morning, he had the keys for that purpose—he had no authority whatever to be on the premises</p>

               <p>on Sunday—I had not forbid it, but there was no necessity for it—there was no necessity for his being there on Sunday 31st Oct.—my dwelling house is in Gloucester-terrace, Hyde-park—on Sunday night 31st Oct, about 10 o'clock, the prisoner came to my house, and stated that the warehouse in Ave-Maria-lane had been broken open, and a considerable quantity of pro<lb></lb>perty was gone, and bills and half bank-notes were strewed about, which he had picked up as well as he could—he said, without being asked, that he was on his way to church about 6 o'clock, and found the door of the warehouse open; he also stated that being fatigued with magazine work the night before, he had not been from home till church-time that eeening—he was excessively nerv<lb></lb>ous at the time—he produced this seal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), stating that I should know what that was—it is a crest seal, and had been in my private drawer on the Saturday evening when I left—he requested me to return to Ave-Maria-lane—I did so; on coming to Stationers'-court the prisoner unlocked the door of No. 13, of which a policeman was in' charge—there is no other outside access to the warehouses when they are properly closed for the night, ex<lb></lb>cept at 13—there was no keyhole or latchhole to 14 and 15—they are closed by bars and bolts inside, and 16 has no door at all; that you can only get to from within; but it is a distinct house—if it had a door it is many years ago—the prisoner got a light at my orders, there was nobody in the warehouse—the prisoner said that he considered the thieves could only have been out very shortly when he first found it, and he wished he had been a few minutes earlier as he might have <hi rend="italic">tackled</hi> them—he said, at my house, it must have been done by some country bands, not London ones, as it was very bung<lb></lb>lingly done—he got the light at the entrance; there was a candle and lucifers there; that was not the place where they were usually left—we then went to the second house, No. 15, where I found the safe open, the bolts of the lock shot as if it had been locked; it did not appear to have been forced in the least, both doors were wide open—there was not the slightest appearance of vio<lb></lb>lence, so much so that I remarked, "This must have been done by some person in the house;" by which I meant somebody that bad a key—I always kept the key of that safe; I left it on the Saturday night in a private cem<lb></lb>partment in the drawer of a private desk which pulled out; it was locked with a Bramah lock, and on drawing it out there was a compartment of three or four inches which lifted up, and underneath it the key bad been kept for many years; it was a secret drawer, it had been forced open and was taken on to the stairs some distance from the counting house; my Bramah key was in my pocket—when the drawer was taken up, and the little compartment lifted up, the key was gone, and I believe was lying on the table on the outside—I did not find it, the prisoner found it—I believe I saw him find it, but I cannot say as to that, because there was so much confusion; but he cer<lb></lb>tainly brought it to me—I cannot speak positively to my seeing it on the table, but the prisoner brought it to me and said, "This was on the desk."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Those are two very different propositions, his finding it in your presence, and his bringing it to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I was so confused at the moment that I cannot say positively—the contents of the safe were all gone, with the exception of the bills; a box of silver-gilt plate was gone, consisting of spoons, forks, and knives; I do not know the exact quantity, they had a crest on them, not the same as was on the seal, but a griffin's head erect—the box was about a foot square—it was a large safe with double doors—I also missed six halves of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes besides, consisting of a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, I think, but I cannot be positive—I know they were there at 1 o'clock on the Saturday but I did not see them afterwards; that</p>

               <p>was all that was taken out of my safe; it was all very portable, with the exce tion of the box of plate; other things were thrown about—I locked the safe on Saturday, somewhere about 4, and placed the key in the usual place—when the drawer is taken out of the private desk that would not expose the secret part, unless some violence were used to the drawer—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here pointed out the position of the secret part, on the drawer of his Lordship's desk</hi>)—the cover of the secret part was not actually fixed, but unless it was pulled out violently it would not expose the key; it would fall out if you turned the drawer upside down, but the papers in the drawer did not appear to have been taken out—the cover of the secret place was taken out and left exposed, it was thrown to the back part of the drawer; the cover lifted entirely out; it was a sort of box which fitted in; you could lay hold of the box and lift it up; anybody who was feeling about could see it was a box; they might have acci<lb></lb>dentally found the key—that key would open the safe if they knew where it applied to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe anything more about what you call your safe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All the drawers were open, but as far as I could see nothing was taken from them—they were only papers, of no use to anybody but myself—some leases were strewed about—there was the lease of my own house, the fire insurance policy of it, and several securities given by the different clerks in our establishment on entering the place, which were of no use to thieves—I went up into the room where the prisoner said the entry had been made—I think he first made that observation at my house—he said the entry had been made where the entry had been attempted before; that was not true—the room he referred to was on the first floor of No. 16 house—no entry had been attempted at that window, but at another window close by, a skylight—when I got into the first floor he showed me the window through which he supposed the entry to have been effected—the window and shutters were open, but not broken—the window looked on to a skylight and a flat of leads, which is protected by a <hi rend="italic">chevaux de frise</hi> all round—the window itself I believe had not been fastened, but the shutters had been barred within—the bars were drawn, but there were no marks of violence on the shutters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there a skylight in the leads? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Adjoining the leads; it lights another counting house below—the <hi rend="italic">chevaux de frise</hi> goes each side of a square, and the skylight is farther away, where there is no use for a <hi rend="italic">chevaux de frise</hi>—when you get out of the window the leads are immediately underneath, but the skylight comes nearly close under the window—it is a flat of leads, twelve or fourteen feet from the window—the skylight is not flat; it comes close under the window from which the entry was said to be made—there are two or three feet between the window and skylight when you get out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it is an inclined plane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the skylight runs narrow from the window—my attention was called to the skylight by the prisoner—he stated that a pane of glass had been taken out of it, which was the fact, but it was impossible for anybody to get through the pane of glass—anybody could get to the skylight from the leads, but they would have to tumble down about twelve feet—an entry had been effected through that skylight about twelve years ago, but the pane of glass taken out on this occasion was such a small one, and we have had an iron bar put under the window—I do not recollect that the prisoner said anything on the subject of any person coming in—when he pointed out the pane of glass to me it was not broken; it had been cut out—it was too small to admit the entrance or</p>

               <p>exit of any person; it was impossible for a boy to get in there—the sergeant of police was with me, and the man was underneath—we next went up to my private counting house, which is on the first floor of No. 13—that is where my desk was where I kept the key of the safe—the prisoner knew that I kept it there—there were five safes in the house, but only mine had been opened—I observed a large bunch of rusty old keys lying on a corner of my table, and pointed them out to the sergeant of police—they belonged to the old locks, and had formerly been used in the warehouse—they had been kept in the desk of our foreman, Smith, in No. 15 house—they were keys which the prisoner knew; he had been in the habit of working near that desk for some years—we had a gentleman in our service named John Forster—he had a safe in his charge on the ground floor of No. 16 house, close against the entrance—he had the keys of it; they were in duplicate—I found the duplicate key of Forster's safe in No. 15 house, exactly opposite my large safe—I did not look at Forster's safe on Sunday night; I saw it on; the Monday, and the pins of the lock in three places had evidently been broken—I do not mean the interior of the lock, but the outside pins—they are large box locks, and there is a pin at the four corners, in the same places as you put screws to a lock—that lock bad been attempted at the pins, according to my belief—I tried the key of that lock, and found it would not open the safe—there was a piece of biscuit or some hard substance in the tube which pre<lb></lb>vented it going home—the safe was unlocked on that Monday, and it had not been disturbed—there were many valuables in that safe—there was a safe also in charge of the prisoner that contained a ledger and books—it was in No. 16 house—I examined it on Monday—it had not been attempted, or in any way disturbed—there were valuables in that safe which no one knew anything of, except the partners—there is a well in it which nobody knew anything about but ourselves—the prisoner had no access to the well; it was closed with a strong lock and covered over, so that nobody would know that there was a well there—No. 15 warehouse door, the prisoner said he found open—that door has no keyhole outside whatever—it is secured by inside bolts and bars, and a padlock inside to the door, which was taken off, and the bar was removed and the bolts drawn—the padlock was found by Smith the warehouseman next morning, in a drawer close by, away from the door altogether—it was not damaged, but was unlocked, and was away from the hasp, which was not broken—I was not present when it was found—the door was just as if there had been no padlock, except that the key was in the prisoner's possession, and it was his duty to lock it—there was no access from without, at the door of No. 15, after it was fastened of a night, but in the day<lb></lb>time, when we were carrying on business, there was a latch with a handle through the door, which governed the latch, by which it might be opened from outside, and on business days it was left unfastened, for persons to come in; they could turn the latch and walk in or walk out—the prisoner left of a night through No. 13, and locked the door after him; that was the only way by which he could leave all secure—a bar went across the door of No. 15; the door fastens in with an iron catch on each side—the staple and padlock were perhaps a foot or a foot and a half above the bar—the staple was fastened to the jamb of the door—you put the hasp over the staple, and then put the padlock in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220078"></xptr>
               <p>the bar being shut across, it would be quite secure from without, without the padlock—something was in the barrel of the key, kept by Forster, which pre<lb></lb>vented it acting—it acts now—a pen, or something, got it out—I am not aware that I had seen those old keys before, but the prisoner was constantly in the habit of working where they where kept—they were apparently put there as a <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>—the desk, which I call my private desk, I was in the habit of using myself—I saw the key in the drawer, every day—I saw it when I left, on Saturday night—when the drawer was pulled out to the full extent a person might see that there was something there—they must see that the drawer was not solid at that part, if they took it out—the skylight could not be entered by taking out that pane of glass; if they took it out they would find the impediment of the bar, which we have placed there—if the next pane had been taken out anybody could have got in—the bar was pretty plainly to be seen—if anybody was seeking to make an appearance of that sort, they might or might not take out that pane of glass—the leads are fourteen or fifteen feet from the ground, they form one side of the court—the window itself has, I believe, no fastening—the shutter is fastened with one of those bars which you see in a drawing room, a cross with a pin in the centre, with screws, which had been wrenched out; they had been there many years—they were not very strong—I cannot say whether that might have been done from outside—this 30th Oct. was what we call magazine night; our business is greater on that than on another night; so much that we are obliged to take on additional hands; but not for that night only, but for two or three nights previous, ending on that night—magazine Saturday is only once a month.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I know the prisoner—on Sunday night, 31st Oct., he came over to our place at a little after 6 o'clock, and asked if one of the young men might come over to their place, for it had been broken open—I went, and the prisoner opened the door of No. 15 by the handle—when we were just on the threshold of the door, I said, "We had better have a constable"—he only said, "Very well"—I came away, and he came after me, shutting the door—he remained out<lb></lb>side the door of No. 15, and I went for a policeman into Ludgate-street, when I met my fellow-servant (Ann) with a policeman (Kent)—she had not heard what the prisoner had said to me; it was in consequence of something the barman said—I returned to Stationers'-court, and found the prisoner where I</p>

               <p>had left him—I, the prisoner, and the constable went in by No. 15 door—the prisoner said he would get a light—he went to the other side of the warehouse, and got feeling about there, about fifteen or twenty yards from the door; he could not get a light—it was the prisoner who suggested that there should be a light—he said he could not find any lucifers—I did not afterwards see where they were—the prisoner went over to our place to get some—the policeman said, "Make haste, and let us have a light"—then he came over to the Daniel Lambert, and we got a light and lit a candle—he came to where the policeman was, and we three together barred the door of No. 15 again; the bar had been taken from the door—we found an iron chest open—I think it was in the second division of No. 15—there was a cash box on the table; it was broken open—I went for the sergeant, and did not return—when the prisoner came he only asked me to go over the way with him—he said he found the door of No. 15 open, as he was going to church—when I and the policeman went with the prisoner to the premises, he said, "It is no use looking for the thieves, for this is the way they have got out"—that was the door of No. 15—before he had got any light he seemed very agitated—he kept running about the warehouse to get the light—before he got the light he said every blessed place had been broken open—I am quite sure there was no light then.</p>

               <p>and told me it should also be fastened with a padlock, and that he him self fastened it at 10 o'clock on the previous night—I asked him why he came there; he said he came there every Sunday since he had had the situation, except one Sunday—I asked him how long he had had that situation; he said three months—I asked him if he always came at that time on the Sunday; he said, that would be just as it happened, he sometimes came at one part of the day and sometimes at another part—I asked him if he brought the keys with him on a Sunday—he said, "Sometimes I do"—I said, "Have you got them now?" he said, "No, I have not"—we then went on down the warehouse; he took us first to a safe, that was open—I do not know whether it was broken open—I think it had a double door, the lock was shot, but the safe was open—I looked at it, and said to him, "Oh, this is not broken open"—there was a cash box lying on the table, broken; the prisoner said the thieves must have got in where the attempt was made before—he told me it was on the first floor, the back window—we went upstairs to the window, and found the shutters open, and the bar down—the prisoner was walking in front of me; he closed the shutters, put the bar up, and said that was how it was fastened—I took the bar down, and found the window was shut, but not fastened—I am not positive whether there was a fastening to it or not, but I slipped it up without touching any fastening—we could see no footmarks outside, it was dark—I observed a skylight of glass underneath the window—I could see that a smallsized pane of glass had been either broken out or taken out of it; neither a man nor a boy could have got through it—we went nearly all over the premises into a variety of rooms, where the desks were broken open—we found a large key lying on a table, I think on the first floor—I cannot say of which house—I was never there before or since, but it was opposite an iron safe (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Hood here stated that there was no safe there, but that it was on the ground floor</hi>)—this was on the first floor—we left it there, I did not try it to anything—the prisoner told me he rather hoped there was no property gone, as his governors sent to the Bank every day—in another room we found three bundles of keys, some of them were rusty; that was on the first floor, not in the same house—when we came to the iron safe, the doors of which were open, I told him I did not believe it had been broken open, and asked him if he did not think it had been left open—he said he was sure it had not been left open (we had not found the key then)—I afterwards examined the safe; there had been no violence done to it whatever—I did not leave the prisoner from the time I went to the house, till my brother officers came—the prisoner found nothing while I was there that he named, and I did not see him pick up anything—when the keys which were partly rusty were found in the room, and the other loose on the first floor, the prisoner said, "These are the keys the burglars must have left;" or, "the thieves must have left"—we had got a candle at that time, and could see that some of them were rusty and some not—I told him that the keys were not such as burglars would use, that they were not picklock keys or skeleton keys, and asked him if he did not know the keys; he said he did not—I said, "Do not you know whether they are your governors' keys?"—he said, "No, it is impos<lb></lb>sible for me to know all my governors' keys"—I went away about 7, and did not return any more—I left my Inspector, Mr. McLean there, and sergeant Roberts with him, and the prisoner.</p>

               <p>quarter past 7 o'clock, on this Sunday evening, and found the prisoner there—the premises had already been surveyed by the officer; still I went round with the prisoner, and observed perhaps twenty desks and drawers had been broken open, I should think not less than twenty, and the papers had been scattered about—the prisoner pointed out a window on the first floor which led to some leads, and said the fastenings were very insecure; that the window would push down—I hurried over the premises, thinking all had been surveyed before—I observed in Mr. Hood's counting-house a quantity of keys, perhaps thirty—the prisoner seemed in a great hurry, and had been searching over the premises before, I understand—I asked him if he knew those old keys—he said he did not—I think he said, "They are what the burglars," or he might have said, "thieves, have left;" I am sure he said either "burglars" or "thieves"—I made answer, "They are not such keys as burglars would carry"—I looked over them, and there was not such a key as burglars would carry—they were a bunch of old worn-out keys—I did not ask him any other question about them, for he was in a great hurry to go—he said he did not know them—he left me, to go to his master's, I should think near 8 o'clock; I should not think it was past 8—I do not know how far it is from Stationers-court to Gloucester-terrace; that is out of my jurisdiction—our division is in Fleet-street—that is perhaps three miles from Hyde-park.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 357). On Monday morning, 1st Nov., I was called to the house of the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner—he showed me various desks which had been broken open, and also a window, where he said the thieves must have got in—he showed me, by placing up a bar, how easy it was for any one to get in—that was a window on the first floor of the furthest house, the house nearest Ludgate-street—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Hood explained this to be the house</hi> No. 16)—I noticed the window—I saw no marks outside—there was a skylight outside, where a square of glass had been taken out; but it was moveable, such as would open and shut for air—it was taken quite off—it was such a square of glass as anybody could have got through if the iron bar had not been there, but it crossed directly in the middle of the square—if it had not been there, I should think a man could get through and drop down, though not with the bar, but, by taking out the next square, he could get through there without breaking other squares, unless he was a very stout man—as you stand on the leads on which the skylight is, you can reach the window—there were marks on the leads, so that I could see somebody had been there to take out the square of glass—some person had been there for some purpose; but neither man nor boy could have got through that square, by reason of the iron bar which ran across it; and on looking at the window where the entry was supposed to have been effected, it was perfectly sound, and had no appearance of anybody getting through from without, if the shut<lb></lb>ters were fastened; neither did it appear that anybody could get access there, for it did not appear weak—I examined the premises thoroughly—I was present at the station-house, about 10 o'clock on Monday morning, when a gentleman, named Hughes, recognized the prisoner, who was then called into a private room, and I asked him at what time he shut the premises up on Saturday night—he said, "About 10 o'clock"—I asked him, "When did</p>

I have charge of an iron safe, which stands on the ground floor—it has two keys, they are both intrusted to me; one I took home with me every night, and the other was left in the shop, in a recess in one of the desks—it is a half circular desk, with two or three drawers at the back of it, and the key was kept in a place behind the drawers—there is a little recess, a very small space, in which this key was kept, so that no person might know it—nobody could know that the key was there without pulling out the drawer, it is a very dark place—if anybody pulled out the drawer and looked, they might see the key, but not unless the drawer was pulled entirely out—I had been in the habit of using that key for some years; but one morning, finding something prevented my opening the iron safe with it, it was put away in the secret place, and I took the other key which was a new one, and have kept it ever since—the prisoner ought not to have known that I kept it there, and I have no reason to know that he did know it—it was only known to one other servant that that key would not open the safe; not generally.</p>

Q.</hi> How were you walking on the Sunday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was walking before my brother—the prisoner made way to let my brother pass—I looked back after I had passed, because I was just going to speak to my brother about him—I was then about two yards from the door, not on a level with the door, but nearer church—it was not to make room for me on the pavement that the prisoner moved back, but to make room for my brother, and my sister who was there—when I first passed the door the prisoner was in the street holding the handle, with his foot on the step—I did not notice what he was doing, his face was turned towards the street—he had hold of the door by the handle, holding it still—I did not notice whether he appeared to be coming out—I did not point him out at once when I saw him next day, because I was not walking with Mr. Hood, I was walking behind him.</p>

On Sunday morning, 31st Oct., I got up about 8 o'clock—I occupy the lower part of the house entirely, and part of the first floor—the prisoner and his wife have resided there for the last ten years and a half—they occupied the second floor—I and my mother hare kept the house thirty-four years—the parlour door, which is at the foot of the stairs, abuts on where I sit—I should see any person going out—it was open during the whole of that morning, and whoever came down the stairs I must see or hear them—I first left the house that day about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner first left the house at a little before 1 o'clock, to fetch his dinner beer—I cannot say I saw him go out, but I heard him pass.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at 27, Long-lane, Smith-field, in the same house as the prisoner. I remember Sunday, 31st Oct.—I got up at half-past 7 o'clock in the morning, and was at home all day till 7 in the evening—a little after I got up I heard a bell ring—I went down my own stairs on to the landing by Mr. Cooper's door—it was then a little after 2—my room is on the floor above the prisoner's, and I can hear people walking and talking in his room—from the time I got up till 25 minutes past 1, to the best of my belief, he never went out of the street-door—he went out to fetch the beer, and then he returned before half-past 1.</p>

death—he was at home, ill in bed, and had not been out of the house a whole week, and scarcely out of bed, only to have it made—he is a copper-plate printer, at Mr. Dixon's, of Dyer's-buildings, Holborn—he is an out-door apprentice—I do not know how far it is from Stationers'-court to Long-lane.

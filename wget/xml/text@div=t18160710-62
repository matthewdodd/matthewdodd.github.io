            . I am the wife Patrick Manning. I remember the Saturday night in question. This child was walking with me on one side, and another was walking with me on the other. There were three aprons, two handkerchiefs and a quilt. The prisoner came up to me, pitying me having two children. Then she went round and snatched the bundle away. I followed her, but did not catch her that night. I am sure she was the woman. Some of the neighbours told me to go for an officer, which I did.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called the following witness.</p>

               <p>MRS. MALEY. On the 7th of June, I lived in Grasshopper-court. Her general character was honest and just as far as I know. She occupied a room jointly with me, and she slept with me. On Saturday night the 8th of June, I went to bed at ten o'clock, and she came into bed at half past ten o'clock, and she cever went out of the room until the Sabbath day, when she went to Church.</p>

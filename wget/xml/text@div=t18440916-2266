                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Mullett, who keeps the Queen's Head public-house, in Cambridge-road. On the evening of the 27th Aug., about half-past five o'clock, or a quarter to six, I saw the prisoner go past my bar going out—she was carryiug this carpet in her arms, which belongs to me—I was at the bar alone—I gave information to my husband, and he went after her—I went to Mr. Reynolds', the pawnbroker, and saw the carpet there—it had been in an up-stairs room at my house—this is the carpet—it had not been rolled up as it is now before she had it, but this is the way it was when she was going out with it—I had seen her in my house before.</p>

I was called by Mr. Mullett, and went with him after the prisoner—I found her in a beer shop in Cambridge-road—we charged her with stealing the carpet—she said she would tell the truth when she got to the station, and in going along she said she had pledged the carpet, but it was not her that stole it, it was given to her—I had cautioned her that what she said would be given in evidence—when I took her to the Court she said the pot-boy had given it to her, and she pointed out the person who she said gave it her.</p>

On the 22d of September, between nine and ten in the morning, I was alarmed by a person ringing at the bell of my garden-gate, and was told that my house, or garden, had been robbed. I found a print of dirty feet, and the window was open: from thence, I concluded some person had been in that room, and that I had been robbed. I looked out, and saw four people upon the road. I immediately went in pursuit of them. When I got into the road, I saw but three: there were four at first, and then the other three separated. I soon came up with one of them, and with the assistance of a man I called to, I laid hold of him, and asked him, Where his comrades were gone? He said, he had none. After having secured this man, I went into the fields after the others. There was a heavy dew upon the grass, in consequence of which, the track of persons crossing the field, was extremely visible. I followed the track, I suppose, for a mile and a half, towards Hampstead. There I had intelligence from another person, that a bundle had been seen lying in the track. There was a man in the field, one Palmer, a chimney-sweeper. Supposing he might have picked it up, I sent Jones to him, and Jones found a bundle upon him, containing a coat and waistcoat of mine, which had been taken out of that room where I had seen the print of dirty feet. When I went home, I found the two prisoners in custody.</p>

               <p>About nine in the morning, in a field thirty-seven yards (for I measured it) from Mr. Alderton's house, I saw a man in a black coat, get into a parlour window of Mr. Alderton's house, and come out again with a bundle; and another man in a blue coat, a man in a red coat, (which was Coleman), a man in a green coat, (Smith): there were two in the garden, and one in the ditch. After the man in black came out of the parlour, that man went across the fields on the left-hand side of the road, which is the side next Hampstead. Coleman went down the road, and Smith went up the fields on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170028"></xptr> right-hand side of the way. Where the man in blue went, I cannot take upon me to say, I am sure they are the same people, but I did not take notice of their faces; I only knew them again by their dress. I observed the man in black gave the bundle to Smith.</p>

               <p>I was upon the road, and assisted Mr. Alderton to secure Coleman. I was working at a dunghill of Mr. Alderton's, at Kilburn, a quarter of a mile from his house. That morning, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner, and two more young men, in company, towards Kilburn. I saw them in half an hour returning towards my master's house. In about half an hour after, the alarm was given, my master came running down the road, and a man was in the field pursuing. My master bid me stop that man in red: that was Coleman. I secured him. After Coleman was thus secured, I went into the fields, with my master, in pursuit of the others. By my master's direction, I went to one Palmer, a chimney-sweeper, who was mushrooming: upon him I found a bundle, containing a coat and waistcoat of my master's.</p>
               <p>( Palmer, the chimney-sweeper, produced the bundle, which he deposed he found under an oak tree, in the fields.)</p>

               <p>I pursued over the fields, above a mile towards Hampstead. I saw two men running very fast; one in green, the other in a dark coloured coat: he ran towards a hedge, and went over a gap. I came up to the same place, and went over. As soon as I got over, on the right-hand side, near the gap, within three or four yards, I saw a bundle. The two men separated: one went into a turnip-field, the other I supposed went on the other side the hedge. I was running on the other side. I could not get over to the turnip field. I turned back, and saw the man in green, (Smith) coming up the side of the hedge. I secured him: he was sweating. He appeared to have been running hard. I have no doubt he is the same man, I saw before in company with the other man. He denied he had been running, and denied he had any company. I mentioned to the prosecutor, that I had seen a bundle at that gap. He sent Jones to a chimney-sweeper, and found the bundle upon him; and when the bundle was found, the prosecutor and I were standing near the gap, where we saw the bundle first.</p>

               <p>I was coming a-cross the fields. The prosecutor accosted me. He asked, which way I was going? I said, to Paddington, to see my sister. He said, Was you not running a-cross the fields just now? I said, No. He said he thought I was, but I must go back with him. I said, I was very willing to go with him. Immediately he called a man or two to his assistance, that were catching birds. I made no resistance, but went quietly to the house, and there nobody knew any thing of me, till I went to the justice's.</p>

               <p>I had been ill, and was going down the road. This gentleman came by, and said, Young man, come and hold my horse, till I get over the ditch. I went down to the ditch. He said some thieves had been robbing a house. I got up upon the road again. I had not got two hundred yards upon the road, before a gentleman came riding down, and said, Young man, stop. I said, For what? He said, Some people have been robbed, and I suspect you are one. I stopped. A gentleman came up, and then the prosecutor came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170029"></xptr> up, and called to the boy, Did you see him? He said, yes; he saw me go down the road after the men. I came back, and was taken to the prosecutor's house; was carried to Paddington; then taken before a justice, and committed. The boy said he did not know any body: then he said afterwards, we were two of them.</p>

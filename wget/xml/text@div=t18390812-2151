                  </hi>. I am the wife of Barnard Garlagh, a skin-dresser, and live in Old Castle-street, Whitechapel. On the 15th of July, about nine or ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner Boyce in our yard—he said he wanted to go into the water-closet—I said he might—he did not go, but went out—I did not see the other prisoner—I had a gown hanging in the parlour, which was safe at that time—my little girl was in the room—I left the door open, and went to hang some things in the yard—my little girl hallooed out there was a strange man—I went and missed my gown, ran out, and came up with Boyce in Castle-alley—I said he knew something about my gown—he said, "No"—I have never seen it since.</p>

I live with my father and mother in Mrs. Garlagh's house—on the day the gown was lost, I was before the door of the house, and saw three persons go to the door—Boyce, and one who is not here, went into the house—White staid at the door, and told the children to move out of the way—there was a Jew there—White asked for a light—he was close to the door at that time—Boyce and the other man did not stop long in the house—I saw them come out again—the other one came out first, with Mrs. Garlagh's gown—I knew it by living in the house—Boyce came out soon after—they ran away, and White followed—I am quite sure of the prisoners.</p>

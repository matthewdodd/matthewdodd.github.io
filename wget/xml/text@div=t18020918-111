               <p>Q. In whose house? - A. Mrs. Mackenzie's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of Mrs. Mackenzie? - A.Maria.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a married woman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she live in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 5th of August, where did you see the prisoner? - A. I was standing in the kitchen; between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come down the area steps, he was dressed like a butcher; I observed him coming down, and not seeing him come forward into the kitchen, I went out, knowing the pantry-door was not locked, and met him coming out of the pantry; I asked him what brought him there; he said he was looking after Lady Walker's housekeeper, and he thought that was her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Lady Walker lodge in the same house? - A. No, nor ever did; I put my hand upon his breast to stop him; he stepped back, and I pulled the pantry door to, and locked it, it was a halfwire door, and I saw him put his hand into his apron-pocket, and take out some spoons, and put them down upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose plate was this? - A.Captain Robinson had the use of it from Miss Mackenzie; it was her plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep the plate? - A. In that pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine him? - A. No, I did not; he laid it on the table.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure he took the plate out of his pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the plate have been seen from the street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the pantry did you keep it in? - A. On the shelf in the pantry; I kept him there till after five o'clock, locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who opened the door? - A. My master, or Major Roberts, I don't know which; I went in with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the plate lying when you went in? - A. Where he had put it, on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took it? - A. I took it up first in my hand, (produces the property); three table-spoons were marked with the name of the lady that kept the house before Miss Mackenzie; the other tablespoon has Miss Mackenzie's mark, and the teaspoons; the tongs have no mark; I am sure they are the same spoons that I had under my care.</p>

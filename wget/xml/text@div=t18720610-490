                  </hi>. I am a hawker, of Elizabeth Gardens, Stratford—on 3rd May, I was going along the Leytonstone Road, and saw the prisoner, and John Swallow and Watts together, standing by the side of three lumps of iron—they told me there was two and a half cwt.—they are the plates which have been given up to the Railway Company—Watts asked me if I bought old iron—I said "Yes"—he said "I have got some here, could you look at them?"—I said "No, you bring them here; I am tired"—they each brought one to my barrow—I said "This is new iron, but it is rusty; how did you come by it?"—they all three said that they had had it in their possession nine months—I bought it for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., there were twenty-six plates, and I took them away on my barrow—I paid Swallow 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Watts 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they all stood together by my barrow when I paid the money.</p>

Then the Court took abundance of pains to perswade him to a true and candid Confession, by whose instigations and incitements he attempted so mischievous a Crime: which he pretended to do, and told a long story, how a Countryman of his met him, and carryed him to drink, and afterwards appointed to meet him at a Tavern in Holborne, where he gave him four shillings, and promised him Threescore pounds (when the business was done) to Fire his Mistresses House, and also a Box-makers over against it; he likewise named a person of note, that had formerly dealt with his Mistress for Flax, and sometimes seemed to charge him as the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16790605005"></xptr>party that set him on, &amp;c. But his present Account being neither very consistent with it self, nor agreeable to his former examinations, gave reason to suspect he had been tampered with, and did not fully discover the real truths; so that after much patience and pains, the Court ordered him for the then present, to a farther Examination more private, thereby if possible to fist out the bottom of the business.</p>

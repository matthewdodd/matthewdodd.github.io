                  </hi>. I am a paper-stainer, and live at 3, Smith's Build<lb></lb>ings, Cambridge Heath—on Monday night, 2nd July, at nearly one o'clock, I was in the "London Hospital" Tavern—the prisoner was there, playing the violin—he told me he wanted to speak to me downstairs—I went downstairs with him—he left his violin at the bar with the landlady, and said, "I want to speak to you outside"—when we got outside he asked me, "When did you see Jem Manning last?" and before I could answer him he struck me in the eye—I felt something very sharp, but I could not say what it was done with—he said, "That is all I want with you"—I fell from the blow, and while I was down he kicked me several times in different parts of the body—I did not strike him at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you not run out of the public-house after him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I followed him out when he asked me to come; I swear I did not strike him—I have known him many years; he gets his living by playing the violin—I once knew him in possession of a public-house—Jem Man<lb></lb>ning is his brother-in-law—I believe he works at a tobacconist's opposite Whitechapel Church—he did keep a beer-house—I once had a house next door to the prisoner—it was not a house where men and women congre<lb></lb>gated—my wife did not walk the streets to keep me—she was a cripple all her life; she is dead; I have two children—I know a Mr. Sheridan, who was in the police—he never made any charge against me, nor did anybody else—I am living by myself now, not with any woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the London Hospital on Monday night, 2nd July, when the prosecutor came there, he had a small punctured wound on the cheek, below the eye, about a quarter of an inch across, and about an inch and a quarter deep—I probed it—I do not think it would have been caused by a blow of the fist; in my opinion it was done by some sharp-pointed instrument—a penknife would have done it—his eye was slightly blackened, and he complained of contusions about his body—he is an out-patient now.</p>

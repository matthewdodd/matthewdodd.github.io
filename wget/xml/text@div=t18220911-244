            . The prisoner was in our service, and lived in the house. On the 12th of September I charged him with stealing some skeins of silk; he denied it. I said nobody could take them but him, and if he were innocent I should be sorry to charge him with it, and he had better let me see his trunks. He said he would. I went up with my foreman; upon looking at the trunks, the first thing I found in one of them was some silk, not in skeins. I found two yards of silk and other things. He said they were mine, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you say to him at first? - A. I charged him with it, and when we went up, he sat down on the bed and begged for mercy. I said</p>
               <p>"Come, open your trunk." He has been a confidential porter in my house for five years, and had the care of every thing. I gave the silk to the officer.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutors, I know the silk to be theirs; I have seen it in their cutting room - it was cut off a piece. I have not looked to see if the remainder is there now, but I know this to be part of the same. I was in the cutting room when he was taken. I brought his box down from his room, it contained this silk. I saw it in the cutting room a week or ten days before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know this from any other silk? - A. I am confident of it - I have no particular mark on it - there is a difference in the sides of it. We have a good many workmen.</p>

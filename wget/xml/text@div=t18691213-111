                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live at 3, Lane's Court, Clerkenwell—on Saturday night, 11th December, about 12.5, I was coming down St. John Street Road; at the corner of Arlington Street, I was attacked by five or six men, they caught hold of me by the shoulders and legs, and threw me right bang on my back and held me there, some on one side and some on the other, and two of them across my legs—they put their hands into my trowsers pocket, and tore my trowsers all down—I shouted out, "Police" as loud as I could, they then let go of me from behind—the prisoner was rising from off my legs and I seized him by the throat, and held him till a gentleman and a policeman came up—I lost about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and copper, out of both my pockets.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Arlington Street—about 12 o'clock on last Saturday night, as I was going along, I heard the cry of "Police!" and when I got up to the place, I saw the prosecutor and prisoner struggling together—I caught hold of the prisoner, and held him till the policeman came up—I saw three or four men pulling the prosecutor about at the time I came up—he was excited, but I think he was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 209). I heard the cry of "Police!" and went up immediately, and saw the prisoner held by Mr. Jennings—the prosecutor complained of having been robbed and assaulted, and told me to take the prisoner into custody, which I did—he walked quietly for about forty yards, he then began to use violence, took hold of me by the thumb, and fell against my legs several times—I got the assistance of another constable, and with great difficulty got him to the station—he tried all he could to get out of my grasp—the prosecutor was sober, and so was the prisoner.</p>

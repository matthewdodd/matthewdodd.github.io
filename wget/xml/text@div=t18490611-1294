                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of Trafalgar-terrace, Kings-land-road. The prisoner was my apprentice six or seven years—he ab<lb></lb>sconded about 17th March—I missed some tools; these are four of them—they had been scattered about on one of the boards in the shop—part of them he used to work with—I met him about eight weeks afterwards, and gave him in charge, I went to his father's, and found these four articles—here is one which was given me by my father, I should say I have had it twenty years—all these have been in my possession for years, except this one—the prisoner said he had taken away none but what he had made himself—I accused him of getting in at the shop-window—he said he had gone in for a pair of old boots.</p>

            . I missed my coat on the 24th of August; I went to where the prisoner lodged and enquired for her; they said she had not been at home eight days, that gave me suspicion. The prisoner worked for me; the prisoner gave me the ticket; the officer has it.</p>
               <p>Mr. TURNER. I live in John street, Golden square. On the 24th of August the prisoner pledged a coat between five and six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor engaged me to work for him, and I was to learn him the flower business, for which he promised me two pounds. In the latter end of July I had not above two days work in a week; I asked him for the two guineas which he was to give me for learning him; he said he had no money, but he would give me something to pledge; he gave me the coat out of the drawer: I went and pledged it at that gentleman's shop for one pound fifteen shillings. I gave the ticket into Mr. de Frenne's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor Was the prisoner to teach you the business of flower making - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her the coat to pawn or sell - A. No; she delivered me the duplicate when I went to apprehend her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Hall, of 16, Davies Street—five weeks ago to-morrow I was at the corner of Prince's Street between eight and nine at night—the prisoner came up and offered to take me away with her—I went a little way, and she struck me across the face, and tripped me up very violently—I was knocked down on the kerb—I was sober enough to know what I was doing, but I had had a little drink—she robbed me of a florin and a half-crown while I was on the ground—I called out, "Annie, this woman has robbed me"—she ran away, and a policeman took her with the money in her hand.</p>

Q.</hi> What had you been doing that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was at home and got my husband's dinner—it was after two o'clock—I never was at Hendon—I did not know that Hendon races were on—I do not deny being at Hendon races—I believe that is the "Welsh Harp" races—I took a cab there—I do not know that the "Welsh Harp" is at Hendon—I did not see the races, I never got out of the cab—I did not have a little refreshment inside the cab, but prior to my leaving home I changed a sovereign, and while I changed it my friend got a drop of brandy—I was not intoxicated—I took some brandy again during the afternoon, I had it inside the cab, it was fetched by the cabman—brandy was only fetched to me once inside the cab—I had no whisky—I remained at the "Welsh Harp" till about eight, and left in sufficient time to be at the corner of Prince's Street, Maida Hill, at half-past eight—I did not stop once from the "Welsh Harp" to Prince's Street—I have not heard of the "Portman Arms"—I never went in there, nor was I so intoxicated that they refused to serve me—I distinctly remember everything that took place—I will not swear whether the friend who went with me was intoxicated—the prisoner came up and spoke to me, and I said, "Will you be kind enough to show me a place of convenience?" supposing she would take me to a place of her own.</p>

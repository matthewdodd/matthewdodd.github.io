On the 17th of March, after twelve o'clock in the day, I went out, double locked my door, and put the key into my pocket. I only occupy one room - I left nobody in the room. I returned between seven and eight o'clock, and saw a light through the key-hole, found the door open, and the prisoner's brother (James) sitting in a chair, reading a book; he lived next door, and is about fourteen years old. I looked round, and saw the keys in my bottom drawer, which I had left in the looking-glass drawer. I missed this property from the bottom drawer. Her brother went out. I fetched my husband, and we went to Duck-lane that night, and found the prisoner in Donshoe's lodging; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070006"></xptr>asked what I wanted - I said I had been robbed, and as she was in the habit of coming to my place, I suspected her - she said she knew nothing of it. She came home with me, and was very abusive. I found my shawl on her back, and gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What was the shawl worth - A. Tenpence. I have lent it to her several times, three or four times a-week. I said if she would tell me where the things were I would not hurt her - she still denied it.</p>

On the 17th of March, I went out about two o'clock; Broad's door seemed fastened then - I returned about four, and saw the prisoner's brother go up stairs to Broad's door; he found it open - he came down, and went out. I went to the prisoner next door, and asked if she knew where Mrs. Broad was gone; she said Yes, and that she would not return before nine o'clock. I and my neighbour made her go up to the room; we could not see that anything was gone; she said the keys were in the bottom drawer; we thought that all was safe, and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You fetched the prisoner to help look over the house - A. I went to see if she knew where Broad was - I did not leave her alone in the room. I know nothing about her borrowing the shawl; I did not see it on the chair.</p>

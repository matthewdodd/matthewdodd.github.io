            ; I said I was going away tomorrow morning at half-past ten o'clock, and did not wish to go to bed, for fear of oversleeping myself - Harding proposed to go and sleep in Mummery's stable, where Bond worked; I told Harding to wake me in the morning, I awoke at five or six o'clock, and they were both gone - the stable was not locked; I missed my watch and money, and went out, and saw Bond dressing a horse; he said he did not know where Harding was - I did not tell him what had happened, I found him in a stable between seven and eight o'clock, and asked him to give me my watch and money, he denied having them - I said I knew he had, he went with me to Bond, and I told him in Bond's presence, that he had stolen my watch and money, he denied it, and Bond said he knew nothing of it. I went to the Magistrates, but they would not give me a warrant till one o'clock and I was obliged to leave at half-past ten o'clock, for London. I apprehended Harding on Saturday, the 13th of October, and going along he said we could have made it up, without all this work - I said if he would give me the watch and seals, I would forgive him, and he might keep the money, and I would give him a 1 l. note besides - he denied having it, but said he knew who had; a woman who he called his wife, brought it to me on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You let him go, and took him up again - A. Yes. I have only got the watch - I never saw his wife in his presence, she said she was his wife, and he said "My wife will make all good." We went into the stable about three o'clock - I was a little in liquor. I tied a bit of my handkerchief, round my pocket and fob.</p>

I never saw him in possession of it, he was remanded till Thursday, when the prosecutor begged he might be discharged, as the watch was given up to him, and he was discharged - a few days after, the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240065"></xptr>came, and said he was dissatisfied, and the prisoner came, and surrendered himself.</p>

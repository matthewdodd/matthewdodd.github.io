                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 125). About 5.10 or 5.15, on the morning of the 24th March, I was on duty at Brookley Hill—I heard a noise opposite the house of Mr. Drury—it was as if a hammer was going against iron—I at once proceeded to the house, and saw Lewis on the pathway in the front, looking towards the house—at the same time I saw two men leaning against Mr. Drury's window, stooping and working their hands against it as if to force it—I said to Lewis, "You are up very early this morning, Miss"—she said, "Yes, I am; I have got two friends inside"—I said, "Yes, you</p>

               <p>have"—I went into the front garden towards the men, and as soon as they saw me they made their escape through a side garden—I followed them—I caught Sims, who was one of them, and knocked him down, and asked what he was doing there—after a struggle he said, "Oh, it is all right; it is the other man, Gardener"—I brought him back to the window—I found that violence had been used between the two sashes—a stone had been placed between the sashes, so as to force them open—I afterwards searched Sims, and found on him a pipe and some matches—on Sunday, 28th March, I went to the police station in Walworth Road and there saw Lewis—I knew her at once—it was quite light when I saw her in the garden—I could see her features—I did not see her for more than half a minute, but I am quite sure she is the woman—I did not speak to her at the station, the Serjeant did; and in consequence of information I want to 28, Content Street, Walworth—she was not with me—I found in the lodging this basket, which is similar to the one she carried on her arm on the morning of the 24th—I found it in the room where she told me she lived—I went back to the station and said she would have to go with me to Lewisham, on a charge of being concerned with two men, one in custody, for attempting burglariously to break into the house of Mr. James Drury, on the morning of the 18th March—she said she knew nothing about it.</p>

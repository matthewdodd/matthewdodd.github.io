               <p>I am porter to Messrs. Kenworthys.</p>
               <p>Q. On Friday last had you any order to carry out any linen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out? - Between four and five.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces? - Four.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what they contain? - I don't know the length.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they contain two hundred yards? - I cannot say. I carried them to the sign of the <placeName id="t17950114-23-crimeloc138">Magpie, in Butcher-row, behind Temple-bar</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you leave the things there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then? - It staid there a while, I sat a while in the window, I don't know how long. While I was drinking my beer I thought I could perceive it was moved about two or three inches nearer the other end of the block, which made me to take more particular notice of it; I think in about five minutes after I see it going off, I ran out and found it on the prisoner's back.</p>
               <p>Q. Quite taken from the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street was the prisoner? - It is Butcher-row, Wych-street is the name of the street I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the house when you found it on his back? - To the best of my knowledge, about thirty yards. I seized him and asked him what he was doing with my goods? I cannot justly say what he said then, but he said soon after that a man gave him sixpence to carry it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him? - Yes, and brought him back to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the goods, or what did he do with the goods? - To the best of my knowledge he carried them back, but I cannot really say whether he did or not, but I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for a constable, or what did you do? - I believe somebody went for a constable, I did not go myself. I went with him to Bow-street, and took the goods to Bow-street; I did not go to my master at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the goods ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought them here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have kept them separate from other goods? - Yes. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Kenworthy. I know them by the number and mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got a wife and three children, and work hard for them every day, and go out every morning to get a shilling if I can; I went out that day to the Bank-side and earned a shilling, and out of the shilling I spent sixpence, and I went home and gave my wife the sixpence; I asked her if she had got any thing for supper, she said she had not, I said I would go out and get her something; going down to Butcher-row, I stood to make water just at the Magpie stand, and I see a man who said, coalheaver, if you will carry this load for me I will give you sixpence; says I, I will. Says he, take and carry it up for me to Boswell-court, and I took it on my back, and he went on and I followed him up Newcastle-court, when I got about two yards up the court from the stone steps this man followed me and said, what have you got here? I said, what is that to you? he said, why it is my property; says I, then God bless my heart, I will carry it back again, and I did carry it back to the Magpie. I have been in prison ever since, and what my family have done for victuals and drink I don't know; I am a man well known.</p>
               <p>Court to Marland, Did you see any body in his company? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

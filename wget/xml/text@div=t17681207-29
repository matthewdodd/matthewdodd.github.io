I was sent with a letter to the post-office, returning back between ten and eleven o'clock at night.

I took hold of the prisoner, and charged the watch with her. She was carried to the Compter and searched. I felt my watch go out of my pocket and saw the motion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070031"></xptr> of her hand, but did not see the watch in it. Her hand was clinched when I was at the post-office. I took out my watch, it was about half an hour past ten.</p>

               <p>I was at the corner of Leaden-Hall market, and had a bundle under my arm. The gentleman clapped his hand on my shoulder, and said, you have got my watch. I said, don't lay hands on me, if you have any thing to say to me, charge the watch with me. I know no more of the watch than I do of my dying day.</p>

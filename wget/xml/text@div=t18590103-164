                  </hi>. I live at Cork. On 10th December last, I was in London—about 7 in the evening I took a cab in Cheapside, and saw my carpet-bag placed safely on the roof of the cab; it contained a coat, two shirts, and a good many articles—I have seen all the contents of my bag since—there was also 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in money—I looked round three times as I went along, to see if my bag was safe, and the fourth time on looking round at Portman-square, it was gone—this is my bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it contains all the articles that were in it when it was lost—I should say about ten minutes elapsed between my seeing the bag safe and missing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver of 26, Doughty mews, Guilford-street—on the evening of 10th December, the last witness hired my cab, and placed a carpet-bag on the roof of it which has a cradle at the back, and an iron railing, according to the new regulations—this was shut down over the carpet-bag when I started from Cheapside—we missed the bag when we were in Portman-square.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You mean an iron rail two or three yards above the top of the cab? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the cradle is formed of two pieces of iron, which run up each side of the back, and some more across it—it stands up at the back to prevent the luggage falling over the back or sides—the cross piece reaches three parts of the way across the cab—the covered part reaches about half-way.</p>

On 10th December at a little after half-past 7 in the evening, the prisoner passed me while I was with another officer—he was carrying this carpet-bag under his arm, and walking very quick—I followed him a few yards, and was going to take hold of his arm, when he turned round, threw it down, and ran off as hard as he could—I pursued him and took him in custody—I found Mr. Gill's name on it, and had to write to Cork to him—I saw him for the first time on January 1.</p>

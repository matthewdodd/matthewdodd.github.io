Hocking took the half-crown on one side, bent it, brought it back, and said, "Have you any more like this; where did you get it from?"—Harrison said, "I brought both from home this morning"—he had another good one—Mr. Hocking said, "I have a good mind to lock you up"—the prisoners said they were very sorry, they did not know it—Mr. Hocking went out at the side door and came in again directly with a policeman and the prisoners—I am quite sure they are the men who were in my shop.</p>

I have seen Armstrong go down there, and I have been with him nearly as far as there, but he would not take me with him; but as I was standing opposite White Lion-street, a young chap came up to me, and said, 'You are waiting for your mate.' I said, 'I am waiting for a chap with a sailor's cap on; and he said, 'He is down at Wybrow's.' I waited a long while for him and he did not come, and I went down there and looked in and I could not see him; he was gone, and the young chap said to me, 'Do you want any things? I said, 'No, but the other chap is gone down for some.' I did not see him again all that day. He came against my house the next morning and whistled for me, and as I was in bed I did not come out. John Armstrong, after I had been with this Walker (who is in prison) a week, was with him the next week."</p>

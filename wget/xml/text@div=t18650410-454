My wife was in the bar on this evening—I think the size of the bar is about eighteen feet by four—we were very busy indeed—if my wife was at one end of the bar serving she could scarcely hear what passed between me and any other person at the other end, if any one was hallooing.</p>

               <p>see any of them—I was then immediately stabbed—I had got right up to the door, because I had hold of the lock with my hand—the door was par<lb></lb>tially open and I had hold of the door, so that my body would be presented face to face to the man who was entering.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then except your own physical power there was nothing to prevent the whole of the Italians from rushing in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. King and Mr. Mellership were standing behind the door—they did not all rush to the door—the others were sitting down in the room singing a song—I was stabbed in the side here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to his right side</hi>) between the eighth and ninth ribs, I believe—I struck the prisoner with the broom-handle—when he pulled the knife out, I laid hold of the broom—handle and hit him in the head, and he ran at me again and I fell in the room and the door was shut—I went back into the room—the door closes with a spring—it is not a swing—door which opens either inwards or outwards; it opens inwards and closes of itself with a spring.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then I am afraid she was knocked down, or fell, before Pelizzioni came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> How could she be, when no other man was there but him—the woman was not intoxicated, she was knocked down by the party that came into the room; that party was Seraphini Pelizzioni—the door was not opened till she fell against it; she was knocked against it, and that opened it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could that open it if it opened inwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She must be out-side must she not, and when the door flew open she was the woman that was knocked against it—there are two sides to a door—she was not knocked against it inside, but her head came partly inside—she must have been knocked against the door from the outside, not from the street, from the passage, and that knocked the door open, and a portion of her was knooked into the room, perhaps her head, or her head and shoulders; at all events, enough of her for me to see that it was Mrs. King; her shoulders might We come in, I don't remember; if I saw you knocked down, and saw your wig knocked off, I should know your wig from your hair—I am giving straightforward evidence—she was pushed down, or hit in some way so that she fell on her back—she was inside the room before the door was open—she was in our company; she went out, saying, "I am going home; "she went to go out, and did open the door, and the door slammed to again, and then in a moment she was knocked down, and the door flew open.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was it, was it; I thought you said Seraphini knocked her down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said the first man that entered the room was the man that knocked her down; I don't know his name, although I have known him two years—I had not been in the tap-room in the early part of the evening; not half-an-hour before—my business was confined to the bar the whole of the day—I was French-polishing the window-boards—I did not see any policeman there—I saw no policeman inside the bar, not till the policeman was called in—Mr. Shaw, the landlord, called him in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just attend to this: "There happened to be a private policeman there, and he fetched another one in uniform, "that was what you said on the last trial; what did you mean by it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Shaw said there was a private policeman, it was what I was told; I did not assert it, it was what I was told—Mr. Shaw said the private policeman was there, just in the bar or outside, or somewhere; he was not in the bar; there was no private policeman in the bar—I have known that private policeman these twenty-five years, his name is Richard Fawell.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Fawell in plain clothes or in uniform when he came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In plain clothes; that is what I mean by a private policeman—I was in the bagatelle-room when Fawell came in, and at that time he was in private clothes—Mr. Shaw told me he had sent for him; that was what I said at the last trial—at the time Mrs. King got up to go I was in the bagatelle-room, standing as near the bagatelle-table as possible—I don't know how she got out—I saw her go across the room and go to the door—I saw her knocked down—I heard a noise, which caused me to look round, and I saw Mrs. King on her back; that was the first I knew of the row—I had not moved at that time from where Harrington and I sat together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you saw Mrs. King on her back was the door shut or open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I saw her on her back it had flown open, but when she went out, it closed after her, and presently I saw her on her back—between her going out and the door closing and flying open again when she fell back into the room, was scarcely a minute I should think; I could not say exactly to a minute—the next thing I saw was that man Seraphini, or a man whose name I did not know then, I know him now, I mean the prisoner, jump over as it were, and he rushed at Harrington in that way, and Harrington fell, and said, "Oh, I am stabbed"—I saw the prisoner make a kind of jump over Mrs. King as she was lying on the ground, and then King runs and picks up his wife; King came from close behind one of the seats, the seat nearest the door; he was on the opposite seat to me; in a second the police came, and took the prisoner in hand; King was the man that lifted him off Harrington; I had no time to do anything—I followed him out to the bar when they were taking him out through the private-bar, and then the potman rebbeck threw himself in my hands, and said, "Oh, MR. Liddell, I am stabbed"</p>

I am a painter, and was in the employ of Messrs Banting, of St. James's-street, before I got the sack on this occasion—I was at the Golden Anchor on Boxing-night; I had been there pretty nigh all day—I did not particularly make friends with any one there; there were other persons there—I was in the bagatelle-room—between 6 and 7 in the evening I heard a noise in the tap-room; upon that I went out of the bagatelle-room into a little street, I don't know whether it was Castle-street or not—I went out of the door leading into the bar-parlour, and then out into the street, and went round to the door opening into Saffron-hill and entered again at the door leading into the tap-room—I went</p>

               <p>into the tap-room—I saw several Italians there; they were breaking up the forms and seats—there were three or four standing against the table; I can't say whether they were breaking up, they were in the act as I thought of doing so; I can swear that I saw one or two breaking up forms, some of them had got pieces of wood in their hands; they seemed to be crouching towards the door leading to the bagatelle-room—they said something in Italian, but I did not know what it meant, at least they told me to go out: they said, "You had better go out"—I did go out, and went into the bagatelle-room, exactly in the same way I had come, and I told the people in the bagatelle-room what I had seen—when I got back there was no Italian in the bagatelle-room, not one—I will take my oath of that—I had not been absent more than six or seven minutes I am sure—I saw Mr. King in the bagatelle-room; he placed himself behind the door—I saw Mrs. King go out of the bagatelle-room; I can't say who opened the door, but I know die went out, and she came tumbling back, but I can't say who struck her, or whether she was struck at all; she came tumbling back in some way or other, whether shoved or struck I don't know; she fell into the bagatelle-room—I saw Rebbeck go into the tap-room with a pipe—I did not see him come back into the bagatelle-room—I saw him in the tap-room—I don't (mow how he came back—I saw him afterwards standing up in one corner of the room with hishand on his side, but I did not know whether he was stabbed then or not—before that I had heard him say, "I will have no row here, "or something to that effect; that was after he left the bagatelle-room to go into the tap-room—I saw Polioni when he came into the baga-telle-room, that was after Rebbeck went out with the pipe—I saw Polioni come in, and make a sort of a side-thrust at Michael Harrington—I did not see anything in his hand, I merely saw that—I could not exactly judge the distance he was from Harrington—Harrington was facing the door, and Polioni rushed at him like that; I believe Harrington tried to make a grab at him, and he went like that (<hi rend="italic">thrusting</hi>)—Harrington had nothing in his hand; he made an attempt to catch him, and he twisted and went down on his side, and Polioni made a rush to get out at the door, and Bannister being in his way he made a strike at him, and Bannister rolled on to the bagatelle-board, and fell down at my feet, and said, "Look out, Painter;"Bannister said that after he was stuck in the hand—I did not see Rebbeck at that time—I looked round, and saw Bannister lying under the bagatelle-board, with some blood coming from his hand; I can't say which hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you do anything to Polioni? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I had not done something to him I suppose he would to me—I struck him on the head I believe, with a piece of wood—he fell on Harrington, and then the piece of wood I hit him with broke, and I had nothing more to defend myself with, so I got out the window and out of the yard and went to fetch more assistance—I asked some to come and they would not—I went back exactly the same way, an got in at the window again—I saw Harrington there—I asked him what was the matter—he did not make any statement—Polioni was gone then—King and Mellership had got hold of him when I went out of the window—up to that time no other Italian but Polioni had got into the rooui; none whatever, if I was to die this minute.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then your version of the story is, not that the door was pushed open by Seraphini and the people outside, but that King opened it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I can't say—whether the door was pushed in or Seraphini was pushed in; I can't say; he came in one way or the other—I will swear Seraphini was the only man in the bagatelle-room—we took good care he should be the only man—we thought that was the only way to beat him—he would have beaten us if we had given him the slightest chance—we did not get him in, he was shoved in, or he came in at all events, and I hit him on the head, bat before that he made the thrust at Harrington—I told King to let them in one at a time, because when I was in the tap-room I saw there was a lot, so I thought I would let them in one at a time and beat them in detail—what was the motive of their coming into the room if they did not mean mischief?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see King open the door, or do you suppose that he opened it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was standing behind the door—I did say that he opened it, but I should not like to swear whether he did or not—it does not matter who opened the door—whether the door was pushed open or whether he opened it I don't positively know; it is a very hard thing to say—at the time Seraphini turned to go out of the room, Bannister was between him and the door, so that he should not get out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say positively whether at that time any other Italian was in the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure, if I was to fall dead on these steps this minute, there was not—I am telling no lie, if I am may God strike me dead—Seraphini was in the room when Harrington fell, and no other Italian—he struck Bannister, and Bannister rolled under the bagatelle-board, sayiug, "Look out, Painter"—they call me "George the painter."</p>

On the evening of 26th December last I went to the Golden Anchor, between 6 and 7 o'clock—that was the first time I had been there that day—in consequence of something that was said to me at the bar I went into the bagatelle-room—I went from the bar. from the Castle-street entrance; that would be across the end of the bar and the bar<lb></lb>parlour—I know the half-hatch which is between the inside of the bar and the tap-room—a person in the tap-room could see me going across the bar into the bagatelle-room—I did not see Mrs. King go out—about three or four minutes after I had got into the bagatelle-room I saw the Italians rush towards the door to push it open—I mean the bagatelle-room-door leading to the tap-room, the west-door—they did not get further than the door—the door was thrown wide open, but Seraphini was the only one that got right into the room, the others got no further than the door—when the door was wide open the fight began at the door—the moment Seraphini got into the room the door was closed—he was the only Italian I saw in the room at the time, the others got no further than the door, and when the door was closed he was the only one in the room—I know no more, I made it my business to get out of the room—I was stabbed—I don't know who it was stabbed me—I was standing in between Rebbeck and Harrington—I can't say how I was with reference to Seraphini—we were standing all within about two or three feet of the door, very close together—I was stabbed in the right hand with ft knife—the knuckle was cut of the little finger—I have lost the use of my finger—I was knocked down—I laid first on the table and from there I think I fell under the bagatelle-table or close by—I spoke to Stanley and said, "Stanley I shall get out"—the prisoner was then in the room, he was being held down by King, or King had him in hand.</p>

"and I said, "I am not sure whether it was Seraphini or not"—that was what I said before the Magistrate; that was the only doubt I spoke of, because I could not say which man it was—I know I was stabbed, but I can't say who it was thai stabbed me—I saw Seraphini in the room; I have no doubt whatever about that; he was the only Italian in the room when I got up off the ground—I saw no other Italian but him in the room that night—I saw him at the time I saw a number of Italians at the door—I have not the least doubt about that; I saw him at the door then—that was not when I was looking over the dwarf-door—I was in the bagatelle-room within about a foot, or two feet, of the door when it was thrown open, and he passed in—I saw who was in the passage, because the door was thrown wide open, and the light from the centre of the bagatelle-room shone right on their faces—they were prevented coming into the room—I think they were knocked back by two or three English chaps; there was Stanley and young Raffell, I think they were the two that used the sticks, and I had a stick, and we kept them back the tat way we could.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued.</hi>) I should think it was about half-past 8 when I got to the Royal Free Hospital; I am not certain, it might be before that—Baldock was there when I got there, and several other officers—I should think Pelizzioni was there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after—I sent for him immediately I heard from the doctor that Rebbeck was likely to die—I heard that as soon as I got there—Pelizzioni was at the police-station in Bagnigge Well's-road—that is about seven or ten minutes' walk from the Royal Free Hospital—Fawell was one of the officers I sent for him—he was in plain clothes—I remember sending him—the other one I do not remember, but he was in uniform whoever he was—I first saw Pelizzioni at the foot of the bed—the officers were also there when I got there, Fawell and I believe Baldock, and the two doctors, and several others—after I had gone to the hospital, and had sent for Pelizzioni, I went away, and searched for Rebbeck's clothes, seeing that he was naked in bed—that was after I had sent for Pelizzioni, and before he came—I went into Gray's Inn-road where I was told they were—I might be absent about twenty minutes—it was when I came back that I found the officers and the prisoner at the foot of Rebbeck's bed—I sent for a Magistrate during that period, and I went and found an officer to go.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you sent for Pelizzioni had you seen that written statement. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was away looking for the clothes, about twenty minutes I should think, not more—I first saw that written statement when I saw the prisoner and the officers round Rebbeck'8 bed when I returned—I did not hear the prisoner make any statement before it was read—I had not spoken to him, and had never seen him before. When Harrington spoke of the man who had wounded him, he said it was either the man with the black or dark moustache, I am not positive which—my opinion is that he said black, but I should not like to to be certain whether he said dark or black—i have not always stated that he said black; I think he did, but I will not be positive—I know Gregorio now; I do not know whether he wore a moustache—I saw him with a moustache when he came to the police-station, but I was told he had not a moustache when the offence was committed—several persons on Saffron-hill told me so—I saw him at the station-house with a mous<lb></lb>tache, when he was there with Mr. Negretti—I have not got the date; it was not uutil after the conviction of the prisoner—I should think it was about a week or a fortnight after the first trial—it was a dark moustache—I did not lose the paper that I produced to Harrington, I gave it to the solicitor, and the clerk took it—I do not know who employed the solicitor; I swear that—I have heard, but I do not know of my own knowledge—I heard that Mr. Shaw the Magistrate, and he handed them to the clerk, and he laid them on the table as being of no value—Sergeant Baldock had drawn out that paper—he wrote it down—I have stated to-day that when Harrington said it was the man with the dark or black moustache, the prisoner said nothing—he said nothing until he said, "I do not understand English writing"—he never opened his mouth to my knowledge—I never heard him speak before that—he uttered no ejaculation, not the slightest—he appeared very much hurt, as far as that he hung down his head, and appeared to feel his position, and never looked up—he said nothing, and uttered no ejaculation, I am quite sure about that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just listen to this, "The prisoner said, 'I do not understand English writing;' I said what Harrington has said is, 'You did it,' the prisoner said, 'Oh.' "<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is quite right; I said that he said nothing until he said he did not understand English writing—he did say, "Oh"—I did not remember that—I did not think of it; I forgot it—I do not know that there were any other Italians at the bed-side of Harrington—I was the officer of the highest rank there—I managed the affair on that occasion—I did not let in anybody who liked—I prevented no person from coming—I asked several to do so; I cannot say whether any other Italians were present, in my opinion there was not, but I don't know, there were four other persons in the room with moustaches, two strangers who I asked to come in, and I believe both the surgeons had a moustache—I found the two strangers at the entrance-door—they were quite strangers to me—when I take persons to be identified, I go into the street and ask some persons whether they have any objection to be placed with others, for the purpose of identifying the prisoner—I did not watch for a couple of persons with a moustache—there was a crowd of persons standing at the door, I took in three, two with moustaches; I cannot say who they were—I believe there were five with moustaches in the room—there was an officer belonging to the building with a moustache on—I do not know the name of that other person—I received this knife, with the broken point, I believe, from one of the officers—it might have been Baldock, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe during the former investigation you never produced the knife at all, until it happened to be called for by the defence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did produce it on the part of the prosecution—I left it in the hands of the gentlemen who were prosecuting—I am speaking of this knife (<hi rend="italic">the broken one</hi>)—the knives were there—that knife was produced on the part of the prosecution on the prisoner's first trial—it was in Court—it was pro<lb></lb>duced to the Jury—I saw it in the hands of the Judge—I have been an officer about seventeen years—during that time I have been a witness in some hundreds of cases—I quite know what a prosecution means—I could not say whether the knife was produced on the part of the prosecution—I know the knives were here in Court; it was produced during the case for the prosecution—I am quite sure of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are not asked whether it was in Court but whether it was produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I could not say as to that; I don't think it was.</p>

               <p>commencement of the trial I sent the knives into Court—I was outside—I can't say when the knife got on the table—I took it from the table—I believe I brought it down to the Court; I know I did—I brought the two knives to the Court, and at the commencement of the trial I sent them into the Court—I delivered up both the knives when I was called upon to do so—I did not bring this knife down to the Court, only that one—Cowland said that was not the knife that he gave me—I said it was—I sent the knives into Court before I gave my evidence; before the case commenced, in the morning, by one of the officers—I could not give his name—I don't recollect saying at the trial that the knife, with the broken point, had been found just outside the window—I will not swear I did not, but I don't remember those words—I did not know at that time where it had been found, only what I had been told—I sent the officer to find the person who found the knife, when I heard that a knife had been found, and he came to the Police-court to give that evidence—I believe that officer, McMahon, was called before the Magistrate; he was there, whether he was called or not I don't remember—I don't think Mrs. Verge, or either of her children, were called upon any occasion until to-day—I know they were not at the Police-court, because I was told they were of no use, as we could not trace the owner of the knife—I had been told that the knife was found near the house, but I knew no more than what I was told about it—I cannot say whether this knife (<hi rend="italic">the long one</hi>) was mentioned in the course of the prosecution—I can't say that it was not—I know I handed them both up to the Judge—I don't know that that was the first time they were produced—I received that knife from the potman of the Three Tuns, Cowland, I think, I have heard his name is, since—I got it from him on the night of the occurrence, the 26th—I brought that knife to the Court with me—I was told where it was found—I pursued the inquiry on the subject of that knife—I was told it had been fouud in the urinal at the Three Tuns—I asked the person when it was given to me, whether he knew who put it there, and he said "No"—I do not take for granted everything that is said to me; very little—I made inquiry as to who was the owner of the knife—I did not hear any name mentioned as being the owner of it—I did not hear any person described; I swear that; not with reference to the knife—I never heard to whom it was supposed to belong; I don't say I never did; I say at the time I was pur<lb></lb>suing the inquiry—I knew it at the time of the first trial—I heard it at the Police-court—I heard a tale about the knife, and I heard a name mentioned in relation to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you in point of fact ever see that knife or call attention to it, during the progress of the prosecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, here in this Court—I make no mistake if I can help it—I do not say I produced it during the case for the prosecution—I did not call the attention of the Court or the Jury to it, during the progress of the case for the prosecution—I was not in Court, only when I was examined—the knives were lying on the table—I did not mention either of the two knives in my examination that I re<lb></lb>member—I don't think I did; I don't believe I did; I should not like to be positive—I saw the knives all the time lying on the table—I had heard that the knife belonged to Gregorio; I heard that statement made at the Police-court—I did hear it before the first trial; before the second trial I did—I did not hear that it belonged to Gregorio, who was tried; I heard that it belonged to his brother John—I had heard of the knife when Pelizzioni was tried—I brought it to the Court—I had not then heard that it belonged to Gregorio, I had heard it belonged to his brother; that was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100115"></xptr>
               <p>at the time of the first trial—I had been looking for him before that, and also the other; I was looking for three Italians—I did hear before the first trial that the knife belonged to one of the Mogni's—I had not heard that it was delivered up by one of them, within a very few minutes after the murder bad been committed, or the day after—I heard that it was found in the urinal—I heard nothing else about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember when this case was first taken up by the Treasury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not think it was above a week before the first trial of Pelizzioni; it was something like that—I gave my statement to the Solicitor to the Treasury—he was aware of the existence of both the knives which I had in my possession, and how I found them—I produced them to him—when I came to the Court on the morning of Pelizzioni's trial I myself brought those two knives here, and sent them into Court by a constable, whose name I do not remember—I think I was the last witness called for the prosecution; or the last but one—I was out of Court during the time of the trial—I had nothing to do with the production or non-production of the knives at that trial—when I came into Court as a witness I saw the two knives lying on the table—I had heard that this knife belonged to Gregorio's brother, at the time I was trying to find three Italians—I was not able to find John at that time; I found out where he had been working and had the place watched, but was not able to find him—I did not conceal from anybody the fact of my having got those knives, or where I got them; quite the reverse; I mentioned the fact of having found them—I got the persons, who I took to Harrington's bedside, from the entrance to the hospital, there was a crowd of persons there, and I asked two or three of them to come in; there were several others besides—Harrington was in a separate bed, but there were several beds in the ward—before I admitted these persons into the ward I left the prisoner and the others outside, and went and spoke to the doctor's to as certain whether Harrington was sensible or not—I knew none of the persons that I brought in, and none of the others except the constables and the doctors, and the brother-in-law of Harrington, Worms, and I did not know him at that time.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know about two hats having been delivered up by Mrs. Shaw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did after the trial; I did not know it before—I heard of two hats being lost by the deceased and Rebbeck—I heard that before the trial—I could not be positive whether I mentioned it at the trial; I do not think I did; I do not remember—I did not make in<lb></lb>quiry of Mr. or Mrs. Shaw as to whether any hats had been found—I do net know whether I made any inquiries of Mrs. Shaw; I forget if I did—I think I spoke to her about it some days after the occurrence—I believe I asked her where she was, and she told me she was in the bar—I asked her several questions, and from that I should have expected to bare heard all she knew—I did not ask her whether she knew anything about the hats; I had not heard about them then—I knew there were two hats lost, but I made no inquiries about them.</p>

               <p>the Magistrate, "In going from the tap-room I saw Alfred Rebbeck following the prisoner into the bagatelle-room; the prisoner was going into the room by himself?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is the fact—Rebbeck said, "Mr. Fawell, I am stabbed/"and pointed a man out to me, as I supposed, the prisoner—it is true that Rebbeck said he was stabbed, pointing to a particular man—I did not see Rebbeck follow the prisoner into the bagatelle-room—I and Elliott followed in—it is not true that I saw Rebbeck following the prisoner into the bagatelle-room—Rebbeck told me he had been stabbed, and we followed through—that statement is not correct—the deposition was read over to me at the Police-court, but not read as it is—Rebbeck told me that he was stabbed; that was my reason for following the prisoner—this is my signature to the deposition—it was made on 27th December, the day after the occur<lb></lb>rence—I believe that is the evidence I gave, but I had been spoken to by Rebbeck then, and told that he had been stabbed—there was a man, I believed to be the prisoner, we lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he going into the room by himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A man wag going into the room, I never saw his face; Rebbeck was in a following posi<lb></lb>tion and we followed after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying before the magistrate, "I saw Rebbeck following the prisoner into the bagatelle-room?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was from the tap-room door, when we went through the two doors; I do not mean after we broke the door open; previous to that; Rebbeck told me he had been stabbed—he was going into the bagatelle-room as I stated, following the pri<lb></lb>soner as I supposed—when he stated that he had been stabbed we went in at one door and pushed the other door open—Rebbeck stood in the tap-room</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100117"></xptr>
               <p>by my side—I did state before the magistrate that I saw Rebbeck following the prisoner into the bagatelle-room; he pointed a man out; a man was pointed out to me who I believe to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are supposed to have said, (if you made any mistake correct it), that when you got in the tap-room, the tap-room door was closed, and further that the bagatelle-room door was not open as far as you know till Elliott broke it open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when I went in after I had got the assist<lb></lb>ance of Elliott I met Rebbeck in the tap-room, he said, "Mr. Fawell, I am stabbed"—I said, "By whom?"—he said, "By that man"—the tap-room door was opened, it was immediately closed again, we rushed through and burst the other door open and when we got in we found the prisoner in the custody of King and Mellership.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time Rebbeck said he was stabbed, where was the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose he was the one that pulled the door open, I suppose it to be him—there was a man there, I do not know whether it was the prisoner or not; I believe it was—Rebbeck followed him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But as I understand you the door opening from the bagatelle-room was not open till Elliott broke it open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I should judge not—I went from the tap-room into the bagatelle-room by pulling one door and pushing the other—I cannot tell whether Anybody opened it from the time the first door was closed, because we had to pull it open again to get the other door open; Elliott was in some part of the tap-room at the time; the man was pointed out to me, he must have been a very short distance from me; I cannot say whether he was in front or behind, we were all in confusion; there were about twenty people in the tap-room at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you seen the prisoner before that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were so many in there—I do not know whether I saw the prisoner—he was the only man I saw in the room when he was pointed out—I saw several English people in the bagatelle-room besides the prisoner—I did not see Rebbeck there—I saw Bannister, Stanley, and several of the witnesses who have been examined.</p>

I am resident medical officer at the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's-inn-road—I recollect Rebbeck being brought there—he was very weak, and had lost a very farge quantity of blood; he was in great danger—he was suffering from a wound in the side; it was what we call a punctured wound, between the eighth and ninth ribs, three-quarters of to inch long, and half an inch in extent the other way—it was a rectan<lb></lb>gular wound; it was three inches in depth, extending into the lungs—its direction was upwards and inwards—he was bleeding from an artery, which was severed beneath the ribs—I had him removed into the ward—he had no other injury upon him that I perceived—I think there was a little abrasion on the knee, but nothing of any importance—inflammation of the lungs followed—there was no part of the weapon that inflicted the injury left in the wound.</p>

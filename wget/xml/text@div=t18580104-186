                  </hi>. I am the brother of Henry Sewell, a pork butcher, in Seymour Street. On Friday afternoon, 11th Dec, I was in my brother's shop; Smithers came in and asked my sister for a pound of pork chops, which she weighed, and Smithers gave her a half crown—my sister said, "I don't think it is good"—Smithers said, "Is not it? the way to try it is with your teeth"—my sister tried it with her teeth, and she said, "It is not good"—she handed it to me, and I looked at it and said, "No, it is a bad one"—I had a large knife, and I chopped the half crown twice and made two marks on it—I gave it to Smithers, and she said, "Put the pork chops by, I will call for them"—she then went out, and my sister told me to follow her—Idid so; she joined Powell, and they walked down Charles Street—they were speaking—they stopped in Clarendon Square—I saw Smithers go into Mrs. Blower's shop—Powell was outside, walking up and down—Smithers came out and went to Powell—I went into the shop, and received this half crown from Mrs. Blower—she marked it and gave it to me—I came out and saw the two prisoners in company—they went away together towards Weir's Passage—I saw a constable, and he and I went into Weir's Passage together—Ipointed both the prisoners out to him—he took Powell and I took Smithers—I gave him the half crown which I had received from Mrs. Blower—onthe way to the station, at the corner of Park Street—Powell had his hand behind him, and he had a bag, which he dropped—I picked it up and gave it to the constable—it was opened at the station, and I identified the half crown which I had chopped with the knife in the bag.</p>

                  </hi>. This half crown that has been chopped, is a counter<lb></lb>feit of George IV., 1819—all the coins in this bag are counterfeit—the three crowns are of George III., and are from one moulds—three of these half crowns are from the same mould—the one that was uttered is George IV., 1839—of these twenty florins, thirteen are from one mould, and seven from another—five of these shillings are from one mould, two from another, and six from another, and two separate ones—they were all done up in the usual way with bad coin, to keep them from rubbing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Powell's Defence.</hi> I think that as you have taken an oath to administer justice according to the evidence, you will require that that evidence be true; and after the answers which the witnesses have given to the questions I have asked, as Christians, you will say they are not worthy of belief; a witness should speak the truth, and nothing but the truth; if he says one thing one moment, and another another, no person who represents himself a Christian will believe him; I cannot quote from any book, but if I had a Bible, I would read an extract from it (<hi rend="italic">A Bible was brought, and the prisoner read the 21st chapter of the Book of Kings, from the 7th to the 16th verse</hi>). Thus these policemen care not by what means they gain their ends; I could give instances where parties have been convicted on false evidence.</p>

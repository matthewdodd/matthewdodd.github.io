Limberts', and look into the shop for about five minutes - when they went away their hands were in their pockets; I saw Moody cross the street to the side where I was, with something in his hand - I asked what it was; he said he did not know, but a man gave it to him to carry; I brought him across the road, and pushed him and Harris (who was still standing at the window) into the shop; I took this piece of brass from Moody's right hand; the people were passing at the time, which prevented my seeing who took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CARRINGTON. Q. Did not Moody say it was given to him by another man? A. Yes. He made no resistance - he carried it openly. I do not think he is known to the Police.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LIMBERT. I am in partnership with my father, whose name is John. This is a piece of brass which we screw on for the shutters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not fixed to the house? A. Yes - there is a screw goes to the window in one part, which holds it fast; this part of it could be got away without being unscrewed or wrenched - it is of no use - it is an ornament.</p>

Yes, on the 16th of April last, we were going through Great George Street in our way home, it was about half-past one in the morning, the child was asleep in my arms, I and Mrs. Newman were about five or six yards from our husbands; two young men came from the other side of the way and insulted me and Mrs. Newman, they made a blow at me, and instead of hitting me they hit the child, the child cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the child. - A. Five year old. Mr. Newman and my husband came up, my husband said what do you want, Hughes made use of bad words and said, what do you want, a scuffle ensued between my husband and the two prisoners, another young man came up, he knocked Mr. Newman's hat off, and ran away. Hughes knocked my husband on his knee, they were then on the road, and I was on the pavement, and when I saw Ruby and Hughes were both falling on my husband, I said Lane where is your watch, he put his hand to his fob and said it was gone, and he said my braces is broke. I immediately ran over to him in the road and laid hold of Hughes; and saw the key of the watch in his hand, his hand was clenched I could not see the watch, I called the watchman. Hughes said he would knock my life time out if I did not let him go, two gentlemen came up and assisted me till the watchman came up, and took him. I gave charge of him, I got the watch out of his hands myself. In dragging the watch out of his hands the case came open, I carried the watch to the watch-house, and gave it to the watch-house keeper.</p>

Hughes shoved me, and the child screamed out, I saw Hughes knock Mr. Lane down on his knee, and the man that ran off knocked my husband's hat off, I picked it up, and then I saw Mrs. Lane, struggling with Hughes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you happen to observe whether he had any watch when he was at the public house. - A. Yes, I am clear of that.

When I returned to my company, I observed the watchman and patrols having hold of both the prisoners, they were taken to the watch-house, I went with them, at the watch-house Mrs. Lane gave the watch to the watch-house keeper, I heard Mrs. Lane say pointing to Hughes, that he was the man that she took the watch from, Hughes pulled his own watch out of his fob, and said here is the watch that will buy you all.</p>

               <p>ROBERT DENHAM. I am a patrol, I heard a woman cry out that one of the prisoners had struck her child; I came up to her, I perceived Lane and Ruby scuffling, they both had their hats off, I asked what was the matter, Lane said that one of them drew his watch from him, I took charge of Ruby, there were three of them together, then the third man ran away, Ruby said he knew nothing about the watch.</p>

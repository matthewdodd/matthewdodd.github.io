The prisoner was occasionally employed as his servant—about ten o'clock at night, on Thursday, the 18th of November, I and my sister were sitting in the front room second floor,—I heard a noise—we went into the passage with a candle, but could see nothing—we went to the front window, and heard a noise over the roof—a young man went out and found a basket, which the prisoner had fetched away in the morning—he looked out, and found the prisoner standing on the right, between the two attic windows—I asked him what he did there, and told him to come in—he was two or three minutes before he came in—I gave him in charge—the house is Edward Heffy Ferne—I had seen the lead safe shortly before.</p>

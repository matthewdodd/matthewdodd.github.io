On the 8th of January, the prisoner came into my tap-room, between seven and eight in the evening. He called for a pint of porter, which I took him, and he gave me the money. He gave me a sixpence instead of a farthing. I returned it him. In a little time a person came and informed me that the prisoner had put one of my pint pots in his pocket.

            . On the night of the 8th of January I was at the King's Head; the prisoner came in and called for a pint of porter. He placed himself down in a box, and put a pint pot behind him. Not the pot he was drinking out of. The landlord brought him a pipe of tobacco. He gave the landlord the money for the pint of beer and the pipe of tobacco, and in mistake he gave the landlord a sixpence for a farthing, which the landlord returned, and on my seeing him put the pot behind him I took up the newspaper, and while I was reading the newspaper I saw him put the pint pot in his pocket, under his great coat. I went and informed the landlord of it. I thought he had not used the landlord well, after he returned him the sixpence to put a pint pot in his pocket. The prisoner observed me tell the man of it; then he got up to the further corner of the box, against the window. He took the pint pot out of his pocket. I told him he had used the landlord ill. I called the landlord in, and told him the man that I had told him had put a pint pot in his pocket, he had taken it out, and had put it behind him. I saw him put it behind him. The prisoner said, the pot is behind me, but it was here before I came in. I saw he wanted to take the pint pot out of his pocket, as he moved, and I moved on purpose to see him take the pint pot out of his pocket. The pot was delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The pot was delivered to me; it has my own name upon it. The magistrate asked me if I saw the pot taken from his person. I said, no; the pot was on the table when I came in. The prisoner said he took it from behind him. The magistrate then said he had better hold his tongue. It is my pot. It is worth fourteen pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About six o'clock I went into the Nag's Head, I had a pint of beer and a pipe of tobacco. Pocock said to me, are not you a villian. What for, said I. He said, I had a pint pot of the landlord's. I am innocent of the charge. I did not know that the pot was behind me at all.</p>

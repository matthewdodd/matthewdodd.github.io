               <p>Q. While you were doing this you say you was knocked off your horse, did you lose your senses? - I was rather stunned, but not long.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew what was going on? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? -Between eight and nine o'clock at night; it was moon light, new Michaelmas night. With that they left me, and took two horses away, and left one, and I rode towards home.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they go? - They seemed to stand still.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean riding towards London? - Towards London; they stood still at the time, but I see them mount one of my horses, and ride after me, after I had got some distance from them, but I rode away, and see nothing further of them, but came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a saddle or bridle to them? - I had two new halters to the horse I had lost; I bought them at Uxbridge fair, and had them booked there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you well mounted? - Very well mounted, but seeing four of them I rode away from them, and made the best of my way home.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this take up? - About five minutes, or not so much, I cannot pretend to say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them before? - I see all four as I came out of the town, but had no suspicion of them being thieves when I passed the Fountain, I see nothing of them again till they jumped out of the path and stopped me; I had seen them in the town all day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they armed? - One had a pistol, and the others appeared to me to have sticks. I cannot be positive whether it was sticks or pistols, but one I am positive had a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken up? - Three days after the robbery, I went down to Uxbridge to enquire whether any body had seen any thing of my horses, thinking they would have dropped them on the road, and I had them cried at Uxbridge; I found one of my horses turned into the field loose, at Uxbridge, the publican of the Fountain went with me and shewed it me, which I gave him five shillings for, what I had cried I would give; this was on Tuesday; on the Monday following I was going to Hounslow fair, going through Brentford I saw two of them, Clarke and Hill, and one of them was riding my horse, going to sell it, and the other was on their own, or somebody else; with that they bearing of me coming, they gallopped away as fast as they could, and they found that I close pursued them, and they rode by the side of a blacksmith's shop, and there they got off the horse; when I came up I asks them who owns this horse, I catched hold of the horse,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280028"></xptr>Clarke says, I don't own it, this owns it; and Hill rather faltered in his speech, and turning pale, said, I own it; he was dismounted then; I then said it was my horse, and he was the man that robbed me of it; so with that he cried, and wished not to go before the justice, I said I would insist on his going before a justice, and I would not have my horse without going before a justice; then they pulled out some gold.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you stop Clarke, or might he have got away? - I would not let them go; there were some other people came up; they were both stopped, and went before a justice, and committed for that night to the watch house; the next day I was ordered to come up to Brentford again, and I went, and this other man, Hamnell, came to speak in behalf of Clarke and Hill, to give them a character.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first time you had seen him since the robbery? - Yes. Then he was committed with the other; there were two more come to give them a character, which I think I knew one of them, but I could not positively swear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What is your name? -John Bengoe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been Bengoe? - Ever since I was born.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not been Benjoe sometimes? - No, Bengoe.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the first time you have ever been in a court of justice? - I cannot say that, I was once in a court of justice before; this is the first time I ever apprehended a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you in a court of justice before? - At Kingston; I dare say you know, Mr. Shepherd.</p>
               <p>Q. I have not the honour of being Mr. Shepherd; what did they say you had been guilty of there; what was you tried for there? - On suspicion of my house being on fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you indicted by the name of Bengoe then? - Yes, by the name of Bengoe.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived at Battersea before that? - I was born there, I live there now.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't live in the neighbourhood of Uxbridge? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about two hundred yards from Uxbridge town, and a very light night? - It was about two hundred yards from the Fountain, between that house and the half way house.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not go back to Uxbridge? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There were plenty of people in Uxbridge for you to have made the alarm to? - I could not go by them four.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a very good horse? - I was very well mounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any alarm? - I did, at the next town, at Hillingdon; I could get nobody that had courage to go with me, I did not raise the town, I see nobody but the waiter and two hostlers.</p>
               <p>Q. You told them you had been robbed? - I did, the men knew me, they did not think proper to go, because there had been so many robberies that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps having been before a court of justice before, it may have occured to you that there is such a thing as a reward? - But I have been offered double the money by their party.</p>
               <p>Q. But don't you know there is a reward? - There is by all account.</p>
               <p>Q. How much reward is there on each of these mens lives? - I cannot say, I never paid any attention to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you never hear what was the reward for convicting a highway man? - There is a reward, but I don't know what.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear what the reward was? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't tell me of your knowledge, on your oath don't you know that there is a reward of forty pounds on conviction of each of these men? - Not to my know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280029"></xptr>ledge, on my oath I do not, I never heard that till justice Bond told me yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Bond, or somebody tell you yesterday what was the reward for the conviction of a highwayman? -He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know there is an hundred and twenty pounds on the conviction of these men? - I do not, nor ever heard it, not before you tell me now.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear yesterday? - justice Bond told the constables that they had no business with it at all, nor need they go down to Hick's Hall, because they were not at the taking of the men, and if there was any reward I deserved it.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that if these men are convicted, they are liable to be hanged on your evidence? - Yes, and I think they thoroughly deserve it. At first I was not bound over it was thought that some other gentleman would prosecute, and the gentleman did not come forward, and justice Bond sent over to me, to come to be bound over to prosecute.</p>

               <p>I am a harness maker at Brentford, I can say that I know the prisoners by their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280030"></xptr>coming to me at Brentford; I see them at Brentford when they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been with you on New Michaelman day at Brentford? - Yes, about half past eight, as nigh as I can guess, they called for a whip, and when I came to the door they went away, and I ran over and fetched two whips, they said they were not heavy enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the prisoners at the bar? - I do believe it was one of them by his voice, and by the words he repeated to me the day he was taken.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, Gardener's-lane, York-street, Westminster. On Sunday, the 6th of October, the prisoner came in between eight and nine o'clock, and asked if he could be accommodated with a lodging for the night; my wife said, Yes; he sat down and took off a pair of boots, which he said hurt his feet - he said he would sell them and get a pair of shoes in exchange; he asked me to go with him, but I refused - he asked me to let one of my children go; I refused, but told him where to sell them, and he said he had a parcel of things he had brought from hopping - he left two parcels with me, containing seven forks and other things; he left them on my shelf - one was wrapped in an old blue handkerchief, and the other in a piece of stuff - my wife had occasion to move them; she did so, and she spoke to me, and I took the parcel from her hand, shoved the cloth back, and the prongs of the silver forks came out - I did not open them; I sent my son-in-law for a police officer, and while he was gone I went to where I had sent him to sell the boots, and cautioned them not to buy them - he came down with me from the place he was selling the boots at, to my house, and I kept him till I gave him to the officer; the two parcels were delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The person told me, if I gave the property up, I might go about my business, or something of that sort. Witness. I did not hear it said.</p>
               <p>ALLEN CHAMBERLAIN (policeman B 57). I went with Fox to his lodging, and saw the prisoner; Fox pointed him out to me - the prisoner then had two bundles in his hand; he gave them to me - I examined them, one contained seven silver forks and a small gravy ladle; the other five silver forks and two table spoons, and he had a pair of boots and a pair of stockings in his hand - I searched him, and in the left side of his breast, found a large soup ladle, and in his left-hand waistcoat pocket, I found a silver tea spoon, two knife rests, two purses, and a silver knife, a caddy ladle, and other things, as stated in the indictment - I produce them - on returning to the lodging, Fox gave me a cap and needle case, which had been left on the mantle shelf.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. His evidence is correct; I have nothing to say to him further than I delivered the things up.</p>
               <p>ALLEN CHAMBERLAIN re-examined. Q. Did you propose to him that it would be better to give you information? A. No; after finding the property on him, I asked whose they were, and where he got them, but I neither threatened nor made him any promise, and he voluntarily said at first that it was immaterial to me where he got them - I said it was no matter whether he told me or not; he then said, "Seeing a gate open, I went down an area, and put my foot against a shutter, and shoved it open; I thought there would be a turning into some street which would take me home, but seeing the plate, it looked very tempting, and I took it."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I took the first gateway to be a turning, but when I entered the house I took it to be a house to let, and when I entered the window I clapped my hand on the boots.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRUHN SEWERKROT. I occupy a house, No. 5, <placeName id="t18331017-1-crimeloc3">Muscovy-court, Tower-hill, in the parish of Allhallows, Barking</placeName>

On Sunday morning, the 6th of October, my servant alarmed my son, and I came down stairs into the kitchen, in consequence of what he told me - I found a large piece broken out of the kitchen shutter, which was done with force; the piece of the shutter is here - it was broken so as to enable a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170004"></xptr>person to get in - I lost a pair of boots, those produced are the same; these articles of plate are also mine; this handkerchief does not belong to me - the silver is worth 20l. odd, perhaps it would cost 30l. to buy it new; I am certain it is much above 5l. in value - the knife rests are not silver; the spoons and forks are all silver, and the two ladles, one alone is worth 5l.; the twelve forks are worth 11l.; the eleven tea spoons are worth about 4l.; and two table spoons worth 1l. - they are very heavy; I consider them worth more than 5l. - I had these articles in use previous to the loss - I do not know how the kitchen was left over night - the watchman who ought to have watched my house is here.</p>

On Saturday night, the 5th of October, I left the kitchen about eleven o'clock; the shutters were up and fastened inside with an iron bar, and the place was all safe - the inside shutter of the window was shut, but I do not know whether I shut down the outer sash; but the window shutter was closed with the iron bar - on the following morning I went down at half-past seven, o'clock and found the kitchen light, and half the shutter open and broken, as it is now produced - I went up and gave an alarm; the shutter had been broken, I think, by the strength of his feet; the iron bar was not removed - this plate was in two different parts of the kitchen over night, part of it in the pantry, and part in a cupboard - I lost a silk handkerchief, two purses, a needle case, and a pocket knife - my things are here; they were in my box in the kitchen over night; a pair of old shoes were left behind which did not belong to anybody in the house - a candle appeared to have been lighted; I had left enought fire in the grate to light a candle by.</p>

             (a Juror). The parish is Allhallows, Barking; I know Muscovy-court.</p>
               <p>JOHN REEVE re-examined. I observed the area of this house about twelve o'clock at night, when I went round the court and saw all safe; there is a gate to the court; I locked it after twelve o'clock, and I opened it at five o'clock in the morning to go round to call the half-hour; I left it open to let the lamp-lighter in; I saw nothing of the prisoner - a few minutes before six o'clock, in the morning I saw the prisoner behind the gate inside, and asked what he did there; he said he had just looked in to see a place to sit down in out of the cold; I said, that was not a place to sit down in; he turned about, and went away while I was opening the other half of the gate; not seeing him with anything, I let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ask all the mercy that can be had, as the things are brought back, and it is the first thing I ever did in my life; I am very sorry I have done it; I was rather oppressed in my mind, and if you will look over it, I will never do the like again, and go to the workhouse till I can get work - when I entered, I took the house to be to let, by a paper in the window, which was a broken pane of glass - as I have been so unfortunate as to take the property, I hope you will show me every mercy; I will never do the like any more as long as I live; I deserve punishment I know.</p>

Armstrong knocked at the door, it was opened by the man prisoner; we went in and we told him that we must search his place; we proceeded to search, and in the cupboard in the room, standing in a bag, was these implements of house breaking - three crows, one large one and the other two small ones, two large picklock keys, and five small picklock keys for boxes, and a dark lanthorn; these were found in that cupboard (producing them). In another cupboard we found this file, and another file with it, and in the same cupboard was this piece of putty, with an impression of a key upon it; that putty is used for the purpose when they get hold of a key of a gentleman's door, to take the impression. In the same room we found a silk handkerchief, which the woman prisoner said belonged to her, she said she bought it at some place which she mentioned; this was sworn to by the woman to the best of her belief. This handkerchief we found in a box.</p>

In the same box in the same room was this white handkerchief, it is a man's neck handkerchief, I believe; in the same place was the stockings and the cap belonging, I understand, to the woman. After we had searched the prisoners apartments and brought him to the office, we were then to the house of the prosecutors, me with Armstrong and another officer; we examined the box that were broke open.</p>

               <p>Vickery. The boxes in the front room and in the back room I have no doubt but they were broke open by these tools, we fitted them; this tool has a jagged edge, there is the impression of this tool on the box exactly, this tool was rusty, and on the box the rust was left, and it fitted the impression exactly, it was a strong elm box, it took some force to open it.</p>
               <p>Q. So that comparing the size of the tools with the impression on the box, and the rust that you found on the box, you think it was broken open by that tool. - A. Yes, and this other has a notch, a jagged edge, there is the mark of that jagged edge on the box. One of the boxes in this room is a stout deal box, it is painted, it had been broken open; that box belonged to

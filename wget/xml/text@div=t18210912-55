On Monday, the 30th of July, about the middle of the day, the prisoner came to our shop, and produced the duplicate of a coat and waistcoat, which were pawned for 24 s., in the name of Turvey. I gave him them, and he tendered me a 5 l. note. I took 24 s. 5 d., and said</p>

               <p>"The name on the ticket is Turvey, is that the name I am to put on the note?" he said Yes; I then asked for his direction, he said "No. 7, Shire-lane." I wrote that on the note in his presence; (looks at one) this is the note. I think he came again on the 3d of August, to pawn a telescope. On the 16th of August, Van and Mance brought him to our shop, and asked if I knew him; I said, Yes; that is the man, who paid me the note for the coat and waistcoat, but he was not the man who took the watch out - they took him away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was he in the shop when he redeemed the coat and waistcoat - A. Perhaps not five minutes. I have no doubt of his being the person. I had seen him frequently at the shop before, pawning and redeeming things. I knew him perfectly well, before he redeemed these. I knew him by the name of Fidler - it is very common for persons who pledge, to use fictitious names. When I asked him if I was to put Turvey on the note, I thought he was taking it out for another person, I said,</p>
               <p>"What is your address." I cannot tell whether he pawned the coat and waistcoat.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Thursday, the 16th of August, I and Mance apprehended the prisoner at a coffee-shop in Shire-lane, playing at cards. I asked his name, he said Fidler. I told him who we were, and that we took him on suspicion of uttering a 5 l. forged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120027"></xptr>note to Mr. Wassell, of Picket-street. He denied all knowledge of the place, or knowing any thing about it. He said he never had a 5 l. note, good or bad, in his possession in his life; he said, he lived in Tower-street, over the water, that he had lived there nearly a month, and had been in the country, purchasing fancy birds, which was the way he got his living. We took him to Wassell's, and the last witness identified him as the man. In going to the office, he said, I was mistaken in him - he was not the person, but that he knew the person who passed it at Wassell's, his name was Turvey, who was then in custody. I afterwards went to No. 7, Little, and No. 7, Great Shire-lane; I could find only one No. 7, in each. I could learn nothing of him there - the coffee-shop is No. 12.</p>

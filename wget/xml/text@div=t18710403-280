                  </hi>. I am a cook, of 2, Rutland Place, Charterhouse Square—on Saturday evening, 25th March, at a few minutes to 6 o'clock, I was in Cunitor Street—I had a little leather bag or reticule in my hand, containing a pair of boots, and other things, worth altogether about 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw the prisoner first in Chancery Lane, and afterwards in Cunitor Street—he snatched my bag, and ran away down a court into Bream's Buildings—I shouted for someone to go after him—no one ran—I looked for a policeman, but could not find one—I afterwards went to Bow Street, and gave informa<lb></lb>tion and a description of the prisoner—I afterwards went to Bow Street, and picked the prisoner out of six others.</p>

I am the wife of Henry White, a painter, of 24, Castle Street, Holborn—on this Saturday night I was coming out of my house into Cursitor Street, just before 6 o'clock, and saw the prisoner go down the court by the "Rose" public-house, with a leather bag or reticule in his hand—I saw the prosecutrix, and heard her scream out.</p>

Last Monday week I saw the prisoner brought out of the cells of Bow Street—I recognized him and told him he was wanted for stealing a bag in Cursitor Street on the Satur<lb></lb>day night—the prisoner was put back into the cells for half an hour, when he was brought out to be taken over to the Police Court by two constables—he snatched his right hand from one of them and threw over his shoulder these two pieces of paper, which I produce; one of his companions picked up one piece, but I snatched it from him, the other I picked up myself—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "On Saturday you know that I was in your shop from 2 till 8 o'clock. I was not drunk nor drinking.

                  </hi>. I am deputy clerk of the peace for Westminster. Oh Thursday, 13th Sept. last, I was at the adjourned Sessions for Middlesex, holden at Westminster—Mr. Bodkin presided on that occasion—a person, named William Lee was tried—I produce a certificate of the conviction, and also the original indictment found by the Grand Jury—(<hi rend="italic">the indictment was for stealing a pocket book</hi>, 1152., <hi rend="italic">and a cheque for</hi> 122. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">of William Horwell, from his person; and the certificate staled the conviction of the said William Lee, upon his own confession of the said offence, and thai he was sen<lb></lb>tenced to six years penal servitude</hi>) when Lee was arraigned he, in the first instance, pleaded not guilty; that plea was afterwards withdrawn, and he pleaded guilty—here is an entry in the indictment, which means not guilty, and <hi rend="italic">retracts</hi>, for retracts and confesses—while that plea of guilty was upon the record, an application was made by counsel on Lee's behalf, that certain property found on his person should be given up to one of his rela<lb></lb>tives—as an inducement, I presume, to the Court to give that request a favourable consideration, Mr. Parry, who was his counsel, stated that he was in a position to show that Lee had borne an irreproachable character, and that this was his first offence—the Judge said that as the prisoner had pleaded guilty, of course he could not entertain the application of giving up any portion of property—then for the purpose of enabling the Judge to inquire into the circumstances, the prisoner was directed to withdraw his plea of guilty, and the plea then remained as it originally stood—it was expressly understood that that was only for the purpose of enabling the Court to inquire into the merits of the case as to whether the property was any portion of the robbery—witnesses to character were then called and examined—the first witness was Michael James Newsham—he was sworn and examined—Samuel Shervill was then called, sworn, and examined—he stated that he had known Lee for about seven years, that he had known him at No. 10, Lucas-street, Commercial-road; that he had had repeated transactions with him, business transactions—when asked what Lee was, he said that he was a general dealer, and that he (Shervill) was a silk and shawl dresser, living at New Inn-yard, Shoreditch.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170020"></xptr>
               <p>but which of the two I am not sure—I am almost satisfied that he said No. 3, Lee-street, Dalston, and that he had known him there for the last two or three years—Shervill was then recalled, and asked the question at which place he had known him last, and he confirmed the evidence of Groves—I am sure he mentioned the same place that Groves had stated—I am perfectly satisfied of that, and I believe it was Lee-street—Groves also gave Lee an exemplary character—we have no short hand writer to our Court—there are reporters attending, but no official short hand writer—I remember the evidence that Newsham gave—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>

               <p>far my being positive of the fact now, has any bias upon my recollection—there is no alteration in him, only the day I taw him his hair looked exceedingly grey—I do not think there had been any effort made to change his appearance, I thought so at the time—he having told, me that he was the person that gave evidence on 13th Sept., I stated that the inquiries that had been made, had proved that the evidence he had given was not true—he stated that the evidence he had given wag true—I told him that 1 had been instructed to take proceedings against him—I had previously obtained a warrant for his apprehension, and had an officer with me—there was a large quantity of silk on the loom, and he requested that he might be allowed to put that in proper order before, he was taken away, that it might not be spoiled—I think it was silk being dyed, not on the, loom, but on the dresser—while he was removing it, we talked about his knowledge of Lee—he stated that it was very hard that a man's liberty should be invaded in that way when he had only spoken the truth, and he told me that he had had business with Lee seven years previously, and no doubt his books would show his name, that he knew nothing move of him but that Lee's sister had called on him some few days before the trial, and asked him to give him-a character—I said, "If you have not seen him for the last seven years, they might have found some person that might have given better evidence as to character"—he did not give any direct answer to that—he said he had seen him but once, and that was seven years ago—what I took down was this, be only had business with him once, and that was seven years ago, and no doubt Lee's name would appear on his books—he was then taken into custody.</p>

               <p>with them, and I brought him his notes, and he perused them in my heating and presence—he read them over—it was only upon one point that my recollection required any refreshing, and that was, at which of the two resi<lb></lb>dences Grove said he had known Lee—when this matter first commended I was attending to other business—Sherrill stated that he had known him in Lee-street last—that is my impression—my recollection is, that he said he had known him originally in Lucas-street, and ultimately in Lee-street—I can only pledge my oath to my recollection—it is possible that he might have said he knew him first in Lee-street, but my recollection leads me the other way—he did not say that Lee came to him to dress silks for him—he said he had dressed silks for him—he was examined by the Court as to these facts—something was said about Lee's sister.</p>

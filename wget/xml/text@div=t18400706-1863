                  </hi>. On the 24th of May I was in the King's Head public-house, in Orchard-street, Westminster—there was a fight, a man struck me—I felt my watch going out of my pocket—I saw a man in a brown coat going from me—I called out, "My watch, my watch!"—a witness said it was all right, that he saw a man take it, and give it to the prisoner; and when the fight was done, I asked the prisoner—he said he had not got it, and was going to turn us out—I have not seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the tap-room—I saw the prosecutor and another man fighting, the prosecutor threw the man down, and was on the top of him, and several of them turned him under—I saw a man in a brown coat draw the watch out of the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to Woolf, I am sure of that—a man was kneeling on the prosecu<lb></lb>tor at the time—I went to Woolf, and asked for the watch—he said it was all right—the prosecutor was crying for his watch—I said it was all right, I knew where it was—he said, "Very well," now he would fight him, and the prisoner laid hold of him and turned him out—I went to him, and asked if he would give the prosecutor the watch—he said, "What do I know about the watch?"—I got a policeman and gave him in charge—there were plenty of people to have carried it off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On that Sunday evening I went into this house, which a widow keeps—she came to me, and said why did I not stop the fighting, and then I parted them; this man pulled off his coat, and said, Come on;" this man was underneath, and I took the other off; then the witness came to me, and said, would I give the watch up—I said I had</p>

               <p>not had any watch. He went out, and fetched two policemen; I never was out of the house; and when the policeman came, he said he wanted me, on suspicion of a man's watch. I said I knew nothing of it, he might search me. The prosecutor said at the office that he was offered a watch or a sovereign if he would not come against me. Dawney has been fully committed at Westminster Sessions.</p>

                  </hi>. I formerly lived at Ballycale; I now live at Fen<lb></lb>more, in Wexford county. In the month of Sept., 1850, I was at Ballycale; in May, 1851, I was in the farm of Kilmory—I did not at that time rent a farm of Mr. Hamilton; I was steward to him—I was never in London in my life till I came up as a witness on this transaction—in Sept., 1850, I saw Mr. Nash on my own land, at Ballycale—he told me he had come on business of the rail<lb></lb>way, to obtain proxy votes, and he asked me to sign a proxy paper—he said it was for some meeting that was to ensue soon afterwards—he said it was in Captain Owen and Lord Courtown's interest—I had received 196 shares in the Waterford, Wexford, and Wicklow Railway Company, from Captain Owen—I told him I should not wish to sign the paper without letting Captain Owen know—he ridiculed me for my fears with regard to hesitating to sign the paper—after some more solicitation, I signed the paper.</p>

Owen I had signed a paper for Mr. Nash, and he said I did wrong—since signing that paper I have voted in this company; I voted in Captain Owen's interest, and for Lord Courtown; I voted as they wished me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ballycale, in the county of Wexford—I am a farmer there—the last witness is my son—I remember in Sep. 1850, a man calling himself Nash or Mr. Nash coming and speaking to my son—I think the prisoner is the man—he appears to me rather darker now than he did then—I think be appeared rather more lively, and brighter then—he was on my land—I and my son were coming out from an out farm I had at my house, and we met this man calling himself Nash, or Mr. Nash, and he said, "Are you Hanstock, or Mr. Hanstock?"—I said, I was, and then he spoke some<lb></lb>thing about the railroad or railway—I told him I had nothing to do with it, It was my son—my son was just coming up behind me, and he spoke to ray son about it—I heard something about what he said—he spoke to him about signing a paper—I saw my son sign a paper—I noticed the paper—this is not the paper he signed (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—there was not near so much writing on the paper I saw, to the best of my opinion—I saw some of it, but whether it was printing or writing, or both, I do not know—there were no seals on the paper—there was no red ink in my house—I was not in the habit of getting red ink at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you produce this document (<hi rend="italic">the one alleged to be forged</hi>) from your office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do; I received it on 16th Aug., 1851—I know Nash's handwrit<lb></lb>ing—I believe this to be his writing—the body of it appears to be his; it is the same handwriting as the rest—the attestation I believe to be his, and the date, the 31st May—the date of the stamp is 6th June, 1851.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this other document (<hi rend="italic">a notice to register</hi>); in whose hand-writing is this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know the writing of the body of the paper—it bears Mr. Nash's signature, which I believe is his writing. (<hi rend="italic">The transfer being read, was a transfer by Peter Hanstock to Edward Pearce, of Chester-street, Greenwich, for the consideration of the sum of</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">of 196 shares of</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, in the Waterford, Wexford, and Wicklow Railway Company, subject to the conditions on which he held the same; Edward Pearce agreeing to accept the same; signed, Peter Hanstock and Edward Pearce, in the presence of Charles Nash, 2, Parliament-street, 31st May, and attested in Parliament-street, London. The notice to register the shares was also read, dated Westminster, Nov. 7, 1851, and signed, "C Nash, for Edward Pearce and self;" to which were appended a number of names, among which was "Edward Pearce," and "Han<lb></lb>stock to ditto."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I believe Pearce has never been registered as a proprietor under this supposed transfer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; two of those names are registered, but not for Hanstock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you were the manager of this railway company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am clerk or book keeper—I have been so some years—the company never had an office to itself, it had a room—it has the run of a house, not quite so much room as it had—I have known Mr. Nash some years—he was clerk to Swaine and Stevens, the solicitors for the Great Western Railway—as far as I know he was an active and zealous officer—I had not much to do with him—he left Swaine, Stevens, and Co.—I do not know that he was subsequently engaged in opposition to them in the battle of the gauges—he has been for some time engaged in litigation with the three W.'s Railway—he has been acting for a great many shareholders in that railway, and many of them large ones—I believe the object of certain shareholders was to drive the directors to wind up the company—he has acted as a Parliamentary agent—the matter of winding up the company has been considered—I do not know that the directors agreed to it—I do not know as a positive fact that Messrs. Hunt consented that if a requisition</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202230067"></xptr>
               <p>was signed by a sufficient number of shareholders, they would wind up the company—I believe that was the case—that afterwards was not carried out—in Sept., 1850, the shares in that company were not marketable—I am not aware that a great number of persons transferred their shares to paupers—the prisoner sent me a number of transfers, over a period of two or three months—only two of them were registered out of a number of about thirty—no shares can be transferred without the numbers of the shares being given—I decline to register them unless they are complete, and they are not complete without the numbers—that was one of my objections, and the objections to some were the difference between the great period which had elapsed between the period of the execution and the date of the stamp—Mr. Nash told me he would get them re-executed if I wished it—I do not recollect that he told me that he took blank transfers in many cases, and afterwards filled them up—I cannot tell that that was the fact; I might have my own suppositions—a transfer is brought to me, and I then look whether I consider it regular or irregular; if I consider it irregular, I refer it to the solicitor, which I did in the case of all that I received from Mr. Nash.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember having a conversation with him, and saying, "These are dated, attested by you in 1851, and you were in London at that time," and his saying, "No, I took them when I was in Ireland in 1850?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think I do, but that does not apply to all—I believe I pointed out the discrepancy—I do not remember his saying that the people gave them to him in blank to fill up afterwards—I remember his applying to me for the numbers that he might apply to parties on the subject—in many cases I refused to give him the numbers—I think I gave him the numbers in one or two cases on written authorities, and refused them in others—the cost of a transfer depends upon circumstances—the registration-fee is half-a-crown, and the other is regulated by the amount of consideration—I have not got the book of the minutes of proceedings here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe Mr. Nash has continued attending the meetings, and acting on behalf of certain shareholders, down to the time he was apprehended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has not been at the two last meetings I think, in Aug. and the pre<lb></lb>vious Feb.—there is an action pending which he figures in; but whether he is solicitor or not, I do not know—I cannot say I know that there are several actions promoted by him at the present moment; he is not a solicitor—a recent Chancery suit has been crushed, in which he was in some way concerned—I cannot of my own positive knowledge tell you whether he was the plaintiff in it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">considered the register book admissable, and that it was only necessary to prove that Hanstock's name appeared in it, not to prove his title; with respect to the intent to defraud, he was of opinion, as he had before had occasion to hold (see page 426), that a man, in putting off a forged instrument must, as a necessary consequence of his act, be taken to intend to defraud; but although it was not necessary to fix upon any specific individual, he was inclined to think there must be some person who could be defrauded. The points however would be reserved if it became necessary.</hi>

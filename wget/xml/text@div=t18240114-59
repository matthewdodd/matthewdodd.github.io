On the 18th of December, at half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I missed all this property from a bed-room on the third floor. A coachman lodged in the room, he had taken it furnished for a week. Some property was in boxes, and some in drawers. I lost nothing of my own except the sheets and bed-furniture, which was in the box the day before. I found the property at the office that evening.</p>

            . I went with Lee, and found the prisoners Sheen and Stevens in the first floor front room - the door was open - a large bundle laid on the table, the curtains and two sheets hung outside it. I secured the prisoners, and asked who belonged to the room; one of them said,</p>
               <p>"We do." They said a young man brought the bundle there, and they did not know who he was. I said that was very extraordinary. They said they did not know who the man was - that he brought it up, and asked to leave it there. Mrs. Stanton came into the room while I was questioning them, and immediately went out again. Stanton occupied the parlour only.</p>

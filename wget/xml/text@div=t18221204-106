The prisoner lived in the same house, and slept in the garret with my father and brother; I sleep below. On the 10th of October my brother went up to bed a few minutes after the prisoner, and about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning I heard somebody coming down stairs and go into the kitchen. (I had seen the hat on the kitchen shelf after they went to bed.) I heard a person come from the kitchen, and unfasten the street door. I jumped out of bed, went into the passage, and saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm; he pulled the door in my face, and went off. I partly dressed and followed him in six or seven minutes, but could not find him. I returned, and missed a blue and a black coat from the garret, which I had left there at ten o'clock at night; one was under his bed, and I had seen him put the other in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Every thing was in the room except what you missed - A. Yes. I never saw any clothes of his, except what he wore. Only one man worked there besides him at that time, and he went home at eight. Three persons besides the prisoner slept there.</p>
               <p>JOHN MEEK. I am the last witness's brother. The prisoner slept with me. I saw one coat which the prisoner had been at work upon that night; it was my brother William's. I went out in the morning after the prisoner, without knowing of the robbery, and did not see him again till the 30th of November, when I accidentally saw the prisoner at a public-house at dinner; he got up and wished me to go out and speak with him; I went out; he first asked me if we had not received a letter from him about the articles; I said No. He said he had written to my brother to meet him to make it up; that he had pawned the articles, and left the duplicates with a friend at Hoxton. We returned to the public-house; he said he would go with me to where the duplicates were, but he gave me the slip and ran out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there not articles in the room of his - A. Nothing, to my knowledge; he was three weeks there.</p>

             re-examined. He left his old hat behind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the coats finished which he took - A. He was at work at one all day, which was not quite finished, but it was a perfect coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Defence. I left a man at work there on the previous evening, with my two shirts, which I told Meek's wife to wash. He employs women and men at work, all on the same floor. I left the coat in the room. I had seen a person who had been at work in the morning right opposite the house. I always arose before the rest of the work people, and generally went into the back kitchen to wash. I went to look for better work, and engaged with one Ragnull. I met a person a fortnight after, who told me of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JURY to MEEK. Q. Had you paid him for making the coat - A. It was not finished. I paid him something in advance. I expected him to go on with the work.</p>

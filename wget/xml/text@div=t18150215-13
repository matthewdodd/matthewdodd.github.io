On Monday night, the 23rd of January, it was not on the 25th, I saw the prisoner standing by the prosecutor's door; I walked a little way, about four or five yards, and turned round, I saw a mob, I enquired what was the matter, I was told, I asked the prosecutor if he should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150010"></xptr>know the man that came into his shop. I took the prosecutor into a public-house close by to see if he knew the man that came into his shop; the prosecutor pointed out the prisoner to me in the public-house; I took him back to the shop; Mrs. Hoare said he was the man.</p>

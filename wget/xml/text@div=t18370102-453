                  </hi>. I live in Furnival's Inn-court, Holborn, and am a widow. About twelve o'clock on Saturday night I was coming to my lodgings in North-street, Finsbury, and met the prisoner—she said, "Come old girl, will you give me something to drink?"—I went to lower White-cross</p>

               <p>street, and called for a quartern of mm and shrub, and treated her—I put some flour which I had, on the counter while I paid for the spirits—the bag burst, and the prisoner asked me to give her a handkerchief to tie it up—I had never seen her before—she kept the flour—I had not drunk much—I had only had one glass of port wine with my brother before I saw her—when I came out of the public-house I felt quite in<lb></lb>toxicated—I had rather more than a glass of spirits—after we got about twenty yards from the public-house she snatched the shawl from my shoulder, and the bag from my arm—she was quite sober—I called out 'Police,' and the watchman came up—we could not find the shawl that night—this is it—I did not give it to her, nor the bag.</p>

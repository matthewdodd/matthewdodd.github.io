                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Roberts and Son, of 95, Great Portland-street—in February this year we had an account with the Clergy House—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was not written by me, or by my authority; it is the prisoner's writing—I did not receive 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England—I used to live at 10, Portland-road—the prisoner was in the employment of myself, and other clergymen who resided there, as a sort of confidential servant—it was part of his duty to receive money from me and the other clergymen to pay the trades people—he had a salary of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, besides perquisites—his wife was employed as housekeeper—the Clergy House dealt with Roberts and Son as grocers—early in February this year the prisoner made a communication to me about the amount due to them, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the trades people, inclusive of Roberts and Son—he afterwards, subse<lb></lb>quent to 6th February, brought me this receipt—I can't remember whether he put it into my hand or not—it was pinned to another receipt, which I may have found on my table, and put on the file—he was given into custody in August, and his wife also—I then produced this paper to him, and asked if it was his writing—he said it was—I said, "Then it is a forgery," or something equivalent to that—he said nothing, but went out of the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He and his wife were the housekeepers in this esta<lb></lb>blishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were—they furnished a part of the house for their occupation—we did not require them to do that; they did it for their own comfort, and on their own responsibility—we paid the servant's wages through them—we did not find the servant in food; she was supposed to get that at home; she only came for about two hours a day; that was the arrangement with the prisoner—for some reason or other he was in arrears with the</p>

               <p>tradespeople—they did not supply the things in his name—he entered into an arrangement with me to pay off 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month out of his salary of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that arrangement was made previous to the 6th February—the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given him as part of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was expected to pay up the arrears as far as the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would go—it mattered not to me to whom he repaid it, so long as he reduced the arrears—during the time he was to pay off these arrears, we did not under<lb></lb>take the payment of the servant's wages—we made no allowance to them in respect of the servant's maintenance—no different arrangement to the pre<lb></lb>vious one—I had possession of the ordinary trades people's receipts—this receipt, and one or two others, were pinned together at the time he showed them to me—the others are in the possession of the clergy—they were the usual receipts given in the usual way, and signed in the usual way—since 6th February, the prisoner certainly paid more than 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the arrear account—I am not aware what was owing when he was taken into custody—I am positive I told the prisoner the receipt was a forgery—I either said it was a forgery, or "You forged this"—I did not give him into custody on this charge until after some other inquiries had been made—in February, at the time of the discovery of his defalcation, we took possession of two cheques for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the understanding that they should not be made use of until we had further permission—those cheques were held by us as a col<lb></lb>lateral security for the arrears—since he has been in custody we have got the money for them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain what is meant by the arrears? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some months before we had paid to the prisoner certain sums with which he was expected to discharge our tradesmen's bills, we subsequently found that they had not been discharged, in consequence of which we had the pri<lb></lb>soner and his wife before us, and felt determined to deal summarily with them, but at their earnest entreaty and explanation of the circumstances, we leaned to the side of mercy, and allowed them to continue with us on the terms which have been alluded to, that he should pay 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of his salary of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month to clear his defalcations—it was on another charge that he was taken into custody—the amount of his defalcations in February was about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk to an attorney—I live at Haggerstone. On Saturday morning, the 5th of May, about ten o'clock, I was called into a field of mine at Haggerstone, and saw the deceased and the prisoner—the deceased was on the ground, endeavouring to get up—he got up, and fell down again from intoxication—I said I should give them in charge unless they immediately left the field—they were both stripped to fight—they were going to dress, and the deceased fell again from intoxication, and in about five minutes one of my men endeavoured to dress them, and they went towards the entrance of the field—I heard somebody say "Go it," and turned round and saw Driver reeling from the effects of a blow he must have had from Abbot—I went and parted them—they shook hands, and agreed to go home—I saw no blow struck.</p>

On Saturday, the 5th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was passing by Ravenscroft-street, and saw the deceased lying on the pathway in a stupid state, as if he was in a fit—at all events there was a great pressure on the brain—I advised that he should be bled—indeed I would have bled him then, but nobody would assist me with what was necessary—about twelve people were round him—I was called to see him at his own residence the next morning, and bled him—he was then in an almost sinking state—I took about ten or twelve ounces of blood from him—I called again in two hours, and he had just died—I remember seeing a bruise under his cheek, which I thought was the effect of a blow, but I cannot say so—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the Monday afternoon—the vessels of the brain were considerably distended with blood, and there were very considerable traces of previous disease in the brain, of rather old</p>

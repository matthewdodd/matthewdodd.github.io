                  </hi>. I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 26th of July, about six o'clock in the afternoon, I was in company with James Ledger—there was a crowd at the hustings in Covent-garden Market—I saw the two prisoners together—I watched them, and saw Ansley take a hand kerchief from a gentleman's left-hand pocket—I do not know who he was—Jones was close to him, covering him—when Ansley had drawn the handkerchief, he gave it to Jones, who put it under his jacket, and I laid hold of one in one hand, and the other in the other—in a moment there was a great crowd, and I was glad to get out of it with the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 17 Palace-street, I am a house-painter and constable.

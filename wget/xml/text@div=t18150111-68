               <p>EDWARD JOHN BOWYER. I am eleven years old last Wednesday. I live with Mr. Govet; he sent me on the 25th of November, about five o'clock, to the Hall, to fetch twenty-six silver watch cases, and eighteen boxes; they gave them me at the Hall, and as I was coming home to my master's house. in <placeName id="t18150111-68-crimeloc392">ironmonger-row</placeName>

I am sure Kelly was the person that held me; he was not the man that took them from me. I have not seen the man again that took them from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge. I know nothing of it; I was at work at my father's at the time the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bowyer. Did he strike you - A. No, Sir, he held me by my shoulders while another person took them from me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

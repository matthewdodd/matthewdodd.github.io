I saw the prisoner there when I went in - I knew him before - I had no conversation with him; two other men were drinking there with him - the prisoner kicked up a row with my friend. I prevented their fighting, and he gave me a violent blow on the head, got me against the wall, got his head in my stomach, and at the same time drew my watch from me - I could not make resistance - I was down in the corner; my wife went to the door to call Watch!</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ill-using you at that time? A. Yes - he gave me a violent blow, in fact we were fighting - he went away. I have not found my watch - the officer did not know of it for about nine days.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We were drinking there - he came and struck me first. Witness. I did not, he was quarrelling with Gillagan.</p>

I saw the prisoner come out with the watch and chain - I could swear to the chain. I begged of him not to rob me; he gave me a push against the wall, and ran off - I cannot exactly say which way, as I was confused with the blow.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received a description of the prisoner, and took him twelve days after the robbery, on the Sunday fortnight. I told him it was for a piece of work in a public-house, and then said it was for robbing a man of his watch; he said he had not been in the house at all - I took him to the watch-house. I put him with a number of other prisoners, and took the prosecutor there - he clapped his hand on his shoulder, and said "This is the man;" and wanted to know where the property was - the prisoner said, "If I tell you, you will prosecute me all the same;" he then said, if I went to his father's, I should hear of the watch - I went there, but his father denied it; a man was charged with being with him, but there was nothing against him. The prosecutor told me of the robbery on the same night, but I could not find the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Berwick-street, and was called; the prisoner was coming out at the door. I seized him, and asked if he was the man; the landlord came up to me, and said "Come and clear the house." I let him go to clear the house - the watch had not been named at that time. I saw Mrs. Cormack, but she did not tell me of it till I had let the prisoner go. I then cleared the house.</p>

I take the money out of my till every evening, which I put into my desk, in the counting-house, and lock it; the counting-house is partitioned from the shop; on the 31st of January, I put 3l. 10s. 6d. into my desk - on the following night I put some more money in - and on the 2d of February, I put 2l. 1s. 6d., in sixpences and shillings, which a neighbour of mine had marked; the next morning, between six and seven o'clock, I went to a cupboard at the corner of the counting house, (I had made a hole to look through into the counting-house), and saw the prisoner come in there with a light to light the fire; she put the light on the table, and went to the fire-place and listened, as if to hear where the shopmen were - she then went towards the desk, and I heard a noise as if a key was going into the lock of it, but I could not see it, as it was behind the door - I then heard some silver chink - my wife came down, and I sent for the officer, who took her, and found two shillings and two sixpences, which had been marked the night before - I believe this is her first offence, and I would willingly pay her expenses back to her mother.</p>

I went to the house and took the prisoner - I told her she had been robbing her master's desk - she said she had not; I asked where her pockets were - she said, "Below;" I then put my hand down her side, and found she had a pocket on, in which I found 5s., and this marked money was among it - she said she had not opened the desk, but had taken the silver out with a knife, and shewed me how she did it, by putting the knife under the lid.</p>

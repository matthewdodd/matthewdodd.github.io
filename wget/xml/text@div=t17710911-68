               <p>Q. Did you see her face, so as to remember it?</p>
               <p>Melone. Yes; I think I could swear to it; afterwards, while the deceased and I were in the room, the door was shut fast upon us; the deceased gave it a shake, but could not get it open, with that, he lifted up the sash, and got out at the window, on the green; being fastened in, I gave the door a shake, and it came open.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not quite sober?</p>
               <p>Melone. I was not, I walked down stairs and stood along with Brackstone; she rapped out a wicked oath, what it was, I cannot say; that the first man that broke the door open, she would knock his brains out with a poker.</p>
               <p>Q. What door did she mean?</p>
               <p>Melone. The door of the lower apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. That lower apartment you understood to be her's?</p>
               <p>Melone. I do not know, she was in the room at the time when she swore this oath; she took the poker out of the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the outer door of the house open?</p>

I do not know whether he found it open, but I believe it was opened for him to go out; the deceased stept within the threshold of the door, and she struck him over the scull with the poker; he cried out murder, and dropped on the outside of the threshold.</p>
               <p>Q. With which end of the poker did she strike him?</p>
               <p>Melone. I believe on the upper end; this was between four and five, or six, in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open or shut?</p>
               <p>Melone. It was shut; the door of the lower room, I mean; he was endeavouring to come into the room where Brackstone was, because he thought the man was in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon that Brackstone hit him over the head with the poker?</p>
               <p>Melone. She said the first that entered the room, she would split his scull with the poker; the deceased having his foot within the threshold, she hit him with the poker.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she her clothes on?</p>

He left the hospital without leave; that in about ten days he returned and begged to be admitted again; that he was then very bad, and had a high fever upon him; that he could not pretend to determine whether his death was occasioned by the blow, or his irregular way of living; that he believed if the deceased had staid in the hospital and followed the directions of the surgeons, it was probable he might have recovered; that upon examining the body after his death, he found a fissure on the skull, and the pericraneum which immediately covers the skull was quite detached from it; that the fissure did not go through both rables, but was very slight; that by taking off the top of the skull, he found immediately under the fissure a large collection of matter; that the dura mater and the brain were very much inflamed; that it was impossible for any person to say positively, but that it was his opinion he might have recovered."</p>

             very well; he was in the London Hospital after the time he received this blow; after he came mirthere he lived, very drunken life, ranting, roaring and lying in the street, all night long. I lay with him in the streets two nights at peoples doors, down Black Horse Yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let him do this when he was in this way?</p>
               <p>Davis. I could not prevail with him to go home; the first night I lit of him; I came up from Woolwich; he seemed very much in liquor, and he desired me to go along with him; we went down to one Mr. Whitting's, there we had two or three pots of beer, I cannot say justly; then we came up Gravel Lane, to the sign of the Swan and Rummer, there we had some bread and cheese, some salmon, and some more beer; after that I followed him and brought him in again; he wanted to get him down to Black Horse Yard; I wanted to get him home to Mr. Seamore's; I brought him in, he fainted away three or four times in my arms; all his cry was, oh, my girl, my girl. I could not prevail on him to go home to Mr. Seymoor's; he went into an alehouse and wanted to fight; he went and knocked at a door in Black Horse Yard; they would not let him in, so he laid down upon the stones at the door; I endeavoured to awake him, but I could not, so I laid down with him. He lived in a very irregular manner for six or seven days. He was seen to drink seventeen half quarterns of gin in two hours.</p>

             deposed that he saw the deceased run out of doors in a great rage, that after that, he saw the deceased force Brackstone's doors open with his hands, that in a few minutes the deceased came out with his head bleeding."</p>
               <p>- Baxter. I am the person that was a bed with Cole; the deceased came and beat me and made my eye bleed. I went into Brackstone's room and laid down upon her bed;

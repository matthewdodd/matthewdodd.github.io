The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 27th of August, and slept in my bed. On Sunday, the 4th of September, I went to dine with a friend, leaving her at home. She said she was not going out all day. I returned about half-past eight o'clock in the evening - she was out; I could not get into the room; I got another key, opened my door, and found all the best of my clothes gone; I missed a silver watch, capped, four silver teaspoons, four gowns, five shawls, two shifts, two aprons and a handkerchief; the key of the street door was also taken - I had left my watch and spoons in a drawer, and my clothes in a trunk. I am sure all were safe when I went out. The prisoner is a <rs id="t18260511-6-deflabel37" type="occupation">shoe-binder</rs>

I saw her at the Grapes public-house, on Monday, and asked her if she had sold the watch, as it was my husband's, and I set great value on it; she said, No, it was pawned, and if I would forgive her she would tell me where all my things were, but I said nothing to induce her to confess; she said she was very sorry, and had not had a week's happiness since; she would not tell me where the things were; I have recovered nothing. I found the key of my room inside a carpet, which was folded up in the passage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did we not always put the key in that carpet for one another? A. Yes; but we used not to fold it in the carpet. I do not think I went out but once while she was with me - I do not know where I put the key then.</p>

            . I live in Princes-street, Drury-lane. On the 17th of April I saw the prisoner at the Grapes, next door to Bow-street Office, in custody; I was leaning over the table, and saw her take hold of Mrs. Hanson's hand, and say, "If you will forgive me I will tell you where the watch and spoons are - I meant to return them to you in a twelve-month, knowing them to be your husband's;" Mrs. Hanson asked her what she had done with the other things; she said she would say nothing about them, only to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you hear me say any thing to her? A. Yes; the officer called to Mrs. Hanson to tell her to hold her out no promise.</p>
               <p>ANN HANSON. The prisoner told me what West has said - she sat close to me, and must have heard it, and said she heard it. I am a widow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You know nothing passed but what was in a whisper - you said if I would tell you what was done with the things you would stand my friend. Witness. Nothing of the sort - she was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I lodged with the prosecutrix for a short time, and after I left her she, through spite, charged me with robbing her, and taking feathers out of the bed, and at the third examination brought a young woman to swear that I begged forgiveness - nobody could hear what passed between us - it was whispered; what she has said is quite false; any one could have access to her room; the key was always left in the carpet.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The reason I left on Sunday was, because my husband is in the habit of drinking, and we did not agree - he would have come there and demanded me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hill, and live in Broad-street. About half-past four o'clock in the evening of the 18th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, I went to purchase a powder for my baby at a chemist's shop in Wardour-street—I had a bonnet in a handkerchief—I sat at the counter with my baby—the prisoner was sitting in the shop apparently very ill—I came out and forgot my bonnet—I went back immediately I missed it, and asked the man for it—he said, "The person you saw so ill has taken it, I did not know but it was her own"—I am sure the prisoner is the person who was in the shop—this is my bonnet and handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at them</hi>)—a person afterwards met me and gave me the handkerchief <hi rend="smallCaps">ELIZABETH BODMER</hi>. I was standing at the door in Green's-court, and saw the prisoner come down the court with the bonnet and handkerchief, at near five o'clock—she went into the passage of a house with it—a few people came up the court, and said there were two policemen looking for her—I directed them where she had gone—she was intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to Green's-court about half-past four o'clock on the 8th of September, and found the bonnet in the passage—I searched three houses for the prisoner, as there is a com<lb></lb>munication between three houses there, but did not find her or the hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I found her in custody next morning.</p>

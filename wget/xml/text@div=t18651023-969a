                  </hi>. I am clerk to George Maddock, of 162, Fleet-street, the proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Builders' Journal</hi>—the prisoner had been in his employ about six months, as canvasser for advertisements for that journal and for the <hi rend="italic">English Mechanic</hi>—since 8th July I have paid him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent on the amount of orders he brought in—he was supplied with printed forms to solicit orders—the form, No. 1, is part of one of our forms—I had paid him every Saturday, but previous to 8th July he received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent commission, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week salary—he received his 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, on this order—on 21st June, he brought me this order for 13 insertions in the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>—it is signed, "George Mitchell, 166, Brompton-road"—at the end of the week I paid him his per centage upon that, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and his salary, amounting altogether to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believed that it was a true bond fide order from Mr. Mitchell, and inserted the advertisements in the paper—the pri<lb></lb>soner brought me on 14th September another request for 13 advertise<lb></lb>ments, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a head, signed, "James Maybank"—I paid the prisoner 20 per cent. on that on the new arrangement of 8th July—I parted with the money on the belief that the order was genuine, and inserted part of the advertisements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know anything of the custom of the canvassing trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have received a quantity of similar orders from the prisoner since these, but do not know about any before—there was nothing that struck me as peculiar about this order—I have never known canvassers" fill up the orders themselves—I have canvassed for advertisements occasionally—if I find the master of the shop engaged I call again—I should take a form—if I found him busily engaged with a customer, and he raid, "You may insert my advertisement 13 times," I might fill in the number, but I should not sign the name and address—this purports to be the autograph of the man ordering the advertisement—it is not allowable for that to be filled up by the canvasser himself—I should never have called this in question if the advertisements had been paid for—advertise<lb></lb>ments have been paid for when a man has given a verbal order, but it is not usual—canvassers are very assiduous, but I do not think they would take half an answer for a whole one—I believe this "George Mitchell" to be in the prisoner's writing—I have seen him write.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COUR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> is it his ordinary writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so, I do not know that there is any disguise in it—it is more like his than Mr. Mitchell 's—it is very similar to the prisoner's ordinary writing, but not exactly like it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mason, of 166, Brompton-road—I know the prisoner—I never gave him orders to insert any advertisement in the Builders' Journal—this order is not written by me or by my authority—the prisoner called and asked me to advertise, and I said, "Not till I see the journal, to use my own discretion"—I gave him no order, nor did I autho<lb></lb>rize anybody to give him one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well; as a canvasser—I gave him orders perhaps once in three weeks or six weeks—I know that he was connected with another paper as well as the Builders' Journal—he was very anxious to obtain orders, and sometimes I yielded to his entreaties, and said, "Well, you may try for three months or six mouths"—he always filled them up himself and signed them in my name—I am not positive whether</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186510230071"></xptr>
               <p>I signed my name to the first order or not, but it is not usual with me when I give an order to sign my name—I have simply told him to continue the advertisement.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were those the only two times he solicited orders? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of any other—he was very anxious to obtain orders, but I was not disposed to yield—the second time he applied I told him we might give him a turn some time after those had gone by, but that six or eight advertisements a week were rather expensive—a gentleman came in on business, and he took his leave.</p>

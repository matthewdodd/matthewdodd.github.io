                  </hi>. I carry on business as a wine and brandy merchant, in John-street, Crutched-friars, and have for nearly twenty years—the prisoner has been in my employ upwards of 16 years—he was my principal clerk and cashier—on Friday, 19th Aug., I was up stairs in my private counting house—in consequence of some investigation, I went down to the clerks' counting-house, where the prisoner sat—I asked him what might be my balance at my banker's at that time—he mentioned an amount that I do not remember—I fancied he was mistaken in the figures, and thinking he was incorrect, I took the rough pay-in book, the banker's book, the check book and the cash book up stairs with me, and on tracing the amounts that had been received by him, and paid in, to see whether they had been passed into the banker's—I found several of them missing—I copied the list off—I have not that list, it is destroyed—this sum of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was one of the sums that was deficient—I went down to the prisoner again, and said, "You appear to have some amounts that you have not paid hi, why don't you pay them in?"—he made me no answer—I waited some time—I then spoke very loudly to him; "Do you hear me, Sir"—he passed out from the enclosure where his desk was, and came round to me, and seized me by the coat with both hands, and said, "For God's sake forgive me, Mr. Storr!"—I said, "You don't mean to say you have been robbing me?"—his reply was, "For God's sake forgive me"—I thrust him from me and went out, saying, "I have nothing to say to you"—I immediately gave the other clerk orders to lock up all the books, and the cash box—he did so, and gave me the key—I think the cash box was in the safe at the time, I will not be positive—I then left the house—on the following morning I went to the counting house about 11 o'clock; I found the prisoner there, he came up to me repeating the words he had said before, "For God's sake forgive me, if not for my sake, for that of my family?"—I replied, "I have nothing to say to you"—I left the counting house, and returned in half an hour—I found the prisoner had gone—I believe he was apprehended on Monday—I consulted my solicitor, Mr. Pinkerton, and what steps I took were under his advice—if the prisoner received moneys on my account, it was his duty to pay them into the bank most unquestionably, all of them—if he received instruction from me to pay money into the bank, it was his duty so to do most unquestionably—this 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was one of the deficiencies that I first discovered—this check (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), has my signature—the body of it is in the prisoner's writing—it is for 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated the 23rd Oct, on Glynn, Mills, and Co.—it was drawn for rum and wine duties—the Custom House do not take checks—it was the prisoner's habit to get them cashed, and another clerk paid the duty—I directed the prisoner to get this check cashed—I saw him afterwards, and he stated he had got the check cashed—the amount of the rum duty was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the wine duty was 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making together 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not pay those moneys for them—I counteracted the order—looking at the payments I had to make, I said, "Don't pay that duty"—I told him to pay the money in again to the bankers—this is the rough pay-in bank book—all the sums that the-prisoner paid in it was his duty to enter in this book, the whole of them should appear here as they were paid in—on 25th Oct. here is paid in, rum duty, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the 4th Nov. here is an item, wine duty, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that ought to have been 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has never in any way accounted to me for that 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have looked through this book carefully, to see whether any such payment has been made, and there has not—until 19th Aug., when I looked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190074"></xptr>
               <p>and found these deficiencies, I was not at all aware that this sum had been retained by the prisoner—he never mentioned that nor the other sums—he had no right to retain that sum for any purpose whatever—he kept a petty cash book—since he left on 19th or 20th Aug., I have not been able to find that petty cash book—I have searched everywhere for it, and cannot find it—I was present at the Mansion House when notice was given to the prisoner to produce that book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in the habit of making payments for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he kept 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by him for that purpose—he always kept that amount in the house, and drew from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe at the time the notice was given him he denied that he had a petty cash-book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not knot what the answer was, there was some answer—it was spoken in confidence to the Lord Mayor, and I did not hear it—here are the entries of these two sums, "Rum duty, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; wine duty, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I was not partner with somebody else at that time—I had a partner—his name was Storey—the firm was Storey and Storr—Mr. Storey was the senior partner—his uncle had the business—I did not find the prisoner in his service—my partner died about three months since—at that time the prisoner was clerk, with a salary of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—we had dissolved partnership about two years before my partner died—I retained the prisoner in the employ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He was to wind up the partnership affairs; there was some confusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that was the mistake of the Lord Mayor—I kept the prisoner to post the books—he was to have his salary continued—his duties were even lighter, in consequence of the termination of the partnership bringing the accounts in a very small compass—he was in my employ first—he was paid by Mr. Storey and me jointly, to act in winding up the affairs—besides that, he attended to my business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there any wine duties due from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; those duties have not been paid at all—the check was differently prepared—I found my payments were more heavy than I anticipated, and I desired that the duties should not be paid—I did not desire that the notes he received should not be paid in at the banker's—I did not desire him to get other notes from the bank—I desired him to pay the money in again—I might have desired him to pay the money in at twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was it you really directed him to do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "We will pay the money in; I see we can't easily spare it"—I said the second time, "I think you had better pay the wine duty in, and leave the rum duty"—that was all that I am aware of—I might have told him to pay it in at two payments—I did not authorize him to retain a small part of it—I gave him no authority, nor did I wish for or desire it—one portion was to be paid in by itself, the other to be paid in afterwards—he had got the cash from my bankers at that time—the cash was kept in his own tin, which he kept in hit desk—whatever money he received from me he had to put in the book, and it is acknowledged in the proper manner in this book, and the disbursement is not accounted for; he should have accounted for it in this red book, supposing it were not paid in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does be credit himself with payments made to an amount exceeding this 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; in the cash book he accounts for it, but the assets are not forthcoming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is more than 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after 23rd Oct. credited by him in this cash book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None but what are accounted for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Attend; you charge him with stealing 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was the balance of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190075"></xptr>
               <p>this check; have you ascertained that he may not have paid that, in current expenses, and only he deficient in that amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he had money for current expenses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This hook that has been produced accounts for the disposition of the money during the whole period that the hook represents? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this is called the cash hook—there is a cash balance hook—it is here—this cash hook is open to my observation—I look over my hooks very often.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is it we have had no account of it from October last till now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he misrepresented the balance in hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But how would the misrepresenting the balance in hand deceiveyouas to why this sum is not mentioned here? how is it you did not find it out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He represented there was a balance in hand, but when the books were examined these sums were missing, and this 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was among them—this 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ought to have been paid in two payments, and here is the book to show that it has not been done—the cash book does not represent the sums paid in—it is the credit given to cash—in this rough entry book there is no mention of it—the books were balanced by mis-statements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say this-man was bound to pay in this 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two sums; and if it was his duty to enter it, how is it that you did not observe that it was not entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not observe it; I can tell that that 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has not been paid in by looking at this book with others, not from this book by itself—I bad the opportunity of looking at the other books, but I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I find here the cash balance on 26th Oct., 1852; the cash in hand is 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.: do you mean to represent that that is untrue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it is quite possible he might have had that—the money he received in the succeeding week, from 26th Oct. to 2nd Nov., was 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. brings it to 228<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and in the cash balance book, on 2nd Nov., he represents that he had got 228<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the cash in hand on 3rd Aug., 1853, was 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was exceedingly excited and angry—I spoke loudly; I do not know that it was violently—I do not know that I frightened him a good deal—I think he is about sixty years old—I did not threaten to bring in a whole regiment of policemen—I said I would have nothing to do with him—I did not say to Richard Sweeney, "If a parcel of policemen come here, point out to them Thomas Browning;" I said, "If a policeman comes in to inquire for him, point him out to him"—that was two days before he was taken—I do not live at that place—I am late in coming to business—I am a very great invalid—I have been for some time as late as 2 o'clock, I believe not later—during that time the prisoner had to disburse all the petty cash—I am married—my wife does not send in any little matters to be paid without I give leave—when little purchases were made, they were not paid by the prisoner without I gave him direction—if any one called before I went there, he would have told them to call again—it was not his habit to pay them—he informed me of the payments he made, and those payments which he had paid out of my money he drew a check for them, so as to keep his amount in hand—I have not known that he has taken his own wages out of the box, and repaid them when I have given him a check—I do not know that when I gave him a check for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he paid it in to answer a sum which he had drawn out for his own wages—he had not applied to me from time to time for his salary; he has applied to me for loans of money, which I have given him—he received his salary at my partner's death; he has not since—I have lent him about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his salary was 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> How did you lend it him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At that time we were also connected with the hop trade; we were in the hop, and wine, and spirit trade, and he was anxious to speculate in a small parcel of hops—my partner permitted him to make a selection—he represented that he was to come into possession of money—he got the hops, and was not in a condition to pay for them, and a considerable loss was sustained by them—I call the money advanced for those hops a loan of money to him, but I lent him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my own pocket since the death of my partner—his salary was paid from the joint estate, and the probate not being paid the assets could not be interfered with, and his salary in the mean time remained accruing, and at his request and for his comfort I lent him money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But was the money advanced for the hops deducted from his salary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he was paid his salary beside.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you to swear, that in the last three months you have advanced him a sum of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or anything like it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in the last three months; I did not mean to mislead you—what I meant to say was, that since the dissolution of the partnership two years ago, he is indebted to me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not mean to say during the last three months—the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been lent since the dissolution, which is now about two years ago—the last sum was lent on 1st Aug., 1853—that was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he received the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and debited himself with it—he did not pay it over to me—he debits himself in the book—I did not get the money—he debits himself with money that was lent him—that is not the only sum he has had this year; there are other amounts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You do not mean you gave him a check for every 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; when they have amounted to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he has had a check, so as to keep the amount in his hand undisturbed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

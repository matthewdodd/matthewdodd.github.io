                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I was in the service of Mr. Alexander, of Hatton-garden, for two years and three months, as groom—I drove a brougham—his stable is in King's-road, Gray's Inn-lane—I know the two prisoners—I became acquainted with Symes eighteen months ago, at the Bagnigge Tavern, and I used to see him occasionally as he drove his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I have seen him at the Yorkshire Grey, at the corner of King's-road—the last <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he kept was at Mr. Rackstraw's, in Gray's Inn-lane, opposite the King's-road—the first time I saw Floyd was in Sept. last—I saw him in Brydges-street, Covent-garden; Symes introduced me to him—he drives a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he has two horses—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> is not his own, he says, but he hires it—I have seen him at other places besides Brydges-street; one night I saw him at the Mogul, in Drury-lane; that was before the robbery—the robbery (took place on 13th Dec.—I had seen Floyd about a week or a fortnight before that—I saw Symes on the day the robbery was committed, at the Yorkshire Grey, from 10 to half-past 10 o'clock in the morning—he asked me if I was going out with the brougham—I told him I did not know—I went back to the stable at dinner time, about 1 o'clock, to feed my horse, and I saw Symes again; he was there when I got there—he asked me if I was going out with the brougham—I said I was going out at half-past 2 o'clock, and he then said he would have a parcel out of the brougham (my master was in the habit of carrying parcels in the brougham)—when he said that I said he should not have it—he said he would have it—I said he should not—he said he would go and fetch Floyd and his <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

Williams and Clapham's, and when he came back to the brougham he missed the parcel—I did not see anything more of Floyd or Symes that day—I saw Symes the next morning, about 10 o'clock, at the Yorkshire Grey—he gave we half a crown, and said he was going away for a day or two—nothing more passed at that time—I saw him again about the Wednesday week afterwards—he was away four or five days—I saw him again at the Yorkshire Grey—during his absence I saw his wife; she came to me at the Yorkshire Grey—I received money from her while he was away; I cannot say how much; I suppose I received 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at different times—she used to come there every evening—when Symes returned, on the following week, I saw him at the Yorkshire Grey—he did not say anything to me or I to him about what had happened between me and his wife during his absence—he did not say much to me in the evening, but he said in the morning he had sold the property for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he gave the man for selling it, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for melting it down, and he said he had got my share of the money, and he would take care of it, and he would buy me a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and two horses if I would say nothing about it—I had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him in money alto<lb></lb>gether, in a pound or a couple of pounds at a time, at his house—that included the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to his house; he lives at No. 35, Liquorpond-street, Gray's Inn-lane, in a room up stairs—I went there one evening after I came home from driving my master, and I found the things all scattered about in the room—the lock was turned; the bolt of the lock was shot, but the door was open—there was no one at home—I did not see him or his wife that day—I went up to his place the next morning, and his wife was at home—she said something to me about the room—I went again in the evening, and found Symes there—he directly turned round and abused me, and accused me of breaking his place open, and taking what money there</p>

               <p>was there—I told him I knew nothing about it; I had gone there for some money—I had not then been discharged from my place—I was at that time in the habit of associating with a woman named Elizabeth Pullen; she is a woman of the town—I had become acquainted with her through Symes taking me down into her company; that had been about six weeks—I knew nothing of her till Symes took me into her company—I had not seen her before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go anywhere else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: I went with Elizabeth Pullen to Floyd's place, No. 43, Woburn-mews, Woburn-place—I saw a boy there—Floyd was not at home—I saw him walking in Woburn-place—I told him that Symes had accused me of taking the money, and breaking his place open—Floyd said, "If you don't say anything about the robbery, I have got two horses, and I will give you one, and you shall work half my number"—that I should work half the day—Floyd then told me that the pro<lb></lb>perty sold for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for selling it, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for melting it—he said Symes was a scoundrel, and he thought he would <hi rend="italic">do it</hi> for us—I thought he meant that he would give information—Floyd then came with me to Symes's place—we saw his wife at the door; the said Symes was ill, and in bed—we did not see him: we made an appointment to go the next morning—I did not go—when Floyd told me what the property was sold for, he said he filled the bag with stones, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it over Southwark Bridge—I did not see Floyd after that till he was in custody—I saw Symes a day or so afterwards, at the Yorkshire Grey, and he said he would pay me an equal share of the money after he got to work, if I would say nothing about it—after that Symes and I were in the Strand; we met Elizabeth Pullen and Susan Kelly—we went with those two women to the George public house, in the Strand; we had a half pint of gin—we then all four came out; Kelly, I believe, stopped in the Strand, and Symes, and I, and Pullen went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Gray's-lane—Symes spoke to Pullen about showing his two rings—he said she had been showing his two rings to a parcel of people—she said she had not shown them to anybody—he then asked her for the duplicate of a pin—she said she had not got it with her, she had left it at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Pullen at any time say anything to you about seeing a lot of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and I said to Symes, "Pullen says that you showed her a lot of money in a bag"—he said he had not—I said Pullen had told me that he had—he still said he had not—I saw Symes afterwards, up to the time when I was taken in custody, which was this day four weeks; the 6th Jan.—I was remanded to the House of Detention at Clerkenwell—my brother came to see me there, and Mrs. Symes came twice—my brother's name is Charles Boyd; he has been a seaman—I went to the House of Detention on a Saturday, and I saw my brother on the Monday—I made a statement to him about this transaction—when I saw Floyd he told me the property had fetched 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said they had taken it to <hi rend="italic">Jog</hi> Wood, who had offered 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. t and they would not take it, and they took it to a place called the <hi rend="italic">Stew</hi>, in Petticoat-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. I was on duty at the station on 9th Jan., when the prisoner Floyd was brought there—he was. charged with being concerned with others in stealing a bag from a brougham—I asked him if he knew Boyd and Symes—he said he did not—I am not aware that he was asked anything else.</p>

I live at No. 16, Hatton-garden; I am nephew and manager to Mr. Alexander Alexander, a jeweller there—James Boyd was coachman to Mr. Alexander for about two years—he lived at No. 49, Portpool-lane—I was in the habit of going about daily to the customers with goods—on 13th Jan. I gave James Boyd directions to go out between 1 and 2 o'clock—I went in the City in the brougham, and took a large quantity of jewellery—I returned to the Strand—I got there about a quarter before 5 o'clock—I had a bag of jewellery—it contained gold seals, gold keys, Albert keys, studs, brooches, rings, lockets, ear wires, shawl pins, and other articles—it was above 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. value—it was a black glazed bag that they were in—I stopped at Mr. Henderson's, opposite the Lowther Arcade—I went to Mr. Allum's; I stayed there about half an hour and ten minutes—I left those things in the brougham, and left James Boyd with it—he was standing at the door of the brougham when I left—when I returned to the brougham I missed the bag—Boyd remained in our service after that, till the 6th Jan.—all the rings had stones, some diamonds, some rubies, and some both—I have never seen any of the property out of the bag.</p>

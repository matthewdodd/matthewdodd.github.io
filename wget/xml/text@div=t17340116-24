But immediately recollecting myself, Lord bless me! says I, she went to Bed when I did! So I got up and run to the Window and found the Sash open. I saw something move before me, as far off as my Hand is, but what it was I cannot tell, for I could not see Head nor Face, and so I call'd out Thieves, and I afterwards found a Ladder left standing against the Window.

On the 12th of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into my shop and looked at some pieces of marked leather; I was in the shop attending some other customers; he stopped about a quarter of an hour in the shop, and he brought a small piece of leather to the counter for me to take the money for; I think it came to three pence; he paid it and was going away; one of my young men came forward and said he had got some leather that he had not paid for. I desired the young man to lay hold of him and bring him back; he did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any leather about him - A. Yes, he had a leather apron on, and under his apron he had a canvas bag hung round him, concealed by the apron; the side of the bag was open, and in the bag were four pieces of marked leather; he begged very hard that I would forgive him, as it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man before - A. I had seen him frequently; twice a day sometimes; he had come often and bought trifling articles.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Duncan. When the prisoner was in the shop I observed him secreting leather under his apron from the hole where the leather was kept; in doing which he dropped one piece of leather; he left it on the ground; he took up a piece of leather he had previously laid on the counter, and gave three pence for it; when he went out I called after the man, I said you have got some leather you have not paid for; he said he had not. I brought him into the shop, I searched him, I found the four pieces of leather in a canvas bag under his apron; the prisoner begged Mr. Duncan's pardon, he said it was the first time he had ever done such an offence, if he would let him go he would never come in the shop any more.</p>

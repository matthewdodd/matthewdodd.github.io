I am the wife of John Gibbs, living at 26, Stanhope Street, Deptford—I know the prisoner and the prosecutrix—on the 7th June I was coming down the street with Mrs. Turner, and as we passed along, the prisoner rushed across the road with a man, and another female behind her, and catched Mrs. Turner by the hair of her head and turned her over in that manner (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>), and with her left hand punched her underneath—she was on the left hand, and her hand caught her right eye—we saw the blood streaming to the ground, and she said "I am blinded for life," and blood was rushing from the right eye—the prisoner said "Now it is done 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. am satisfied; I have got my revenge"—Mrs. Whelan took charge of her, and the piece of stuff afterwards came out—she was taken to St. Thomas' Hospital.</p>

You went in the middle of the road and said you would fight me as well as her, and you threw your bonnet and shawl up. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was with Mrs. Turner and never left her company from 1 o'clock in the day.</p>

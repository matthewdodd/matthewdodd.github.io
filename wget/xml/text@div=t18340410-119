            . I am an officer of Marylebone - on the following Monday I saw the prisoner - I followed him to a house in Short's-gardens - I put my hand to his pocket, and said, "What have you got here?" - he said, "A dirty shirt, and I will show it you" - he put his hand to his pocket, pulled out these four handkerchiefs, and threw them through the window into the yard, in a moment - I seized him by the collar, and asked some men who were at work in the yard to give me the handkerchiefs, but they took no notice of it - the prisoner then began to make some resistance - I took out my staff and said I was an officer, and if he made any resistance, I would make a hole in him - I then called to the men again to give me the handkerchiefs, but one of them took them up and threw them into a hole which they were digging - I said, "Is there not one honest man among you? - mind, I know you all, and if you do not give them to me, I will have you up" - at last one man took them out, and another man gave them to me - I then brought the prisoner out - he made great resistance in the street, and some women pulled my arm and some men ill used me - one of them bit my thumb, and I was very ill used - if a policeman had not come up, I must have lost the prisoner.</p>

I was on duty about a quarter to 3 o'clock last Thursday morning in Manor-street, York-road, Lambeth—I heard a cry of "Police!" proceeding from the corner of Sutton-street—I saw the prisoner Clark running from the cries, with another man dressed as a coalheaver—I am not able to say whether Howe was the other man—I could not swear to him, the street was dark—I caught hold of Clark, and held him—he said, "Let me go, I am after him"—I had been in the street for some time, I suppose ten minutes, and no one had passed between the time of the cry of "Stop thief!" till Clark came up—he ran up to me—I met both of them in the street, running—the other man continued running, and escaped—I held Clark, and he said again, "Let me go, I am after him"—I held him till the prosecutor came up—he said, "That is one of the men that robbed me"—Clark replied, "You are a false man to accuse me"—I then sprang my rattle, and my brother constable Fermeger came up—I told him what I had seen, and he went after the other man, and while the charge was being taken against Clark, Howe was brought in—the prosecutor directly pointed to him, and said, "You are the other man"—Howe said he was not the man, it was a falsehood—I searched Clark, and found on him one shilling, two sixpences, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—after locking Clark up I went back to the spot where I had taken Clark into custody, searched, and found this pocket, and part of a waistband of trowsers, containing a half crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—it was within a yard of where I took Clark, and about twenty yards from where I heard the cry of "Stop thief!"—both the men ran in the same direction out of Vine-street into Manor-street—they ran down Sutton-street, and turned the first turning into Manor-street—I met them at the corner of Manor-street—Manor-street leads into Vinestreet—it is near the Belvedere-road.</p>

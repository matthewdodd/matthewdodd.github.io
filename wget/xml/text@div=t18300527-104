               <p>RICHARD KNIGHT. I lost my watch, on the 16th of May, from the kitchen of my house, No. 1, <placeName id="t18300527-104-crimeloc558">Unicorn-place</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had he not been to sea? A. I have understood so - there was a man and his wife in the upper part of my house; I do not know that they had any visitors - I did state before the Magistrate what the prisoner said about the watch; I did not tell the officer I thought he was not the thief.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 16th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to our house - he staid about a quarter of an hour; I saw the watch when he came in - he went through that room, and let himself out; he spoke to my husband as he went down stairs.</p>

            . I received the prisoner into custody. He begged me to go as far as his mother's - I said I would take him to the station-house, and then I would go to his mother's - he said if we would let him go to his mother's the watch and all things would be set right; I said, "Have you pawned or sold it?" he said, Neither.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to look for it? A. Yes, from other information, but we have not found it.</p>

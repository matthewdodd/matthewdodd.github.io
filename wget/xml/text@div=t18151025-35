We had lived together fourteen months, On the 13th of September, at about six o'clock in the evening, I was nailing up a stick against some boards. I had driven one nail, and I wanted another; I said to the prisoner, I want another nail, and must have one, from some where or other; but I won't go down stairs for one, if I can help it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been quarrelling with him that day - A. No. When I said I wanted a nail, he said, look in one of those holes, and you will find one. He meant the old holes in the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak that angrily - A. No, good humoured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all suspect that he was angry with you at that time - A. No not at all. I found an old nail where he directed me, and said, I have got one, if I can make it do. I went and kneeled down, and straightened it on the floor, and began driving it into the floor, to keep the end of the stick from slipping out of the boards; I was driving this nail, when he came and stabbed me; he stabbed the knife into my side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything to you - A. He never spoke, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, there was nobody else in the shop besides you two - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave the knife sticking in your body, or did he carry it away with him - A. It was found in the room. I ran after him; when I came to the top of the stairs, I put my hand to my side, and felt it wet, and looking at it, and there it was all over blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the effect of this wound upon you - A. I was taken to Bartholomew's Hospital almost immediately; I was confined there a fortnight and two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever give you any reason since, for doing this - A. I never have seen him since, but once at Guildhall. Not an angry word passed between us. I kept my bed with the wound for about eight days; I never was out of it during that time.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. Q. Can you venture to say he did not fall upon you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your back was towards him; now can you venture to swear he did not fall upon you with the knife - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed he had any occasion to use his knife - A. We had been cutting tobacco stalks but with other knives. We had not been eating bread and cheese, nor any thing of the kind.</p>

When I came down stairs, I found Ellingham with his hand on his side, covered with blood. The prisoner was then sitting on a cask at the end of the warehouse. I asked Ellingham what was the matter, and he said, that villain, has murdered me. I asked the prisoner what was his motive; he said, it is done now, and cannot be helped; he knew we were all against him, and he knew what was coming. I asked him what he did it with; he said, a knife. I sent a neighbour and the constable up stairs, and they brought a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250017"></xptr>knife down, it was not bloody when it was brought down.

I asked the prisoner whether he had stabbed the prosecutor with a three pronged fork, as Ellingham had told me. He said, he did not do it with a fork; he did it with a knife. I asked him where the knife was, and he said, he did not know. I asked him where he had thrown it to, and he said, he did not know. I took a candle and went up stairs into the cutting loft, or snuff room, and I looked about, and in the right hand side on the bed. I saw the knife laying by a candle, which was burning; there were no signs of blood on it. I brought it down, and asked the prisoner if that was the knife, and he said, it was. I asked him why he did it, and he said, it served him right, they were all against him. I said, he had sharpened the knife on purpose; he said, no, he had not; he sharpened it to cut his corns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an itinerant bookseller, and live in Mitre-court, St. John-street. On the 28th of March, I was returning home from Poplar—I was in Ropemaker-street, at eleven o'clock at night—I was perfectly sober—the prisoner came running up, and asked me to treat, her—I told her I could not—she tore open my coat, and took my bag out of my waistcoat pocket, containing two half-crowns and five pence in cop<lb></lb>per—I walked on, and met the policeman—I told him I was robbed—he asked if I should know the girl—I said, "Yes," and the prisoner was taken in less than five minutes—I swear positively she is the woman that robbed me, and she ran away directly—I picked her out from among seven others—I have not got my money again.</p>

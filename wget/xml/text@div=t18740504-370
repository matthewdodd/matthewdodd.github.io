                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Huntsman Street, East Street, Walworth,: and am a yard foreman—on Easter Monday about about 12 o'clock, I was walking in the Old Kent Road with my wife on my arm, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner Harris and another man standing together—one of them snatched at</p>

               <p>my watch—I don't know that man, he did not take the watch, the bow was broken—he seized hold of my chain, I struck out at him, he ran away, I followed him, while doing so the other tripped me up, and we both fell together—I got up and left him behind me and ran after the man that snatched at my watch—at the end of York Street I lost sight of him, and I turned round on to Harris and said "I have lost him, I will hold you"—the policeman came up at the same time, and I gave him in charge—he struggled violently and assaulted the policeman—I saw Purdy afterwards at Star Corner in the hands of some man—when I got home I found that my watch was in my waistcoat pocket with the bow broken—I have no doubt about Harris.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about twenty minutes after Harris was in custody that Purdy came up; there was a crowd at that time—there were two policemen—there was a good deal of pushing—I did not see Purdy get a click on the ear—the police were doing their best to take the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was about a quarter of a mile from the place where the man snatched at my watch to where Purdy came up, and about 400 or 500 yards from where I lost sight of the man.</p>

I work at a coffee-house, and live at No. 1, Layton's Buildings—on Easter Monday night, about 9 o'clock, I was in the Old Kent Road, near the Dover Road—I saw Mr. Egan and his wife—I was two or three yards behind them—I saw two men following them; they both wore black coats—Harris is one of the men, I am sure of him; the other one turned round and snatched at Mr. Egan's breast—Mr. Egan tried to resist him—I think he hit him—the man ran away through York Street—I do not see that man here—I had not time to look at him—Mr. Egan ran across 1. the road, and Harris after him and knocked him down at the corner of the street; Mr. Egan clung to him, and they both fell down—I was there when the police came up and took Harris.</p>

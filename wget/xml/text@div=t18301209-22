I had been beating a carpet; I and my partner were carrying it home on this stick - I saw two brushes on the flag stone, and took them up; I carried them twenty yards, when the shopman came, and said they were his; I said he was welcome to them - he was not satisfied, but took me by the neckcloth, and almost throttled me; I said, "Don't do that - I will go any where with you."</p>

                  </hi> I am a linen-draper. I have an unoccupied house at Woodford—I live at Woodford, and hold that house as tenant. I heard that some lead had been taken from the building, and went to it with White—it had then been replaced—it was laid down in the gutter which it had been taken from—it had been torn off from the nails—it corresponded exactly with the place, and supplied the deficiency—I have no doubt that it originally formed part of the same gutter.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I received information, and went to the prisoner's house with a search-warrant—I found this lead in a shed in the prisoner's yard behind the house, secreted under a quantity of leaves—I went to Mr. Carter's house, in company with another constable, about eleven o'clock, on Thursday night, the 19th of Dec—the door was open—I looked up, and discovered the moonlight shining through the gutter—I got on the roof, and found a quantity of lead missing—it was per<lb></lb>fectly fresh done—the boards were quite dry under the lead, and not at all stained with rain—I went again on Monday morning, the 23rd, about daylight—I noticed the edge of the lead, which had every appearance of being fresb removed—Mr. Carter was with me—I applied the lead found</p>

               <p>at the prisoner's to the gutter, and it exactly corresponded—it fitted every part—I have not the slightest doubt it came from the gutter, and that also appeared quite fresh—there were two lengths of lead which lapped one under the other, and the nail holes were broken out—it weighs 98lbs.—I also found in the gutter this piece of brown paper, with the name of Hurrell on it—it was doubled up just as if it had fallen out of a man's pocket.</p>

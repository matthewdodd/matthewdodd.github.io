               <p>On the 11th of Sept. I saw the prisoner on the Common—I heard him say, "God help the poor man; from dust I came, to dust I go; here goes. Amen"—he then threw himself into some water—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion—he was got out—the surgeon came, and he was Drought to life again.</p>

I heard cries, and found the prisoner in the water out of his depth—he sunk three times—his head was below the water—I got him out, and he was rubbed, and restored—when he came to he said he wished I had let him remain in the water—he said he would do it again—he had lost his board and bag of nuts.</p>

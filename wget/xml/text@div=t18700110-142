                  </hi>. I keep the Coach and Horses, at Blue Anchor Alley, Bunhill Row—on Friday, 31st December, about 11.20, the prisoner came in for a half-pint of porter—he gave me a sixpence; I gave him change—he drank the porter and left—I put the sixpence in the till—there was other money there—I went to the till afterwards, and found a bad sixpence lying amongst the other money—the prisoner came in again shortly after, and asked for three-halfpennyworth of rum—he paid with a bad six-pence—I gave him his change, and put the sixpence on one side, on the lower counter—he went away and spoke to a woman outside—he came in again in about 10 minutes after, for another three-halfpennyworth of rum, and paid with a bad sixpence—I walked round the counter and shut the street door and said I should give him into custody for uttering two bad sixpences—he said he had not been in the house before—he asked for his change, and I said I should not give it to him—I sent for a constable and gave him into custody—at first he denied having been in before, but afterwards he admitted he had been—I gave the three sixpences to the constable—I don't swear that the sixpence he gave me first was bad—I strongly suspected he was the man—I only produced two in the evidence at the Police Court.</p>

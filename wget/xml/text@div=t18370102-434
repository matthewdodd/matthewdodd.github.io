                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ELIZA LORD</hi>. I live in White Rose-place, Whitecross-street—I was bar-maid to Mr. Roberts, of the Queen's Head. On the 1st of December, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the bar for half-a-quartern of gin, which came to twopence—I served him—he threw down half-a-crown—it fell on the ground, I took it up and gave him two shillings and fourpence—he drank the gin, and went out—I showed the half-crown to my master directly, as I thought it was bad—it had not been out of my hand before—I took it, and went after the prisoner—I overtook him—I told him he must come back to Mr. Roberts—he asked what for?—I said he had given me a bad half-crown—he denied coming into the house at all, and then my master came up and took the half-crown—I am sure it was the same one as I got from the prisoner—it had not been out of my possession—the watchman took the prisoner.</p>

               <p>—they were both good—I should not have taken the half-crown if my master had not been there—when the officer came up I saw three shillings in your hand—I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The two shillings found on me was what she gave me—I had but one half-crown and a penny farthing when I went into the house.</p>

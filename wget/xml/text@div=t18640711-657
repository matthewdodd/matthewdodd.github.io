I keep the Lord Nelson at Chelsea—on 9th June, I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner come across, walking as a cripple, with a man who appeared to be intoxicated; they came in, and the prisoner asked if I sold rum—I said, "No"—he called for a pint of six ale, which came to threepence, and gave me a half-crown and three halfpence—he pretended to be intoxicated, picked up the half-crown again, and threw it on the zinc counter—I put it in my teeth and it bent; I took away the ale and said, "I shall not give you the half-crown"—the other man said, "Why do not you come away; you know you have done wrong?"—I got a con<lb></lb>stable</p>

We came up that day to get a fresh supply; we divided our money and this half-crown came to my share. I tendered it, and the man said it was bad, and having taken some drink, I was a little confused. I should have given my right address but for the damage it would do meat my place of work. I afterwards thought it was more straightforward to give my right address.</p>

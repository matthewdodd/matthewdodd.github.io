I said you have got my watch, but you shall not have it, and made at him, but missed him I laid hold of the prisoner, but the other got off with my watch.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to me by Willis and the two watchmen. Willis said, he had been knocked down by two men and he was sure the prisoner was one of them, and that they had stole his watch, but he did not know which had it. I searched the prisoner, but I found nothing upon him but a knife, a few halfpence and seven shillings.</p>

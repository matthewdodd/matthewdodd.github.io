On Sunday morning, the 29th of October, between nine and ten o'clock, I came down stairs, and found the three prisoners alone in the shop; I knew Bridget Andrews before; I said, "God bless me, I thought my son John had been at home" - she said, "Do not be afraid - you have lost nothing by us;" she then bought a ham bone, which she had bargained for the night before, and paid me 1s. 3d. - she also bought a hock of bacon, and then went out; my son John came home in a short time - he went to the desk, and the purse and money were gone; I had given him the purse that morning - it is usually kept in the desk, which is not locked - the desk stands on the counter; the purse was a yellow canvas bag.</p>

            . I am son of the last witness. - On the 29th of October she gave me the bag, which contained a 10l. note, two half-sovereigns, and some silver - I counted it, and put it into the bag again, and, to the best of my recollection, put it into the desk, but I am sure I left it in the shop; I recollect there was a half-crown piece in it, which I had taken between eight and nine o'clock that morning, and on ringing it, it sounded like lead, but I found it was cut in the edge, and cracked in two places; a little girl had paid it to me, who brought it from Mr. Griffiths; this did not occur to me till next morning, but I am positive I put a half-crown of that description into the bag. I went out of the shop about half-past nine o'clock, and thought I had left my mother there - I left no customer there; I thought I shut the door, but it does not latch very easy; when I came home I desired my mother to look into the desk for the bag, and it was gone. I went with a friend between eleven and twelve o'clock, to the prisoners' house, and found them with two more persons in the room; Thomas Andrews is Bridget's son - she was on the bed, beastly drunk, and smoking a pipe; Benyon was sitting on the bed, but not quite so drunk - she smelt of rum; the boy was sitting in the room. I told them we had missed some money in the morning, and asked if they could give me any information about it. I fetched Eatough, and was present when he made a search; 18s. in shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns were found in Bridget Andrews' pocket, and 7d. in copper; the officer took it, and the next day, at Worship-street, I recognized the half-crown, which was among them - I am sure that half-crown was in the bag; it was the one I have spoken of, and was taken out of her pocket.</p>

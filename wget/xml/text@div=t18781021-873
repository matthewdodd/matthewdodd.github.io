I am a general dealer, of 86, Gray's Inn Road—on 8th October I was in Portpool Lane, and saw the deceased child sitting on a doorstep knitting, and some boys in the street playing at <hi rend="italic">tip-cat</hi>—the prisoner was playing with them, and I saw him throw a stone, which was thrown backwards and forwards, and the prisoner was throwing it with his right hand, but his hand <hi rend="italic">slewed</hi> over to the left, and the stone struck the child, but not intentionally—she was picked up and given to me bleeding—I took her to the hospital—it was a large piece of flag-stone, very much like his(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">cross-examined</hi>. I think it struck the child's head and the door together—I think it struck the child first—it is a narrow street turning out of Gray's Inn Road, but the part where they were playing was wide—it is a public thoroughfare, and a good many people go up and down—I saw the stone in the prisoner's hand—it was from his cast.</p>

I am a coke-dealer, of 16, Portpool Lane—I was out<lb></lb>side my house at 4.45, waiting for my tea, and saw four boys playing at tip-cat, the prisoner was one—Metcalfe said "You will do something with your larking in a minute," and then I heard the blow of a stone against a door—Metcalfe said "You have done something now with your larking," and then I looked and saw the child wounded—this stone lay on the pavement near the door and near the child—I picked it up and kicked it into the road—it weighs about 21<hi rend="italic">b</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not see who threw it—I had rather say that it struck the door-post first, because if not it would have killed the child there and then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—on 8th October, about 5 p.m., the child was brought in with a depressed fracture of the skull—the bone was fractured and one side was pushed under we other—she lived seven days all but 12 hours, and died on the 15th from the result of the fracture—it was done with some blunt instrument—if this stone Passed level with the top of the child's head it would not be necessary for it to hit the door first.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Aldgate High-street—the prisoner was in my employ. In consequence of information I sent for a policeman, and gave the prisoner into custody—I charged him with taking goods from the warehouse, which he had not accounted for, and appropriated to his own use—he said he was not guilty—I told him we would go to the parties where he had taken the goods—we and the policeman went to a person named Bateman, in the Minories—the prisoner made no further remark, only that he hoped I should not be hard with him—he said he bad pro<lb></lb>cured currants and orange-peel from a young man, to the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and besides this, he had taken 3lbs. of currants and some sugar—that they were all taken to Bateman's—he had accounted for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Mr. Bateman's shopwoman had paid him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was part of what he had not accounted for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopwoman to Thomas Bateman, of the Minories—I have been there six or seven years. On the 22nd of October the prisoner brought the goods as usual, two papers of currants, of 3lbs. each, and two papers of peel, 1/4 lb. each, and 2lbs. of lump sugar—I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to the prosecutor. Last Friday afternoon I was outside, I looked into the cellar, and saw the prisoner pressing something between his knees—I went down, sent him tip, and found in a currant-tub a paper of currants—I pinched it at one corner, and in five minutes after, it was gone—this is the paper, it is one of the papers of currants—the other I believe to be my employer's, but I could not swear to them—they have been used.</p>

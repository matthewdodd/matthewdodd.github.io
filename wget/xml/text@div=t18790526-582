                  </hi>. I am a printer and live in Molyneaux Road—on Saturday afternoon, 19th April, about 5 o'clock, I was in Woolwich—I had two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and some silver—I went into the Coach and Horses—I did not go there with a woman—I do not recollect any particular persons there except a man calling himself Newton, who introduced himself as an old friend—this money was in one purse, I was using another purse for what I was spending—I missed the purse and money later in the evening, near 10 o'clock, as I was going home in the ferry—I was in another public-house after leaving the Coach and Hones; in felt myself I was in such a state I did not wish to be in the street—previous to going there I went into an eating-house and had some tea, and I believe the prisoner was there, so I have been told—on the Monday a policeman showed me my purse in which the money had been—I was in no house but the eating-house with a woman, or in front of the bar, not for any immoral purpose.</p>

I do not recollect wanting you to go home and live with me; or wanting to buy you a pair of boots—I do not remember putting the purse into your hand and asking you to stay with me till Monday—there was another woman in my company before you; that was a long time previous—my drunkenness came on all of a moment, from what cause I don't know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Coach and Horses, in High Street, Woolwich—on Saturday afternoon, 19th April, I saw the prosecutor and prisoner there in company with a man who said his name was Newton—they were there 10 or 20'minutes—the prosecutor was drunk, the prisoner was sober—I served him with some ginger-beer, I would not let him have anything else; he wanted something else—they all three left together; Newton went to the right and the prisoner and prosecutor went about 30 yards across the road to some dining-rooms—in about three-quarters of an hour the prisoner cam. back to my house—she' showed me two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and asked me whether they were good; I said I believed they were—she said would I change one—I said "How did you come by them?"—she said "The gentleman you saw me with a little time ago gave them to me"—I said "You fetch the gentleman and I will change one"—she did not bring him and I did not give her any change—I handed the notes back to her.</p>

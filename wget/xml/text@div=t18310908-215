             at a house in Glasshouse-street, and asked her to go over the way to a publichouse to get a glass of liquor, instead of which we went to the prisoner's house; I had two 20l. notes in my fob, and a sovereign, a shilling, and a sixpence in my trousers pocket - the prisoner asked me for some gin; I gave him 1s. - he was not satisfied, and I gave him 2d. more, and then 6d.; he did not get any gin; I went to change my sovereign at the public-house - I returned in a few minutes, and he wanted me to give him money again; I would not- he went to put his hand into my pocket; I would not let him, and he knocked me down - he fell down on me, and while he was on me took my money; before I could get on my feet he had gone out of the house the back way - I had felt the notes safe in his house, and I felt him take them out; I staid in the house a little time, and said to Brooks, "I am done now, my two notes are gone;" I had received my wages, which came to 58l., about a week before - he was taken on Sunday; I had gone to his house twice that night, but he was out - I was as sober as I am now; I had been to a good many places, but to no bad place till I got to this lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the Compasses? A. Yes, I was there, and had some gin and rum; I cannot say how many glasses I might take - one or two of both, not more, and that was all the day; I had no brandy - I do not think I had any brandy and water, but will not swear it, as I was in the house in the day-time once or twice in the morning, about seven o'clock, and had half a pint of rum then, but only drank one glass; I was at the lodging-house the woman lived at almost all day - I did not go to any other public-house that day; I went there once after seven o'clock, but cannot tell when, and had two glasses of gin; I sent out at the lodginghouse for a good deal of gin, and gave it to the women, but did not take much myself - I spent 1l. at that house, and might have had six glasses myself in the course of the day- I will not swear I did not have a dozen; I did not fall down drunk in the street, nor did a sweep pick me up; nothing of the sort happened - I was found asleep in the privy of the house I stopped at, but that was at nine o'clock, after I was robbed; I was not drunk - they said I was asleep; I do not know whether I was - I never used the word rooping, I do not know what it means; I never said I was rooped - I think it was a young woman awoke me in the privy; it was not much after five o'clock when I went to the prisoner-house - I left my hat in his house, not at the public-house; I did not stay there five minutes after I was robbed - it was in a bed-room down stairs; I found my hat there next day - I had only been with one woman that day; I do not know how many were in the house - I treated about a dozen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You treated women in the house on that day? A. Yes, I sent out for liquor for them from time to time.</p>

            . I was with Tulloch, and went into the prisoner's house with him; he asked me to go out and have something to drink; I refused - he pressed me, and I went; the prisoner was standing at his own door, and called us over, and instead of going to the public-house, we went in: he asked Tulloch to give him something to drink; he gave him 1s.; he said that was not sufficient; he gave him 6d. more, which was all the change he had; as the prisoner brought nothing to drink, Tulloch went to the public-house, and changed a sovereign for half a pint of gin - he returned, and the prisoner began to pull him about; he said he did not like that, and then he knocked him down - I did not see him take the notes, but saw the prisoner upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Tulloch? A. He lodged at our house two nights - I was in his company all day; he breakfasted there, and did not leave the house till the afternoon, about half-past four o'clock; I do not think he went out till then, but I was up in my room for half an hour about half-past twelve o'clock in the morning - he was in and out of the different rooms; I went with him about five o'clock to Worley's - the prisoner was not out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080098"></xptr>above two minutes, before he put his hand into his pocket, and said he was robbed of two 20l. notes; we returned to the prisoner's house, but he was not to be seen, and we returned to my place - he was found asleep at my place- he remained at my place all the evening, except going to see if Worley was there - I went with him; I was at the Compasses public-house with him about a quarter to five o'clock, and two women were there; he treated us to half a pint of gin, and nothing else - I am an unfortunate girl; the Compasses is next door to our house.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday evening, about eleven o'clock, and found 19s. on him, but no notes; he was standing under a lamp, with a female - he said he was innocent; I said, "Why did you abscond from your house with the woman you have lived with twelve years?" he then began to pretend intoxication; he had a new hat on, and almost all his clothes were new - I knew that, for I was in the habit of seeing him daily.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, upon being called upon for his Defence, in a coarse and indelicate statement, represented that the prosecutor and Brookes had come to her house in a complete state of intoxication, and wished for a room, which he refused them, and turned them out of doors; and that he was robbed previous to coming to his house.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Where is the necessary? A. In the back apartment of the house, No. 9, next door to the Compasses - I was called there to assist him out; he was quite drunk, and could not stand.</p>

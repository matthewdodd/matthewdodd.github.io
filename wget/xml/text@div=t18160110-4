            . I am the wife of the first witness. There is a curtain goes across our bedroom, to keep it warm. My son had come home about half an hour, and was in bed, when I heard a sort of a scratching noise, on the green baize that was on the table. I had a candle burning in my room, and I saw the green curtain across the room move, but I had not power to get up to see what it was. I told my husband when he came in, and he went about the place, but he could not see anything. The next morning, I missed the property named in the indictment; I know they were in the premises the night before.</p>

I stopped with him a few minutes, and then saw the prisoner coming along Compton-street, towards St. James's parish; she was coming along Compton-street. I went up to her, she looked very big and bulky, and I turned her shawl aside, and she had a little bag or pillow-case full. We stopped her, and found the articles named in the indictment on her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am articled to an attorney. I have purchased a little property at Whitton, near Hounslow, and have been building a rear deuce on it—I first went to the Tillage about twelve months ago, and took lodgings at the prisoner Smith's residence, to superintend the building—I occupied those lodgings up to about a month since—on 15th or 16th June I purchased a bird of a man named Walker, and on the same evening the two prisoners came down to my house, on my return from a drive, and Goldsbrough claimed the bird—I told him that if he would bring Mr. Walker, and he would say that it was his, he should have it—Smith was present—he turned round, and said, "You b——Jew, what do you mean by doubting my word?"—I then left the cottage, followed by Goldsbrough and Smith—Goldsbrough abused me down the village—I had said nothing to exaspe<lb></lb>rate him more than I have stated—next day I had occasion to pass Golds<lb></lb>brough's house, and he held up a board with "<hi rend="italic">Old Clo</hi>" on it, and on my return from the Magistrate's at Brentford, where I went to take out a summons for abusive language, the house was placarded with other boards, "Hot pies;" "Pork;" "Fried fish;" I have a witness here who took a sketch of the house with the boards—in the afternoon he hooted after me, and gave the boys pence to do the same—the boys told me so—this board (<hi rend="italic">A portrail with a large nose, inscribed, "The portrait of Judas Iscariot</hi>")</p>

               <p>was put up outside the house—I cannot walk down the village now unless I am hooted at—I was never hooted at before the boards were put up—the summons was heard on 28th June, and Goldsbrough was fined 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the boards were not removed that day, but Smith removed them the Sunday afterwards—I saw him do it—I have mistaken the date, the summons was heard on the 28th, but Smith removed them the week before that—Smith said, "If you will withdraw all proceedings, I will take down the boards; if not, they shall hang till they rot"—I said, "Pray take them down, and I will withdraw proceedings," and he took them down on the Sunday before the 28th—it was on Saturday that the summons was heard, and it was on the Sunday before that, that Smith took them down—when he took then down he put them in his own front parlour, and I agreed to withdraw the summons, but a friend told me something on the same Sunday that he removed them, and I went out, and found he had left one in the window, with the words, "To let; no b—Jew or <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man need apply"—on the day after the summons was heard, the 29th, the boards were replaced—I saw Smith bring them from his house, with a man named <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, and Golds<lb></lb>brough assisted him, and said "I will defy the law; I will keep you out of the village"—that course of conduct was continued till 6th July, and on 6th July I went before the Magistrate again—they were both bound over to keep the peace, and the Magistrate cautioned them to remove the boards, but they kept them up till the 9th or 10th, and the same course of conduct was pursued towards me—Goldsbrough called me a Jew vagabond, a Jew <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driver, a scoundrel, and an uncircumcised Jew, and said before some females that I had only half a, and my wife knew it—on the 12th the Magistrate said, "I cautioned you to remove the boards, and you had no business to let them remain a moment longer," and he bound them over to appear here—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) represents the house, with the boards on it, as taken by a gentleman expressly—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watchmaker, of Church-street, Pad<lb></lb>dington. In June last Smith called on me, and asked me if I had heard the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> which had taken place between a man named Goldsbrough and Mr. George—I said, "Unfortunately I have, and I am sorry to think that net disgraceful proceedings have taken place, for Mr. George is very little known as a Jew; and I have been here fourteen years, and never had a word with a single person; and people will think that it is me"—he said that he would take care that people should know that it was not me, but Mr. George; and after they had been before the Magistrate, he called on me, and informed me that the boards had been taken down, but were re<lb></lb>put up, and that other matters would come out against Mr. George which would drive him out of the village—I have heard the prosecutor hooted after, and his family—Mrs. George came and fetched me, and I went with her, and saw some twenty boys, girls, women, and men, Mr. George was attempting to get hold of one of the young men, but I begged him not, but to go home, being Sunday, and I would find the man's name out; and he went home—they were laughing and hooting at him—I cannot say whether Mr. Smith owed Mr. George a grudge, but Mr. Smith wanted to borrow money of him when he lost his wife—he refused, but I lent him some—he spoke of that afterwards to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What day was it that the boys hooted him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Sunday, but I did not take the date down—it was in June, I think—on that very day Mr. Smith called on me—I saw them laughing—I have known Goldsbrough some years, but only by name, till he came to Whitton—I know that he lived in Beaumont-street; I have seen him there—I under<lb></lb>stand he is connected with the law—I do not know him personally.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 147). From 15th June to 6th July I was on duty at Whitton—from 11th June to the 22nd I saw several boards hanging on Goldsbrough's cottage, and on the 29th there were some more boards hung—I believe this sketch to be correct—Mr. George has complained to me from time to time of the annoyance—the boards were taken down two or three days before the Magistrate decided the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did Mr. George make the first complaint to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be three or four days after they were up; it was not before they were there; I am sure of that—I have not seen people congre<lb></lb>gating about the house, nor have I heard people hoot him—nobody has complained to me except Mr. George.</p>

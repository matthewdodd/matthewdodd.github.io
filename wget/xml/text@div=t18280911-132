               <p>LAURENCE ODEL. On Saturday night, the 31st of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110087"></xptr>August, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in Peter-street, Cow-cross, going home to Attfield-street, Goswell-street; I am labourer to Mr. Burgess - I was not quite sober - I knew what I was about; I had two half-crowns and a penny-piece in my right-hand breeches pocket; the prisoner, who was quite a stranger, came up, and wanted to see me home; I said I wanted nobody to see me home; - he said "Oh no, I know you - I will see you home;" I said "I did not want him; and at the corner of <placeName id="t18280911-132-crimeloc687">Peter-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He said he had two half-crowns? Q. Yes: I had been to Fleet-market to buy some water cresses for my daughter, who was ill; I had been to Gray's-inn-lane before that, and had part of a pot of beer among three of us; I went to no other public-house, and drank nothing else till I got to the Cock in Fleet-market; this was about half-past eight o'clock; I staid there about an hour - I went no where else, but stood in the market talking to one and another for perhaps two hours - I had two glasses of gin at the Cock, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. That would hardly have made you tipsy? A. Why, if a person has no bread all day, and his children ill, he is soon made tipsy; I had eat nothing all day but a mouthful of bread in the morning; I was not drunk - I was not lying on my face in the street; two women were going to fight in the market - I held up my hand to part them, and got it scratched; I did not know them - nobody helped me up; I know Mr. Gooch helped me up by Saffron-hill - he did not help me up; I saw no gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there was not another gentleman helping you up when you were lying in the mud? A. I was not laying at all, I was never down - I was walking when the prisoner offered his assistance; nobody else came to assist me that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The women were fighting in the market, not in Peter-street? A. No - I never saw the prisoner till I got to Saffron-hill.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on my beat between twelve and one o'clock on this night; I saw the prisoner and prosecutor turn the corner of Peter-street and Saffron-hill - he had his arms round the prosecutor's waist; I was walking to and fro by my box, opposite to Peter-street, and saw them together for a minute, but took no notice till the prosecutor called me over, and said "This man will not let me go home;" I said to him"Why not let the man go, if you know nothing of him;" he said he knew him perfectly well, and would see him home, and how dare I insult him - that he knew him, and had picked him up drunk, and that he lived in Baltic-street; the prosecutor certainly was not sober, but knew what he was about, and charged him with robbing him of two half-crowns and a penny-piece; the prisoner said"Do you suppose a person of my respectability would go to rob a man like that;" I replied I knew nothing of his respectability, he was charged with felony, and must go to the watch-house; the prosecutor walked very well to the watch-house, and was able to state how he was robbed; as the prisoner was going to be searched, he put his hand into his pocket, took out two half-crowns with an old penny-piece, and gave it to the watch-house man - he was searched further, and no other money found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner walk with you to the watch-house? A. He did - it is about three hundred yards; I did not take hold of him - I had no lantern.</p>
               <p>Q. Walking three hundred yards, he had an opportunity to get rid of the penny-piece? A. I kept my eye on him - there was a light at the watch-house; I saw the prosecutor's face - it was as it is now - it was not scratched all over - it did not appear to me to be scratched; I never heard him say so; he did not say he was robbed till I had been up a minute or a minute and a half - while there was an altercation about his knowing him, he put his hand to his pocket, and said he was robbed of his money - the prisoner was sober, and could see me, and did not attempt to escape.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were close to him? A. Yes, I walked by his side, as I should by any other prisoner.</p>

            . I am the watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought in, charged by the prosecutor with picking his pocket of two half-crowns; he did not mention anything else, till I had searched the prisoner - he then said it was all his money; he was what I call little up, but quite correct in his language; as soon as I caught hold of the prisoner's clothes to search him, he whipped his hand in his pocket, and said - "Here, I have got two half-crowns of your's;" he put them into my hand, and there was a penny-piece with them: the prosecutor said it was his money - I did not search him further.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then is it true he was searched afterwards, and no money found? A. Not to my knowledge - Watson had left the watch-house when I locked him up - he could not have been searched in his presence; the prosecutor said nothing about the penny-piece till I produced it - he and Watson both went away together - the prosecutor's face looked a little dirty, as a man might leave work - I saw no scratch on it.</p>

            . I cannot swear to the half-crowns, but I know the penny-piece - I picked it up on Saturday morning in Old-street; here is a dent, made by it being run over by a cart wheel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see it run over? A. No. I said I had lost two half-crowns and a penny-piece, before it was found; I will swear that - when I came out the watchman went to his beat, and I home; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Friday, the 22d of August, I came to town from my place of business, which is at Lime-house; I received from Mr. Lloyd three half-crowns; I spent two, and had one left, which I offered to Mr. Siret, a bookseller, of Fenchurch, for a small order book - he would not take it, but told me he would book the article: I proceeded home, and on the 23d came to town with Mr. Lloyd, my partner, and parted with him in Mile-end-road - I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110088"></xptr>for some silver, and he gave me another half-crown; I went to the Eagle tavern, City-road, where I had appointed to meet a law-stationer, and spent the evening with him; my share of the reckoning came to 2s.; I had 1d. left - I left there about one o'clock, and walked to Cheapside with Mr. Parker and Mr. Siret; I parted with Mr. Siret, and went home with Mr. Parker - I came down from his house at a quarter-past two o'clock in the morning; proceeded along Castle-street, and when I came under the archway of Norwich-court I saw the prosecutor lying on his face, on the stones - a baker was trying to disturb him from his stupor; we rose him on his legs; he said he lived up there, pointing to Castle-street; we led him to the top of the court where the baker lived, and he left us: I asked the prosecutor where he lived - he said in Baltic-street; I said I was going that way, and would lead him home - he said he would walk quiet, and when we got to Peter-street, he said he would not go further, for I had robbed him, and called the watchman; he charged me at the watch-house with robbing him of two half-crowns, and unfortunately for me I had two half-crowns and a penny-piece.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What made you out so late? A. I happened to be out with a friend - I had been to Leather-lane; I am a journeyman baker, and work for Mr. Dick; I parted with the prisoner just opposite my own door - I did not tell him where I lived; he found me out quite by accident, through a friend of his who came to me where I was at work, three weeks ago; he found me out in Norwich-court - I had parted with the prisoner there about a quarter-past two o'clock; the prosecutor could not speak or stand at first - he came too when we led him a little way; the prisoner said he lived in St. Luke's, and would see him home; I am certain of the time, for I looked at the clock when I went in; I parted with them just opposite my door, and believe the prisoner saw me go in.</p>

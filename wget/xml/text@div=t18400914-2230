                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Harrow. I had a stack of hay in cut—I missed some on the 1st of September, and on the morning of the 2nd some more—Dyer lives within twenty yards of the stack—Phillips brought some hay to roe, it was brown hay, I compared it, and know it to be part of my stack—I missed the full quantity, and Dyer said, voluntarily, "I took the hay off the cut, and put it into Chapman's sack" Chapman is a marine-store dealer—the hay is worth 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 1st of September at Bishopsgate, and between seven and eight o'clock I saw Dyer with a sack of hay—he said he had received it from a farmer's cart named Hill—I watched him, and saw Chapman give him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then he threw the hay into Chapman's cart—I took them both into custody—Dyer told the sergeant he received the hay from Hill's carman—the sergeant took their names, and allowed them to go home, and in the morning they were apprehended again—Chapman keeps a horse and cart, and goes about the country a good deal.</p>

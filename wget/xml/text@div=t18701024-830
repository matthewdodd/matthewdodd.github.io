I am the wife of Cornelius Holland, and live at 48, Golden Lane, St. Luke's, and keep a lodging-house—on the night of 18th October I went up to my room, between 10 and 11 o'clock—I found that the door had been burst open, and when I went in the prisoner dropped out of the window—the padlock had been screwed off—I had fastened it myself about 8.30—it was an inner door—the door of the house was not fast—it is a lodging-house, and I occupy that room on the first floor—the window was open when I went in—I went towards the drawers, and I saw the man go out at the window—I had previously left the window shut—I missed three dozen and a half ancles of clothing of my own and my husband's, worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had seen them safe that evening, because they came home</p>

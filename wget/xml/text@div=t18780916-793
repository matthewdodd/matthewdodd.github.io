I live at 9, Lower John Street, Golden Square—I was at home at about 6.30 p.m. on Bank Holiday, with my sister—at about 8 o'clock the prisoner called and asked if Mr. Kirkham, a lodger of ours, was in—I said no, and asked if he would leave any message—he said he had no message, and left—about an hour after, I went to the first-floor window with my sister and looked out, and saw the prisoner by the King of Prussia, next door but one to us—sometime after he went over to No.? opposite, and knocked twice, and went again to the King of Prussia—about five or ten minutes after he went over again, and then he was constantly knocking and ringing—then I called out and said "I don't think any one is there"—he came in front of our house, and said "My sister is there, and she won't let me in. I think I shall have to stop in the rain; if she does not, I think I shall get over, wouldn't you?"—I said it was not my busineas—he went over, and knocked and rang again—I think we went away from the window for a little while, and we went back to it again in five or ten minntes—he was then on the railings of No. 2, just getting over into the area, and I saw a light come in the kitchen—I shut the windows and pulled down the blind—I had no clock, but I should think it was about 9.40 when I saw the light in the kitchen—after some time I went to the window again, and in about a minute I saw the prisoner open the door, look out, and come out with a bundle—I did not see him take anything in—I told the police the same night.</p>

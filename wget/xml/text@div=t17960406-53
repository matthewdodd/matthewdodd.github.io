            Had he access to the place where this sugar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060042"></xptr>was deposited? - A. Yes. We followed him to Leadenhall-street, opposite the India-House; we called him, and took him to a public-house, and then to the Public-office, Lambeth-street; but in going to the Office, in the coach, from our house, we discovered a quarter of hundred bag under his shirt, it was a paper bag, he was taking a book out, which pulled his shirt a little open, and I saw this bag; it was an empty bag, made similar to some that we have; we searched him at the public-house in Lambeth-street, and found a quantity of sugar in his breeches, and some in his inside pockets, or somewhere about him, but I know the officers took a quantity out of his breeches, some in brown paper bags, and some in handkerchiefs; I told him it would be better for him to confess it.</p>

               <p>Q. In point of fact, had not you, before this time, lent him this bag? - A. I can't say to that bag; I might have lent him other bags.</p>

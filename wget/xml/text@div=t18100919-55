I saw a bullock confined with a rope, and a mob of people following him. In consequence of that I went and took a look at him. As soon I got to Tower-hill, some men attacked me, who confined my hands and my legs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many - A. that I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners - A. I do not know either of the prisoners. I was confined by a set of ruffians, they held up my head at the same time, in consequence of that, I found I was robbed of my watch, a gold chain, and seal.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chain hanging out - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you felt your watch before this - A. Before I went to see this bullock, I had felt it within a quarter of an hour of the time I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since - A. I have not. I followed the persons across Tower-hill, some lads came up, and observed to me, that I had lost my watch, they knew the parties well. They shewed me the parties at the corner of St. Catharine's. I was knocked down, and they repeated the blows at the back of my head; I was senseless. They took me into a house, they desired me to go home, they were a desperate party, they said.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, I live in Moor-lane. O the 4th of July I was out, I saw a bullock and people following him; I saw the prosecutor on Tower-hill, by some railings; there were some people about him; I did not exactly see what they were about; I saw a man come from the crowd with a watch in his hand; his name is Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue in your sight - A. Not long; he gave the watch to another person; I perceived it was a silver watch and a yellow chain; I went to Mr. Jones to show him the man that had the watch last. I saw no more of Williams till he was taken into custody, Mr. Jones followed me, I shewed him the man that had the watch; I watched to see where they went, Fidgeon came out of the house and said d - n your eyes, what do you tell lies of me for, and hit me over the head. Williams had a butcher's mixture jacket on, and a white hat, at the the time I saw him, and when I saw him in custody, between six and seven o'clock, he had his jacket and white hat on.</p>
               <p>MOSES ISAACS. I live with Mrs. Parsons, Shoemaker-row. I was out on the 24th of July, I saw the prosecutor at the corner of a street in Tower-hill. I did not notice what he was doing; I saw a mob of people about Mr. Jones, about thirty; I saw one of them coming away with a chain hanging down his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you judge whether the watch was in his pocket or in his hand - A. In his pocket, with the chain hanging out, so that any body might see it; he ran when he had the chain hanging out.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had the chain hanging out of his pocket were there any seals to the chain or not - A. There were; I did not take notice how many; I am sure there was one, I cannot say whether there was more than one or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who was the man that was running - A. No, I only saw his back; he had a brown great coat on, it was not either of the prisoners, he ran towards the warehouses on Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners - A. No, not till I came into St. Catharine's-lane, and there I saw the two prisoners with a bull, Mr. Jones went to lay hold of another man; Williams struck him over the head with a stick, he was knocked down; Williams was dressed in a white hat. After the bullock was in the slaughter-house, I met Mr. Jones; we went into a public house.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, New-court, Aldgate; I am no trade, I do any thing for a living. On the 4th of July I was on Tower-hill, I saw Mr. Jones standing against the iron railing of King-street, he was standing still, the people with the bull were about six or seven yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there following of the bull - A. Perhaps twenty-four or twenty-five, they were going towards Mr. Jones and passed him, they were fourteen or sixteen that stopped and surrounded him, Williams was one of them, he was dressed in a butcher's mixture jacket and a white hat. I saw some man put his hand to Jones's small cloaths, but to swear that it was the prisoner, I will not. I saw Williams come from the crowd with a gold or metal chain, and one or two seals, but a watch I did not see. Williams ran on following the bullock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he did with the chain, and what he had in his hand - A. I saw him deliver it over to a tall man, dressed in a dark brown great coat. Then the bullock went on towards St. Catharine's-lane, Mr. Jones followed the mob, to try to get one of the prisoners whom he thought had robbed him, and when they came near the Black Boy, St. Catharine's, Fidgeon said, here comes the gentleman that you robbed, or drawed the thimble, or some such words like it. Then three or four turned back with sticks in their hands, Jones stood at the door of the Black Boy, which was open, they struck him, he fell backwards into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Fidgeon among the crowd on Tower-hill - A. Ye, I did; he was in the mob with them that surrounded Jones. They left the bullock at Mr. Smalls. I went into the public house with Mr. Jones, he desired us to give him our direction. After they had left the bullock, Fidgeon came to

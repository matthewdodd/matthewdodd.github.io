I went home with her to her apartment; I had not been with her five minutes before she picked my pocket of my watch, She stepped out of the room; she said she wanted to go and get something to drink, I was surprised to see her go out of the room. I felt for my watch; I went to the door to go out after her; she had locked the door outside, so that I could not go after her. I knocked at the door, she returned in three or four minutes, and asked me what was amiss. I said she had robbed me of my watch, I laid hold of her by the arm, and pulled her to the street door, and hallooed out watch. There came seven or eight women in the passage, and the prisoner made her escape. I went to the watchman and patrole; I could not find her. This was twelve o'clock at night. In eight days afterwards I saw the prisoner again in Drury-lane. She denied having any knowledge of me at all or of my watch. After a good while she confessed where she had pawned my watch; it was pledged at Charing Cross, I went and found the watch.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GODSON. I live with my uncle. On the 6th of December, about half-past five in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18170115-172-crimeloc941">Holborn</placeName>

I went on and took no notice, when Barker came up and offered to fight me, I had said nothing to them, I refused; Price jumped up and took off my hat, I took it from him, and went into Holborn-court; when I was in the middle of the court the same boys came up to me again, and took off my hat, they ran by and threw a hat away; I picked it up, thinking it was mine, but it was not. I pursued them and called out, stop thief! the two prisoners ran towards Bellingham-buildings. I followed them, they parted, and I collared Knight, he said he had not got the hat, but the other boy had, pointing to Price. Barker came up, and said he could show me where the hat was, and took me to Holborn-court; as I was going along Knight attempted to put his hand into my pocket, I turned round, and he ran away. Barker looked down Holborn-court, and said the hat was not there. I afterwards went with Barker to Air-street-hill; he said Knight lived there-he was not at home, Barker then ran off. I gave information at the Police-Office, and the two prisoners were taken into custody the next night. I am sure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150070"></xptr>the two prisoners were with the other boys when I lost my hat.</p>

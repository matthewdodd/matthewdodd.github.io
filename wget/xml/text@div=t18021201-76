I missed three small silver spoons, but nothing further till my wife came down.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH FEETCHER sworn. I am wife to the last witness; we went to bed on the 18th of November about ten o'clock, after my husband had seen the house was fastened, in which he is very particular; a little after three in the morning we heard a noise but did not suspect it ws at our house; in the morning we found the back parlour window open, and the sash quite up; I went into the yard, and found the shutter standing against the side, without any hinges; which were lost on the frame, and the bell was on the ground; which I cannot account for not ringing; I found a tea-chest, a bird-cage, but the bird was gone, and a little short dirty pipe; I then went in and missed the spoons and my red coak, two pocket handkerchiefs, a pepper box, a chair cover, and a pair of nankeen breeches. I have seen the cloak, the chair cover, and pair of nankeen breeches.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTONG sworn. I am an officer, belonging to Worship-street; On Friday the 19th of November, I went with Mason and Vickery between ten and eleven to a house in Nichol-row, Beual-greet, about six or eight minutes walk from Fletcher's when I opened the door I saw Mrs. Blake and Mrs. Robinson in a room below, Mrs. Blake was sitting with a child in her lap, and a little girl standing by her; I said I had a warrant to search the house, and disired Vickery to go outside the door to watch; I left Mason below while I went up stairs to search, I found a bed on the floor, and another on a bedstead; I desired Mason to let nobody to go out for I was in possession of some goods which I had found on the bed, (producing a table cloth, a pair of breeches, and a chair cover, which were identified by Mrs. Fletcher); I secured those goods with others, and chucked them down to Mason; I then went down and asked Mrs. Robinson who they belonged to; Mrs. Blake said, it is nothing to you; in a few minutes after Vickery brought Blake in; then the prisoner were all secured, taken to the office, and committed: On Monday the prosecutrix brought a memorandum to the office of some goods she had lost; I then shewed her the things I had taken from the house with the prisoners, and she owned some of them; I desired William Blake to pick out what was his own, and be picked out the chair cover, the table cloth, and breeches which have been sworn to by the prosecutrix, and said they were his.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - On the 19th of November I went with Armstrong and Mason to Nichols-row; they went into a house, and I went into a public-house very near, which I know Blake used I saw him standing by the fire, I called him out and told him I wanted him, and he must go along with me, for that Armstrong was at his house searching for some goods; he went close before me, and I folowed him into the house where Armstrong was; he was asked what property belonged to him, he ownned some of the things, and some he would not own; when we were taking them to the office, he said he had been in that house three weeks as a lodger, that some little difference had happened to him respecting some business in the city, for which he had left his house, and that his wife had only come down there that morning to bring him some breakfast; I knew him before very well when he used to keep an old iron shop in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street I then went and examined the prisecutor's house, which is next to a corner, and found they were obliged to get over the neighbour's wall at the corner, and there to break through a little fence, that fenced off a garden; I saw the shutter had been forced off by means of a large chissel or a crow; and I saw a pipe with some tobacco in it.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON sworn. - I asked Mrs. Blake and Robinson who was the owner of the house; Robinson said it was her house, and that Blake had lodged there a little while; I asked her how the things came there without her knowledge; she said she was a milk woman, and went out very early in the morning, and they might have been brought in, in her absence.</p>

            's defence. - I was under some difficulties, and went to Robinson's house, who I am positive is innocent, to secrete myself, and staid there for three weeks; I used to go about with fish, and last Friday I went to Billingsgate and returned to the public-house about nine o'clcok in the morning; I neither saw the property, or knew any thing of it, till the offficers apprehended me; Armstrong asked me whether any of the property belonged to me, and I told him it did not, but took up some of own things, and the table cloth, and nankeen drawers were intermixed with them; the chair-cover I never saw, and I believe they were secreted for the purpose of taking away the life of a poor individual like me.</p>

I am the wife of Robert John Allen—I was married to him on Christmas-day last—I have my certificate, if it is required—he is a hatter, working at Mr. Heath's, in Oxford-street—I hare known the prisoner about eighteen months—I am not related to her, she has taken the name of Allen—on 26th January last, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I was with my husband at Mr. Heath's, in Oxford-street—as we were coming out of there I saw the prisoner standing close by—we all three went into a public-house and had a pint of beer together—she said she had been walking about all the morning without anything, and had no money, and I felt very sorry for her and gave her sixpence, which was all I had but three-halfpence—my husband left us and returned to his em<lb></lb>ployment—the prisoner wished me to go and hare some refreshment with her—I did so, the prisoner paying for it out of the money I had given her—she sat by my side at the public-house drinking with me—I missed her from my side—I did not notice her getting up till I saw her standing aslant of me with a pint measure in her hand—she then threw something upon me, and said, "There, take that"—there had not been an angry word between us—something went over me which caused a great burning sensation, and the immediate loss of the sight of one eye—it extended all over the left side of the face, neck, chest, and left arm—here are the marks on my arm now—she was standing a very short distance from me at the time she did it—had she gone further round, the whole of the contents of the pot would have gone over me—the greater portion went over my clothes, which were burnt to a cinder—it caused me great pain—I have entirely lost the sight of one eye, and am still suffering—I am still in the hospital.</p>

               <p>nine or ten months of that time—on the day in question I was at my employment at Mr. Heath's, when my wife came to bring me my dinner—I did not see the prisoner that day until I went out to my wife, but I had heard of her being outside an hour and a half previously—when I went out with my wife the prisoner followed me into the public-house, without my consent—I called for a pint of porter—the prisoner had some of it—I think my wife passed her the pint pot, saying at the same time, "I hope you bear me no ill-will or animosity"—the prisoner answered, "My dear creature, I would not wish to injure a hair of your head; but as for your husband, I will see that he does not exist after another fortnight"—I then returned to my employment—up to the time of my leaving there had not been a single word of disagreement between the prisoner and my wife—the prisoner has studied a variety of occupations during the time I have known her—her last employment was, I believe, book-binding—I never knew her to be in any employment in which she would use oil of vitriol—I know that she has had it in her possession while she was with me mouths previous to this, and I questioned her about it—she said it was to clean some articles—I said, "You have got about eight penny worth of vitriol to clean articles not worth a penny"—she said she had bought it of a manu<lb></lb>facturer very cheap—I said I would not have it in the place, for I was very suspicious of it, and I threw it away.</p>

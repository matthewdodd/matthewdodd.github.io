                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel McKeon, a boot maker, at 39, York Street, Westminster—in 1867, I was in possession of eighteen Rus<lb></lb>sian bonds, worth 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I kept in an iron box—I was then living at Stibbington Street, Oakley Street, St. Pancras—I have known the prisoner 36 years—in August, 1868, I was taken ill and she induced me to go and stay with her—she was then living at 2, Barrett's Court, Wigmore Street—I went there, and took my bonds with me—she put them under my bed, in the framework of the bedstead I slept in—I never saw them after that—I never gave her permission to take them or use them—I went with her to Rothschild's to get the interest of the money, in Mr. Bray's cab, from the Caledonian Road—she went into Rothschild's and left me outside in the cab—she had taken a public-house at 12, Back Hill, Clerkenwell, and we went back there afterwards—when I came back, I said "Where is my box?" the prisoner said "What box do you mean?" I said "The iron box that my papers are in," she said "I put it in the usual place"—I asked for my box because I began to have a suspicion—I have asked her continually since then to see the bonds, and I have never seen a sight of them—when I demanded them from her, she said she had put them in the hands of a clergyman—I left her in January, this year, and returned home to my husband—I did not take my bonds back with me—I believe they were sold at that time—before I went to live at Barrett's Court I used to look at my bonds every day—the prisoner took my keys from my pocket when I was ill—I left my husband ten years ago to mind my mother—she is an eccentric character—I never gave the prisoner the bonds, or made her a present of them—do you suppose I should give them to her—they were in the name of my mother, Honora Austin.</p>

Russian bond to pledge for me—I never received part of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got the money to pay my rent from Rothschild's and paid her every halfpenny—the prisoner got the money from Rothschild's, I went with her but did not get out of the cab—the prisoner got me to pay her rent under pretence that her daughter was dying—I got that money from Mr. Smith, he owed it to me—the prisoner did not negociate any of these bonds for me—I did not hand her the box when she took the public-house; I was not in London—she always knew I had the bonds—I gave her them to take care of, but not to go and spend them—I did not tell her, when I gave her the bonds to take care of, that she could negociate them and make a comfortable place for me; that never entered my head.</p>

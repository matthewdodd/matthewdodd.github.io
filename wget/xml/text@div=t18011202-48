               <p>MARY DYE sworn. - On the 16th of October last, between nine and ten, this man met me promiseuously in the Strand, and asked me if I would have any thing to drink, which I did; he then took me to a house called the Ship and Horseshoe, East Smithfield, and called for a quartern of gin; he said, he had no money; I presented a seven-shilling piece, which proved to be bad; I gave another, which proved bad also, innocent of me; the landlord then called in two watchmen to know how much more money of that kind I had about me; I had no more of any kind; I then presented my silver watch for payment, but the landlord would not take it; after that, the prisoner called for another quartern of gin; I did not like the appearance of the man, so I took the watch, and put it into my bosom; when the gin was drank, we went out; he led me up a yard, and drew the watch from my bosom; I said, where is the watch; upon which he knocked me down, and I was left insensible on the ground; the watchman found me, and took me to the watch-house; I challenged the prisoner on Tuesday following at Somerset-house, upon which he run away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long were you in company at this house? - A. About three quarters of an hour; I can swear he is the same man who drew the watch from my bosom; I lost also a cloak, a silver pencil, and a pocket handkerchief; my pocket was turned inside out when I came to myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Who paid for the gin? - A. He, after he saw the watch, paid for both; I never recovered any of the things.</p>

             sworn. - I am a publican, and keep the Ship and Horseshoe; I remember the prisoner and prosecutrix coming to my house on the 16th of October, between eleven and twelve at night; I am sure they are the persons; he knocked at the door, I said it was too late; my wife said, it is Cochran, he wants his crutch, which he has left at our house; he had been away fourteen or fifteen months, but had just come back again; I served them with the gin, and the girl offered me a seven-shilling piece to change; I said it was a bad one; she then tendered me another, which was bad; upon that, I snatched both up, and said I must have her searched, and called in the watchman; no other money was found, except one farthing; she tendered me a silver watch for payment; I refused it; then he said, bring us another quartern, which I did; says he, don't take and lend the poor girl away, I believe she is very innocent, though I never saw her in my life before; says I, my dear, are you an unfortunate girl; she said, she was; and as such I let her go; he said, he believed she was innocent again, and paid for the gin; they then went out of the house, and bid me good night; it was between eleven and twelve when they came, and about twelve when they went away; I could not see that she was any way in liquor; they had three quarterns of gin, or two, I cannot tell which; about three o'clock the headborough rung, and asked me if a man and woman had been there; I said, yes; he asked me if I knew where they lived; I said, I did not; he said, the woman had been robbed by the man who had been drinking with her, in Black-Horseyard; about two or three days after, the prisoner came back to the house, and said to me, have you heard any thing about this piece of work? I said, what; he said, about this girl; I said, yes; he alied for half a pint of gin, and said, is there any danger in my being here; I said, I don't know; that was all he said; I believe he is a sea-faring man.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH RAWLINSON sworn. - I am headborough; just before three o'clock on the 17th of October, alarm was given of the robbery; I saw the woman about five o'clock, and she appeared as sober as she is now; I went to Etherington's, who described him to me, and his name, by which I knew him; I went to search for him, but could not find him, and I gave informa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020038"></xptr>tion to the officers; Black-Horse-yard is a very bye-place.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS sworn. - On the 18th of October, I received information of this young woman being robbed; I desired Nowlan to go with me; a day or two after, I had two warrants against the prisoner for beating two women; I carried one to the Thames-Police, and we were informed he was in custody for robbing a ship, but we were told there was reason to suppose he would be discharged; and we attended again, when he was delivered over to us; Nowlan had a warrant to serve elsewhere, and the prisoner and I went together to the Ship and Horseshoe, the corner of Nightingale-lane; I saw the landlady, and asked her if that was the man along with the young woman; she said, it was; going along, I asked him how he came to rob her; he made very little answer to that, but said, he did not hurt her; says I, you knocked her down in the passage going to Black-Horse-yard, and robbed her of her watch; he replied again, he did not hurt her, and hoped he should not be hanged for it; I said, I hoped not; says I, the young woman saw you at Somerset-house, going there to receive your pay; he made but little answer to that, but, going along, he said, if I could only be transported for it, I should be glad to take that now for my chance; I then took him to the Office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is not in my power to say any thing after what they have said, for they have said that which is most false; I leave it to God and the world to judge of my innocence; I left the woman sitting on the steps; as soon as I came out, I said, my good girl, I will leave you here, I don't think proper to go any further with you, as you had liked to have got me into trouble about the bad money; I then left her sitting on the steps, for she was so drunk, she could hardly stand; indeed we were both drunk together. If I had been guilty, I should have gone away, but I never slept one night out of the parish; I was not one night out of Rosemary-lane; I left her on the steps, and never walked with her after; my crutch I had left off but two days, after having used it for nine months, with a bad leg, with sixty holes in it, which I got by a wound on board a ship.</p>

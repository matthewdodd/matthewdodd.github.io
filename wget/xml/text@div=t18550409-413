                  </hi>. I am a draper, of No. 20, Fore-street, Cripplegate. The prisoner was in my service about four months—in consequence of certain matters which had transpired, on 27th Feb. I marked four shillings and a sixpence; I put it in a piece of paper, and put it in my pocket; it remained there till tea time, between 5 and 6 o'clock, when I went up stairs to tea—I left the prisoner in the shop—my other shopman, Mr. George, was up stairs at tea with me, and Mumford, an apprentice—I had on a pair of heavy boots—I had suspected the prisoner for a long time—I went up stairs to the room above, and took off my heavy boots, and came down stairs very lightly, while the prisoner was at tea; I passed the door that was open as he sat at tea, and went down stairs to the shop—I put 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the marked money on the desk, and gave Mr. George the two other marked shillings—Mr. George was then alone in the shop; he had not then been up to tea—I gave George certain directions with reference to the two shillings—I then went up stairs again very lightly, to the room where I had gone before, put on my heavy boots again, and came down just as the prisoner was coming out of the dining room from his tea—he went down to the shop, and I went into the tea room—Mr. George came up about half a minute afterwards, and made some communication to me—I immediately went down stairs, looked on the desk, and there found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said to the prisoner, "Will you walk up stairs with me?"—he said, "Yes," and walked up—we went into the tea room—I shut the door, and said, "Mr. George, Mr. Richard<lb></lb>son, one of you two is robbing me"—I addressed both of them—I said to Mr. George, "Will you show me the money that you have got in your pocket, whether it is yours, or mine?"—he showed me his money directly—I think it was half a crown, and some coppers; I do not think there were any shillings, or sixpences—none of it was marked—the prisoner then said, "Perhaps you would like to see mine?"—I said, "I should like to see the contents of your pockets"—he pulled out a <hi rend="italic">porte-monnaie.</hi> and in that was</p>

               <p>sundry silver, shillings and sixpences, in different compartments—he put them on the table—I did not touch them; I looked, and saw there was none of my marked money—I said to him, "Is that all the money you have got?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You must feel in your pockets, as I think you have got some more, for I have just lost a shilling"—he said, "No, I have not"—he hesitated, and seemed quite confused; after a time, he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and said, "Oh! here is a shilling"—I looked at that shilling; it was one of those which I had marked—I told him it was mine—I told him it was a marked shilling, and showed him where it was marked—he said he had had it by him for a long time—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; the mark is across the "one"—I recollect the date also, 1824, and it was one of George the Fourth's—I told him that he was a very great thief, and he had been thieving from me a very long time—I did not mention the amount; I was in a very great rage with him, and told him if he did not leave my house that very minute, if I ever saw him again, I would give him into custody—he said he would, if I would let him have his boxes—I said no more, but went down stairs, got a policeman, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. On 27th Feb., Mr. Adams gave me two shillings, and also gave me certain directions—I took a note of whether they were marked or not—I saw that they were marked—as soon as the prisoner came down from tea I gave him a bill to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and likewise gave him the two shillings which Mr. Adams had given to me—I had made out that bill, in consequence of Mr. Adams's directions, before the prisoner came down from tea—I told the prisoner that a customer who was just gone out of the shop had paid it, and I had given the halfpenny in change—I requested him to place the two shillings on the desk—if I had received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a customer, it would be the ordinary course to give it to the prisoner, with the bill, and tell him to put it on the desk—that was done while Mr. Adams was away—the prisoner walked towards the desk—when he got to the desk he asked me whether I had taken any more money while he was up at tea—I said I had not—he said, "Then there is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. here altogether"—I had seen 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the desk five or six minutes previous to my giving him the two shillings—no one else could have taken a shilling away from there, except the prisoner—there was no one else in the house except myself—I then went up and made a communication to Mr. Adams—he went down, and shortly returned with the prisoner—after locking the door, he said to me, "Mr. George, some one has been robbing me; have you any objection to show what money you have? I have missed a shilling since I came up to tea"—I told him I had no objection whatever to take out what money I had, and I did so—the prosecutor looked at it, and said none of them were his—he then asked the prisoner if he would show him what money he had belonging to him—the prisoner took out his purse, and took from one partition money to the amount of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I am not certain to the exact amount, and said he thought that was all he had, but on looking in another part of the purse he discovered two sixpences more—it was a purse with several divisions—the prosecutor looked at them, and said they did not belong to him—the prisoner then said that was all the money he had—the prosecutor then asked him to search his waistcoat pockets, to see whether he had not any there—after a few seconds he drew forth another shilling from his waistcoat pocket, saying, "Oh, I have got another shilling"—the prosecutor looked at that shilling, and said that was the shilling he had lost, and he asked me whether it was not one that he had given me to give to the prisoner—I took it up and looked at it, and said it was the same—the prisoner said that he had changed half a sovereign the night before, and he might have had it in that—the prosecutor asked him where he had changed it—he said he did not know the name of the house—the prosecutor told him if he chose to go out of his house, and never put foot in It any more, he was at liberty to do so, but he was not to stay another minute in the house, if he did he would give him into custody—the prisoner had told me the previous day that he had no change in his pocket less than a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note after paying the washerwoman—that was about 1 o'clock in the afternoon—when Mr. Adams said if he stayed another minute he would give him into custody, he asked to have his box—the prosecutor told him if he remained another minute in the house he would call a policeman, and the prosecutor got up and went out of the room—the prisoner followed him, and he was given into custody.</p>

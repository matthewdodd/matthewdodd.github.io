             on the 16th, between eight and nine; we saw the prisoner go into a house, and we pursued him, and in searching him I found this Bible, we secured him, and took him to the watch-house, and he was committed the next day; the next morning finding the prosecutor's name, Mr. Cock, on the Bible, I went to him, and desired him to come down, he said he had been robbed, and lost some things; I told him to come down to the Public Office, in East Smithfield; he came there, and swore to the property; here are his wife's name, and children's name in the Bible.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my Bible; I know it; I bought it; it has my name on it, and my brothe'rs name, and children's name, in my own writing; this is the Bible I left in the window that night, and this glass over the mantle-shelf; there is a piece out of the corner, and there is a piece out of this; this is my hat; here is the man's name where I bought it, and tallow-grease upon it, as I mentioned before I saw it, and this laid on the drawers.</p>

               <p>I was going along, and saw these things lay; I picked them up; seeing this man's house open I went in, and asked him if they belonged to him? and he said no; and before I could say any thing else this man came in and took me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses; they waited so long they could not wait any longer.</p>
               <p>Had the pane of glass that was opposite to the handle of the casement, been broke before? - No, it was not; it was whole when I went out.</p>
               <p>And you can positively swear that you fastened the window yourself before you went out? - I can.</p>
               <p>Jury to prisoner. How old are you? - Going of thirteen.</p>

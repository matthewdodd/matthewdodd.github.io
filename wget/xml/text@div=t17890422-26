               <p>The prisoner lodged at the house where I did, at Hogsdon; he had been there about eight days before I lost my things; I lost them on the 13th; there were two beds in the same room; he had one, and I the other; and when I got up I laid my things on the box; on Monday morning I got up at five o'clock, it was on the 13th of October, and went to work; I left my coat, it was a blue coat, and a white dimity waistcoat; I left the prisoner in bed when I got up, and returned home at night about seven, when I missed my things; the prisoner was not at home then; the next time I saw him was in Tothill-fields in custody, it was two months after; I heard of it from the people where I lodged, they said, he was taken up; I found him at Tothill-fields; I found my coat and waistcoat at Mrs. Lowe's in Baldwin's Gardens; I did not ask him to tell me where they were; he told another person, of the name of Clark, first, and then he told me, that he pawned them on the same day in Baldwin's Gardens; it was the first time I saw him there that he told me; I first asked him, how he did? and then he said, he had taken my clothes, and had pawned them in Baldwin's Gardens for 18 s.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you hear the conversation between him and Clark? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Is Clark here? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Why did not you bring Clark here?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not the witness issue a warrant against me for taking the things; and when he came to Tothill-fields Bridewell, he tore it, and said nothing should hurt me? - No, my Lord, I did not; he was in for another offence; after he told me where the things were, I said I wished he was out.</p>

               <p>Clark and another person came first, and after some conversation, they persuaded me to tell where the things were, and that they were sure he would not hurt me; that he was a working man, and had been out of work some time, and that it would be easier for him to take them out than buy others, as they supposed I had not pawned them for the value; afterwards the prosecutor came in, and I told him where they were; and he said he would not hurt me.</p>

               <p>I am a hackney coachman. On the 12th of December I was in Hatton Garden rank, a little before six; I knew Jones, but not his coach; I saw a coach driven away, out of the rank, by a man in a great coat, and a white wig.</p>
               <p>Court. How many coaches did you see turn in that manner? - Somebody called coach; and then Mr. Fox tried to get the job; and then another coach turned out of the rank, and drove down Fetter-lane; the cry for the fare came from the right hand side, where he turned about.</p>

               <p>I live servant at the Green-yard. I remember a man bringing a coach, the 12th of December, about six o'clock; the prisoner is the man; he said, his name was John Green; he said, he found it near Snow-hill, without a driver, and that it was a stray; they get one shilling each horse, and one shilling for the carriage; I pay that by my master's orders; the owner pays nine shillings; the prisoner came again the next day, with another coach; and told me his name was Thomas Green; then he recollected himself, and said, I told you last night Johnny Green; Oh! says I, I shall not alter it; call in two hours, and I will pay you; mean time I sent to Mountain, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The coach was a strayed coach.</p>
               <p>Have you been an old coachman? - I have been a piece of a one, in my life time.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Five and fifty. I have no witnesses.</p>

I went to the British Queen beer-shop, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, and found the three prisoners there—the door was partly open, and on seeing us, they got out at the back-parlour window—Taggett lives at the house in St. James'-court a long with a girl—I cannot say that he occupied the room, but the woman he lives with did—I have seen him come in and out of the court, but not of the house, for about a fortnight.</p>

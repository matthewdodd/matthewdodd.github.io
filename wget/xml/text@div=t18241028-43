On the 18th of October, in the afternoon, as I was coming in with my pots I saw the prisoner coming down the stairs; he went into the yard - I followed him; he turned round and came out again: I stopped him, and saw the gown under his apron; I opened the parlour door, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got a thief;" he said a girl had given it to him; I called my servant, and he said she was not the girl.</p>

            . You have already collected from the stating this indictment, what the nature of the offence imputed to these defendants is; and as it certainly bespeaks that this is a case which will occupy much of your time, it is undoubtedly my duty to abstain from wasting it; and, gentlemen, in discharging the duty imposed on me as counsel for the prosecution (not a very pleasant one) I shall endeavour to draw your attention to the evidence I shall lay before you, with a very few observations on that evidence. Gentlemen, the indictment charges, that Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150157"></xptr>Jacques, conspiring, with the other defendants, to impute to the prosecutor the crime of murder, did in the progress and carrying into execution that conspiracy, file an indictment against the prosecutor, that the prosecutor was in consequence thereof, indicted, tried, and acquitted. By this time, gentlemen, I am certain you feel that no enquiry can be imagined more important than the present, except that which forms the preliminary enquiry; I mean the enquiry into the guilt of the present prosecutor. Gentlemen, on this occasion I desire that you will feel no alarm, left this prosecution should have any effect to prevent proper enquiries on the death of any of the king's subjects; no man can feel more than I do the necessity of such enquiries being perfectly free, and that nothing should occur to shake such enquiries; on the other hand, nothing can be more important than to guard innocence, and to shelter virtue from the wicked and malevolent attacks of their adversaries; therefore, undoubtedly, though on the one hand, every prosecution that has a probable cause in it, when the death of one of the king's subjects is the point of enquiry, ought to be encouraged; yet on the other hand, if there should be bad men found, equal to the task of forging accusations against others, and supporting such accusations by evidence before grand juries, that also forms a very serious enquiry. Gentlemen, the charge against Mr. Clipson is not that of any ordinary mode of putting another man to death; it does not impute to him, that he brought this man, Hart, to his end, by poison, or by any other violence, but by a specific art, which I am now about to state to you from the indictment, namely, that Hart being a prisoner, and Clipson the deputy turn-key, he placed this man in an unwholsome, damp, and inconvenient room, without his consent, knowing it was an improper place; and that in consequence of that improper treatment and confinement, Hart came to his end; that is the charge. Now, gentlemen, the law is so attentive to the situation of prisoners, that in all cases where a man dies in gaol, it is provided that the coroner's inquest should be summoned, to prevent improper treatment, and to take care that nothing of malice or malevolence should prevail. Gentlemen, in producing the evidence I have to lay before you, I shall first produce the record of Mr. Clipson's acquittal; but I do not stop there; I mean, if I am permitted by the Court, to go into a full and ample and labourious investigation of all the circumstances that attended Hart's preceding illness and death, as fully as if Mr. Clipson was on his own trial; and I do it with this view, to shew you not that he is innocent, but that it is impossible any man alive, from the moment Hart became sick, to his death, or to this moment, can, acting on any fair opinion, on any serious investigation, have believed for a single moment, that his imprisonment in that strong room, either occasioned his death, led to it, or in the smallest degree whatever accelerated it. When I have established the innocence of Mr. Clipson; when I have established the impossibility of any man believing he was guilty, it seems to me I shall have got a considerable way on the journey I have undertaken. I undertake to prove to you that there was malice in those who have indicted him; that there was no reasonable or probable cause for the accusation; if I shew you that you must agree he did not come at his death by those means, I have accomplished a great part of my task. Gentlemen, in general we do not meet with defendants so hardy as I am obliged to state the present defendants to have been; in general, defendants of this complexion shrink from the investigation of the public eye, and do not court public inspection; but I shall shew you, that, antecedent to the death of Hart, that this was looked to as a thing to be hoped for: and that Mr. Jacques, at the head of this conspiracy, talked of it, not doubting but it would prove lucky and desirable; and he did not leave us in doubt of his malice or malevolence; but he stated in terms, in the presence of Mr. Barclay, and in the hearing of witnesses that I shall call, that if Hart should die, then, said he, it will be a lucky<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150158"></xptr>shewn to Dr. Norris, and other witnesses for the prisoner.]</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I am struck with so great an awe, appearing before this grand tribunal, that I fear I shall fall very short in making a defence to meet so heavy a charge as that on which I stand before you; at the same time I feel myself happy that I am before a jury who are men of property and character, and where I may expect that justice which is the grand characteristic of an English jury. The situation I have always held in life, I flatter myself, has been very respectable; my connections have been amongst the bettermost kind of people; and although from the first of my entering into life I have been unfortunate, I cannot accuse myself of being any ways criminal. At the age of twenty years I found myself in possession of a sum of money very little short of ten thousand pounds, an age much too young to turn it to advantage: I thought mankind honest as myself, therefore I the more easily fell into the snares that were laid for me; for every one seemed to court my friendship; and it was who should be first to serve me. At the age of twenty-five I formed a connection with a man who at this time is in a very great line of business, and lost very near five thousand pounds; and I was almost the only sufferer, as a scheme was laid for me, being known to he a man of property; and I was continually arrested, and sometimes imprisoned, while those who were in partnership with me went unmolested: I do not mean to cast any reflection upon my partner's conduct; but it had been better for me during the distress I have since suffered, if he had been endowed with a more liberal heart. That every one to whom we stood indebted, might receive their just demand, I put into the hands of a worthy alderman all my estates, which were sold at public sale to the best advantage, and paid every man twenty shillings in the pound, after which I believe I had a surplus of near one thousand pounds, which I went into business with in the drapery line, in Cheapside; but still fortune was unkind; I was continually harrassed, and became a bankrupt; but so good an opinion had my creditors of me, that upon my examination not one appeared against me, but pitied my situation, and liberally assisted me afterwards; for the course of seven years I indured every kind of distress and hardship; penury and want were continually my companions; still I did not swerve from that which is just, but bore my unhappy situation with a becoming fortitude, and would rather starve than be guilty of a meanness. Fortune once more smiled, and I found myself happily situated as master of the riding school in Gray's-inn-road; there I thought my sorrows and sufferings were at an end, and that the latter part of my life would prove much more favourable than the beginning; my business flourished, my family seemed happy, and I was quite contented: when, dreadful thought! I took into co-partnership a young man from the country, who soon formed an unlawful connection with my wife, robbed me of most of my property, set off for France, and remained there three years, until they had squandered all away; once more I was reduced to poverty, in which state, gentlemen, I now stand before you: and, gentlemen of the jury, as men, as Christians, and no doubt, many of you fathers of a family, picture to yourselves my distresses; robbed of my property, of the partner of my bed, by whom I had had seventeen children; but what must her feelings have been upon cool reflection; she, that should have been the protectress of her family, in one moment, by one base act, brought into a state of beggary; I hope God has forgiven her. Gentlemen of the jury, I have now living five children, which I am happy to say have been taught a proper sense of their duty both to God and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150160"></xptr>will necessarily force me to state to you some other offences, in which Mr. Jacques stands involved; and I would not have attempted that, if I had not persuaded myself that my Lord will be of opinion, it is perfectly regular in point of evidence. In 1787, Mr. Jacques was committed to the Fleet, as a debtor; till 1789 he enjoyed the indulgence of the rules of the Fleet; in that time it happened that several actions were brought against the Warden, for the supposed escape of Mr. Jacques, for whether real or supposed, it is all the same: On the 17th of June, 1789, Mr. Jacques was ordered to be brought within the walls, and from that period Mr. Jacques never ceased day nor night to endeavour to work the ruin of the Warden and his Deputy Mr. Clipson; he promised that he would be the ruin of them both, and seems never to have lost sight of that intention. Mr. Jacques accordingly entered into a conspiracy with other persons to procure a person of the name of Shanley to be charged in execution in the Fleet with debts to the amount of a large sum of money, and procured the escape of that Shanley. -</p>

               <p>Mr. Jacques. May I be permitted to interrupt Mr. Garrow. I beg your Lordship's pardon: I have no counsel: I have no sort of objection to his going into that case, if he goes into it fully.</p>
               <p>Court. He must follow his own discretion, as to the use he proposes to make of that case; while he is in the regular way, he must not be interrupted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Gentlemen, I knew too well the great risque I should run in stating any thing improper before his Lordship. I proceed to state to you the circumstances I was mentioning when Mr. Jacques interrupted me, and to shew you, under my Lord's direction, how they appear to me to apply; and I desire, if it should turn out that my judgment is erroneous, you will do Mr.

             the justice to reject it, and then the prosecutor will be the only person to suffer by his counsel: I have stated to you, that Mr. Jacques had entered into the conspiracy to which I have alluded: Clipson was the turnkey of the prison at that time; he was also the witness against Mr. Jacques: upon his testimony, undoubtedly, a great deal of the weight of that prosecution depended. Now for the application of this observation, I shall shew you, that after the escape of Shanley, after Mr. Jacques felt the weight of Clipson's evidence upon that business, Mr. Jacques contrived this prosecution for murder, knowing the active part that Clipson had taken: he spoke of the death of Hart as a lucky event that would enable them to get rid of Clipson; and men who are ready enough to wish to accomplish their intent at any rate, would look upon this as a lucky event.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. I only wish to observe to you, Mr. Garrow, that both your indictments were presented at the same time.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Jacques, with respect to your observations on the opening, the proper time will be for you to be heard in your defence, you will then be heard with just as little interruption on the part of the counsel, as the counsel must now be heard on the part of the prosecution.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Gentlemen, it would have been wise in Mr. Jacques not to have made that observation; because, though the two indictments were preferred together, the escape of Shanley was effected on the 28th of August, 1789, which was antecedent to the death of Hart, and subsequent to his confinement in the strong room, and discharge. Gentlemen, with respect to the different shares that the different persons now before you took in carrying on that prosecution against Clipson, it is not material for me to state to you, though it would be more correct if I was able to do it, which I am not; it is enough to shew you their frequent consultations on the subject, and to shew you the hand-writing of some of them, and various other acts which mark them to be the authors of it. Mr. Jackson was the prosecutor, Mr. Jacques was the foundation of it, and he proceeded step by step to its completion, and has had the merit of not deserting it to the end; and after the acquittal of Clipson, he has been indiscreet enough, even on the eve of this trial, to boast of the share he had in that prosecution of Clipson, for murder. Gentlemen, I have, I hope, satisfied you, in the first place, that Mr. Clipson was innocent of the charge; from whence it seems to me that there is a strong inference that those who knew all the circumstances of the death, must have acted not from virtuous, but from vicious principles; and with respect to Mr. Jacques, particularly, I have stated to you that I mean to prove facts and declarations of his intention to ruin the Warden and Clipson. Gentlemen, more does not remain to me but to call the witnesses; with respect to the punishment, that is in the hands of the court: and if you find the defendants guilty, it will be properly administered.</p>

               <p>Was you clerk of the papers at the time of the commitment of Hart to the strong room? - I believe I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I do not take him to have proved any thing.</p>

               <p>Are you a prisoner there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My Lord, the Warden of the Fleet would not permit any of our witnesses to be brought up without a Habeas Corpus; therefore I trust, if these witnesses come without, they come under influence, and I hope your Lordship will not examine them.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you must make the observations to the jury in the course of your defence: it is no objection to the testimony of the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you in the Fleet when Hart was a prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you with him in the strong room? - Several times, I heard a noise, that Hart was taken to the strong room; to the best of my knowledge I believe it was about eleven at night.</p>
               <p>What was the sort of noise that you heard? - A kind of uproar: a number of people assembled together and made a great noise, and they said Hart was carried to the strong room. I frequently visited him, not in the strong room, but at the window: It is a room in that part of the prison which they term (it is a very odd name to strangers) they call it

               <p>Was it a cold, damp room, unwholesome, and unfit for confinement? No: it was a good room; Hart had superfluity of accommodations, plenty of fire, and plenty of good victuals and drink. I attended him, and saw it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any complaints from him? - I cannot particularly say I did: I heard him say that he would write to a vast number of people, and that it was very improper to put him there: he wanted for nothing. I eat and drank there very often with him.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue there? - I do not exactly know; but I believe sixteen or seventeen days.</p>
               <p>What manner of man was he in his conduct; was he a regular steady man? - He was quite worn out before he went there.</p>
               <p>He was a man addicted to drinking and debauchery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did he live after he came out of the strong room? - 'Till he was taken ill; I told him, Hart, you had better not live with us; for we drank too much for him. Says he, By God you are very fine hearty fellows, and I cannot leave you; and soon after he was taken to his bed, as I predicted he would, and he died there.</p>

               <p>He was at the same time a prisoner in the Fleet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know Barclay? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Jacques saying any thing to Barclay? - I heard Jacques say, after Hart came out of the strong room, to Barclay, It would be a d - d good business if Hart was to die, for they could lay a good indictment against Clipson, or the Warden, for murder.</p>
               <p>Have you ever, at any other times, heard Jacques or Barclay, or Jackson, or Apsey, or Arnold, say any thing about indicting Clipson? - I have heard Jacques say, that he would never leave him till he ruined both Clipson and the Warden.</p>
               <p>Have you heard Jacques say that more than once? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any other expressions of Jacques's about the death of Hart? - No, Sir; no more than his bragging that he had an indictment, and saying, that then he should do for them.</p>
               <p>After Clipson was indicted, what did you hear Jacques say? - I cannot expressly mention the words; but he, in a bravo kind of stile, mentioned several times that he had got the better of him, and would do for him, and never leave him till he was in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear Jacques say any thing to Cane about Clipson? - No, Sir: not relative to that business; but when Shanley made his escape, I heard him tell Cane to write to Clipson's securities to withdraw them, or else, by G - , they would be fixed to the amount of Shanley's debt. Cane wrote a letter, but, I believe he never sent it.</p>
               <p>Do you know who carried on the prosecution? - I believe it was done by subscription, because I have seen letters written by a gentleman, a clergyman, the Rev. Sir

            , or any body else, in conjunction with the present defendants? - I know, of my own knowledge, that Barclay conducted the prosecution: he made no application to me, but I believe I can mention several who put their names to the subscription, though I believe they never paid it: Barclay was the principal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you a prisoner now in the Fleet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are now on friendly terms with Clipson, the turnkey? - I have no quarrels with him.</p>

               <p>I believe he indicted you for an assault against him; did he not? - He did.</p>
               <p>I believe he never pursued that prosecution? - I believe he pursued it.</p>
               <p>Did he ever call you to a trial on that prosecution? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not he execute a release for it? - Yes; but I was brought to the Old Bailey before I was released.</p>
               <p>I believe that release was subsequent to this indictment? - It was.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Lane was included with you in that prosecution? - He was indicted for the same assault.</p>
               <p>You often was with Hart? - Very often.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not Hart, both to you, and to a great number of other persons, in your hearing, declare frequently that he believed the imprisonment in the strong room would carry him to his grave? - He never did in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Did not he say to that effect? - Never to my knowledge; I am sure he never did.</p>
               <p>Did he never to your knowledge complain to the warden, that he believed it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150165"></xptr>would be the cause of his death; and desire to be delivered? - I cannot say I recollect any such circumstance: I know he wrote to the warden to be released.</p>
               <p>You were at this time on terms of intimacy with Hart? - Quite intimate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That appears to be in writing, and the warden is here? - I recollect the warden sending in a surgeon, to see if there was any danger; I heard the surgeon's report, which was, that it was mere nonsense, and that there was no danger.</p>
               <p>He thought it a very disagreeable place? - I never heard him mention any other circumstance; but I am pretty sure he did give such a hint; because there was a surgeon sent, as I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the Fleet prison? - I do not exactly know the day, but I believe near two years.</p>
               <p>Have not you now the run of the key? - No; I never had in my life.</p>
               <p>Was you threatened with the strong room when Hart was there? - Not to my knowledge; I was once there previous to Hart's being there.</p>
               <p>I believe there have lately, since Hart's enlargement, been alterations in that strong room? - I can see no other alterations, but that some panes of glass that were broke have been mended; and I believe it has been white washed; something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>What kind of place is this strong room; is there any window in it? - It is the best strong room, I believe, in any prison in England.</p>
               <p>What have you been in so many prisons? - Never but one; that was in the strong room of the King's Bench; I have been an officer in the army about seven years, and about two months a private.</p>
               <p>Was you never taken up for desertion? - No, Sir; I was discharged as a private soldier; I once did inlist as a private: I was very much vexed: I paid for my discharge, and came away; or at least I came away, and paid for my discharge; I have a certificate from the Duke of Dorset, for four years good behaviour as a soldier.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. At whose suit are you in the Fleet? - It was at several suits; but at present at the suit of my grandmother.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, why was you detained at the suit of your grandmother?</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think you have a right to enquire into the private affairs of this man and his family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. If I should put my questions improperly, it is not intentionally.</p>
               <p>Court. I will set you right as far as I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Was not you a deserter? I mean to shew that he was detained in the Fleet prison to prevent his being taken up, for desertion and selling his accoutrements? - That is false, Mr. Jacques.</p>
               <p>You was indicted by Clipson? - Yes; and I recollect you put a vast number of enormities in my hand, which I believed were all true then; but I have found were all false since.</p>
               <p>Was there not a petition drawn up to the judges? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the contents of that petition? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it was for the purpose of obtaining the liberty of Mr. Hart? - I do not recollect such a petition.</p>
               <p>Did Hart never tell you that he had presented such a petition? - I understood he had wrote to the warden; but I cannot say I recollect it.</p>
               <p>Is that strong room under ground or not? - It is the same as the rooms in

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you confined in the Fleet prison? - Yes, four years; I messed with Mr. Jacques and Mr. Barclay: I remember the time when Hart died; I think it was last August: I recollect his being placed in the strong room; I was not present when he was put in; only from hearsay.</p>
               <p>Do you know the situation of the room? - I thought it then a much worse place than I now find it.</p>
               <p>What sort of a place is it? - Why, Sir, it is walled; there is no boarded floor, nor to any of the rooms on that floor; I have lived two years nearly, in a room somewhat smaller, but nearly in the same manner and form.</p>
               <p>Was it an unwholesome damp place, likely to occasion death? - By no means likely to occasion death; but not so pleasant as the other rooms were.</p>
               <p>Was Hart accommodated with bedding and fire? - Sir, I believe better than most rooms in the prison.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect at any time hearing any conversations respecting the death of Hart, and the taking up of Clipson? - Barclay, myself, and Jacques messed together: the constant conversation of Barclay and Jacques was respecting this prosecution of Clipson; and their idea was, that Hart's death was occasioned by this confinement of Clipson's, and that they would exert their utmost abilities to prosecute Clipson for the murder, conceiving that he had occasioned the same; that was the general conversation: I did not leave the mess; I frequently left the room when the conversation was unpleasant respecting the matter being mentioned by Jacques and Barclay; I frequently reproved them for it, that it was not my conception that the room was the occasion of the death; I wished them to change the subject: I knew Hart drank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150167"></xptr>very hard, and was unwell in other respects.</p>

               <p>How long did he live after he came out? - I do not exactly know; it may be three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Was the course and habit of his life known to Jacques and Barclay as it was to you? - I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You formerly thought this strong room was a bad room? - I did: I have since seen the room.</p>
               <p>I believe you have frequently remonstrated with Clipson on confining them there? - I may have done so.</p>
               <p>There was a petition? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I conceive it was, that they had not done any thing to deserve being put into the strong room? - I recollect something of signing a petition; but I do not recollect the particulars.</p>
               <p>Did not you likewise swear, that the contents of that paper was true.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You must produce the original.</p>
               <p>Court. There was a petition on oath presented? - There was; I swore to the petition; but do not recollect that petition.</p>
               <p>Did you go to visit Hart in this room? - Never in the room; but to the grate several times.</p>
               <p>Now did you never hear Mr. Hart declare that he believed that confinement would be the cause of his death? - I do not recollect I ever did: I believe a few days before we were put into the strong room we were not upon such good terms, nor only on speaking terms till his death; we were not at enmity.</p>
               <p>Have you ever declared that you have heard Hart say so, that that confinement would be the cause of his death? - I believe I may have heard Hart say, that he thought the confinement would be the cause; but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Where was it that you believe you heard him say so? - In the strong room: I do not recollect before whom.</p>
               <p>You was prosecuted by Clipson for an assault upon him? - I believe I was.</p>
               <p>You know you was? - Yes; I think I was.</p>
               <p>That was before this indictment? - Yes; I think it was.</p>
               <p>Did not he release you from that prosecution? - No; he did not: I was acquitted without having spoke to him for a long time: he did not urge the prosecution: my acquittal was subsequent to that indictment.</p>
               <p>Were there any glazed windows in this strong room at the time Hart was confined in it? - I believe it was broke.</p>
               <p>What was Hart's state of health before he was confined in this room? - I believe very indifferent; I have heard him say he was troubled with a very great asthmatic complaint.</p>
               <p>He was confined in this room part of July and August? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was a fire in this room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Did you never say since the death of Hart, that you verily believed the strong room hastened his death? - I do not recollect it; I may have said it.</p>
               <p>Have not you said it a hundred times? - If I have said it a thousand times I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Did you never say it before Mr. Beckford? - I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Did not you say it to Captain

               <p>Have not you repeatedly heard me declare I so believed; and have not you as repeatedly said, no, I do not know it was the cause; but it hastened his death? - I recollect I have checked you in saying it was the cause of his death; whether I said it might hasten his death I do not recollect; I will not say I have not said so.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Sambridge? - I do.</p>
               <p>Have not you repeatedly said, that you might thank Mr. Sambridge for not being prosecuted on that indictment? - I believe I may.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My lord, with respect to the petition, I have given notice to the warden and Clipson, to produce all the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150168"></xptr>original papers; now I can prove this to be a correct copy.</p>
               <p>Court. You may ask him as to any facts that may be mentioned in the petition; but your notice will not oblige them to produce papers which they have not in their custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Do you remember signing a petition? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court. Any fact that the petition stated, you may ask him whether those things happened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. What was your opinion of the conduct of Clipson, in putting Hart into the strong room? - I was not present that day.</p>
               <p>What was your opinion the next day? - I thought he went too far.</p>
               <p>Did not you express yourself frequently alarmed for the safety of Hart, while he was in the strong room? - Never, Mr. Jacques.</p>
               <p>Did not you visit him frequently? - Very seldom, Mr. Jacques.</p>
               <p>Do you think it is a wholesome room at all, or fit for a man of a good constitution to be put into; I hope you will give me a candid answer? - There are better rooms; but I think it would not kill a man.</p>
               <p>Court. No; but would the room injure a man not in a good state of health? - No doubt, my lord; a man in a bad state of health being prevented from air would injure him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. But would this room be particularly dangerous to the health of a sick person? - I think not.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know how long Mr. Hart was confined there? - I believe about fourteen days.</p>
               <p>Were there any glass windows? - If there were they were broke.</p>
               <p>Has it been altered at all? - I believe it has.</p>
               <p>Do you think Clipson conducted himself as a humane good man ought to do, in such a situation, to Mr. Hart? - I was not present when he was taken to the strong room.</p>
               <p>I believe what you have heard me say on that subject has been open? - Yes; very open.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you called upon in your character of physician, to attend Mr. Hart, the person who died in the Fleet? - Yes; I saw him the Thursday preceding his death; he died on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Please to state to my lord and the jury, in what condition you found him, and what occasioned his death? - I found him in a fever, under which he laboured some days; and by his appearance, I conceived it was an advanced stage of fever; as to the cause, it is extremely difficult to ascertain; I understand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150169"></xptr>and was informed he had been a man very much given to debauchery and drinking: I never saw the strong room in the Fleet prison.</p>
               <p>Were there any symtoms in your patient, that induced you to think that his death was either occasioned or haslened by improper confinement? - I never had any such thing suggested to me; I saw him the 1st of October, and he died the following Saturday in the night; I saw him twice on the Friday, and once on the Saturday; there was some delirium upon him at first: I thought him better the Friday morning, but not at any time quite competent.</p>
               <p>Was you examined before the coroner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The subject of the enquiry was, what brought him to his end? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And neither then nor now did you suspect any violence? - I had not the least idea of any such thing; he was a stranger to me; I was called in to see him.</p>

               <p>I am an apothecary in Holborn. I attended the deceased, Mr. Hart, in the Fleet prison; I was called in the 28th of September, and some time before, about three weeks.</p>
               <p>At whose desire? - He sent himself.</p>
               <p>In what condition did you find him? - He had the itch</p>

               <p>Please to describe the state and condition of your patient? - I was called in the 28th of September, in his last illness; the itch had left him for a fortnight or more; he complained of an astma which he had had for some years; I did nothing for that.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you had left him, that you heard of him again as a patient? - The 28th of September.</p>
               <p>Did he at that time make any complaint of any injury sustained by him, in consequence of his confinement in the strong room? - I never heard any thing of the strong room from him.</p>
               <p>In your judgment what occasioned his death? - A fever.</p>
               <p>Of which he had no symptoms in September? - None at all.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a prisoner in the Fleet, and have been about two years. I remember the circumstance of Hart's confinement in the strong room very well; I was not present at the time of the offence; he was there; I believe, six weeks; I was in the strong room myself for four months.</p>
               <p>When was that? - After the death of Mr. Hart; I lived there, and eat and drank there myself, that I might let my room; I lived there, and found nothing at all, any more than I do from the room I now live in.</p>
               <p>Then it was fit for habitation? - Clearly so; he was hurt, not from the room, but from the manner of living in the room, by drinking spirits, brandy, and wines, from the time he got up in the morning till he went to bed.</p>
               <p>How did he get supplied with those things? - By his friends, that were then prisoners.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the coroner's jury fitting on his body after he died? - Yes; as the coroner's inquest were coming down stairs, after they had set on the body, after they had viewed the body, I heard Mr. Jacques and Barclay, Mr. Jacques particularly hallooing out, gentlemen, he was murdered! he was murdered! he said so several times.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - It was in the third gallery in the Fleet; Mr. Hart was in the top gallery; and they had come down into the third gallery, and were going down.</p>
               <p>Was Barclay with him? - Barclay was not with Mr. Jacques, but he was in the same gallery with me; he said as they were going down stairs, just in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to these two gentlemen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150170"></xptr>on their conduct? - I was afraid of saying any thing; upon this Mr. Barclay went for the defendant, Jackson, who came forward and said that he was murdered, and that the warden of the Fleet might as well put a pistol and shoot him; these were the words as near as I can recollect; I did not choose to reply.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard Mr. Jacques and Barclay, or either of them, say any thing with respect to Clipson, or their conduct with respect to Clipson? - That is all I can recollect.</p>
               <p>After Hart got out of this strong room, in what manner did he live then? - Why, drinking; I have seen him in an evening drink five or six or seven glasses of brandy and water; he was, upon the whole, in my opinion, a very intemperate man; I do not know who paid the expences of the prosecution against Clipson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. You then was not in a state of confinement in this strong room? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Therefore you went out for air as much as you pleased? - I went out, but I was at work; I was in there in the winter time; my windows were glazed.</p>
               <p>Many persons made no scruple of saying it was their opinion Hart was killed with this strong room? - I do not remember hearing any other persons but Barclay and Jackson and Jacques.</p>
               <p>What age was this man? - I really do not know; two or three and forty.</p>
               <p>An old man? - No.</p>
               <p>What state of health was he in? - When he was not drinking he was in bad health; he had always some disorder.</p>
               <p>Was not he visibly worse than when he went in? - I think he was, for he was with Mr. Lille; he was either always ill or always drinking.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do you think he was not the worse for being confined in that room? - I cannot say so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. You have just said you heard Mr. Barclay and me say he was murdered, when the coroner's jury were coming down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You heard me declare it then in a very public manner? - Yes; you was very busy about it.</p>
               <p>Who was present there? - Mr. Moore was there.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am an artist.</p>
               <p>Have you a house in London? - No, Sir; I am a prisoner in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Do not you keep a house any where? - No.</p>
               <p>Does not your wife? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor any lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor have not lately? - About eight months ago.</p>
               <p>What was that house? - A house that was let out for lodgings, that I used to work in at the time I was not a prisoner.</p>
               <p>To what sort of people? - Sometimes to gentlemen; sometimes to ladies.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Was not the strong room put into a state of reparation previous to your going into it, such as being glazed, and appeared different to what we had? - There was a casement put in, because it was November; but there were shutters at the time when Mr. Hart and me were there.</p>
               <p>Did you sleep in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a privy in it? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Are you a prisoner in the Fleet? - Yes, I was, at the time of Hart's death; I remember his being in the strong room; I knew him before he went; and his habits of life were very irregular, as drinking hard while he was in the strong room; he used to drink a deal of liquor and wine.</p>
               <p>Was this strong room a cold, damp, unwholsome place? - I lived next room to it at his death, two years, and it never hurt me; people have lived in the strong room six months, and not been hurt.</p>
               <p>Was it at that time in a state in which a man might live in it without any visible danger? - I do not know: I remember having a quarrel with Clipson: Barclay came into my room once, and he said to me he was going round the house to get a subscription with respect to an indictment of Clipson; I told him I was not in a capacity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150171"></xptr>to give him any thing; I made application to Jacques, that I thought Mr. Clipson used me ill in taking out a bottle of brandy; and I had a bottle of ketchup, and I broke that; so they took my room from me for it; I went to Mr. Jacques and asked him what I should do; and Mr. Jacques said there is a better way than indicting him, that is, to make an affidavit that you gave Clipson seven shillings or half a guinea a week to permit you to sell liquors in the gaol; upon that I looked at Mr. Jacques, and turned from him.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by that? - I did not like to hear such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>Then it was not true? - No; I never gave Clipson a farthing.</p>
               <p>Had you ever represented it to Mr. Jacques, that you had given money to Clipson? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Did he explain to you what effect your making such an affidavit would have on Clipson? - He said Clipson would be fixed for it.</p>
               <p>You refused to perjure yourself? - No, I would not do any such thing.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard Mr. Jacques or Barclay say any thing with respect to Clipson, what they would do to him? - No, nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Hart's shewing you any medicinal girdle he had? - After he came out of the strong room about a fortnight or three weeks, or a week, he pulled up his shirt, and he was broke out all over like a leper, says he, this will be the death of me; I looked at him, says he I have put on a girdle, and I am very ill; I went up one time after; I saw him, and he was hardly sensible enough to speak to me; he said he used an ointment; and he said he catched the itch with laying with Jackson in the strong room.</p>
               <p>What was his complaint? - The complaint was the itch; I believe he might live about four or five days or a week after that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Were you intimate with Hart before he was in the strong room? - For five years.</p>
               <p>Did you join in any petition about Hart and Jackson? - There was a petition drawn up, and brought up to us; and a parcel of us swore to it; I believe that disorder of the itch was the death of him, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. What are you, Mr. Freeman? - You know me very well; I was bred a butcher.</p>
               <p>You are brother to Chase Freeman, the attorney? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How have you got your living for some years past? - Many years I lived on my own estate; then when I lost that, which is about nine years ago, I rented one; I have lived this nine years by my business, by butchery, and dealing in cattle, buying cattle by commission, and buying horses by commission.</p>
               <p>You bought horses and cattle for your brother too? - No, never; we might buy a horse and cow together, but not these several years.</p>
               <p>You kept in the Fleet prison a kind of brandy shop? - Why I might have a glass of brandy in the Fleet prison.</p>
               <p>Clipson came down one night to your room, and seized it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he make use of any pistol? - Why he brought a pistol, but did not make use of it; to be sure he said, if I did not desist, and let him take the liquor, he should blow my brains out.</p>
               <p>Then you came up to me and told me? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You met me? - No, I did not meet you; I saw you the next day; then you said I should fix the warden, and fix them for bringing the liquor in.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, swear it! I should not come here without swearing it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear positively that I told you to make affidavit that you paid to Clipson seven shillings a week? - To be sure you did.</p>
               <p>For what purpose? - You know best; you said it would be better to make an affidavit, than to indict him.</p>

               <p>How many prisons do you happen to have been in? - I was brought up under a decree, because I would not sign an estate away; and I put myself into the Fleet; I was in Warwick gaol for debt, a little matter of Lord Sandy's, about seven pounds ten shillings; and in Worcester gaol about an estate.</p>
               <p>You never was in any other gaol? - I have been in many a gaol, backwards and forwards, but not to stay.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you ever in any other gaol as a prisoner? - Yes; I have been in another gaol in Gloucester.</p>
               <p>For what? - Why I was brought in there upon a matter about a person; you see, the value of a five guinea matter.</p>
               <p>Explain to the Court for what was you in; for a debt, or for a criminal charge? - Why not for a criminal charge.</p>
               <p>Was you there for a debt? - A man said I laid hold of five pounds that did not belong to me, for a wager; I borrowed it, and the man had a note of hand for the money.</p>
               <p>Then you was on a criminal charge? - I had won five guineas of a man; and the man said I took it up before I won it; and he took me up on a warrant; I never was in any other gaol; that I swear.</p>
               <p>Was you never charged with horse-stealing? - No, nor cow-stealing.</p>
               <p>Was you never charged with any other fraud? - No; nor that is no fraud.</p>
               <p>You swear you never was in any other prison than Gloucester gaol, Worcester gaol, the King's Bench, and the Fleet? - That I swear positively; the King's Bench I never was in.</p>

               <p>I have been a prisoner in the Fleet two years: I know Jacques and Barclay; I heard Mr. Jacques insult Clipson three times, twice upon the stair-case, and once in the hall gallery; the first time was, Clipson was coming down stairs with his hands behind his coat: Jacques says, you rascal, you have a knife there to stab; Clipson took out his hands, and said I have no such thing; Mr. Jacques said, you lie, you rascal, I will never leave you till I ruin you; this was after Jacques was locked in as a close prisoner; I think it was before the death of Hart.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after Hart had been confined in the strong room? - I think it was before that time; the expression Mr. Jacques made use of, was, that he would never leave him till he had ruined him.</p>
               <p>After the death of Hart, did you ever hear Jacques or Barclay say any thing about the prosecuting of Clipson, or the death of Hart? - I know the next time they met on the stair-case, and Clipson was whistling; Jacques said, you are whistling now, but you will squeak at the gallows by and by; the third time was, they met in the hall gallery, and there was rogue and rascal and villain called; and a number of people gathered round, and me among the rest; there Clipson said, you accuse me wrong; you are a rogue and villain; and Jacques called him rogue and villain; and Jacques said he would have new turnkeys and a new warden, for he would ruin them both.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear Barclay say any thing on the subject? - Yes; I was at the club when Barclay came into the coffee-room; that is twelve or fourteen months ago; Hart was alive and there; I think Sir

               <p>Have you ever had any idea that that strong room occasioned the death of Hart? - None at all; Hart was a very ailing man, and he caught a nasty itch, as it was reported, by sleeping with Jackson; he stunk so of brimstone and nasty disordered stuff, that I was very glad I got rid of him.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any conversation with him about his health? - He always said, he was poorly.</p>

               <p>How long? - Two years come Michaelmas day.</p>
               <p>Did not you offer to swear yourself worth one thousand six hundred pounds? - I did not; I was not asked the question.</p>
               <p>You was not asked the question, what sum you would swear to? - I tell you again I was not asked the question.</p>
               <p>What sum of money are you in the Fleet for now? - Eighteen pounds.</p>
               <p>You sued for your groats, I believe? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago? - About a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Did you give any schedule of your effects? - Certainly so.</p>
               <p>And you receive your groats? - I do.</p>
               <p>Have you not often told, that you could pay him one hundred pounds, and pulled out a handfull of gold, at the Fleet prison? - You asked me that before; I told you, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was not the strong room damp when Mr. Hart was there? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe you have frequently held clubs in that room? - Never, but once; that was two or three months after the death of Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>How many times have you been tried in this court? - Not so often as you.</p>

               <p>Did you never hear Hart declare, that being put in that strong room was the cause of his death? - I never did; I came to see you there, and asked you to make a concession; you refused that, saying, you would not on no account; and that you would not take five hundred pounds for what you should get of the warden.</p>
               <p>Was I not in good health then? - You never looked very well; you always had a sickly look with you; you had a very disagreeable smell with you; I wished you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150174"></xptr>away, and your wife the same; I was afraid of catching it; I remember you had a combustible disorder about you.</p>

               <p>Have not you heard Hart solemnly declare, that he verily believed the confinement in the strong room would be the cause of his death? - I do not recollect hearing him say so; but I have heard others say that he said so: I do not remember that I ever said that strong room was the cause of his death; there was a great deal of conversation about it; I might have expressed it; but I do not recollect it.</p>

               <p>I believe you was one of those that signed a petition to Lord Loughborough? - I signed one or two; I swore to my belief of the contents.</p>
               <p>I suppose you would know it, if it was read to you.</p>
               <p>(The affidavit read of all the parties. The petition to the judges read.)</p>
               <p>You recollect swearing to that affidavit? - I remember swearing to some affidavit.</p>
               <p>Do you remember saying after Mr. Clipson was indicted, publicly in the presence of Mr. Lloyd and Mrs. Lloyd, that you would be at the expence of a habeas corpus, to take yourself up to go against Clipson, if nobody else would, for that your evidence would convict him? - I never said I would be at the expence; but I said, if Clipson merited what was said of him, that I would contribute towards the prosecution of him.</p>
               <p>Do you not recollect saying, that if no other person would go on with it, your evidence would be sufficient to convict him? - I never said I knew enough.</p>
               <p>Did you never say any thing like it? - I said I would join in the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Then you considered there was cause for prosecution? - According to what I had been informed; I cannot recollect whether it was before or after the indictment; but I certainly did believe at that time that there was cause for prosecuting Clipson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Have not you frequently heard me declare at the time that Clipson was prosecuted, that I would have nothing to do with the disputes of the prisoner, as I was no prisoner? - I have heard Mr. Jacques declare when he was brought in a second time, that he did not consider himself to have any right to make that affidavit, or sign the petition, because he was no prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Was you present at the time I was put into the strong room? - I was.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. I am no friend to converting civil prosecutions into criminal ones. There is no doubt but that you have given a strong evidence of a very malicious prosecution; and of a very malicious prosecution, with very little, if any probable cause; and that evidence would entitle you in a civil action, to recover damages against the parties by whom that evidence was offered; but it is not enough that the parties happen to be poor; it is not enough that the parties happen to be prisoners, to warrant the turning that civil remedy into a criminal prosecution. You have been obliged to insist, that this false and malicious accusation, without probable cause, was by conspiracy between these people. Now, at present, I do not see very distinctly where the evidence of the conspiracy is; the only thing that strikes me as material to that purpose, is the declaration proved by you, as to what was to be done by Jacques, after Hart had been in the strong room, and before his death; that declaration, that this would be a damned good business if Hart should die, for that it would lay a good indictment against Clipson or the warden, for murder. There is a good deal of malevolence in the expression, supposing that this man would proceed to the utmost that he could, in order to support such a prosecution; but that declaration is no conspiracy, because it is his own declaration; it is his individual act; it is true, he says it to Barclay; but Barclay is not involved in it by any answer he gives. The ground that they take, is a distinct ground, namely, that Hart had been in a place, which it now plainly appears they had considered and represented to Lord Loughborough as a bad place; it is also clear that Hart was in such a state of health, that violent, ill-tempered, malicious people might very well hasten to a conclusion that was not just, namely, that this would be murder in the warden: but I do not find that there is any thing like private concert; that there is any proceeding that has led any body to say any thing that was not strictly true; and however erroneous, false, and malicious, yet it was conducted publicly and strictly: and it is particularly taken notice of in the depositions before the coroner. Then this is a case in which it is said, there has been a constructive murder, on the part of Clipson, the officer in the Fleet; the fact of this construction is true; that he was confined in a place very likely to prejudice his health: this was a miserable debauchee, drinking twenty-four drams, or glasses of spirits and water, before dinner: it is a more rational thing, to attribute his death to intemperance; but yet it is a matter open to discussion; and it was more likely to prejudice the health of such a man: I do not mean that the officers are not to keep the prisoners in order; and if a man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150179"></xptr>was allowed to say I am too ill to be restrained, it would put an end to all regulation. Now they have thought fit to bring this case before a jury; and in my judgment there would be evidence to go to a jury in a civil action; but I do not myself see the evidence of the conspiracy, which is to turn a civil remedy into a criminal prosecution; and which I shall always expect to see, because I abhor the idea of converting a civil remedy into a criminal prosecution; and though this happens to a man who has already shewn a disposition to conspire; yet if you think you can sustain the ground of the conspiracy, in that case I will go on; if not, it is unnecessary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, whenever any observation comes from the bench, that I should much better serve the interests of the public by bowing immediately and implicitly to their opinion, than by setting up any imagination and conjecture of my own, if I could prove it; and after the patient enquiry which has been continued; and upon the whole, the prosecutor having already had the vindication of the jury of his country, in his acquittal; I have no difficulty in saying, I have felt the pressure of your lordship's observation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My lord, I beg your pardon. Standing loaded with prejudice, as I do, I wish to go into my defence: I have a great number of witnesses brought here at a great expence; I am loaded with prejudice: God knows, I shall be loaded with still more from the observations, I fear, of your lordship, unless my defence is heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, I ought to say that it is hard that some of the other defendants, if they wish to avail themselves of the mercy of your lordship, and the acquiescence of the prosecutor, shall not avail themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. I wish for myself to go on: but I wish for the other defendants, that they may be acquitted, as they were indicted only that I might not have the benefit of their testimony; if they are acquitted, I will call them as witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. There cannot be a partial acquittal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Will your lordship pardon me. If it had been a prosecution in the common way, and there had been no evidence whatever given against any of the parties that stand indicted with me, I submit whether in such a case, those gentlemen that stand indicted with me have not a right to take an acquittal; and whether I am not entitled to the benefit of their testimony.</p>
               <p>Court. In this case the evidence is against all the parties.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Does your lordship conceive that there is any evidence given against Mr. Arnold?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I mean to insist to the jury, in reply on Mr. Jacques, that there is no evidence irresistably strong, as against Jacques, Jackson, Barclay, Arnold, and Apsey: now, as to Arnold, I mean to insist to the jury, that if Mr. Arnold, who stood in the character of a surgeon to the deceased, having visited him, having heard the examination of the witnesses before the coroner; and knowing that man died by the visitation of God, that he must have been actuated by malevolence when he went before the grand jury; and that he had by that act taken upon himself the public character of a prosecutor, and assumed that character for base and malevolent purposes, which he proved afterwards by deserting that prosecution; for if Mr. Arnold felt a consciousness that one of his fellow citizens died by murder, it was his duty to have come forward, and stated that in court: these are a few of the observations which it will be my duty to make by and by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. I wish not to involve the other defendants, if their counsel are of a different opinion to me; as to myself, I think it is of consequence to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reader, Counsel for Mr. Arnold. I declare, on behalf of Mr. Arnold, it is totally indifferent whether we proceed, or whether we save the time of your lordship and the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150180"></xptr>Court. I think that it would be incumbent on you to appear before the Court, to shew why you did not appear: I do not think it is a pressing circumstance, but it is a circumstance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. As it is, I certainly cannot wish to involve the other parties that stand indicted with me, on any account, however I might wish to enter into my defence, unless I could have the benefit of calling Mr. Arnold, who was the surgeon to Mr. Hart, and Mr. Apsey and his wife, who are witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the jury, I have delivered my opinion on this case so publicly and so distinctly, that it is impossible for me to add any thing to it: my judgment is, that the case that is proved does entitle Mr. Clipson, supposing it not to be contradicted, to a civil satisfaction for a false and malicious prosecution; but that it does not prove the crime here charged, which is a prosecution produced and concerted by conspiracy; therefore, of course, my opinion is, that in point of law, the indictment is not proved, and therefore, if you think fit, you will acquit the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Tried by the London Jury before the Lord CHIEF BARON.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, Mr. Jacques, before you leave the bar I must tell you, that I think it a most unwarrantable thing, the circulating previous to this trial (if you did circulate it) a printed account of the former trial, and a pretty strong reference to the trial that was then depending, for which, if it had been fully brought home to you by evidence, I should have thought it my duty to have censured you: therefore be so good in future to understand, that if you have a case depending, you are not to prejudice the minds of any body on that account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My lord, I have never circulated any letter respecting that trial, though it has been said I had.</p>
               <p>Court. I can hardly think that paper did not come from you or your friends; (holding up a printed paper, which had been distributed to many persons.) I believe the adversary could never have circulated that paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My lord, as to writing letters on that subject, I shall not attempt to deny, but that I have written letters on the subject of the late trial; but I have never circulated them to prejudice the minds of any individual.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If Mr. Jacques is not now satisfied, I undertake to prove, as a substantive complaint, that he has circulated a printed paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My lord, there is an observation that I trust you will permit me to make, respecting the evidence upon which I was convicted on the former trial; if that evidence is admitted contrary to law, is there no redress for me.</p>
               <p>Court. I observe that is one of the points you make in that printed paper: if it will be any satisfaction to you to know my mind about it; if what I have heard be true, that there was other evidence given of the parties being in conspiracy, I am of opinion that evidence was very properly received.</p>

               <p>It is longer than that? - He was not a bankrupt at the time these things were delivered: they were given to me by the creditors before he became a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Which of your creditors was it that gave them to you? - Mr. Porter, the gentleman that had the execution in the house.</p>

            ? - I did not: I only sent her to my room for me: she had been a woman that has chaired for me.</p>
               <p>Where were those things taken from to that room? - From my house.</p>
               <p>Where was the room? - In George-street.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see it? - Yes, I was there three days.</p>
               <p>Where did you go from to that room? - To a sister at Paddington. Mr. Davis was in Oxfordshire: I did not leave the things in her care; I thought as she had been before an honest woman; I gave her the key of my room; I did not leave them in any body's care; I thought they were locked up.</p>
               <p>You left them in your room? - Yes; I locked the door, and gave the key to her.</p>
               <p>How long was you gone before you came back again? - Three weeks; I told her I was going for three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Upon what account, and for what reason, were those things removed from your house to that room? - I was sent out of my house.</p>
               <p>How soon after you went to Paddington, and your husband to Oxfordshire, did the messengers commission come in? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long had he been a bankrupt before you came back again? - I do not know he was made a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did the commission of bankruptcy come in? - I do not know: I left the house in the night.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did the messenger come? - I did hear the docket was struck.</p>
               <p>How soon after was the docket struck? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it before you came back from Paddington? - I was very often from Paddington.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you hear it? - I heard it two or three days after I went to Paddington.</p>
               <p>Who paid the rent for the room that was taken? - Why, she that took the things away.</p>
               <p>Who was that? - I suppose Mrs. Humble; I was to pay her for it.</p>
               <p>Now I believe there were certain other creditors who smelt out these things? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who issued out the commission? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear who was the petitioning creditor? - I did hear Mr. Calvert was: Mr. Porter desired me to take what little things were necessary.</p>
               <p>You found this woman in some new lodging? - Yes.</p>
               <p>With most of these things with her? - Yes; all the things were found in the lodging; but some of the furniture was sold.</p>
               <p>Court. What furniture was found there? - There was a bed, a set of drawers, half a dozen chairs, two tables, two saucepans; these things were sold; all the rest were found in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Of course these were to be considered as Mrs. Humble's own property? - No.</p>
               <p>Then she was to give them you back again? - No; they were not: I was to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070045"></xptr>back to this room when my husband came to town; he desired me to go.</p>
               <p>Were not these things delivered to Mrs. Humble, in order to prevent their being swept up by the commissioners? - No; they were not.</p>
               <p>For what purpose were they then delivered to her? - I thought her an honest woman; and she was to be with me the time; and I heard she was in another place; and I sent for a constable, and took her up.</p>

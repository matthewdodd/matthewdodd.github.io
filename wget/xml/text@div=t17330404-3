For my own part, I never dress'd a Baby in my life; but on the 21st of March about Noon, Nell, what d'ye call her? a crooked Body, brought two dozen of these Dolls to my House Jenny came with her indeed, but it was Nell that had the Dolls. And so, says Nell, says she, I wish you would go and sell these Dolls for me to such a Man, in St. Catherine's-Lane, that has bespoke 'em I am afraid Nell, says I, that these Dolls belong to your Master [the Prosecutor.] No, says Nell, they are nothing but old rubbishing Dolls that lie about our House, and such as we often fling away, and I have got our Joe to paint their Faces up, and make them look a little smug; so away goes I to this Man's House, but when I came there he was provided, for he had just bought half a Gross of Dolls for 15 s. back I comes to Nell, and tells her how, and about it. Well, says she, go to Mr. Robottom's in White-Chapel, and see if he won't buy them. No, says I, Nell, any Body may see by my Looks, that I am no Doll-dresser. So then Nell was for going away, and Jenny said to her (but I don't know what she meant by it) I wish you would dress those two odd Dolls for me. When Nell was gone, I advised Jenny to go to her Master's, for fear she should lose her Work; but it raining very hard, she could not go without being wet to the Skin, and so she staid till 9 at Night, and then went home. About half an Hour after comes Nell again, and asks for Jenny. I told her she was gone, and with that Nell turns about, and beckons thus with her Finger - I ask your Lordship's Pardon - and in comes Mr. Higgs and his Wife. Says he, What's in that Basket? A Parcel of Dolls, says I. Give them me, says he, No, says I, you may take them if you will. So his Wife took the Basket, and turn'd the Dolls out upon my Bed and told them, and then she put them up again. The Jury <rs id="t17330404-3-verdict13" type="verdictDescription">

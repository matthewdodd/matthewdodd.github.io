             sworn. - I am butler to Dr. Robert Willis; On the 4th of November last about a quarter after twelve, or thereabouts, I was in my master's bed-room, fronting the street, nearly opposite to Lord Le Despencer's, and I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of a two-pair of stairs window upon a new piece of building that was building up; there was a door way cut through the wall that communicated into the attics of the dwelling-house; I saw the prisoner trying to conceal something under his great coat, on the left side; he then crossed the new building, and got upon the scaffolding, and, on my going down stairs, the servant-maid of Dr. Willis called to me, and said, she believed there was a man robbing Lord Le Despencer's house; I then went to the landing-place of the first stair-case, and I saw the prisoner upon the scaffold, putting the sheets into a mason's lime-basket; when he had so done, he picked up bricks and rubbish, and put over the sheets; I went down stairs to the street door, and called to him; he stood up very unconcerned; I said, you rascal, if you don't come down, I will fetch you down, I will throw you down and break your neck; the prisoner then left the basket, and threw himself astride the ladder, and slid down; when he came at the bottom, I laid hold of him by the collar, and told him he had been a thief, that he had done something wrong; he said, he had not, and begged I would let him go; he broke away from me, and ran across Hanover-square, but I took him in Oxford-road, and brought him back to the place where I first saw him; in the interval of time Lord Le Despencer's servants had been informed of it, and I saw the basket in the manner I have described; we then took him to Marlborough-street, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time of day did you see this? - A. A quarter after twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the time the other workmen were at work? - A. No, they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know enough of the prisoner, to say he was the man? - A. Yes.</p>

My Lord, I am a bricklayer by trade; I went up this ladder with an expectation of getting a job, I had worked for the same master before, and they asked me what I wanted; and I said, I only wanted to see my master; they used me very ill, and therefore I made my escape.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole belonging to Sir Sampson Wright. Mr. Croker and I and two more were going up Carolina-street about half past two; I see Pope in custody with Mr. Croker and Doyle; I went with Mr. Croker to the spot where he secured him, and I saw him pick up this bundle; Pope was left in the custody of Doyle and Manning, the mean while the bundle was picked up in Russel-street.</p>
               <p>Croker. I took Pope in Russel-street, coming out of Carolina street.</p>
               <p>Court to Lewes. Did Mr. Croker carry the bundle away with him? - He did. (The contents deposed to by Mrs. Connolly and Miss Connolly; which was one curtain, four cruet tops, a tea caddy and one apron.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner Pope. I had been to Somer's Town to see an acquaintance who was a bricklayer, I stayed rather later then ordinary, as I was coming along the corner of this street, I saw two men runing along the street; and them things I saw lay in the street, and picked them up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Croft. I work for Mr. Ellbank a salter at Blackfriars-bridge; coming up Oxford-street there was a waggon by an Inn, called the Boar and Castle, the watchman was pursuing a man, and he came against me and knocked me down, I got up, and went round the waggon, and the watchman pursuing the man came up to me, and took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Croker. Did you hear these people talking together? - I am not sure, I thought I heard one of them say damn the watchman.</p>

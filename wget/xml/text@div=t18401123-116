                  </hi>. I live at Kingsland, in the parish of St. Mary, Stoke Newington—I formerly kept a public-house. I had been very ill, and in September last my brother brought the prisoner to my premises—I put great confidence in him—he only stopped till he could get a situation—I found him in board and lodging—I had known him as a waiter at the Manor House Tavern, Stoke Newington—I have known him about six months altogether—I missed him from the house on the 3rd of October about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock—he had been waiting on me—I missed a silver hunting watch, two seals, a metal chain, and a key, which were in my room the last time the prisoner was there—I also missed three sovereigns and two half-sovereigns from my pocket at my bedside—I found the prisoner in custody at the Mansion House—this is my watch, (<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at it</hi>) and one of the seals—the other is gone.</p>

On the 18th of November I accompanied the prosecutor to the Mansion House, and saw the prisoner there—I said, "How came you to rob Mr. Faint, so good a master as he has been to you?"—he said he was very sorry for it, and asked me to intercede with Mr. Faint not to prosecute him, that his mother had got the watch, and all the money he had taken should be restored to him by his brother—I had known him a long time before.</p>

I was directed by the Magistrate to take the prisoner to Worship-street, after being released from where I had him in custody, he said, "This is a bad job"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "I acknowledge taking the watch, but I have not taken the money"—I said, "Well, what did you do with the watch?"</p>

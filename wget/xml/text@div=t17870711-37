               <p>I had been at a club which I go to once a fortnight, on the 30th of April, at the Blue Posts at Mount Pleasant; coming home between twelve and one through St. Giles's, I met with the prisoner opposite Drury-lane in St. Giles's, he said it was a cold night; I said it was rather coolish; and then he said you are a country man of mine; I walked down almost to Oxford-road, he walked with me, I was going to my lodgings, I live in St. Giles's, he walked along with me, he brought me that way, we were talking about the country.</p>
               <p>How came you to walk past your own place? - He wanted me to go to drink with him, I wanted to go home to my lodging.</p>
               <p>How came you to go past? - I was talking to him, and I went past, I told him I was too late home, he said stop, let us have one sixpenny-worth, I told him I would not go, I shall be knocked down; says he if you will come down this street, that was <placeName id="t17870711-37-crimeloc165">Bambridge-street</placeName>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I think you did not tell my Lord what you are? - What I am, Sir, a <rs id="t17870711-37-viclabel166" type="occupation">tin-man</rs>

               <p>Where pray? - I work for Mr. Smith in Gerrard-street.</p>
               <p>Where do you lodge? - I have lodged in Phoenix-street three years, but now within this week or fortnight, I have lodged in Gerrard-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110056"></xptr>What sort of a club is that at Mount-Pleasant? - A club that I pay money once a month to; it was twelve o'clock when I left it; Mount-Pleasant goes into Gray's-Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>How did you find yourself in Drury-lane in your way from Mount-Pleasant to Phoenix-street? - I was going along there, the prisoner was quite a stranger to me, I had seen him before by sight, I told him I knew him.</p>
               <p>You did not know what he was? - No.</p>
               <p>So in Bambridge-street you was told by him, you might go to have six-pennyworth, and be safe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that shop was shut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was upon the ground when he took your hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the watchman who had robbed you, and shew the marks; you have no doubt of the man at all? - I know the man perfectly well.</p>
               <p>And you always said so, did you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And always swore so? - I did.</p>
               <p>You always said so, and always swore so, and you have no doubt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You made your first information before the justice on the 6th of June? - No my first information is made on May day in the evening.</p>
               <p>You did not know this man's name? - No; on the 6th of June, I saw him before the justice, and swore positively to him; I had not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>How came it then that he was committed from the 6th for further examination on the 9th, you did swear then positively to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you attend on the 9th? - I attended twice.</p>
               <p>What need for further examination, if you swore positively to him the first day? - Because it is not the English custom.</p>
               <p>Nor the Irish custom neither.</p>
               <p>You saw him for the first time on the 6th of June at the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you attended two more days before you got yourself up to swear positively to him; what magistrate was it? - Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>This club, I suppose, is a good jolly sort of a thing? - I had never been there but twice; I was not a new member, I had always sent my money.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober this night? - I was neither drunk nor sober.</p>
               <p>You was what we call in a state of betweenity? - I was quite feasible; I was very well; I had company with me till I got to Drury-lane; and meeting with the prisoner and discoursing with him I went out of my way; I went with him to the ale-house; and I never saw him again till six weeks after.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner on the 6th of June in the evening, out of the Hammer and Trowell, in Church-lane, St. Giles's, I said to him, I have a warrant against you; I took him to the office, the prosecutor went and picked out the prisoner directly; Carty jumped over the box, and said damn you what do you want here.</p>
               <p>Was the examinations taken in writing? - Yes, I believe they are here; it was about eight in the evening when the magistrate committed him for another hearing; the prosecutor was examined and swore to him that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You sent word you had got the man you suspected had robbed him? - Yes, and he came, and the man was committed on suspicion after the prosecutor had been examined upon oath, and re-examined on the 9th, and this prosecutor attended again on the 9th, and he swore to him on the 9th. I have been about eight years in this business, I believe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110057"></xptr>very few are committed fully on the first hearing.</p>

               <p>What is the practice at your shop? - He was had up to Litchfield-street, he was committed from us, and examined for another offence; I dare swear so far as this, that where there is one man fully committed the first time, there are three that go on for a second hearing: They mostly do so at Mr. Walker's office, they seldom commit the first time.</p>

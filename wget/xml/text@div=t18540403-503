                  </hi>. I am a marble polisher, and work at Mr. Hartley's works, in Holy well-street. The prisoner and Faulkner worked there also—on 14th March we left work together—when we got outside, Faulkner pushed the prisoner—the prisoner said if he did it again he would run a b—knife through him—Faulkner did it again, and went to try to take the knife away from him, and while he was doing so the prisoner plunged the knife into Faulkner's belly—he hallooed out, "I am stabbed!"—he was taken to a surgeon's—I laid hold of the prisoner, and another boy, Porcus, took the knife out of his hand—I saw him do so—I saw the knife drawn away from the body of Faulkner—the prisoner said, "I have not stabbed him"—he held the knife in his hand, open, and Porous took it out of his hand while I had hold of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at these marble works. On the night of 14th March I came away with Faulkner and the prisoner, at 7 o'clock—as we were coming outside the gates, the boy Faulkner <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> the prisoner—the prisoner said, "If you <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> me again I will run this knife into you"—Faulkner <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him twice, and he got to him on to the pavement, and ran the knife into his belly—he then pulled the knife out—I said, "You have stabbed him!"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "Let me look at the knife," and he let me look at it—Seymour laid hold of him, and I took the knife out of his hand, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> They had been squabbling in the room before, had they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; after they came out, Faulkner pushed him twice on the back—I saw him put his arm round the prisoners neck as if he was going to hit him, and it was then that the prisoner stabbed him—before they came out of the work room there was some dispute between Faulkner and another boy, about getting the work done—Faulkner said he would give the prisoner something when he got him out—Faulkner began it—he pushed the prisoner several times, and had his arm round his neck at the time this happened.</p>

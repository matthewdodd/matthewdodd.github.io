My wife and I happened to be out at work; she is not here now. We have got a child dying at home, and she was obliged to be at home. This girl's brother happened to come to the house the same day we missed the things, when we came home, it was Saturday the 2d of November, we went out at ten or eleven o'clock that day. We came home about six at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the articles in this indictment missing? - We owed this Odam a few shillings, and very possible she might take them on account of that, as she had a brother recruiting, and he called to see her.</p>
               <p>Q. I only asked you, whether you missed the things, when you came back to your own house? - They were left out to wash, they were in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the house when you came back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask you for them? - No, my wife looked to see what was washed that day, and she happened to look for them, and she missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they were missing? - Yes, I was in the house at the same time. Then I went after a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. This woman being in the house, did you ask her, whether the had got them? - Yes, I did; she did not deny that she had taken them; she said, she could get them again; she put me all of a slurry. I sent for a constable; she was rather in liquor, very possible, seeing her brother, and he was going into the country, and very likely, he had made her drink more than ordinary. I never saw her in liquor before.</p>


               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about the money you owed her, that night? - She had not power to say any thing about it that time; I sent for a constable, and had her taken up. We saw some things just like them at the pawnbroker's, he had things just like them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to them? - I cannot.</p>

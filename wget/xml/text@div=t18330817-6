I have a stable there, and live over it - the staircase of my room is partitioned off from the stable; there is no communication between them - I live with my family in the room above the stables; there is no communication between the stable and the part in which I live - on the 24th of May an application was made to me by the prisoner to take the stable of me - I did not come to terms with him that day, but I did on the 25th - he agreed to take it of me and I gave him the key of the stable on the 25th - he said he wanted it to put a carriage and a few things in for a week or two, but not for long; I agreed he should have it, and he was to give a week's notice to quit - no carriage nor any other things were ever brought there by him - on Monday, the 27th I went out about one o'clock, I returned at near six o'clock in the afternoon, and when my door was unlocked I discovered two boards in the partition between the stable and staircase were broken down and laid on the stairs - when I went out at one o'clock, I locked the door and left nobody in my room - the partition was broken half a yard wide - when I went up stairs I missed twenty-five sovereigns, three £5 notes, seven gold rings, a silver watch, two pair of trousers, a coat, two pair of breeches, and three gowns; I had seen these things on the Sunday and this was Monday; every drawer was locked, I found them all broken open - I unlocked the door leading to my staircase when I came home, there was nothing the matter with that - I examined the lock of the stable-door, and that was all correct - the party must have broken into the staircase from inside the stable - the prisoner had given me a false reference and a false name; he referred me to Seymour-street, New-road, he gave no number, but gave his name as Young, he sent me a note agreeing to my proposal - I would not deliver the key and he came and received it from me himself.(Note read.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. He afterwards told you he wrote the note at a public-house in Seymour-street? A. He said so after he was taken - he was quite a stranger to me - he did not say he wanted to put the things in the stable to avoid an execution - I gave the key of the stable to Mrs. Coleman to give to the prisoner - she knew him, but I did not know that at the time - I did not see him at the stable from the time he made the agreement, which was Saturday, until I missed the things - he was not at all intimate with me, nor do I think he knew I had property there, nor had the means of knowing I was going out on Monday - I have mentioned all the things taken, they would make a pretty large parcel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How large a parcel? A. A person might take them in their arms.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you deliver the key on the 25th? A. Yes; there was no hole in the partition when I went out.</p>

            , and live next door to the prosecutor. On the 25th of May I was present when the prosecutor gave the key to the prisoner - I knew the prisoner before by the name of Shaw; I never knew him by the name of Young - on Monday the 27th of May I saw the prisoner come from the stable door with another man, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; they came from the stable door - the prisoner had rather a large bundle wrapped up in a light-coloured handkerchief; he put it in front of him, when he came from the stable - and after he passed my door, he put it under his arm, so as not to attract notice - the other man walked away with him - I saw nobody else in the mews.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner was in difficulties and expected an execution? A. No; he said nothing of the kind - he did not mention the name of Young in my hearing - I was not acquainted with him, except that he took a stable of us; he did not pay for that; it was a year and a half ago - the two men were in my sight about five minutes I suppose - directly the stable door was shut they walked by me, as I was nursing my little girl at the door - I was standing inside my door, not outside; I was standing on the sill of the door - the mews is a thoroughfare - they might have gone out at the other end, without passing me - the strange man was nearer to me than the prisoner - the prisoner had the bundle under his arm, on the further side from me; it was in a light-coloured handkerchief - I can't tell the size of it, anybody might see it - I did not notice the other man, my attention was directed to Shaw - I think he was rather thinner than the prisoner; he had a hat on,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170009"></xptr>not a cap, they were both dressed very gentlemanly - they had not great coats on - I saw them for about five minutes.</p>

I have a dye-house and premises there - on the 27th of May, between three and four o'clock I saw two men come out of the prosecutor's stable door - I am certain they came out of the stable; Shaw was one of them, and he had a bundle rolled up in a light-coloured handkerchief - I saw Shaw lock the door and put the key in his pocket - the two men both turned round and walked away together - I saw nobody else in the mews.</p>

            . I am police-sergeant. I apprehended Shaw on the 29th of May, at six o'clock in the morning - I found nothing on him - two other men were with him, who I took at the same time - the prisoner said at the office that he wrote the note in a public-house, and that it was no address - I don't know where he lives- I went to Seymour-street, but could find no such person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you go to Seymour-street - after he had explained to you about the note? A. No; I went on the Monday night - I did not show him the note; it was before the magistrate that he mentioned about the note - he said, "It is no address, I wrote it in a public-house" - there is a public-house in Seymour-street; I was not at the station-house when Jones came there - I had no conversation with him about it - Davis, the other officer, was not bound over - I locked the prisoner up, and Davis fetched the prosecutor and witnesses, but I was not present when he saw the prisoner at any time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I humbly beg to tresspass a few minutes upon your time, while I state the facts of the case for which I now have been tried. I am by trade a gold beater; not having sufficient business to employ the whole of my time, I took the stable in question of Mr. Houldsworth for the purpose of selling horses by commission, being supplied by a relation of mine with horses. The female witness for the prosecution (and the only one who swears to my coming out of the stables) must admit that some time back I hired the stable of her, and placed therein two horses. The witness also states, that between the hours of three and four o'clock on White-Monday, she saw two men come out of the stable. She identifies me, but not the bundle, (which must have been a very large one) - neither can she identify the other man. The other witness cannot swear to me; but thinks that the bundle carried was tied up in a white handkerchief. I have six or seven witnesses to prove where I was between the hours of three and four o'clock on Whit-Monday, whom I should like your Lordship to examine. I must beg to clear up another fact which may probably place my case in an unfavourable light, that is, the taking the stable in the name of Edward Young instead of my own. The reason was because there were law proceedings out against me for a debt of £30 and the expenses; and I knew that if the place was known to be occupied by me, judgment would have been entered up. I therefore trust, that the prejudice, if there was any, will be done away by the above explanation. I can assure you most solemnly that I am innocent of the charge laid against me; not a single vestige of the articles has been traced to me - indeed the worthy magistrate discharged me on the evidence produced before him, but by the suggestion of the magistrates clerk I was committed for trial. I am a married man with a family, and have been unsuccessful in business, but a felony I never committed in my life, which can be proved by witnesses as to my character up to the very time of my being taken on the present charge. I trust, under all the circumstances of the case, you will well weigh the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution. The fact of the female witness being the only one who identifies me; she might be led to swear so, owing to vindictive feelings; the rent of the stables which I took from her not having been paid. I have nothing further to add, but that I feel confident that I am standing before an impartial Judge, and a discerning Jury of my own countrymen; in whose hands the life of a fellow creature is safe; and that I shall be allowed the benefit of any discrepancy which might have occurred during my trial.</p>

The prisoner rented a stable of us, No. 1, Torrington-mews, and had horses there - it is a year and three quarters ago - I think it is as long as that since he left them; I know nothing of him since, until I saw him at the prosecutor's stable - he put nothing into Houldsworth's stable, I am certain - it was nearly evening, on Saturday, when he got the key; the prosecutor took it from my hand, and put it into the prisoner's hand - I was at home all day on Sunday; I did not observe any body at the stable, nor did I observe him there on Monday, till I saw him passing my door.</p>

I am acquainted with the prisoner; he is a goldbeater - I went to the Nag's Head on Whit-Monday, about twelve o'clock; there were a good many people there, the prisoner was there when I went in - I remained there till eight or nine o'clock at night, and he remained there during the whole of that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He was there at twelve o'clock, and staid the whole time? A. Yes, I never missed him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Could he have gone out for any time, without your missing him? A. He could not - I dined at the Nag's Head between two and three o'clock, the prisoner dined with me - we had some boiled beef, which was fetched from the corner of Crown-street and Compton-street; no other person dined with us - M'Ewen fetched the beef - our dinner occupied us about ten minutes; we only had it on a bit of bread, it was only six ounces of beef - the prisoner continued there drinking after dinner, and being Whit-Monday, we were there drinking nearly the whole of the day - we did not pay attention to business; there was only us two dining together; we drank in the same room - we were drinking together, me, and six or seven more - there was Doley, Clayton, and Clark there; I have been acquainted with the prisoner ten years, I never knew a word against him, he bore the character of an honest man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What business was he carrying on at this time? A. He was a journeyman at the time, but had not sufficient work to do - he was in temporary work, not quite out; he was working at a person's named Woodfield and Tomkins, perhaps he had one week in a month or three weeks - I cannot tell whether he was working in that particular week; I knew him keep a livery stable in Torrington-mews - he has often said how bad he was off, and he must get some other place to work; I had no particular conversation with him on this day as to how he was to get his livelihood - I first saw him that day at the Nag's Head; he was sitting there, taking part of a pint of ale - it was about twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Nag's Head, New Compton-street. The prisoner was at my house last Whit-Monday - I do not know at what time he came, but he was served with a small portion of spirits by my wife at the bar, between two and three o'clock, in my presence - he might have been in the house before that, without my seeing him; there were a great many people there - my house is a place where goldbeaters resort to; there were people of that trade there until nine o'clock at night - I do not know at what time the prisoner left, but I saw him between three and four o'clock, coming out of the parlour to the bar; I was in the bar; I believe he was then going into the back-yard - I did observe him leave the house at all.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him afterwards? A. I think I saw him once after that, but I cannot call to mind where it was, but it was in my house - I did not see him afterwards to notice him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is there any back entrance to your yard? A. Yes; a person can get out there - I have known him between three and four years - and always thought him an honest character.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at No. 18, Compton-street. I was at the Nag's Head, on Whit-Monday, between twelve and one o'clock; I saw the prisoner there when I went in - I remained there until about seven o'clock in the evening; I am satisfied that the prisoner remained there as long as I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you never see him go out? A. I did not; he might have gone out of that room for about five minutes, but I did not observe that he was absent.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You were drinking, all of you? A. Yes; I certainly did not lose sight of him for a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he drinking in company with you? A. Yes - I did not dine with him; Farley did.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When you left at seven o'clock did you leave him there? A. I did - I have known him four or five years; he bore the character of a particularly honest person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you had any dealings with him? A. I have, in my business - I and Doley, and Shaw, and Clayton, and Clark, were all drinking together - I am quite positive he was there between twelve and one o'clock, when I first went in - he was speaking to Farley; I believe they were in company together - I dined there, not at the same table with them, but in the same room- I am a master tailor - he was absent for about five minutes; I think it was about five o'clock that he went out - I am sure he never went out for any length of time before five o'clock; I never missed him before that; I missed him only once - they had beef and bread for dinner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Shirley Cottage, Norwood. On Saturday evening, 26th June, I was on Holborn Hill between 8 and 9 o'clock—I was going towards the West End, on the right hand side of the way—I bad in my coat-pocket a purse containing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I think seven sovereigns—I felt a pull or jerk—I put my hand round to my pocket where I felt the jerk—and as I put my hand round, the purse fell into my hand; and dropping from the hand of some one by my side—I instantly seized the person—he was not a quarter of a yard distant from me—he was as close as it was possible for a person to be—it turned out to be the prisoner—as I put my hand towards him, he <hi rend="italic">eased</hi> off and tried to get away, and got as close to the houses as possible—I did not see any other person as near to me as the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185207050008"></xptr>

I am barmaid at the Cock public-house, Kennington Road—on the evening of 25th February, about 5.15, Lloyd came in for a glass of ale, and tendered me a bad shilling, which I broke in three pieces—I told him it was bad—he said he was not aware of it, he had taken it in change of a half-sovereign the week before—he went away—about twenty minutes after Smith came in for a glass of <hi rend="italic">cooper</hi>, and tendered a counter<lb></lb>feit florin; I broke it, and told him it was bad—he said "You don't mean it"—I asked if he knew it was bad—he said "No—I went to the parlour door to inform Mr. Buttress, and he ran out; I followed, and Mr. Burgess</p>

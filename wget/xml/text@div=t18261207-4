On the 25th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was alarmed by a crash at my window; it was dark; I immediately ran down stairs, having just finished my tea, and my boy was trying to get out at the door; but I found it was tied with a rope. I gave the watchman a knife, who cut the rope; I went out, found a hole in the window, and missed a gold watch, two gilt ones, and a gilt case, which I had seen safe three minutes before - the hole was scarcely big enough for a person to get his hand in - it was jaggy - it was plate-glass: I could not tell what it had been broken with, but should think with a hammer - the glass is so very thick, it must have been done with some instrument; a person would certainly cut his hand by putting it through - the fragments of the glass were inside the window. The watches and case are worth 25l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you left your boy in the shop? A. Yes, it was his duty to remain there- he alarmed me. I have occasionally seen the prisoners opposite the house - the gold watch was about eleven inches from the hole, and the others about eight.</p>

            . I am near thirteen years old. On Saturday, the 25th of November, just as it had struck six o'clock, I was alone in the shop: it was dark - I heard a noise, and thought it was some children playing at the door; I went to the door - there was nothing the matter with it then: I saw nobody there - I shut the door, and was going to put some coals on the fire; I then heard a very great noise, like a large piece of timber falling - I ran to the door, and found it was fastened with a cord; the handle was tied to the kitchen bars - I could see nobody in the street - I called out, and Mr. Dunn came down. I had seen the watches safe three minutes before; the window was then safe - I saw a gold watch, two gilt ones, and a silver gilt case; they were gone: when I heard the noise, I got outside, and found a hole in the window; a person could hardly get his hand through the hole - the gilt case was about an inch from the hole, two watches were about eight inches, and the gold one about eleven - the hole was large enough for a watch to be got through. When I first heard the noise, I was in the shop putting coals on the fire - I am sure the shop-door was shut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Dunn? A. A year and a half. There was a lamp burning in the shop - I found the window broken about a minute and a half after I heard the noise at the door - there is a glass case to the window - I think if a hand had been put through the hole, it must have been cut - the watches had no chains to them - there was a great alarm when we got the door open, and a good many people collected: I saw no girl outside who spoke to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How high was the hole from the watches? A. Three or four inches from the bottom of the pane.</p>

            . About six o'clock, on the 25th of November, I saw the three prisoners at Mr. Dunn's window, and in a few minutes I saw Freestone take a string out of Garland's pocket, and give it to Court, who tied it to the knocker or knob of Mr. Dunn's door, and then to the scraper - they then all stood round the window - I was coming across the road, and heard Dunn's window smash; I got across, and the three prisoners came against me, and pushed me rather aside - they ran down Britannia-row; I saw nothing in their hands; I saw them all three together about an hour afterwards, just by Mr. Rhodes' farm, which is about a quarter of an hour's walk; they asked me if I had heard of the watches being stolen- I said, "Yes, I have, and you have got them;" Freestone told me not to say any thing about them; I said I would not; they wished me good night, and we parted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who do you live with now? A. With my parents - my father is a watchman and special constable - his beat is in the Lower-road, a good way from Dunn's. I knew the prisoners before as neighbours, but never had any talk with them, except saying "How do you do?" I had not seen them that night till they had committed the robbery - I have been at home one year and a half, and was in service before that - I had gone out for some tea and sugar for my mother; I stopped opposite Dunn's house a quarter of an hour, while the prisoners were lurking about - I was going to get some meat when they said this to me - I saw Court tie the door - when they ran away, I went straight home, without going into Dunn's: I never went to tell Dunn of it - I told my mother of it that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you remain there to see the thing out? A. I had been waiting so long, I wanted to get home - they were running away when I went away - I told nobody till I got home; I was offended at their pushing against me.</p>

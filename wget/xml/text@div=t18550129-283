                  </hi>. On 10th Jan., between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning, a robbery was committed on my premises, the White Horse public house, Rupert-street, St. James's. I was knocked up by an officer about half past 4 o'clock, and the tap room window was broken open from the back; the parlour door had been broken open and closed again, and about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property stolen, and some spirits—among the property stolen was this hydrometer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on that evening the prisoner came and said, "Have you been robbed?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "What have you lost?"—(I had seen him several times before as a customer)—I named to him the articles of jewellery and this hydrometer—he said, "I think I can get the hydrometer back for you"—I said, "Can you; how is that?"—he said, "I was at a house last night where they were talking about <hi rend="italic">doing a drum over</hi>"—I understand that that is breaking into a house—1 said, "If you can get it back I will give you a sovereign"—he said, "Very well, I will go and see"—I expressed a wish to go with him, which he declined; he said it would not look well to see us both together, and told me to wait at a house which I followed him to, the Thirteen Cantons—he left me there, and walked in the direction of King-street—he came back, and said, "I can get it in half an hour"—he said that he would bring it to me at the corner of Lisle-street and Leicester-place, the Prince of Wales Hotel—I waited there, and he brought it to me—we walked back to my house, and I wished him to go down to the station, but he declined—I then returned to my house, and got Sergeant Barnes and a policeman on duty, and persuaded the prisoner to walk down to the station—he went with us, and told the inspector on duty that if he would let an officer go with him he would show us the man who gave it to him—on that I went with him and an officer to a public house in Hayes-court, kept by a man named Gra<lb></lb>ham—the prisoner said that he would go in and see if they were there, and come and let us know—we waited outside very nearly an hour and a half; he came out between 9 and 10 o'clock, and the sergeant said, "Where are those parties? have you seen them?"—he said, "No. Did you see a short stout man, with a rough coat on and a cap, go out?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "That is one of them that gave it to me"—Godfrey said, "Why did not you come out and tell us that—he said, "Because he has gone to fetch the other; but I dare say if you wait he will be back"—we promised to be back in an hour and a half, and when we went the house was closed, and no one was there—on the next evening the prisoner came to my place</p>

Did you see a man come out: a short, stiff built man, dressed in a rough coat and a cap, smoking?"—I said, "Yes, we did"—he said, "That is one of the men who brought it to me"—I said, "Why did not you come out and let us know?"—he hesitated, and said, "I think he has gone to fetch the other man"—I said, "It is not very likely he will come back"—we left him there with an understanding that he should wait; we came back in an hour and a half, and the house was closed—when he mentioned the man who gave him the hydrometer, he did not mention any other person, nor has he done so at all—he has not mentioned that the landlord gave it to him—he has never mentioned the landlord's name to me in the transaction.</p>

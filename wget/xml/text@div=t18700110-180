                  </hi>. I am a private in the 94th Foot, stationed at Wool<lb></lb>wich, and am an officer's servant—on 29th December, the prisoner was employed there as a sweep, with another man—private Taylor was in charge of them—I went from the kitchen up to my master's room, and when I came down again, I missed a piece of soap, and a pair of boots—I reported my lose to private Taylor, and he went across with me to the soot bag, and in it found my boots, and another pair with them—I gave the other sweep, Sciven, in charge first, and afterwards the prisoner—he said he knew nothing about the boots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did private Taylor leave the sweeps, and go with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he took Sciven about with him, to sweep the chimneys, and left the prisoner to collect the soot afterwards—there was no one but them in the room—I missed the boots about 3.30—the sweeps were then outside the door, with the soot bags, and when I reported it to Taylor, the prisoner bolted—these are my boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the 94th Regiment, stationed at Wool<lb></lb>wich—these boots are Her Majesty's property, worn by private Rayley—the prisoner and Sciven were the only sweeps employed in the barracks that afternoon; they were employed by the contractor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am a pioneer, in the 94th Regiment—I was in charge of the prisoner and Sciven on this afternoon—I had to take Sciven to the different chimneys that he was to sweep, and the prisoner had to gather up the soot afterwards—I recollect Sciven having to sweep the chimney of Rayley's master, that was from about 3.0 to 3.30—he then went up stairs with me, and swept another chimney, leaving the prisoner in the kitchen to gather up the soot—Sciven was in my company all the time.</p>

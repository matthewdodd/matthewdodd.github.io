                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Alma Road, Blue Anchor Road, and am a stationer—between twelve and one on the morning of 9th April I was passing No. 8, Alma Road, in company with a man named Johnson—the prisoner and his wife live there—he is my brother-in-law—I heard quarrelling between him and my sister—they occupy the first floor—I knocked at the door, and the landlady let me in—I went up to the front room, and Johnson followed—I pushed the door to open it, and the prisoner was pushing from the inside—I heard my sister say, "William, there is John outside; lock the door"—I continued pushing—the door yielded, and while on the threshold the prisoner struck me with a knife—I felt the blood trickle down my left hand—I pushed him against the window—I put my right hand up to save my throat, and he then struck me with a knife in the right hand—it was a pocket clasp-knife—I went down stairs—a policeman was outside—he took me under a lamp and looked at my hands, and said, "Go to the doctor's"—I went to a doctor's, and then to the hospital—I told the constable to take the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you were excited? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard quar<lb></lb>relling, and of course I had a feeling for my sister—I had just come from a friend's—I had had some refreshment—there was a candle burning in the room—there was no light on the staircase—I do not know whether the door was locked; it was closed—I do not know whether I broke open the door—I asked him what right he had to insult my sister, and then a struggle took place—I did not hear the prisoner say, "You have no right here, you had better go away"—I do not remember saying, "I will break your b—head open"—I won't swear I did not say it—I was so weak when at the police-court that I do not know what I did say.</p>

                  </hi>. On 9th April I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—a little after two a.m. Mr. Mourgue was brought to me with three several wounds on the hands; one on the left hand, an inch and a half long, at the back, over the knuckles, and little finger—the tendons were cut—on the right hand there was one three inches in length, ex<lb></lb>tending from the centre of the palm, to the centre of the little finger—a piece was cut off the thumb—it was half an inch deep—those wounds were inflicted by some sharp instrument—the knife produced would have pro<lb></lb>duced such wounds—his little finger will be permanently stiff—the right hand has healed—he lost a great deal of blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 81, Fort Road, Bermondsey—I was with Mr. Mourgue on the morning in question—as we were passing No. 2, Alma Road, we heard a noise coming from the rooms up stairs—he said, "Let's go up stairs, and see what is the matter"—I said, "Very well, I will go with you"—he said, "Yes, do come"—we went up stairs—I saw the door give way—the prisoner rushed at him with a knife—I did not see him actually stab the prosecutor, but I saw the knife in his hand—I do not recollect hearing the prosecutor make use of any bad language.</p>

               <p>and am a waste paper dealer—on the night of 21st November I was going towards home about 10.30 or 11 o'clock—when I got near my house I saw two or three men coming towards me—I tried to avoid them—they ran out of a place where they are pulling down two or three houses—one of them hit me in the mouth and knocked me down, and one had me at the back of the neck when I wag down—the other one had me by the throat, and another one picked my pocket of a little canvas bag and five sovereigns in it, which I had in my left-hand trouser's pocket—one of them said "Kill the old b——, or take his money"—I can't tell which of them said that—I had seen my money about three minutes before—I was very much hurt—an officer ran up the court, and presented his bull's eye—I don't know whether they saw the light, but they ran, and he ran after them—I found my money was gone, but I could not halloa, I was grizzling like—my throat was so bad, because they held me so tight—I saw no more of them I can't say that I know any of them.</p>

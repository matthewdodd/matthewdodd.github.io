                  </hi>. On 5th Aug. I was walking with my husband near Bugbee's-hole—we were having a few words; in fact we bad been quarrelling and fighting—I was not quite sober—I recollect striking him several times—I do not know whether he struck me in return, but we were both down—I recollect some one coming up—I had not called out to my knowledge—it might be five minutes after I was oh the ground—I had walked away from my husband there, and saw some blood on my dress—when I got home I found my throat was cut—I do not know when it was cut—I fancied I saw a knife in my husband's hand while struggling with him, but cannot say.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was your husband in liquor that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do just recollect saying," Go after that man"—my husband has been in a very bad state of health for the last month, in fact, for the last four years—I am quite certain his mind has not been exactly right, by the treatment I have received—I have had numbers of quarrels with him—he is a very excellent husband when he is in his right mind—I believe his mind has been disturbed through the death of my children—I have had three born alive—one lived to be eighteen, and the other nineteen months, and the other is not by my husband, it is living in the country with my friends—I had it before I was married to him—he never had to support it, neither did he upbraid me of it—he lost his children, but the child before marriage lived, and that has produced so much unhappiness as to upset his reason—I have heard him say he would make away with himself—I have asked his reasons, and he has said, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Meg.</hi>, you don't know"—I do not remember any blow being given to my neck—I never knew whether it was an accident or not—it did not occur to me while we were having the words, that be would be likely to attempt his life—to the best of my recollection I fell on him—we had had mutual blows that day, before—he has beaten me severely, and when his passion has abated, and I have told him, he would not believe he had done it—he has said, "I did not hit you like that"—when he is in a passion, his mind is very strange, and he has declared he has not struck me when he has—I am sure his mind is very much disturbed—when he has beaten me he has had cause, for I have gone and left him, and then I have been very saucy and impudent to him, and he has beaten me—I have said, what had it to do with him? I would go if I liked, and he has beaten me, and I have struck him again—there has not been jealousy between us, till within the last month or two—I knew if I went out that he would be disturbed—it was mere aggravation on my part to stop away from him—I was not thinking of leaving him altogether—I would like to live with him—it was merely the passion that made me go away—it was merely to keep him in suspense, by the way he has struck me—I went away because I was offended at his striking me—he has been in the habit of drinking much, and it has generally been then that he has got into these passions—he has been a very good husband at other times—he has been five years master of a sailing vessel, under Government, from Woolwich to Chatham, up to this time—his father sailed with the vessel for thirty years—our last child died last May twelve months—his mind has been more affected</p>

               <p>during the last month—nothing has occurred to increase it, except the jealousy—I attribute it to that—he has come home and found me out, and I did not come home for some hours—I have been gossiping with my neighbours, and he has come home and not found his meals ready, and we have had words—his boat does not come at a certain time, but as the tide suits.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Woolwich. On 5th Aug., I was called to see Mrs. Hornsey, about ten o'clock at night—I found a wound on her neck, about three inches long—no vessels of any importance were divided—there had been a good deal of hemorrhage—she was saturated with blood—she was suffering from exhaustion—it was a flesh-wound, down to the muscles only—it commenced from the centre of the neck, near the wind-pipe, and proceeded towards the left ear—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was shown to me; it would produce the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BIRNIE</hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the prisoner on 5th Aug., and found a large flesh-wound on the fore-part of his neck about three inches long—he was very prostrated, both bodily and mentally—he appeared to have been immersed in water, and seemed in a very dejected state—I administered brandy—when he regained his senses, I asked him about the transaction—when I inquired about his wife, be sprang up in bed, laid hold of my arm with great violence, and seemed in a state of great agitation—he did not seem to recollect anything, but next morning I had some more conversation with him—he did not recollect where he saw his wife last—he asked where he was, what he had been doing, and what was he there for—there was great incoherency about him—next evening there was great delirium—he would sing a <hi rend="italic">stave</hi>, and lie down, not knowing what he was about—delirium is connected with disease of the brain—I did not con<lb></lb>sider him in danger from the wounds—he was very much depressed, but from brandy and the application of warmth, he rallied—I think he did not under<lb></lb>stand what he was about on Sunday—there was an appearance of determina<lb></lb>tion of blood towards the head and face—I think he was a little more collected on Monday morning, but on Sunday evening he was entirely inco<lb></lb>herent; he did not know what he was about, nor what had occurred—he was delirious for a short time.</p>

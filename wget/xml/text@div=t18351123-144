                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Roach. I do not know where he is, but his name is down as having enlisted for the Queen of Spain. On the 20th of November, I met the prisoner in Queen-street, Tower-Bill—I had never seen him before—he came up to me while I was waiting for Mary Ann Parish, who was at the baker's shop—he said, "How do you do, my dear?"—I said, "I am very well, I thank you, Sir, but I don't know you"—he said, 'Are you waiting for you sweetheart?"—I said, "I am not, my sweetheart is too far away for me to wait for him," and asked where he was—I said he was enlisted in the Queen of Spain's service—he then asked if he could go home with me—I told him he could not, for I had two children (and one of them is since dead)—the prisoner then said I could have my husband back to me, by my paying him nine shillings—he said he would fetch him back in a fornight, or a month at the farthest—I told him I had not so much with me, But I dare say I could make it up—Mary Ann Parish then came out—I told her the prisoner was the captain of the vessel which took my husband to Spain—(he had told the captain of the vessel which took my husband to Spain—(he had told me so)—Parish said that she should be very glad for him to come back, that she had a helf-sovereign, and she would lend it to me—she went went home, and fetched me the half-sovereign—while she was gone, the prisoner and I went, and had a pint of half-and-half at Mr. Davis's public house, in Swan-street—Parish then brought me the half sovereign, and I gave it in to the prisoner's hand—he did not give me the shilling change—I should not have given him the half-sovereign, but for his pretending that he was the captaion of the ship by which my husband was conveyed to Spain, and that he would restore him in a fortnight, or a month, and seeing that he was a respectable looking man—he said he lodged at the Queen's Head, where my husband had enlisted from.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the baker's shop that evening, and when I came out I saw the prisoner in conversation with the prosecutrix—she said in the presence of the prisoner, that that gentleman represented himself to be a captain who was taking a ship of recruits for the Queen of Spain, and by her paying him nine shillings, he would be able to get her husband back in a fortnight, or a month at farthese—she said, she had not nine pence in the world, much more nine shillings—I said, "Mrs. Roach, you shall not be lost, if nine shillings will be any object to you—I can get half-a-sove<lb></lb>reign, and lend you"—I took my bread home, and borrowed half-a-sovereign of a friend—I then returned to the prisoner and Mr. Roach—I found them coming up Swan-street—I gave her the half-sovereign, and saw her give it to the prisoner—I then left them.</p>

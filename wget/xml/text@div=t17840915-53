             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I am an Irish woman.</p>
               <p>What is your business? - I do not follow any business, only sometimes I sell fruit.</p>
               <p>Was you robbed last July? - I was, the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I had a lodging for him, somebody recommended him to me, I never saw him before, I cannot tell the day of the month, he wore a sailors jacket upon him, says he, come along with me, and I will put something in your way, and help me to bring my shirts and a chest that I left at home, he said, he would put two or three shillings in my pocket, and I was glad of it; but I said, I would not go without my husband, and he took me seven or eight miles.</p>
               <p>But did he take you without your husband? - No, Sir, he did not, and then he left my husband in one public house, and took me to another, and there he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Then you did set off with your husband at first? - Yes, I don't know what place he robbed me in, it was beyond Islington, he took me in the house, and he called for a pint of beer, and there were two Gentlemen drinking a pint of beer and nobody else, and as soon as we came in they went out, then the boy brought a pint of beer and went out directly, then the prisoner drank a drop of it, and then he asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150108"></xptr> what money I had; not a great deal says I, let me have what you have of it, says he, and I gave him the three half-guineas in his hand.</p>
               <p>What did he say this in a threatening manner? - Yes, and he threatened my life, and I was afraid to say any thing, I gave him three half-guineas, and half a crown I thought to keep.</p>
               <p>Did he draw a knife or any thing of that sort? - No, Sir, he did not, I staid in the place an hour after he robbed me of my money; I did not see any body in the house but himself, I was afraid to tell any body in the world how he served me, he got the money and went away directly.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see no alehouse boy? - I never saw the boy at all, I did not know any more of the place where I was, than a fool, I think in my own mind, that I staid more than an hour in the place after he was robbing me, my husband met me in the fields, coming from the other public house, I did not tell my husband how he had served me, till three or four days after, till I was very bad, I was so frightened, I am sure this is the man, he left this bundle behind him, there is nothing in the bundle but some old wood, and hellebore.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not worth your three half-guineas, and half-crown? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. First and foremost, it is too long a story, and I am not willing to give the Court and Jury any trouble; ask her whether she swore a robbery at Litchfield-street? - No, I did not, I swore that he threatened my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did you tell this story exactly at the Justice's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. This fact the woman swears to, was in July last, you hear her story, she says, this man came to her in July, and asked for lodgings.</p>
               <p>Court to Judith. Was that the boy? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, whatever story she gave before the Justice, if she has now told the truth, this is the story to which you are to attend; at the same time, if she has given different accounts, then to be sure it throws a very strong suspicion upon the truth of her story, but if you believe the witnesses have told the truth, there is no doubt in point of law, but he has committed a robbery.</p>

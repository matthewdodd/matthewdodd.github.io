               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner's hands? - A. Yes; the press had then been recently pulled, because I found a plate with a stamp upon it; his hands were as all men's hands are that work a rolling-press, with black ink or red ink, they wipe the plate with their hands; his hands were then stained with red ink, and the stamps that hung upon the line were worked with red ink, they were damp; the linen is obliged to be damped to receive the impression; this plate was on a thing which they call a jigger, that they wipe on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. I take it that has been in your custody ever since? - A. No, it has not; I marked it with my own name, and gave it to Mr. Estcourt's clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is a jigger? - A. It is what the plate is wiped on after it receives the ink; this grate is for laying the plate upon, with charcoal underneath, to keep it in a little warmth; this is the pot that had the charcoal in it, which was then alight; after the prisoner was secured, these printed stamps I took down from the line, and I have had all but three ever since in my possession. (Produces them.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were they damp when you found them upon the lines? - A. Yes, they were, they are two shilling stamps, No. 24. This quantity of cloth was over the press, but had not received any impression, it was wet, in a fit state to print; I found the press compleat at work, and every apparatus compleat for printing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. The door of the garret was open when you went up stairs? - A. It was just opened as I entered, three of us going up stairs, I saw the prisoner with the nob of the door in his hand, and Barnett Solomons was behind the press.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that all you know of him? - A. No, I did give evidence once against him in this Court for coining of halfpence, I believe about twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any other circumstance about Mr. Solomons? - A. No, not of my own knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know he is as great a rascal as lives? - A. I do not know that; I know many of the Jews are a deal worse.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these plates did you find under the press? - A. This, the sixpenny one, that impression had just been pulled.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the other? - A. Ready to be put in the press as the other came out, I found it lying on the jigger. I served five years to a copper-plate printer, that makes me know so much of the nature of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that stamp, is that an engraving of your's, or belonging to the Stamp-office? - A. It is a counterfeit; our stamps are engraved 4, 6, and 8, on a plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at one of these impressions, does that stamp resemble the original? - A. No, this is a counterfeit, it is an impression from this plate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does it mean to resemble the real stamp? - A. Yes, so nearly, that persons not conversant in these things would be deceived.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Tell me the distinguishing circumstances? - A. They have omitted the chain in the counterfeit stamp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did you engrave that which is in use in the Stamp-office? - A. Not entirely my self, I finished it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you fetch it from there yourself? - A. I believe this gentleman delivered it to me who fits next me, Mr. Linley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you received it? - A. I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. About when? - A. It could not be long after its date.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you return the plates to after you had engraved them? - A. I carry them to the Stamp-office, then they are entered, and signed by three or four witnesses, and always in presence of a Commissioner.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these the plates that have been in use in the Stamp-office, for the purpose of impressing stamps? - A. I have them here, (produces them); they are under my care.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. How many plates like that large one have you engraved since that order came? - A. I cannot say, I have engraved many of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now point out to me the difference between that on the large plate, and that which you have in your right hand? - A. There are many differences that you would not be a judge of, there is a chain totally omitted.</p>
               <p>Q. These plates, by wearing, become unfit for use, without re-touching? - A. They are repaired upon the same plate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. (To Linley.) Q. How many of these plates are there in use? - A. Forty-six.(Mr. Shelton reads the record of the conviction).</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Solomons.) Tell us what you know about this business? - A. I went to a house that I use, and Collins told me he had got something that might be of use, we might get money by it; I asked him what it was; and he shewed me a two shilling stamp; he told me if I could negociate any of them, it would be of great service to him and me too; I took the stamp to a gentleman, who said, he would go immediately with me to a solicitor; he went with me, it was a stamp upon cloth; the prisoner brought me some stamps to a public-house, he brought me two hundred the next day; he served me about three weeks, I had about seven hundred in the whole of them; the Sunday before he was apprehended, he asked me to come to his house, I did not know where he lived till he asked me to come; it was about two o'clock in the afternoon, and I saw the press, but he said it was Sunday, and there was no work going on; he told me to call on the Monday, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us any thing you saw then about the stamps? - A. I saw the two shilling stamps struck.</p>
               <p>Q. Who struck them? - A. The prisoner; he asked me to pull the press for him, which I did; and in about an hour the officers came and took us.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I think it is not necessary for me to say much, being fully conscious of my own innocence; that man is the greatest traitor that ever was born, he has sworn as false as any thing under the sun; if ever an innocent man stood at the bar I am he; my Lord, and Gentlemen, I have nothing more to say, I leave it intirely to your discretion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. My Lord. This indictment is founded upon an Act of Parliament, the 36th of the present King, which refers to a former statute, the 24th of the King, by which it is enacted, that no person is to sell hats without a licence. It then charges upon hats a duty of two shillings for every hat above the value of twelve shillings, and so on. Then the statute of the 36th of the King enacts, that every hat made of felt, wool, stuff, beaver, or leather, &amp;c. shall be lined, or covered, in the inside of the crown, with silk, linen, or other proper materials, whereon a durable mark, or stamp, can be conveniently affixed, to denote the duties by the said recited Act imposed; and on which materials, a stamp, or mark, to be provided by the Commissioners of the Stamp-office, shall have been stamped.</p>
               <p>Now, if this same status had charged the duty which has directed the stamp to be used, and has created the subject of the offence, beyond a doubt this indictment would have been good; but, I submit to your Lordship, upon the face of this indictment, that it is at least equivocal by what statute this duty is charged; if this indictment had stated that he forged a stamp denoting a duty charged by the 86th of the King, it would be bad, because there is no duty charged by that statue; and, therefore, it must be stated to be a duty charged by some other statute than that set out in the indictment; because, by that statute, there is no duty charged at all. It is stated in the indictment, that the prisoner has forged a stamp to denote a duty charged by virtue of the statute. - I say, that is not sufficiently stated; for the only statute in the indictment is the 36th of George III. which charges no duty at all. I submit to your Lordship, that it ought to have been stated in this way; that he has forged a stamp to denote a duty charged by virtue of the statute of the 24th of George III. and then it would stand perfectly clear; that the duty being charged by one statute, and the stamp provided by another, that he had forged the stamp directed by the 36th. denoting a duty charged by the 24th.</p>
               <p>Court. You see, Brother Shepherd, the words are - "forge a stamp, and mark, then and there directed to be used, in pursuance of a certain Act made in the 36th, denoting a duty of two shillings, charged by virtue of the statute in that case made and provided."</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. If your Lordship thinks that must necessarily refer to some other statute, my objection falls; but I submit to your Lordship, it is most perfectly equivocal as it stands at present.</p>
               <p>Court. If there is a statute made and provided for the purpose, am I to suppose it refers to a wrong statute?</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. If your Lordship takes the statute in that case made and provided necessarily to refer to the 24th.</p>
               <p>Court. He has transgressed against the 36th, by forging a stamp in that case made and provided.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. I will just trouble your Lordship with another objection. This statute creates an offence. the object of which is to defraud the King of a duty raised by another statute. - Then this man has offended against two statutes, and this indictment concludes "against the form of the statute" only; whereas, I apprehend, if there is a breach of the law against two statutes, it is necessary that the indictment should conclude "against the form of the statutes;" I admit it will not vitiate an indictment which concludes against the form of the statutes when the offence is only against one statute; but I contend, that where it is stated against the form of the statute, when it is an offence against two statutes, that indictment is bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I shall apply myself entirely to the latter objection of my learned Friend's. - My learned Friend says truly, an indictment must conclude against the plurality of statutes, if a plurality of statutes be necessary to contemplate the crime of which a party is accused; if, therefore, it were necessary in any degree to consider the constitution of the crime, as made by the 24th of the King, it would give a semblance to the objection of my learned Friend; but, inasmuch as here, whatever other duties may be imposed by former Acts, the 36th comprises all those cases, so as to bring them within one focus. I consider the crime, of which the prisoner is indicted here, to consist in what I shall now state to your Lordship: whatever the duties were before, whether they had been imposed by one, two, three, or four different statutes, it does not at all signify here; the statute of the 36th says, that a stamp, ordered by the Commissioners to denote any thing that had gone before, that the forging, or counterfeiting that stamp, is the crime in the contemplation of the Legislature. Therefore, your Lordship can have nothing to do with any other statute; for the 36th of the King expressly makes it criminal in the party to forge that, which, by the order and direction of the 36th, is adopted in order to denote such duty, and therefore it could not have been necessary for us, in the least degree, to have taken notice of the manner in which the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120094"></xptr>duties were imposed by the 24th of the King. It is true, the Act of Parliament does not expressly charge the duty of 2s.; but there are a great variety of cases in the books, where I take the distinction always to have been this: that where the crime in the contemplation of the Legislature is laid altogether, and the punishment affixed by a latter Act of Parliament, though there may have been several preceding Acts of Parliament, it is always laid as against that statute. The crime here, is the counterfeiting a stamp, that stamp is directed to be used by the Commissioners, by this very Act; and all we have to consider is, whether the stamp, so made use of, was ordered by the Commissioners under this Act. We conceive we have nothing to do with the antecedent Acts, and therefore, we trust your Lordship will be of opinion that the indictment is good.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, There has been one position of law assumed upon this occasion, against which I beg leave to enter my protest. In the first place, the foundation certainly fails - The crime with which the prisoner at the bar stands charged, is forging a certain stamp; that crime was created by the 36th of the King, and created by no other statute whatever; because, till the 36th of the King, that stamp, which he is charged with forging, as a capital offence, was not in existence. The 24th of the King had ordered stamps to be made, but they were to be impressed upon paper; that mode of collecting the duty was found to be open to considerable evasion, and therefore the 36th repealed that mode of impressing the stamps. To denote the duty, it says, that new stamps shall be prepared by the Commissioners, to be impressed upon linen, and so far fixed to the hat as to make evasion more difficult. Then comes the enacting clause, which says, if any person shall forge or counterfeit any stamp directed to be used by this act, then they shall suffer death, without benefit of clergy. There is no other stamp legally in existence, and therefore there can be no other forgery than that individual forgery created by this individual Act; therefore, that would be the answer to the position, upon which the subsequent objection must be grounded, namely, that there are two statutes relative to this offence; but, supposing that were so, yet the inference of law deduced from it, cannot stand. It is taken as a position, that the indictment ought to conclude against the form of the statutes - I know that Mr. Serjeant Hawkins, when he treats on the subject of indictments, says, there have been some authorities for it; but he adds, there are also strong authorities for the contrary opinion, which is also most agreeable to precedents; and I will venture to say, that there are no precedents in the margin of this book(4 Hawkins, 71) of indictments, upon which the objection has been raised, and upon which the objection has been allowed. The precedents there cited, are precedents of actions qui tam, in which the objection has been allowed; but in those cases there is no allegation of a crime, and therefore the party claiming a penalty may be held to greater strictness than in an indictment calling upon the party to answer for a crime. There is no precedent, so far as I have been able to search, of that kind; but those precedents which are cited in the margin, are proceedings in actions qui tam, and not upon indictments; and therefore, do not warrant the assertion that there are precedents, in which the Court have decided, that, in indictments, the conclusion must be against the form of the statutes; on the contrary, the strong authorities, as well as the course of precedents, are on the other side; and therefore, unless there is some modern case stronger, in which those former opinions are taken notice of, and held not to be law, while it is said, the stronger opinions are on the other side, and the course of precedents too, your Lordship will not give way to the weaker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. My Lord, With respect to the authority of Mr. Serjeant Hawkins, there are cases which appear of a contrary determination. Mr. Serjeant Hawkins says, where the proceedings are in latin, and may not be understood, the safest way is to put it with an abridgment, contra formam statut, which may stand either for statuti or statutorum, as will best maintain the indictment. Where one act creates an offence without reference to another, which enacts what the punishment shall be, there I apprehend it should be against the form of the statute, because the subsequent statute has nothing to do with the offence, but merely with something that is to be done with the prisoner, after the verdict of the Jury has passed, namely, punishment: But where an offence is constituted, and necessarily must be founded, upon more than one statute, it is not a true description of the prisoner's offence, because he has not done any thing criminal against the form of the statute, but against the form of the statutes. Now, to apply that observation, suppose for a moment, the 24th Geo. III. was expunged from the book of statutes, neither my learned Friend, or any body else, could form an indictment, or convict a man upon the 36th, because the 36th creates an offence forging a stamp denoting a duty charged by another statute; therefore, the 24th of the King, must be an existing law at the time the offence was committed, or it is no offence at all; and therefore makes one of the ingredients upon which the indictment is framed; for the indictment is for doing an act prohibited by the 36th, producing a fraud, the existence of which fraud can only be against the 24th; for there must be an act done, and there must be a fraud intended; the act must be done against the 36th of the King, the intention of fraud is against the 24th, because it is an intention to defraud his Majesty of a duty charged by the 24th-Then there must be two Acts of Parliament to constitute the offence charged, and if so, then I submit to your Lordship that this indictment cannot be good.</p>
               <p>My learned Friend, Mr. Knapp, refers me to an authority very much in point, in Hale's Pleas of the Crown, 2d vol. 173. The case cited, is the case of Dingly and Moore, from Croke, Eliz. 6."If one statute be relative to another, as where the former makes the offence, the latter adds a penalty; the indictment ought to conclude contra forma statutorum." That is not exactly this case to be sure, but the principle, as it seems to me, is the same; that where two statutes must be taken into contemplation, in order to constitute the offence, it must be against the form of the statutes. The indictment charges that he has forged a stamp denoting a duty of 2s. upon all hats above the value of 12s. to be sold by any person; suppose they had blundered at that description, and said, denoting a duty upon all hats above the value of 5s.; beyond a doubt, it would have been bad, because it must charge, by the 36th of the King, that the stamp forged, is a stamp denoting a duty. - There is no duty upon a hat of 5s. therefore, if it does not say, forging a stamp denoting a legal duty, as charged by the 24th, it would not be any offence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120095"></xptr>at all. That shews that your Lordship must necessarily look at the 24th, in order to see whether he has forged any stamp which does denote any thing at all; and here the offence is founded upon that statute, because the offence is, forging a stamp, directed by the 36th of the King, to denote a duty charged by the 24th of the King; and therefore, unless the indictment had stated it to be against the form of the statutes, it cannot be good.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. This objection, in the first place, is perfectly new. I believe I have attended scores of prosecutions in the offices which I have had the honour to fill, and in every case these forgeries are attended with the consequence of breaking in upon some revenue, founded upon some Act. I agree with my Brother Shepherd, that if one Act shall speak of the crime, and another of the punishment, you must take the two Acts together; but it is singular, as it strikes my mind, to suppose that the 24th of the King had any thing to do with the present indictment, which is an indictment for offending against a mode of offence, which is, for the first time, described in the 36th; it is an offence against that Act, and that only; but in describing the offence, and purely as matter of description, the indictment says, he has forged a stamp and mark directed to be used in pursuance of a certain Act; for what purpose? it then describes the thing, for the purpose of denoting a stamp duty of two shillings, by virtue of the said statute. Then it is nothing more than describing what sort of stamp it is that has been forged; but the crime of forging depends entirely upon the 36th, and not at all upon the 24th. I take it this does not fall within that sort of case, where you must necessarily look into two statutes to see what the offence is; you only look into one, and there you see what the consequences of that offence is; it is a very different case from where the crime is defined in one Act, and the consequences in another. I am therefore of opinion, that the objection should be over-ruled: at the same time, if Mr. Knapp, and my Brother Shepherd, think it a point worth reserving, it shall be reserved.</p>

               <p>After the verdict was pronounced, the prisoner addressed the Court as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am perfectly satisfied with my trial; I meet the sentence with every fortitude that a man ought to do. To the Counsel, who have pleaded for me, I return my most sincere thanks. The evidence of Barnett is completely false; and knowing my own innocence, and the manner in which I have been drawn into it, I shall meet that God hereafter, whom he dare not shew his face before. I am totally innocent, and I know that God will stand my friend, and a crucified Christ will receive me in the arms of his faithfulness, when I launch from the gallows into an endless eternity.</p>

               <p>I am a midwife. I know the prisoner, by attending her when called on, the 17th of September; I found her on the bed not quite delivered, and I finished my business; the child was born, but she was not quite delivered; I saw the child; it was taken from a water-closet; it appeared to be a full grown child, and perfect in every respect: it appeared that the prisoner went to this necessary from the common feelings of every woman that is delivered; and that from ignorance of her state, she went there to relieve herself; and that the child might have been still born, from her ignorance of rendering it proper assistance; there was not the least mark of violence; some little things were provided for it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lived with me about ten or eleven weeks; I suspected sometimes that she was with child; I called her up about half past six; she got up and made the fire; I went to market about seven, and did not return till very near nine; and she was at the water closet very bad; she said she had swooned away twice, dead; so I looked, and found the baby in the place; she seemed a very good girl.</p>

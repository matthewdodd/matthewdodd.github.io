                  </hi>. I live in Phoenix-street, Spitalfields, and am traveller to Mr. Edward Harris, an ale merchant—he is the sole consignee of Mr. Morgan, of Norwich—he is in the habit of selling the ale to customers in different parts of town—Butfoy was his carman—it was his business to carry out the beer and ale, and to collect empty barrels and bring them home—</p>

               <p>Cripps was an occasional man, and he assisted Butfoy to carry out the ale, and to collect the casks—in consequence of information, I went on 19th April to Small's premises, in Short-street, Locke's-fields, Walworth—he carries on the business of a cooper—I went into the yard, and saw Small—I also saw two of our barrels, and three belonging to other brewers—our barrels were branded, "Morgan, Norwich"—the brands had been cut out, but I examined them, and saw the traces of the letters quite sufficiently—they had contained ale which had been brewed in March—I said to Small, "Are these barrels for sale?" he said "Yes"—I said, "What is the price?" he said, "12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. apiece"—I asked if they were all he had—he replied, "Yes"—I asked if he could supply me with a hundred—he inquired in what time I should want them—I said, "Could you let me have a hundred in a week or a fortnight?"—he said no, he could not let me have them in that time, but, if I would guarantee to take a hundred, he would get that number in five or six weeks, and deliver them—I said, "What would the price be, sup<lb></lb>posing I bought a hundred of them"—he said, "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-piece for that number"—he was very anxious to know who recommended me, and my address—of course I did not satisfy him, but I said I should see him in two or three days—I afterwards saw some other casks, and identified them as Mr. Harris's—I afterwards went to Mr. Dredge's, and saw some barrels there—on the next day after I had been to Small's, I gave instructions to Butfoy to go to three places, and receive empty barrels from each place—when he and Cripps returned, they brought with them three empty barrels and two empty kilderkins—they brought this note, which was given to the cellarman—it is Butfoy's writing, and it has been altered from five to three, and three empty barrels were returned from Mr. Austin—there were none delivered from Mr. Hall—this is the delivery note from Mr. Hall—it shows one to be returned, and that was not returned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jesse Crump—we keep a beershop, in Charlotte-street, Walworth—it is two or three doors from Mr. Small's pre<lb></lb>mises—I never saw Butfoy come to my house with a dray—there was a dray—Butfoy and Cripps have been in the habit of coming to my house—on 20th April, I saw a dray, and Butfoy and Cripps came to my house—Cripps went out, leaving Butfoy in my house for about a quarter of an hour—on Cripps' return, they had some conversation, and Butfoy went out—Cripps told him to go to the top of Brandon-street, and wait there—Cripps was at my house on the Saturday before, and on the next morning—while Cripps was at my place on the Saturday before, a boy came there from Mr. Smalls, and, in consequence of what was said by the boy, Cripps went out—I have seen Cripps and Small come in my house four or five times, and they have drank together.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector</hi>). On Wednesday, 20th April, I went with a constable to Small's house—I waited till half-past 1 o'clock on the Thursday morning—Small then came home—I met him and asked him if he had had any barrels brought in lately—he said that he had not within the last two or three weeks, and that all that was in the place belonged to him—I asked him whether it was his place—he said "Yes"—I asked him if he had any brought there on the previous evening, the Wednesday—he said, "Who are you?"—I told him we belonged to the police, and he must consider himself in custody for receiving barrels on the Wednesday and on the previous Saturday, well knowing them to have been stolen—he said those that he had received on the Saturday were brought to him by a man recommended by a Mr. Munnery, in Bath-street, Kingsland-road, and that he had given him seven or eight shillings apiece for them—I asked if they were still in the yard—he said no, they were not; he had taken them away yesterday morning in a cart, to a man named Dredge, who resided near King's-cross, but he could not tell me the street—I took him to the station, and came back and searched the premises—I there found three barrels, branded Morgan, Norwich; one branded R. Thornton; and a kil<lb></lb>derkin</p>

               <p>with Truman and Co. on it, all which I removed to the station—I then took Small into the station yard, and told him these were the barrels I got from his premises, and I asked him if he remembered anything about them—he pointed to the four barrels, and said he bought them last night, but he had not paid the whole of the money for them—he had paid fourteen shillings on account—he did not say from whom—I went back to his house, and took away three account books and some papers—I searched him, and found some money on him—about half-past 9 o'clock the same morning I went again to the yard; sent a lad to Cripps, who came back with the lad, and was taken in custody—I went on the Saturday to John-street, Pentonville, to Mr. Dredger—I found near thirty barrels; five of them had the brands cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper, of John-street, Pentonville—I have a store there—on 20th April I bought four casks of Small—there were no brands on them—they were cut out—they were delivered on the 20th—I saw them in Small's cart—I did not see them at his premises—I had bought some on two or three occasions before that—I paid 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the four; that was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I had bought four on the 15tn at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the brands had been cut out of them also—I had bought three barrels and two kilderkins for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 11th April—the barrels were 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and the kilderkins 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—and on 2d April I had bought sundry old casks and barrels—the names were Cut out of all these—I had been to Small's premises on several occasions—I have not observed any barrels with the name of Morgan oh them—I Was present when the police took away five barrels from my place—they had come from Small's.</p>

               <p>the 16th—they had no brand on them—those taken away were not bought of Davis—I bought some of Munnerman on 12th April—they are on the premises now—I say that I cannot tell whether those that were taken away were, what I bought of Small, because I believe they were all put together—I have not sold any—those I bought of Munnerman were like those I bought of Small—I could have distinguished one from the other if I had taken particular notice.</p>

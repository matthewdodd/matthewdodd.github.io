I am a watchmaker, at 25, Great Pear Tree Street, Waterloo Road—on Sunday morning, about 12.45, I was coming down Stamford Street—as I turned into the Waterloo Road I was met be the prisoner and another female—she said she would have my hat—I said she should not—the came and laid hold of my left arm and walked at far as the church, when I got rid of her—I walked straight on then, and thought no more of it—I crossed the road to the corner of my own street; just stepping on to the pavement, I saw the prisoner and two men converting together—I could not hear what they said—at I was going to the door of my house I received a blow on the aide of the face, and was knocked down, right opposite my deer—I went on my face and hands—I can't say which of the three knocked me down—I believe the prisoner was behind me—I tried to get up again—I was turned on to my back—the prisoner came and knelt en my chest—I was very much hurt and kicked round the body—I struggled to get up—I halloaed out "Bill" and "Fuller;" that was my brother and a lodger in the house—my brother came out after I had hal<lb></lb>loaed about four times—I was nearly senseless then, from the ill-usage, kicking me round the body, and her knees on my chest, and her hands on my throat—I found her tearing away my waistcoat—I suppose trying to get at my watch—I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my left hand pocket, and some halfpence—I never saw the money afterwards—my chain was lost, but the watch was found afterwards, when I was picked up—I lost my senses when my brother came up—this is the waistcoat and the watch.</p>

I am the prosecutor's brother—on this Sunday morning, I was sitting by the fire, reading; I heard a call of "Murder!" and Bill," and "Fuller," two or three times—I ran to the door, and saw my brother lying on hit back, and the prisoner had her knee on his chest—there was another woman standing by, with my brother's hat in her hand—she said "Let the woman alone, that is her husband"—I pulled the woman off, and got my brother up the best way I could—I asked him where his watch was—he said she had got it—I laid hold of her and asked</p>

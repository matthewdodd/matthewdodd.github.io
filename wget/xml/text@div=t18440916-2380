                  </hi>. I am a merchant's clerk, and live in Woolwich-road. On the 27th of Aug. I was walking near the Five Bells, in the Kent-road, about two o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner, and asked her the nearest way across the Creek-bridge to my residence—I understood there was a very near way—she said she would come and show me the way—I said I did not require it—she walked on, and before we got many yards she appeared very ill, and staggered about—I supported her, and instantly felt her hand in my pocket—I missed my purse and charged her with it—she used abusive language, and said if I had lost my purse I should find it on the ground, which I did, but I found two half-sovereigns were missing—she endeavoured to make her escape, and I gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am female searcher at the station at Greenwich. On the morning of the 27th of Aug. I searched the prisoner—I asked her if she had the money she was accused of—she said no, she had not, neither had she seen it—I proceeded to search her, and saw her hand was closed—I asked what she had in her hand, she said, "Nothing;" and then she said it was the key of her door—I said I must see it—she was putting her hand to her mouth—I caught her hand, and found one half-sovereign in it, and another was found on the floor.</p>

I was so frightened, when he said I stole them, that I denied having them; be then said he could not go to the station-house, but the policeman made him; when we got to the station-house, he wished to abandon the charge; but the inspector did not let him. The reason I did not own to having the two half-sovereigns was, because he said I had stole it: had he told the truth, I should have given it up to the policeman. It is quite false to say I sham'd ill, or said I would show him the way; it was him that asked me to go down the lane, as he knows the way very well. I hope, as I am innocent of stealing the two half-sovereigns, you will mercifully take all circumstances into your consideration."</p>

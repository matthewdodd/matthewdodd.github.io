                  </hi>. I am a merchant, living at 24, Charles Street—on the night of 25th, about 10 o'clock, I saw that my parlour window was shut—about 12 o'clock I was roused by the police, I found the window open—the clock produced is mine, and was on the mantelpiece the night before—the prisoner had worked under his father at my place, I believe he bears a good character—I could not believe he would do such a thing.</p>

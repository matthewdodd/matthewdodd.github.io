                  </hi> I keep the Royal Oak, Wandsworth. The prisoners lived there—Smith left on Friday, the day before the robbery—Atkins re<lb></lb>mained there—they were both at my house on the Saturday—Atkins went to the skittle-ground several times—he would pass the cellar to go there—I had part of a pig in salt, in the cellar—I saw it safe at ten o'clock that morn<lb></lb>ing, and locked the door—at ten at night I found the door closed but un<lb></lb>locked—I went in and missed it all bu the two feet—I gave information, and the prisoners were taken—Smith left about five o'clock that afternoon—I have compared this pork (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the feet—they correspond, and I can swear to one piece, as my wife cut it in an unusual way—any one could have got in by forcing the lock back with a small instrument.</p>

            . On Thursday the 19th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in by herself, she asked for some brown holland; I shewed her some; she stood in the shop about a quarter of an hour; she bargained for a yard and a half; I cut it off, it came to three shillings; she wished to look at some French cambrics; I shewed her some; she bought three sixteenths of a yard, it came to sixteen shillings; she paid for that, and the brown holland; I shewed her two or three pieces; I missed one of the pieces while she was at the counter, and when I gave her the articles she went out of the shop, and I followed her.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the length of yards in one of these pieces - A. Six yards and a quarter; it will fold up in a very narrow compass.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had she got from the shop before you overtook her - A. About an hundred yards from the shop; I did not know positively whether she had the cambric or no; I saw her looking at the cambric by the light of the lamps in Chancery-lane; she crossed over the way, and dropped the cambric; Bennett was with me, he picked up the cambric; I saw it, it was one of the pieces I had shewed her.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. The prisoner and the pieces of cambric were delivered to me, and these are the things she bought; she said, Mr. Read, I am sorry to see you here; she said she was taking up what she had bought, and with them she took up the cambric, and going down Chancery-lane she looked and saw something more than she had bought, and seeing somebody behind her, coming up, she was surprised, and threw it down, she did not know what to do. I have known her some time, she was a respectable woman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

On Friday evening, the 16th of June, the prisoner came in and looked at some wedding-rings, but did not like them; she asked me to get her one which I said I would in half an hour; she then looked at some other rings, and liked one very much. While I went to get them from the window she, by some means, got this ring about her person; I missed it just as she was going out of the door, saying she had no money, but would return in half an hour; I caught her by the arm - the officer came and took her, and found it on her.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James', Westminster. I came in and found the prisoner very penitent; she said she had to go and meet a gentleman who was to give her two guineas, and then she would come back and pay for the ring.</p>
               <p>- CABE. My husband is a coffin-plate-maker - he works for Mr. Pontifex, in Lime-street. The prisoner is my daughter - she has been weak in her intellects ever since her childhood - she sometimes goes away without my knowledge, and sometimes takes a child to the Parks - she does not know right from wrong; I have applied to the workhouse but they would not take her.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was nursing at Captain Crockat's . Mrs. Crockat lay-in.</p>
               <p>Was you there on the 14th of October? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner? - I never saw her till I saw her in the house. She was <rs id="t17781209-45-deflabel275" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17781209-45-defend542 t17781209-45-deflabel275"></join> to Captain Crockat. Between seven and eight at night I came down into the kitchen to send her out upon an errand. I saw her standing by the side of the dresser; I saw a great quantity of blood; I asked her what was the matter with her? She gave me no answer for a good while, at last she said something had come from her. I immediately asked her where it was, and what she had done with it?</p>
               <p>You supposed it to be a child? - I really cannot say just then, whether I thought so or no.</p>
               <p>Upon your asking her what she had done with it, what did she say? - She made no answer; not in the least.</p>
               <p>Did you press her further? - No. I lit the candle, and looked about, and I tracked the blood to the necessary.</p>
               <p>Describe the situation of the necessary to this kitchen? - I went out of the kitchen across the wash-house; then up two or three steps into the yard.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in the yard is the necessary? - About a couple of yards from the steps. I looked down, and there I saw an infant.</p>
               <p>How deep might the necessary be? - I cannot justly say. It was very deep, as deep as a common sewer. I sent directly for Mr. Midford; he came. I told him our maid, I believed, was delivered of an infant, and that it was down the necessary. I went directly up stairs as I thought my mistress might want me, and left Mr. Midford below.</p>
               <p>Before the doctor came, had you any further conversation with the prisoner after you returned from the necessary? - Yes. I returned into the kitchen again to her, and asked her what she had been doing? She made no answer.</p>
               <p>Did nothing else pass between you before Mr. Midford came? - I do not recollect that there did.</p>
               <p>How long had you seen this maid in the house before this happened? - She had been in the house about two months before this happened. I had been in the house three weeks, and one day.</p>
               <p>Had you had any suspicion of her being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090057"></xptr> with child? - Yes. I challenged her on the Wednesday before. It was on the Saturday following that she was delivered.</p>
               <p>What did she say to it? - She did not say any thing at all. She had very little to say for herself.</p>
               <p>Had you any more conversation with her, at any other time? - No.</p>
               <p>She had of course, I suppose, the appearance to you of being with child by your challenging her? - I thought she had some little appearance. It was very trifling to my sight.</p>
               <p>You are a nurse; how far gone did you suppose her to be from her appearance? - I supposed her to be four or five months. I did not think that she was further gone.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the child since? - I did not see the child till the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>By the appearance of it then, what age was it? - I cannot justly say. I took very little notice of it. I was so frightened, that I could not bear to look at it, it was so shocking.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of violence upon it? - There was violence upon the neck of it; it seemed as if the head was off.</p>
               <p>The head was not severed from the body, was it? - There was a bit of skin held it.</p>
               <p>Were there any other wounds upon the child? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When you saw the prisoner in the kitchen, did you observe any instrument of any kind? - There was a knife lay upon the dresser, but whether that had been made any use of I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When you tracked the blood from the kitchen to the necessary, was there any thing that could lead you to distinguish whether the blood began in the kitchen, and went from thence to the necessary, or began in the necessary, and went to the kitchen? - I cannot say that there was.</p>
               <p>Had you any further conversation with her upon the subject? - None.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>It was about seven or eight when you first came down into the kitchen? - Yes. Seven or eight at night.</p>

             at any time, while you was in Captain Crockat's service, complain? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time see her making child-bed linen in the kitchen? - I cannot say. I was very little in it. She was at work at times, but I did not take notice of what she was about. She might for what I can say. She had the kitchen mostly to herself.</p>
               <p>In what posture was the child when you discovered it in the necessary? - It seemed as if it laid upon its back,</p>
               <p>You said the necessary was very deep; did you examine it so closely as to know whether it might not be possible for the child to be wounded in dropping down? - I do not know but it might.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a surgeon I believe? - I am.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Burr-street .</p>
               <p>Do you remember being sent for to Captain Crockat's, on the 14th of October? - I believe it was on Saturday the 10th at eight in the evening, I think I made a memorandum to that effect.</p>
               <p>To Osborn . You was not sure of the day was you? - It was the 10th.</p>
               <p>Who came for you, Mr. Midford?</p>
               <p>Mr. Midford. A servant maid in the neighbourhood, I do not know whose servant it was. I went immediately. I was desired to go into the kitchen. I saw the prisoner sitting in a chair near the dresser; I asked her what was the matter; she told me that she had had for several days a complaint in her bowels, and a purging, and that the child had come away at the necessary. I asked her how long before; she said just before. I asked her if she had hurt it; she said she had not. Thinking it probable, as so little time had been lost, that the child might be alive, I went from her immediately to the necessary; with the assistance of a candle, I saw it upon the filth, in a huddled-up posture; I got assistance and had it taken up with the loss of a very little time.</p>
               <p>How soon after you got there might you get the child out? - I suppose about twenty minutes. When it was taken up I found the head nearly separated from the body. I then went back to the kitchen, and recommended that the prisoner should be taken to the work-house.</p>
               <p>Was the child at its full growth? - It appeared to be so.</p>
               <p>It had its hair and its nails had it? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090058"></xptr> Yes . I went to her a short time after at the workhouse. and brought away the after-burthen .</p>
               <p>Was the after-burthen of that kind as where the child is come to its full size? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any other wound upon the child? - I was in doubt whether it was all one wound or not; there were several of the ribs cut through, but I am in doubt whether the stroke, or whatever was the cause, might have been begun upon the ribs and ended with taking off the head.</p>
               <p>Give a description of the wound particularly; and how you suppose it had been made; whether it was severed by an instrument or torn off? - It appeared to me to be done by a cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Did the wound upon the ribs appear to be given by a cutting instrument? - It did.</p>
               <p>Do you think it possible that these wounds could have happened by the falling of the child down into the necessary, by striking against the edge of bricks which sometimes project? - I suppose that very improbable, I cannot take upon me to say positively.</p>
               <p>Might it be possible to have happened from the sharp edge of the hole of the little-house? - I did not see any thing that could countenance such an opinion.</p>
               <p>Was there any blood upon the hole of the necessary? - I did not look particularly; I do not remember that I saw any.</p>
               <p>Did you observe blood in the little house? - I do not remember that I did; I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Were there any traces of blood from the kitchen to the little-house? - I did not examine that; my attention was taken up at first by thinking it possible that there might be life in the child, and that it might be preserved.</p>
               <p>Did you see any effusion of blood upon the ordure? - I did not perceive any.</p>
               <p>What must have been the effusion of blood from such a child as that if its head had been cut off alive? - There must be a considerable quantity.</p>
               <p>Was that examined into? - No; that circumstance was not looked into.</p>
               <p>When a child is first born, is its neck come to such a state of firmness, as that it would require a considerable degree of force to cut it through? - Not a very great deal. I should imagine it would require some little degree of force.</p>
               <p>Have you ever known a child's head torn in that manner, where a woman has been delivered by herself? - I never have.</p>
               <p>Could it be done by pulling the child's head out of the womb? - I will not say it could not be done so; I believe it might.</p>
               <p>Did you attend Mrs. Crockat as a midwife? - No.</p>
               <p>If the head had been torn off or pulled off in the act of delivery, would the separation from the body have had the same appearance, or would it have been more ragged and jagged? - I should suppose if the head was torn off, which might be done with force no doubt, that it would have had a ragged appearance. I should think it would not have the appearance of having been cut off with a sharp instrument. The force with which it would be torn off must make the edge of the wound ragged .</p>
               <p>Did you make particular observation whether it was ragged or not? - No.</p>
               <p>Because before you said it appeared as if it was cut off with a sharp instrument. - Some parts of it appeared so; I only speak to how it struck me as far as I could judge; but I looked at it but very superficially, for as soon as I found the head off, I returned into the kitchen, as I said before.</p>
               <p>Did you make any other remark upon it? - I did not .</p>
               <p>Had you any further conversation with the woman? - I desired that the mistress of the work-house would take care of her.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner tell you where she was delivered? - I believe a day or two after I asked her, and she told me she was delivered in the kitchen, as she stood by the fire-side; to the best of my remembrance she told me so.</p>
               <p>To Osborn. Was Mrs. Crockat lying-in at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far was her room from the kitchen? - Two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Was it at such a distance that you could have heard any body cry out in the kitchen? - The children were making a great noise at the same time; there were three children at play in my mistress's room, and they made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090059"></xptr> a great noise, that I could not have heard any noise that happened, unless it had been a violent great noise indeed.</p>
               <p>How long had Mrs. Crockat been brought to bed? - Three weeks and one day.</p>
               <p>Does the kitchen window look towards the street, or backwards? - Towards the street.</p>
               <p>Is it a publick street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is the kitchen window even with the street, or under ground? - Under ground.</p>
               <p>If a child had cried, might the noise have been heard in the street? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How many windows is there to the kitchen? - Two.</p>
               <p>When you went down into the kitchen, did you observe whether the windows of the kitchen were shut? - I don't know whether they were shut or open.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Midford. Do you recollect how the windows were? - I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>To Osborn. Are there shutters to the kitchen? - Yes; but I don't recollect whether they were shut or open.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Midford. Did you dissect the body? - The Coroner ordered the usual experiment to be made upon the lungs.</p>
               <p>Court. That is nothing. We never suffer that to be given in evidence.</p>
               <p>To Osborn. You came down directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have been used to lying-in women? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw a great deal of blood in the kitchen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it like the blood flowing from a labour, or fresh blood, flowing from a wound? - I was so frightened I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination of Mr. Midford.</p>
               <p>I think you said it was possible for the mother to have wounded the child in the act olabour? - It is possible for a person to do so.</p>
               <p>When you had the candle in your hand, and was at the necessary, did you look carefully round the necessary? - No.</p>
               <p>You don't know then whether there might be any glass bottles, or nails, or any thing of that sort? - I don't.</p>
               <p>I think you said you did not so closely observe the wound as to know whether it was done by tearing the head off, or cutting it? - I said before, it appeared to me to be done by a cutting instrument, but I did not examine it so particularly as to be able to say that it might not be done any other way.</p>
               <p>You did not observe whether the edge of the hole of the little-house, was sharp or no? - I did not take notice of that.</p>
               <p>How old was the young woman? - twenty four.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Please you, my Lord, I had a sad looseness; I did not think it had been my labour; I had fell down stairs some days before, and had a bearing down; I had no appearance of labour; the head might be severed upon my helping myself. I called out for assistance, but nobody heard me.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Midford. Did you see any thing of a knife? - Not till I saw it on the table before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>What sort of knife was it? - It appeared to be a kind of carving knife; a common kitchen knife.</p>
               <p>To Osborn. Did you say that you observed the knife, and that there was no blood upon it? - Not to my knowledge; I did not look at it.</p>
               <p>You must have been at this necessary house. Are the edges of the holes sharp or not? - I never looked down.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

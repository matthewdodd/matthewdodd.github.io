                  </hi>. I am a prisoner awaiting sentence in the Wandsworth House of Correction—I have Known Patterson about 16 months—I first saw him in March, 1878 at Workman's house, 42, Stafford Street, High Street, Peckham, and was introduced to him by Workman at my lodgings, 14, Cork Street, Camberwell, early in May, 1878—Workman told me that Patterson was his brother-in-law—I had previously had a conversation with Workman about Maudsley's—he said, "J will use my influence with Pat, who is my brother-in-law, that you shall take Old George's place"—Old George was George Fossitt, who used to lodge at Workman's—Old George was to have taken the outside and Workman the inside part to rob Messrs. Maudsley's of two bags of money, which was taken from the Bank and deposited in a large safe, or strong room, every Friday night to pay the men's wages on Saturday morning—Workman and Patterson told me that the premises could be entered by climbing a low portico in front, about six or seven feet high, and on to the roof of the offices about four feet higher, and then, by going down some steps, or slanting roof into the yard, to enter at the back by a small circular window leading to the model-room, and then by opening one of the doors into the passage access would be got to the whole of the place—I had subsequent conversations at different tirnes with Patterson and Workman—I used to see them nearly every Sunday at my lodgings or Workman's, and sometimes in the streets—our conversation was generally about Maudsley's premises, and the robbery—before introducing Patterson Workman had mentioned the keys to me, and promised to introduce Patterson to show them to me—Patterson showed me the keys in Workman's presence and said they were the keys that would do the place where the money was kept—he said the money was kept in a small wooden cupboard in one of the strong rooms which opened into the passage with a thumb-spring—he said there were two safes, one contained petty cash and the other the wages money—he showed me two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300210"></xptr>
               <p>keys—I had seen one of the keys being manufactured at Workman's by Fossitt from impressions taken in wax by Patterson—Patterson told me he could get impressions of any of Maudsley's keys—he said the amount of money on the premises on Friday nights varied from 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sometimes over—Workman told me be went out with Fossitt on Easter Monday to a Volunteer Review at Staines Common and Fossitt got into trouble about some housebreaking affair, and he (Workman) escaped—Patterson was introduced to me by Workman as "Mr. Baker, the party I spoke to you about to take Old George's place"—Workman called him "Pat"—that was at the Red Cap publichouse Camberwell Green—Workman said he had been and had a view of Maudsley's place and his wife went with him, and that they tried the keys and found they would do, and it was arranged I should take the outside part instead of Fossitt, and that a cabman named Gurney should have a cab waiting outside on the night of the robbery and take the money away to Patterson's house—it was to be divided into three parts, Workman and his wife taking one part, Patterson another, and myself another, but I was to give Fossitt 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my share when he came out of prison—the month of November last was fixed for carrying out the scheme—I continually saw Workman and Patter<lb></lb>son up to September last—when Workman, a man named Rogers, and myself, broke into some premises in the Old Kent Road and Workman was caught. I was the outside man in that case—I kept out of the way and did not see Patterson again till the first week in November, when I went to see him—Workman was still in custody—I said to Patterson, "Has Workman said anything about this affair, or have you seen any<lb></lb>thing at Maudsley's to lead you to suppose there is any suspicion?" he said, "No; all things are going on as usual. I have not observed anything. Can you get another man to assist you in carrying out the robbery in place of Workman?" I said, "Yes, I can"—I had prior to this known Jones—he visited me at my lodgings several times—I told him that Maudsley's affair was on and proposed he should assist, and I subsequently introduced him to Patterson on Saturday night, November 16th, at the Elephant and Castle—Jones said to Patterson, "Are you still willing to carry out this affair, and have you been talking to any one else except the persons named?" meaning Fossitt and Workman; Patter<lb></lb>son said, "No. No one knows anything of it except the persons that were mentioned"—Jones asked him a few more questions about the place; if he was sure the amount of money was there, and so on, and then said, "I'll assist"—I knew at that time William Chandler and his wife, of Waterloo Street, Camberwell Park—T had previously lodged with them at 14, Cork Street, and Patterson had visited me there several times, and Workman came a great many times—on several occasions we wore all there together—Jones has been there to see me—at Workman's house Mrs. Workman was always present, taking a part in the conversation when we spoke about Maudsley's—I went down to Slough with Jones on 8th March, and we were taken into custody and convicted—I was sen<lb></lb>tenced to 12 months' imprisonment for the Slough affair—I am waiting sentence for the old Kent Road burglary.</p>

I am undergoing penal servitude in Pentonville Prison—I was sentenced at the Surrey Sessions, April 9th, 1879, and had been in Wandsworth Prison from 5th November, 1877, to 3rd August, 1878—I knew Patterson seven or eight years ago—I did not know him personally, but a man named Charles Wells, of Camberwell, showed him to me—I have known Workman and his wife for some years—the witness Harding lodged in the name of Baker at 14, Cork Street, and he was lodging there in August, 1878—I have not seen Baker at my house in company with either of the other prisoners except Workman—Workman has been there hundreds of times, and visited Harding (or Baker) there a good many times—Baker and I were out housebreaking together almost daily—about the middle of August, 1878, I saw Patterson and Workman talking together at the Station Tavern, Beresford Street, Walworth Road, but I did not hear what they said—when we came away Workman said, "Do you know that party?" I said, "I have seen him before;" he said, "That's Pat, my brother-in-law. That's the party that's putting up the place in Westminster Bridge Road"—"putting up "a place means to commit a burglary Or robbery—Baker, Workman, and Dowthwaite, alias Rogers, were all out housebreaking together last year—Baker is the cleverest man—I have five or six times heard Baker and Workman, at my place, talking about Maudsley's place, Westminster Bridge Road, and concocting how to do it—I met Workman by the Crown, London Road, coming from Water<lb></lb>loo, about the middle of August—I said, "Hallo! Arthur. What's yer game?" he said, "I have just been down to see Pat." We went inside and had something to drink, and he said, "I've just been down and fetched these from him," showing me two keys, one a pipe key and the other not—I did not notice, I was a disinterested party—I said, "Is there two safes, Arthur?" and he said, "Yes, sometimes they put the money in one and sometimes in the other, so, to make sure we have had two made"—I said, "Well, if you open them with keys, Arthur, they will think it is some one about the place"—he said, "Pat will leave a few weeks before the job comes off, and they won't suspect him"—in August</p>

               <p>Workman asked me to lend him 57. till November and he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, as he should have a fortune then—I said, "I have not got it," and offered to stand for a loan for him—the loan was for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we each had half—on a Monday or Tuesday night towards the end of August I went through Addington Squire, Camberwell, with Workman, and we met Patterson there, and went back to the Anchor and Hope and had something to drink, and they talked for a few minutes, and then Patterson went towards Peckham, and Workman and myself towards Camberwell—later in August I was going to the Strand with my pony and cart I have been a baker for 22 years, collecting sweepings and stale sacks from bakers, and kept a pony and cart—I was at 14, Cork Street, and offered to give Baker a ride to Pimlico—just before starting Workman came in and said, "I might at well go with you"—when we got to Westminster Bridge Road opposite a chapel near Oakley Street, he said, "Stop there, Bill; that's the place we are going to do,' pointing to a place with a coat of arms over it painted white—there was a wall about eight feet high, where they said they were going to get over to do it; and then on three or four occasions afterwards, after Workman had got into trouble, Baker had a look at the place when I gave him a ride—Baker often came in an afternoon or evening and said, "I must go round and see Patterson and his wife, and if the job comes off right I'll give Mrs. Workman 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my corner, the others could give what they liked"—I knew Dowthwaite—Workman four or five times said, "Don't take any notice to Bob, as we don't want him to know, because we don't want to give him any of it; we only want to keep it between three, Patter<lb></lb>son, me, and Baker"—that was after Fossitt had got into trouble—Fossitt made the keys, and when he got into trouble Baker was introduced into the case.</p>

I sometimes go by the name of Dowthwaite—I was convicted with Workman at the Surrey Sessions for housebreaking on 15th October, 1878, and am now undergoing penal servitude at Penton<lb></lb>ville—I know George Fossitt as a lodger of Workman's, and Patterson as Workman's brother-in-law—I have had conversations with Fossitt about a burglary in Westminster Bridge Road, but he did not mention Maudsley's—at the end of January, 1878, he showed me a blank key, and told me that he and Workman had a good job on—I have heard Fossitt and Work man talking the matter over together—they said the key was made at Workman's house and took two days to make, and it fitted the safe it was intended to open—Fossitt told me that there was about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the safe—I told him I should not let that die a natural death, and he said, "I should think not; it's something worth attending to"—I called on him frequently at Workman's house, and Mrs. Workman generally opened the door, and was present at several conversations—on Whit Sunday Workman and his wife and Patterson were in the parlour—as Patterson left to go home to dinner he said to the Workmans, "Now, remember your promise; for if you miss this chance of seeing it you won't get another '—I went again on the Wednesday, and I talked about being caught in the rain on Whit-Monday, and Workman said they were in the same predicament coming from Westminster Bridge—I said, "Well, did you see what you went to see?" he said—"We saw it all"—I said, "You know where to go and put your hand on it now?" and he said, "Yes, I can find it blindfolded"—after that he got a situation for the purpose of doing it, and I went round to his house on a Tuesday morning when he had been there a little over a week, and Mrs. Workman said he had been in on the Sunday and wanted to see me very particularly—she said, "There's something up there for you," pointing to a picture on the wall, and I found two pieces of wax at the top of the frame—she said, "You are to make them, and I am to take them down to-morrow"—I said, "I can't make keys from these; they</p>

I am a labourer, at 1, Garden Row, London Road—in May last I was sent to Wandsworth Gaol for a month—Workman was in the next cell, and spoke to me on many occasions while going to chapel or out in the exercise ground—he asked me to take a message to a Mrs. Clark, 104, Warner Road, when I got out, and to tell her the "Coppers," Hunt and Chamberlain, had been, and he was sorry "Pat" had "fell;" they wanted him (Workman) to come up and give evidence against Pat, but he told them he knew nothing about it, and they went away very cross—Workman asked me to go his wife, 14, Bath Place, Addington Square, Camherwell, and tell her the Coppers had been about Maudsley's job, and she must keep her "guts" what she knew about it, and that he had told the Coppers he had been with her to Maudsley's 18 months ago to look at the models while the clerks were in the country.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Inspecter P.</hi>). I and Chamberlain had Work<lb></lb>man in custody last September—I know his wife and Rogers, alias Dowthwaite—Workman made certain communications to me before his conviction, and subsequently his wife also made certain communications to me—I was at Slough on 26th March, when Davis and Harding were tried and convicted—Harding, alias Biker, made a statement to me before his conviction, and at three interviews after his conviction, in consequence of which I saw Mrs. Chandler—I obtained an order from the Home Secretary and saw William Chandler, and made certain inquiries, and then reported to Scotland Yard, and this prosecution was instituted—I obtained an order to see Workman, and saw him at Wandsworth on 24th May, and told him the object of my visit, and that Patterson was in custody with others on this charge, and said, "Now do you know anything about the case?"—he said, "No; I can have nothing to say in the case"—I said, "Do you know Patterson?"—he said, "Yes; I have known him about 16 years"—I said, "We are in possession of the whole facts of the case. We know that you can give evidence in this case if you like. Will you do it?"—he said, "No; I can have nothing to do with that job; I can't give evidence against my brother-in-law. Besides that, it was nearly two years ago it was talked about?—I said, "Do you recollect being in a certain public-house when the keys were shown to Baker by Patterson in your presence?"—he said, "Yes, I recollect being in a public-house with Patterson and Baker at the Father Red Cap, Camber well Green, one Sunday evening last May (1876), but Patterson did not show Baker the keys. In fact, I do net think Baker ever saw them. I went with my wife once about fifteen months ago, and had a look ever the place referring to Maudsley's. Patterson showed us over the premises and showed us the models"—he declined to give further testimony—on 23rd May with Inspector Chamberlain I saw Mrs. Workman at the Orange Tree Beerhouse, Avill Street, camberwell—I said, "Patterson is in custody charged with others conspiring to commit a burglary at Messrs. Maudsley's and it is said you have been there and know all about it; will you tell us what you know I"—she said, "No. I shall have nothing at all to do with it. I know nothing about it; I have heard it was intended to break in; but that was sometime ago"—I said, "Well, if you decline to give the necessary infor<lb></lb>mation there are plenty others who can," mentioning Chandler and his wile—she said, "Mrs. Chandler, let her say what she likes. She is only wild she didn't have the job to climb blooming well herself"—I asked her if I should see her again in the evening, and she said "Yes, come alone. See me at 7 o'clock at my house"—I called there about 6.30, and she was not at home—I saw her about 7 with Mrs. Patterson, the prisoner's wife, leaving the house, and after she had left Mrs. Patterson I spoke to her again about giving me information and told her I was going to see her husband—she said, "I'll wait and see what Arthur does"—she said she could not give in<lb></lb>formation as she had not been paid for the last job—she had given evidence in Harding's case—she said, if her husband gave evidence she would do the same—she afterwards said, "As Patterson has found me and ray children food and shelter for two months after Arthur was put away, I cannot find it in my</p>

I went with my husband once into Mr. Maudsley's place. We went to see the models. Patterson showed us over the premises. We had some ale there—I know some keys were made, two lots, and I believe that Baker had them with him when he was taken at Slough As the job did not come off you can do nothing with it. You can do nothing with Patterson—Patterson and Baker did come to my house several times—I intended to wait until the job was done, and if a reward was offered, to give informa<lb></lb>tion—lid you expect to find the keys when you reached Patterson's house?" I said "Yes, I suppose they did. I was not there myself." She said, "Ah! clever men never keep those things in their own houses"—I said, well! if the affair had taken place she would not have got so much as she thought, perhaps. She said, "If it had been done at the right time, there would have been a good lot there, and they did not mean to do it except when there was plenty there. Sometimes it's more than at others. I will think the matter over, and perhaps I'll tell you more about it. I'll wait and see what Arthur does."</p>

Patterson took him and me in. They didn't allow me to go over the place with them.

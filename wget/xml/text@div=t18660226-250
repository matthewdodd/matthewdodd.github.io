                  </hi>. I live at 53, Upper Stamford-street, in the house kept by the two Kirbys—it is a house where single ladies live—on the evening of 2d December, I saw Swyer about 8 o'clock, and later, about 10—I saw him also during the day—Mr. and Mrs. Kirby introduced him to me as Mr. Nash—he answered to that name—he and another man came in together—they had a bundle with them—the man that was with Swyer brought it—the servant let them into my room, and Swyer said they had got their luggage—Mr. and Mrs. Kirby were in the room at that time—the other man, named Charley, opened the bundles—Mr. and Mrs. Kirby helped to look the articles over—there were dresses and such-like in the bundle, but only one petticoat—there were some earrings and rings—when it was opened, I began to cry, and said, "This won't do for me"—Mrs. Kirby said, "It is no use crying, you have got to get used to it"—that was in her husband's presence—I said, "No, I shall not, for I will not have anything to do with it"—Mr. Kirby said, "Don't cry"—Swyer stayed the night with me, and the things remained in the room—a velvet dress was sent to the pawnbroker's next morning by Swyer's directions by a little girl who comes of a morning to run on errands—a coat, waistcoat, and trousers were sent to pledge on that day—Mr. Kirby took them down stairs; he took them off the table—I saw some rings taken away on Thursday, the 14th, by the other man, Charley—I recollect bearing of Swyer being arrested—I recollect a man coming to the house and seeing Mr. Kirby—he came up stairs, and said, "Mr. Nash," that is, Mr. Swyer, "Is taken for fighting a cabman, and if any of the property is left in the room, it had better be taken away"—I told him what I had</p>

               <p>got, and asked him where they were to be taken to—he wrapped them in a blanket, and said, "I will take them to Kent's"—that is not a pawn<lb></lb>broker's, but a friend of theirs, at 8, St. Paul's-road, Kennington—Mr. Kirby gave me directions where to take them to, and Mrs. Kirby took them to Kent's—I afterwards went and saw Swyer in the House of Detention by Charley's directions—he said, "I am here on suspicion of robbery"—I went back and saw Mr. and Mrs. Kirby, who said that they thought so—I recollect a man coming to the house on Boxing<lb></lb>day—he saw Mr. Kirby first—he said he wanted the stolen property they had got in their house—Mr. Kirby said he had not got any property—the man said, "Where is it? I want it"—on that Mrs. Kirby went up stairs to him at the door, and said, "There is no stolen property here"—he asked her whether she had not got a red blanket down stairs that she had bought for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said, "No"—there was a great noise in the passage, and I went up and told him what there was there they should have in the evening—he said, "I will b—well <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on you if I don't have it"—I afterwards went to Kent's house—he had removed by that time to Cumberland-street, Pimlico—I did not get the bundle from Kent which I had taken—I got a note from Mr. Kent, and went with Mr. and Mrs. Kirby to the Walworth-road, where I received a bundle, which they put into a cab, and I took it to the Blackfriars-road—they got the bundle from some friends of Kirby's, No. 1, Church-street—I delivered it up to Hillier in the Blackfriars-road—Miss Florence Brunell saw me do so.</p>

It is not true that I had connection with the girl Cartridge—when I have been at her house I have always been with other policemen—I took Kirby into custody on the Sunday evening, I think it was 7th January—I told him I should take him in custody with Swyer and another for stealing things from St. George's-road—that was another case—I did not mention this case—I took Mrs. Kirby on the Monday week following—I told her I should take her for receiving several dresses, well knowing them to have been stolen from 16, Waller-villas, Chelsea—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260008"></xptr>
               <p>she said, "Yes, I know all about it—a bundle was brought up into Miss Cartridge's room; myself and Mr. Kirby were there drinking with Miss Cartridge—I introduced Miss Cartridge to Swyer—we went out and had a quartern of brandy together."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Swyer. Q.</hi> Will you swear you have not had any intimacy with Miss Cartridge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I swear it—I did treat her to a little drop of brandy and water at the police-court, as she was very cold—we did not have anything at the York Hotel—I only treated her once—I did not say that if you would plead guilty, you should turn Queen's evidence, and get off, but you asked me to allow you to do so—you gave me a statement, wanting to fix the robbery on a respectable person, and a poor fellow named Pettice cut his throat in consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did Swyer say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he did not do it, but that he was asked by Pettice to do it, and that there was a man who was a painter, living near—Swyer asked me to be allowed to plead guilty, and get through.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">John Kirby. Q.</hi> How long after was it you saw Miss Cartridge before she told you of the robbery, or gave you any information? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till Swyer was committed for trial on another case—I could get nothing out of her at first.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">B</hi> 253). On 14th December I went to 13, Palace-road, Lambeth, where Swyer gave his address—he came there in a cab with another man—Swyer went in and returned in a minute or two, and got on the box—the other man got inside, and they drove at a rapid rate up York-road—I followed in another cab—they stopped at the Rising Sun public-house, York-road, Swyer, and the other man, and the cabman—I went in, and called for a glass of ale—they got into the cab again, and I then told Swyer I should take him into custody for the robbery at Waller-villas—he struggled very violently, and said, "Oh, my God, what shall I do?"—I ordered the cabman to drive back to 13, Palace-road—Swyer struggled desperately all the way—I told the cabman to stop, and called a hackney<lb></lb>carriage man to my assistance, but the cabman threw the door wide open—Swyer and I struggled out, and the cabman drove away—I got Swyer into another cab, with the assistance of the hackney<lb></lb>carriage man, and took a constable in uniform with me to Brompton—I then took Swyer to the station—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Luke's, Chelsea.</p>

Q.</hi> When you asked me if my name was Swyer, did I not tell you yes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You told me no; but I went with you to 13, Palace-road, because I knew your mother lived there—I found this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on you at the station—I tried it to your street-door, and it opened it—this other key fell from you—it could not have fallen from anyone but you—it laid at your feet—it was not there before—I took the look off at Waller<lb></lb>villas—I took it to the station—it was taken to pieces, and examined by a witness who is here—I went to Kirby's house on the Saturday I took a gentleman in custody named Lloyd, who is connected with Mudie's Library—I swore that he was you.</p>

                  </hi>. I had a young man named Pettice lodging in my house—he committed suicide on 14th December—I am a locksmith—I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260009"></xptr>
               <p>examined this lock and key—my opinion is that this skeleton would open the lock, when on Mrs. Barrington's door—it was formerly a Bramah key, but has been made into a skeleton—formerly this was a Bramah lock—it is nothing but a sham Bramah now, which this skeleton would have opened with the nib off—there is a little nib on a Bramah key, which is taken off this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Swyer. Q.</hi> Did you take it to pieces, and examine it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, and the top of the slides dropped out of it—I did not say at the police-court that pieces of the key fell from the lock—I said pieces of the lock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Swyer's Defence</hi>. There is not a particle of direct evidence against me; I was not seen in or near the place; no money was found on me; I was taken two days after the robbery, and had nothing to do with it; I gave my right name and address; my name is on the door; the police have been to different houses of the nobility and aristocracy where I work, trying to find out if anything has been lost, but they found nothing; Pettice's dying words were, "I will tell you that a man named Squires, a painter," who is now in prison, "has done it;" my name is not Squires, but Swyer, and from the similarity of name I have been brought here. If you believe the inspector, yon cannot believe Cartridge, and if you believe Cartridge, you cannot believe the inspector. The police have got on the wrong track; but rather than own themselves wrong, they say somebody must suffer; they know the man who did it, but cannot swear to him now, because they have sworn to me; I gave him a description of the two men that came to Kirby's house, but he does not want to apprehend them, because if he does I shall get out of it. I should like to call a witness from Messrs. Bramah, who manufactured the lock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Messrs. Bramah—I have examined this lock—it is one of their locks, but some one has had it, and taken all the security away—anyone can open it now—there are no wards—they could not have done it without taking the lock off—a key might break the wards off, but nothing would open it till they were taken out—it is like taking the works out of a watch, and leaving the case—I cannot say whether the wards have been taken away lately—Mrs. Barrington was per<lb></lb>fectly satisfied with the lock—the lock has been made to the key, and not the key to the lock—when locks are sent to small men to repair, they take the works away to fit a certain key.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, New North Street, Theobald's Road—on 10th May, after 12.30, I was in New North Street with my wife, going home—we passed four young men standing under a lamp post—the prisoners are two of them—I have not the slightest doubt of that—as we passed, one of them pushed Patten right into my wife's face and the brim of his hat cut her across the nose—I turned to protect her and was struck by Uwins and knocked down by a blow between the eyes—the whole four then fell on me—I was beaten about the body, and two sovereigns were taken out of my waistcoat pocket, and 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. either fell or were taken from my trowsers pocket—I felt a hand in my pocket and am sure the two sovereigns were there—I cannot say whether they put their hands in my trowsers pocket—I saw the two prisoners there the whole of the time until I got up, and my wife and Mrs. Richards chased them, and I saw a man stop them 300 or 400 yards off—I followed as quickly as possible, and said to Uwins "I will make sure of you if I make sure of nobody else"—he had my hat on and I took it off him and placed it on my head—I saw Patten there too—a policeman came up and they were taken to the station and I charged them with assault and robbery—I was sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. I went to Camden Town about 6 o'clock and got the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—we had one pot of malt liquor with my brother and then went home and had some supper and came out with my brother-in-law to post a letter and get a stamp—there was no row—I did not make a rush at Uwins—I felt a hand distinctly in my waistcoat pocket while Uwins and the others were on top of me—I said before the Magistrate that my money did not fall out of my waistcoat pocket, but it might possibly have fallen out of my trowsers pocket—Uwins was stopped by a man named Arnold, and I told Arnold I had been knocked down and robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I am not related to Mrs. Richards she said that one of her teeth was knocked out—I did not know that she appeared at Clerkenwell and attributed that to a man she was living with—she said that she got her black eye from the man she was living with—it had been rather an exciting day for her, but not for me—I did not know that her name was Joyce—I know that her husband's name is Middleditch—it did not strike me as strange that she should be Mrs. Middleditch that day and Mrs. Richards at the police-court the following day, because her husband's name is Richard Middleditch, and she took the name of Richards not wishing to go in her marriage name—Joyce has lived with her in our house about four months—she had been with us and had a share of a pot of malt liquor between four of us—she did not strike any of the young men—she was not the least excited—she was not with my wife the whole evening—my wife was with me—my brother-in-law spoke more clearly to the men than my wife—I heard witnesses to character for Patten called before the Magistrate, and he was admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When I charged Uwins I said that I had been knocked down coming out of Mr. Tucker's house—he said "What! Harry Tucker, if I had known that I would not have let him go"—I am certain I had that amount of money—I am quite sure that both the prisoners were there at the same time.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—I saw five or six young men at a corner by a lamp—the prisoners are two of them—I did not speak to them or quarrel with them, but one of them pushed Patten against me, and he caught the <hi rend="italic">bridge</hi> of his hat across my eyes—I asked him how he dared do that, and he made a beastly remark—my husband said to Patten "Go home, you puppy," I think it was, and the whole of his companions then fell on my husband and had him down—the prisoners are two of them, and they are the two who I tried to keep in my company—they were on top of my husband pulling him about, but I did not see any blows—I tried to assist him and heard money rattle on the pavement—I could not see their hands—I got my thumb injured—Patten said "Let us be off"—I followed the two prisoners holding both their coats and calling "Police"—they went about three doors down Theobald's Road and came back again with me holding them—they got from me, and Patten said "Let us run off"—I said "You won't run off, you have robbed my husband"—they ran up Theobald's Road and I after them, and saw them stopped by a man—I gave them in custody to a policeman.</p>

I live at 3, New North Street, Theobald's Road—I was with Mr. and Mrs. Page, at the—corner of New North Street—it was after midnight—I saw five or six men under a lamp-post—the prisoners are two of them, and one man shoved Patten against Mrs. Page, and cut the edge of her nose with his hat—she said "What do you mean by this?"——he said something disgusting and nasty to her, and Mr. Page turned round and Uwins struck at the brother-in-law, Mr. Faulkener, and knocked his hat off—he picked up his hat and immediately the prisoners and two others had Mr. Page down—I ran across and said "Let Mr. Page get up"—they were all on him, and I had no sooner said so than I heard money drop on the pavement—I called out "Mrs. Page, they have got Page's money," and as I was going to stoop to prevent their taking the money I got a punch on my mouth from Uwins, a tooth was knocked out and I began to bleed—Mrs. Page came up and helped her husband, and these two prisoners struck her on the chest—they got away from her and we went after them, and they were stopped at the corner of Fisher Street—I saw a dark man there, but I do not not know whether he stopped them or not—a policeman came up and they were taken—Mr. Faulkener brought two more policemen, and they all went down Hunter Street.</p>

               <p>our possession from six weeks to two months before it became due—I know the prisoner's handwriting very well; I have known him fifteen years or more—the body of the bill is his writing, most decidedly, and the signature "E. Tarrant" is his usual signature—I should hardly like to say that the acceptance was in his handwriting, it seems so much bolder, I would not like to swear to it; the word "accepted" looks very much like it, but looking at the writing generally it seems a bolder firmer hand—I think it differs from his ordinary writing on the face of the bill; still I think it is possible that the person who wrote the body might be capable of writing the other; I have no doubt about the signature "E. Tarrant" being his; the body is certainly his—the M in Mathieson in the acceptance, and the M in the body of the bill are very similar, now I Come to examine it more closely there is a great similarity between them—I have no doubt that the endorsement "E. Tarrant" is the prisoner's writing—he was given into custody on 22nd September, the same morning that I went to the police-court; I charged him with forging and uttering a bill of exchange, the amount was mentioned, the inspector took it; I did not mention it—the prisoner made one or two ordinary observations, but nothing relating to the charge—he asked if he could see Mr. Milk—I said he could not as he was out of town—he said if he could see him he could make the matter all right, and he asked if I would let the matter stand over till next day, till Mr. Mills appeared—I Said "No"—he was then taken to the station and charged.</p>

We have never signed any bill of exchange as partners. There was no agreement; we carry on business jointly; we are friends. I did not bring any capital into the business; a great portion of the capital was brought in with the prisoner's money. He lent it—to her, and he bought the furniture for her, and a great portion of the stock, from Moore Cope<lb></lb>stake's "—I don't know that he took the house, Miss Mathison took the house—she had some money in the bank-we started the business together—there was no money in the bank at first, she was not able to have the money when we first went into business—I know that the prisoner paid 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stock bought of Moore Copes take—I am not aware of the amount he, paid for gas fittings, but I know, he bought them—I know that he pur<lb></lb>chased furniture and goods for the purpose of the partnership to the amount of 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I can't say how that was paid, I know it was paid by small payments—we had a plate on the door with "Mathison Howell" on it—we have since removed it because everyone that passed by looked at the house, and our names had got so published that we thought it had better be taken down—it was taken down by ourselves, by bur direction—Mr. Gosnell does not live there; he had nothing. to do with taking the plate down that I know of.</p>

               <p>when I took the business there in November, 1874, he did not pay for it down then, it was paid by instalments, he became liable for the furniture—I paid some of the instalments, I have the receipts here—he also paid a bill at Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He is no relation of mine—I did not go to him and state that I had no capital and would he help me to go into business; it was not that way it was said at all; he was to lend me the money, he volunteered to lend it me, because he knew that he could be paid back I again, first of all if I had succeeded in business, and if not it would have been paid back as well by a certain person—I did not give any paper writing to that effect, he took it from me by word of mouth—I did not pay back any, except about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have paid part for the gas-fittings; they were so badly done that I had to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so for that-this is a bill that I have paid for the gas-fittings; it is not a receipt, it is simply the invoice for it—I can't say exactly how much I have paid; I have not paid the pri<lb></lb>soner anything, except about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because he never asked for it, he never applied to me for the sums I owed him, I don't know what I do owe him, even now—the bill I signed was in January and was a four months' bill—I have never paid that bill or anything towards it, I have, never seen the bill since-at the time it was drawn nothing was said about the handwriting—after I had written it the prisoner used the pen I had, but I don't know</p>

               <p>what he did to it—I did not say to him "As the things—here are all yours, you may as well sign it yourself", because all the things in my house are not his, certainly not—I said before the Magistrate "He altered the signature in my presence; I don't know the alteration that he made", that is the same thing as I am saying now—somebody else besides the prisoner advanced me money towards the stock at the time I went into business; I shall not say bow much, you have no right to ask me.</p>

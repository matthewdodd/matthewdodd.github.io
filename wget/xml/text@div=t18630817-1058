                  </hi>. I am an oil distiller, living at West-ham, in Essex—on Monday, 20th July, I was in the ball-room at the North Woolwich<lb></lb>gardens, and heard a "click" at my waistcoat pocket—I looked, and saw my chain hanging down, and my watch was gone—the prisoner was standing close by me, and I accused him of taking it—he looked up at me and said, "I have not got your watch"—I caught hold of him by the collar, and he said, "Don't say anything, I will give you the watch; don't prosecute me"—with that he walked away some six or eight yards—I followed, and kept hold of him—he then moved up to some ladies, stooped down, put one hand under a lady's crinoline, and the other round to his outside pocket, and brought the watch out and gave it to me, saying, "Don't say anything about it," and walked out—the bow of the watch was gone—policeman 48 k was in the building, and I gave the prisoner into his custody.</p>

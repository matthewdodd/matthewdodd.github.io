                  </hi>. I am a glass-cutter. About half-past one o'clock in the morning, on 2nd June, I was going home, and the prisoner asked me to give her something to drink—we—went to a public-house in Blaekfriars-road, and I then went home with her—I gave her two shillings—in pulling that out, I pulled out my other money—she asked me for more—I refused to give it her—I had then two half-crowns safe—I took off my clothes, and went to bed, leaving my things on a chair—the prisoner got up about half-past five o'clock, and sent down stairs—I heard a whispering—I then looked and missed my two half-crowns—the woman down-stairs called out, "Young man, is it all right, the woman has just gone "—I put on my things, and went after her—no one else had been there.</p>

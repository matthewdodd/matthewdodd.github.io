I am barmaid at the Sun, Union Street, Borough—on 26th May, about 11 p.m., I served the prisoner with a pint of ale—he gave me a florin—I bent it in the tester and gave it to my master, who accused the prisoner of passing a bad coin, and asked him if he had two pence to pay with—he said that he had not—my master laid the florin on the counter, and the prisoner picked it up and ran out—he was brought back by a constable, who took the bent florin from his pocket—I had also seen the prisoner there on Wednesday, the 22nd, and Friday, the 24th—I served him on the 22nd, and he gave me a florin, which I put in the till, and gave him change—I noticed that it was dark,</p>

               <p>but I did not think that it was had—there was no other florin there, only a shilling; a sixpence, and some coppers—he drank the beer and left—six or seven minutes afterwards my master cleared the till out and put the money on a shelf—on Thursday night, 23rd, about 10.45, I served the prisoner with a pint of ale—he gave me a florin, which I put in the till, and gave him the change—I noticed that it was a dark one—no other florin was in the till—my master cleared the till and put the money on a shell, and on the Friday morning he showed me two bad florins—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in a militia uniform on each occasion, the same as he is now.</p>

My husband keeps the Sun—I saw the prisoner there in uniform on Wednesday evening, the 22nd, and Thursday, the 23rd, in front of the centre bar, and on the Friday morning I found two bad florins among the money my husband had collected on the two previous days—it was in a cupboard which was kept locked, and I had the key—I locked it up on the Thursday night—I saw the prisoner in custody on Friday—I recognised him, and said "You were here last night and the night before"—he did not answer.</p>

I keep the San—on Friday night, May 24, my barmaid brought me a bent florin—I showed it to the prisoner, and said "Where did you got this from?"—he said "I got it from the Elephant and Castle"—I said "Have you any more change?"—he said "No"—I said "You have been here before, this is the third florin of this kind I have taken this week," and asked his address—he said "The City Road"—I said to my potman go and fetch a policeman; the prisoner then took up the florin and ran away—I ran after him; he ran very hard round several turnings and met a policeman—I called on "Stop him"—he tried to throw the constable twice, but he followed him, brought him back to my house, and I saw the bent florin taken from him—I am sure he is the man—I cleared out the till on the Wednesday night; there was only one florin there; I placed the money on a shelf—I cleared the till again on the Thursday night; there was one florin there—I put the money away behind the bar as the cupboard was locked up—my wife afterwards picked out two florins and gave them to me; I gave them to the constable—they were dark.</p>

I saw the prisoner running very fast, about 150 yards from the Sun—it was raining fast and I had my cape on—I stopped him; he caught hold of my cape and gave me a twist in the leg and tried to throw me down—I ran him to another turning, got hold of him again, and he tried to trip me up again—he twisted me round but I did not fall—I took my cape off and took him in custody—he had his right hand in his right pocket—I found this bent florin in his hand and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two halfpence in his pocket, and a pawn ticket—he said that he got the florin at the Elephant—I received these two florins from Mr. McGwire.</p>

I had some beer and tobacco at the Elephant and Castle, and paid with a half-crown; I received a florin in change, which I afterwards passed at the Sun, and told them where I got it, and that I would go back and get it changed. I never tried to throw the policeman; on the other occasion I was in a different part of the town altogether.</p>

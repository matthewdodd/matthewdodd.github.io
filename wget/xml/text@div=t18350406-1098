                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Greenwich. On the 26th of March, I hung some linen to dry in front of the house; among which was a gown, a frock, and two aprons—I missed them the same evening.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 141.) On the 26th of March, I went to East-lane, Greenwich, and saw the prisoner at Mr. Smith's. He escaped from there, by getting over a wall—I went immediately to his lodging, and waited in the passage till he came—I then told him I took him for that wet linen out of Hogg-lane—he said, "Say nothing about it, and I will give you all I have about me"—I said, that was not the way I did my buis<lb></lb>ness—I went into his room, and found these articles in a box—he wanted me to put them back.</p>

This wall is twelve feet high, and has glass bottles on the top—I could not get over it—I did not rent the room he went to. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and lodge in East-lane. On the night of the 26th of March, I was at Berry's house, in Hogg-lane—the prisoner came in there, and said he was going to the other side of the College—after he had been there a little while, he trod on my toes, to make me go out with him—he said there were some handkerchiefs hanging in a court, and he went and took them down—he offered me some, but I would not have them—he then told me to follow him, which I did—he went home, and left them there—he wanted me to sell them, but I would not—we then came down together—he went one way, and I went and told the policeman—I have had no dispute with him—he said, while he was unpinning the things, that he took them for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I went to Mr. Berry's, to inquire if he had got the piece of baize. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. That was the night before—two boys told me that you had made inquiry about an old rug—I had sold it for old rags, and it fetched 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when you took these things, you said, "Never mind about the piece of rug"—we had no quarrel about it.</p>

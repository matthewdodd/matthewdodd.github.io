On 3rd October I was on duty at High Bridge, Greenwich, and saw the prisoners ejected from the Three Crowns public-house about 11.45 p.m., and saw the landlord shut the door—I persuaded them to go home, but Linihan said, "You——, I'll corpse you to-night"—they went towards Queen Street, and I went on my beat towards the Trafalgar Hotel, and in turning round I saw the prisoners again, and Linihan rushed out and struck me on my face with his fist—whilst struggling with him, the other two prisoners got behind me and threw me down—I held Linihan and fell with Norris, and Carty came up and kicked me in the side of the head, cutting my ear—I became insensible, and the other two got up, and they all three began kicking me about the head and body—I got up and drew my truncheon, but</p>

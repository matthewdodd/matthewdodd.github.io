                  </hi> I am employed by Mr. Taylor, baker, of High Street, Clapham—on Saturday, 12th October, about four in the afternoon, I went out with the barrow to deliver some bread, and saw the prisoner—I asked him to assist me in pushing the barrow—I had to deliver four quarterns of bread at Mrs. Garrett's—I stopped at Battersea Fields to look at some shooting—I gave the prisoner the four quartern loaves and I basket, and said, "Will you take these to Mrs. Garrett's, and I will catch you"—I stopped two minutes—he went to the house and came back, and said, "Mrs. Garrett says if you do not send her bill she shall have to come up to your master and get you into a bother"—I said, "She has had her bill"—he left me and I saw him again on Sunday morning—I took some bread to Mrs. Garrett on the Tuesday, and took the bill, and in consequence of what she said I spoke to the prisoner, who I met at the corner of Manor Street three-quarters of an hour after—I saw a constable first, and then crossed to the prisoner, and said, "Mrs. Garrett has paid you a bill"—he said, "No, she has not; I don't know any<lb></lb>thing</p>

               <p>about your money"—the constable said, "You had better come down to the shop; "he did so, and then said, "I have spent some of the money, and lost some"—he was given into custody—I gave him no authority to sign my name, this "Recevied, J. A. Taylor, Thomas Green, "is not my writing.</p>

                  </hi> I am a carpenter, of Stewart's Lane, Battereen—on 12th October the prisoner delivered four loaves at my house—I brought out a bill for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I had previously received from Mr. Taylor, and gave it to my wife with 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay the bill—I passed the money at the door—she paid it to the prisoner, and I stood and saw him sign this receipt—he said either "We" or "I can't get the boy here to-day; there will be a row when he gets home, and most likely he will get the sack"—he paid my wife 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and gave here the bill—I noticed the name of Green on it, which was a strange name.</p>

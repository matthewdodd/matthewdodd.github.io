I was in the employ of Mr. Henry Carter—I was working for him at some new houses in Catharine-grove, Blackheath-hill—on Wednesday evening, 8th Jan., I left work at half-past five o'clock; the other men who were at work left at the same time—there was a new door standing in the front-kitchen, against the wall, ready to be hang the next morning—I went to work at six next morning, and missed it—I saw it afterwards at the police-station—I had made it; I am sure it was the same.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on 8th Jan., between five and six o'clock—he asked if we wanted any doors; I said, "No," I had more than I wanted, and I was having some made on the premises—he said should he bring it round—I said be might do as he liked, I did not want any door—in about an hour afterwards he brought this door—it is new, and unpainted—he said it was made for a lady, and she had altered her mind, and was going to have a sash-door made instead of it—he asked me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I did not agree to buy it, but T gave him permission to leave it till next morning—be said what made him ask so low was, the lady allowed half-a-crown on it—it is worth about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, St. George's Place, Knightsbridge, and am a fancy wool dealer—I know the prisoner under the name of the Countess De Bar—I first saw her on 27th January, 1873—she called at my shop then, and asked for some sacred Catholic pictures, large ones, I only kept small ones in stock, and she asked me if I could get some large ones and send them on approval; I did so, and the Countess was out—she gave the address 137, Eagle Place, Brompton Road—this is my bill, it came to about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to Brompton Road the next day to see what pictures she had selected—she said "I am a foreigner in this country, I am going to take a place near here"—she told me she had a brother in Spain, and large tin mines in Spain, and she had a ship load lying in the docks—she asked me if I could recommend her a broker to sell them, and I told her to inquire of the trades people round and no doubt some one would tell her—I asked her to give me a pen and ink and paper to make out my bill for the goods selected—she said "You need not do that, as I require a pound of knitting and crochet cotton, and send the bill the next day,"The message came back that the Countess was out, and would I leave the goods, and that her ladyship would call on the morrow or send, and on the morrow I received a letter which is in Court, to the effect would I call at once, her ladyship wanted to see me—I called on the 29th, and she said "I have decided and taken a house in Queens borough Place," she was going to enter the house on the 25th March, and could I recommend</p>

               <p>her some servants—I think it was four in all I was asked about, a cook and page boy and someone else; it was not a maid, because she said she would get a maid straight from Paris—she did not tell me the number of the house—she gave me some curtain orders and sixty-eight yards of curtain bordering, and said she wanted them sent as soon as possible, and I said I could not execute the order as I did not know the number of the house; she sent back a message to say when she got into the house it would be then time enough for the curtains—I saw Mr. Douglas afterwards and found she had not taken the house—I believed her statement that she had taken a house—I asked her to pay ray bill when she gave me the order on the 29th—she said "I require a great many goods, I don't take trouble with small bills, and I prefer paying you when the order is executed"—she wanted a gilt cheval screen and some arm chairs—the amount of the order altogether was 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and with the expenses in the County Court and all it would be about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent her the sacred pictures and some frames and oil paints to paint the pictures with—she told me about the mines in the first place—I did not supply her with any goods after the statement about the house—she mentioned the tin mines on the 28th—on the nest day, the 29th, she told me she had taken the house—the amount of the whole order, if I had executed it, would have been about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got it in hand and partly finished—none of the goods were supplied before she mentioned the tin mines and before she mentioned the house in Queens borough Place—I had left the pictures for her approval—I think it was about the 9th March I went to Queens borough Place—all the goods had not been supplied at that time—the last goods were sent in on 11th March—I thought there must have been some mistake so I let the goods go—I afterwards summoned the prisoner and her husband to the County Court—the Countess appeared and her solicitor, Mr. Crook—I made a statement to the judge about the tin mines, and how she had deceived me—she was present, and she said she was alone responsible for paying my bill, and I should have it the following month; and I said "How can I rely upon this lady's word, she may be gone out of the country"—she said at the County Court that she had made a mistake, the ship load of tin had not arrived—I asked her if she would return my goods if the judge would grant it—she did not return the goods, and I have never been paid the money.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On 27th of January this year, I went to 1, York Crescent, Woolwich, and saw the prisoner there—I had to force the door to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> into the room—I told her I was a police constable, and had come to apprehend her on a warrant for obtaining a dressing case from Mr. Asprey by false pretences, in the name of the Countess de Bar—she said there were no false pretences, she was the Countess de Bar, as well as the Countess de Civry—she said she had sent a letter to Mr. Asprey, the case had been sent from France, and it must have been lost by the railway—she asked me what she could do in the matter—I told her I could not give her any advice—she said "I shall make Mr. Asprey suffer very severely for this"—I searched the room but found nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 8th Hussars. On 5th Aug, I was living in the Grove, at Peckham—I saw Grady on that evening, about a quarter before 8 o'clock, in the Old Kent-road, and he and I had a few angry words—the first word he said to me was, "Shake hands"—I said "Yes," but we had had a few words about four years ago, before I enlisted—I said, "I will shake hands, but I don't forget you gave me fourteen days' imprisonment;" and I said, "You have been talking a great deal about me while I have been away "—he said, "No "—I said, "Well, let us fight it out, and see who is the best man"—he said no, he was not able to fight me, and he said if I would not let him go, he would give me fourteen cuts as well as the fourteen days—I said, "No, you could not do that," and with that he drew out a bagging hook from under his smock, and struck me across the head unawares—(a bagging hook is the same shape as a sickle but it has not teeth as a sickle has)—I ran away to my mother's, who lives in the bottom part of the house where Grady lives at the top—she was not there—I came away, and got talking to Mrs. Brunnett, and I told her how Grady had served me—while there, Grady came out of his own house—he called me a b—b—, and said he would cut my head open if he had a chance—I went back to his house, and he was pulled in by his wife</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150105"></xptr>
               <p>—I told him to come out; he did not seem to make any appearance, but kept shouting inside—I hit the door, and drove my hand through the door—made a second hit, and the door went in with me—Grady came out, with the hook in his hand, and make a stroke at me to split me down the head—I put up my hand—I had a piece of paling in my hand—I defended that stroke off—Maloney then came with a piece of wood, a piece of quar<lb></lb>tering, and he struck me with it between the elbow and the arm—that made me drop the piece of paling—I then ran away again, and I received two more strokes on my head with the bagging hook—they are here now—Grady came after me through the crowd, with his two hands on the hook, and made a blow to split my head—I stooped my head, and received the blow between my shoulders—I fell down, and I heard him say that he would cut the head of any other b—that came after him, a policeman or any one else—I then became senseless.</p>

                  </hi>. I am acquainted with Grady and the prosecutor—I on 5th Aug. I went with Grady to buy a sickle—we bought one a-piece to go to the harvest next morning—on the way home we met the soldier, in the Kent-road, by the Green Man public house, about a mile from Peckham-orchard—the soldier was standing on the footpath—I said to Grady, "Doherty is here"—we walked pretty fast, and passed him by—Doherty followed us—he came up, and Grady asked him to shake hands—Doherty said, "I am not going to shake hands with a thing like you, that gave me fourteen days"—he said, "I will hare satisfaction for the b——fourteen days"—he stopped him, and I went between them—I said to Doherty, "You are drunk "—he said, "No, I an not; you are a——fool to say I am"—I went on with Grady, and Doherty came op and stopped him again, and said, "You can't go till I have satisfaction for the b——fourteen days you gave me in prison "—Grady said, "I am going to harvest in the morning; I don't want to have anything to do with you; I can't fight you; I have had a hard day's work, and you a good dinner of bread and beef "—Doherty said, "You must fight me here "—he drew his sickle, and Doherty ran across the road, and took up some stones in his hand—I said to Grady, "Get on as fast as you can "—Doherty came again, and said, "Tell me, are you man enough to fight me? can you fight me?"—Grady said, "No "—Doherty was then talking to me—I said, "Be quiet "—he then left me, and struck Grady on the face—this was pretty near Peck<lb></lb>han—orchard—Grady then drew the sickle, and knocked the cap off Doherty and Doherty knocked the cap off him—I took up Grady's cap, and said, "Don't use that sickle "—Grady ran, and Doherty can as fast as he could ever the bridge—I took Grady a different road, and as I was going I met a policeman, and I spoke to him—I went with Grady to his own house—I had seen Grady use the sickle, but I cannot say where he hit him—I saw his cap fall off—before the blow with the saw Doherty had struck Grady—I went home with Grady, and after that I saw Doherty in the court, and he said he would stop in the court and watch him, and he said if he had his b—sword he would cut his head off—I went in, and gave Grady his supper, and left him, and as I came back the door was broken in.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 7, Billiter-square, and am the medical attendant of Mr. Arthur Bennett, of Wells-street, Hackney, who has been ill for some time—he had a very severe illness fourteen years ago, and soon after this occurrence he became very ill, and has been so about two months—it is a tendency to softening of the brain—I ordered him to leave London, and he has been away six or seven weeks, during which time I have only seen him once, and that was on Friday last—he was not then in a condition to come up here and give evidence—the effort of giving evidence would be dangerous to his life, and I, as his medical atten<lb></lb>dant have forbidden it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition was then read at follow</hi>:—<hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR BENNEYY</hi> says: I am a builder, and reside at Hackney. On Wednesday, the 3d instant, at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at my yard gate when I saw the prisoner Wilson coming towards me; he came up to me and spoke about the weather, then upon business—he said, "Very unpleasant business has brought me here to-day; a man whom I've had in my employ, and my father twenty years before, has recommended me to a gentleman in this neighbourhood of the name of Drake, who has a pony for sale; perhaps you know him, he is a Quaker, and they are very particular folks to deal with—I came down yesterday, and saw the pony, and it's just such a one as I want; they have been driving it in a basket chaise, with a lady, and I want it for the same purpose; I have agreed to give ten guineas for the pony." He again repeated that the gentleman's name was Drake, and that he lived in Hack<lb></lb>ney. I told him that I did not know Mr. Drake, when he, the prisoner, said, "I gave my man, this morning, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and a sovereign, to go for the pony, pay for it, and bring it to me home, but, to my surprise, he came back with the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and sovereign, but without the pony." He then went on to say that the gentleman would not let him have the pony, and then added, "I have come down to know the reason, and, to my vexation, found that my man had offered the gentleman ten pounds instead of the ten guineas, and Mr. Drake was so exasperated that he would not let him have the pony at all." The prisoner Wilson then said that he had seen Mr. Drake's groom, who had promised "to follow me here.'1 On saying this, he, Wilson, turned round, and exclaimed, "O, here he is!" and the other prisoner, Rumsey, came up, and Wilson said to him, "I have been telling this gentleman how your muster has served me with respect to the pony." (I took Rumsey to be Mr. Drake's groom.) Ramsey's reply to Wilson was, "No, roaster won't sell it you at any price; I could sell it, but not to you," addressing Wilson. Wilson then turned to me, and asked me how he should get out of it. I said, "Well, you give me the money, and I will give it to the groom," meaning Rumsey; "and he can go and tell his master that I have bought it, and then he can give the pony up to you." Rumsey then said, "No, you are not to have it; that won't do, I'm not to take his money." Wilson then said, "As the groom seems so particular, is there anywhere we can go and sit down?" I said, "Oh, yes!" and led the way into my own house—we seated ourselves, and Wilson took out his pocket-book, and laid it down on the table, then opened it, so that I could see a lot of notes, and he took out one note which appeared to me to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank note; he then took out a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank note, and said, "This is the note I gave my man this morning;" he then replaced the other note, folded his pocket-book, and put it into his pocket. The other prisoner was not then with us; he was waiting at the gate. Wilson gave me the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and one sovereign; that was in my house. I told him that the sovereign made it 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more than was to be given for the pony, upon which he said, "O, never mind, those men always expect something." We then went to the gate where the groom (Rumsey) was standing; I tendered him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the sovereign; he objected to taking the note, saying that his master would not have the money from Wilson, and that his master would know it was his, and that he.(Rumsey) would lose</p>

               <p>his situation. He then gave me the note back, and Wilson asked me to change it. I took the note in ray hand, and went to a butcher close by to get it changed. Rumsey went with me; he waited outside while I went in. I told the butcher what I wanted, and he came out with me, and directly collared Rumsey; I turned and saw Wilson running away. I kept possession of the 101. note; it is now produced; I wrote my initials on it; it has since been stamped "forged," as it now appears. Rumsey was given into custody, and Wilson was afterwards taken by a police-constable. Wilson offered me a sovereign to let him go, but I told him I would not if he gave me a hundred. The pocket-book produced is the same in which I saw what appeared to be bank notes at my house. Rumsey was then dressed nearly as he is now."</p>

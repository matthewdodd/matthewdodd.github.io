I bit him by the thumb, then he gave me a job on the temples, here is the scar of it now, and the blood ran; I know not what he did it with. As soon as ever I was down he took my hat and wig, I flew at him as I lay on the ground and tore off a piece of his coat. I saw him only by the light of the lanthorn, I cannot swear to his face; they did not ask for my money; the neighbours got to their windows, the other two fled, and the prisoner went off before the watchman came to my assistance. I got up and found my wig and my lanthorn; I lighted my candle and found a sack. I saw him again in about three minutes time,

            . I am constable; the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner , saying, he had been robb'd, but did not say this was the man. I saw the coat and piece fitted together, and do believe it was fresh torn off from each other; I have taken care of the sack ever since.</p>

               <p>I came from Blackwall ; there were men a fighting about emptying a vault, and a great noise, I went along by them, there was murder cry'd out among them; I met this watchman, he said, d - n you, I'll stop the first I see. I said, don't stop me, I readily went with him by ourselves to the Ship-tavern, which is best part of half a mile; then I went to the watch-house, there they brought a sack ; I charged the officer to take Fletcher into custody, but he let him go and kept me; in the morning they put me in the cage; there was a report of some houses being broke open, and I stood trembling in the cage, so somebody put that old jacket through to cover me with.</p>

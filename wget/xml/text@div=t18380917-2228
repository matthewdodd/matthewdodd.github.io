                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am sister of the prisoners. I was at Peckham on Monday the 17th of September, and my sister came to me about this bill—I returned to town, and I saw my brother the next morning—he asked me if I would go and get his note cashed—I said I would, when I had taken breakfast—I went to Mrs. Hamilton—she said she would cash it as soon as I had got my brother's name on it—I went and got him to put it on—the bill is for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mrs. Hamilton kept 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for doing it—this is the bill-(<hi rend="italic">looking at it)-</hi> I gave the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a man named Borrett was taken for uttering another note—when the prisoner went away with the money, he said he was going to get his clothes out of pledge, and should return in half an hour—I saw him go into a pawnbroker's shop, and I asked him if he was getting his things—he said he was—I wished to take them home, but he objected, and said he would bring them home—when he was gone, I went to the pawnbroker's, to ascertain if he had taken any things out, and then I went to the Commercial Dock to inquire if there was such a ship as he said there was-(I should have gone before, but Borrett objected to it)—I afterwards saw my brother in the Highway, in a state of intoxication, and he said it was all a <hi rend="italic">fudge</hi>—I went to find J. Evans, No. 14, Lime-street, where the note is made payable—I could find no such person there—I could not find the ship, and there could be no master of it-No. 14, Lime-street, is the Grapes public-house, kept by a man of the name of Apple—I saw my brother write "Joseph West" on the back of this note.</p>

I was called by the prisoner's sister—I went to her house, No. 8, China-place, and found the prisoner intoxicated, and sitting on a bed-Borrett was in the house at the time—he was taken last night for passing a similar bill to this—when I went in the prisoner struck at me with the shovel, and while I was depriving him of the shovel, Borrett got away—I took the prisoner to the station, and when I returned, Mrs. Drew gave me one sovereign And eight half-crowns, which she got out of her brother's pocket—I then went to Mrs. Hamilton, who gave me the note I now produce, and another—there is no such ship as the <hi rend="italic">Hebe</hi>, and no John Evans in Lime-street.</p>

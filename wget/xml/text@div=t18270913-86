            . On the 15th of July I was going home and met the prisoner (whom I knew before,) in Maidenhead-court; he asked me into a public-house, and said he would treat me - he took me into a house, and called for a pot of beer; he would not pay for it - he wanted me to pay, and I would not - the publican took it back again; the prisoner then said, "Have you got no money?" I said, "No, and I do not want the beer; you may pay for it;" he then put his fingers to the bottom of my waistcoat pocket, where my purse was, and took it out - I told him to give it me, that nobody might know it; he then held his fist at me, and pulled me into the passage - and while I was waiting for the watchman, he bit my fingers - the watchman came; he struck the watchman, and made away - the watchman followed and came up with him again, and struck him with his stick - he was then taken - he denied having the purse at first, but when the constable got up to take him, he produced it - the money was all right in it, and a bit of black thread was in it.</p>

            . I was the officer of the night - the prosecutor brought the prisoner in; he at first said he had no purse, and that the money he had about him was his own - but when the prosecutor described it, he produced it - they were neither of them sober.</p>

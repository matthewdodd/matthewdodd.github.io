               <p>Q. If he brought your money and said, "I have given a receipt for this sum," should you have complained of it - or thought it his duty? A. Certainly not; I complain both of his signing my name and not paying me the money - no person in my employ was authorised to sign my name to a receipt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Pray what did I receive as your servant? A. Five shillings the first three weeks, boarding in the house - you afterwards received 12s.; the soda-water manufactory was mine; my name was not placed over the door without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did it become your property; had you purchased it? A. I did; I did not agree with the prisoner for any wages as a servant; I was to give him what I thought proper.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you at any time send the prisoner with a sum of 80l.? A. Yes; that transaction was done honestly - I cannot answer whether the prisoner might have furnished a person with the receipt in my name, thinking he had authority to do so - I never sent more than one person for the money; nobody else called by my authority - I authorised the prisoner to call for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the Sodawater concern did not belong to the prosecutor, whose name was only printed on the door, in order that the business might be kept from the creditors of Davis, his son-in-law, who was in Whitecross-street prison, for debt, and that he was never in the prosecutor's service.</p>

             re-examined. I am very familiar with the hand-writing of the prisoner - I have every reason to believe the writing is his - I have not a doubt of it - the signature is disguised - the body of the receipt is written in his own hand; I have not a doubt of it being his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Being employed by you, if he had paid the money, and said, he had given a receipt in your name, should you have complained? A. I cannot answer the question; I should not have wished him to have signed my name; I have sent him to collect money, not on account of Davis - Davis is not interested in the business; this was for lead - nobody was interested in that business but myself - I have received money from the prisoner in my lead business - I don't know whether he gave a receipt in my name on that occasion; I have not heard; he no doubt gave a receipt - he paid me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Now if he had paid you this money, should you have considered he exceeded his authority, in giving a receipt for that money? A. If he signed my name, I should certainly think he had; I never knew an instance of a person signing the name of his principal, and handing the money over - I always considered it should be with the additional signature of the party himself - it should be signed "for

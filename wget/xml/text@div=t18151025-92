I returned to the premises the next morning at a little after seven; it was day light then. I found that the lock was picked. I had double locked the door, and locked the padlock on the outside. The padlock was broken off in the morning; it was afterwards found at Mr. Smith's door. All the property in the indictment was gone.</p>

            . Day had hardly broken when I was first alarmed. The door was fastened by one of Branthwaite's catch locks, and a padlock on the outside. When I got to the warehouse, the robbers had completely gone. There must be more than one concerned, for the largest parcel was so heavy, that it would require two or three strong persons to lift it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could one person have moved the smallest - A. Yes, if he had been a stout person.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these things which were stolen, on the ground floor - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the warehouse, did you see any body - A. No, not a soul near. Our warehouse is about twenty yards from the corner; if six or eight good stout hands had been engaged, they might have got the property round the corner in a short time.</p>

            . I am a police officer. On the 16th of this month, I was at Kingsland, with Avery, a brother officer, at about half past four o'clock in the afternoon of that day, we were walking down Coffin Castle lane, and the prisoner was riding in a one horse cart. I asked him to give me and Avery a ride, for we were very tired; we got in; he said, he was going as far as the Thatched House, at Islington. As we were going along, I saw two pieces of Irish cloth laying at the bottom of the cart; I did not say any thing. He set us down at Scott's-place. We watched him. At this time, we had heard of this robbery. We saw him take a young woman into his cart, and then turn back again, towards Ball's Pond, and the Thatched House. We went into the parlour at the Thatched House, and found him, and the young woman, in company with a man, named 
               <persName id="t18151025-92-person736">

            . The prisoner at the bar, said to us, you have got here nearly as soon as I have. We told him we were officers, and must search him, on suspicion of a burglary, on account of the linen we had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this linen in the Thatched House - A. Yes, laying on the table in a handkerchief. I took care of the door whilst Avery searched the prisoner, in my presence. Henry said to me, do you think he is a smuggler; I said, no; sit you still, we will search you presently. I saw Henry searched, and on him were found ninety-six counterfeit three shilling tokens, and a number of notes, of Country Banks which have broken. I saw them all three searched, but nothing was found on them relative to this business. After the prisoner was searched, we took him to the watchhouse. We then went back to his house in Coffin Castle-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that it was his house - A.Because as we were coming along the lane, we saw the horse and cart in which he rode, standing at the door. I did not see the prisoner come out of the house, but I saw him come out of the yard, and get into the cart, and after that, we asked him for a ride. The house consists of two stories. I searched the top part first; I found three ends of kerseymere; I went into the bed room, and found some black serge in a drawer in the bed room; I found some buckram likewise. I then went down stairs, and found thirteen pieces of canvass under the stairs. I then went the next day. That was all we found that day. I went the next day with my brother officer; the prisoner's wife was in the house; I found one wooden packing case, and the boards of another; I found a rope with a noose bag hanging over a beam in a shed in the yard. We afterwards communicated to the prisoner what we had found, and he did not deny that this was his house.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. It might be an hour and a half after the prisoner left this house, that we searched it the first time. I never knew the man before, nor saw him, before I saw him get into the cart. The prisoner gave a true account of himself, so far as, that he said, he was going to the Thatched House, and so he did. He did not say he bought the linen, nor do I know what he said about it, nor whether any thing.</p>

            , that was the young woman's name. Upton held the door whilst I searched them all three; on the prisoner I found a two pound Bank of England note, which I returned to him. We took him to the watchhouse. We found nothing on either of them relative to this business. We then went to his house. I afterwards told him, we had been to his house. I saw what Upton found. He never denied that it was his house. The next morning we went there again, at about twelve o'clock; we found a packing case, and the boards of another, and the rope was hanging over them. In the front room, I found a phosphorus bottle; that was the last thing found. When we were coming along this lane the day before, I saw the cart and horse in which we afterwards rode, standing at the door of this house, where we found these things, and saw the prisoner come out of the gateway of that house, and get into the cart.

               <p>Q. How do you know it - A. Because I have a particular way of fastening it; that cord I can swear was round one of the bales that were stolen.</p>

We took up a person of the name of Hyams that very afternoon, but he was discharged; we also apprehended a Mrs. Faucett; we would have apprehended her husband, only he has absconded. On their premises we found two hundred picklock keys. Hayward said to us before we went to his house, I suppose you will go and search my house, be as delicate as you can on account of my wife. I did not hear any thing about his buying these things of a licensed hawker. We afterwards told him we searched his house.</p>
               <p>Richard Stubbs. This say, or serge, is a woollen cloth, used by the Priests in Portugal and Spain; it is an article of British manufacture, but not used in this Country. We lost the quantity of it stated in the indictment. I firmly believe this to be part of it. We have been a whole year having four pieces made.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing else you can swear to - A. As a packer, I know that buckram, like this is used only by packers for the purpose of packing up such cloth and things as we have lost. The kerseymere I know particularly, because here is the part where there has been a card pasted on; I know no other persons had such a large card upon it as we had; the kerseymere I can swear to; here is a pattern book, and one of the pieces corresponds with it in every respect, in pattern, in all the marks, even in the maker's name.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. You don't supply all the tradesmen in Spain and Portugal - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say there is but one manufacturer of it - A. These are all made down in Essex; I don't know that there is another manufacturer; but I don't mean to say there is not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I keep livery stables; I take horses in to bait, and receive parcels for the Endfield and Winchmore Hill caravan. On the 18th, a licensed hawker put up at my stables, and the things that were found in my house, as well as the two pieces of linen I had in the cart, I bought of him, and the packing cases and the rope were in the shed by his putting there. Had I any guilty intention, or had I known that the linen in the cart was stolen, I should have hardly let these two gentlemen get into my cart.</p>

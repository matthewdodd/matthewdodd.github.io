                  </hi>. I am the wife of Hippolyte L'Habitant—he keeps a fish shop at 26, Regency Street, Westminster—on Sunday night we went to bed about 8.30, leaving the house safe, and about 12.30, hearing my dogs bark, I opened the window and looked out, and saw Prendergast running out from the closet in the back yard—I knew him before—I also saw Phillips stooping as he went along—I did not know him before—my husband got up and ran after them; they both ran away—I called "Police!" and then went downstairs—I found the window of the watercloset had been forced and the string cut—I missed from my room a watch and chain and five rings, and other articles worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine, and was safe that night; it is</p>

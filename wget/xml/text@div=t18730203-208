                  </hi>. I am a beer retailer, and reside at the Swiss Cottage, Manor Place, Walworth—on the 11th of January last, about 11 o'clock at night, I was in Friar Street—two men got hold of me, one on each side, and a man who came round a corner tripped me up—I was thrown down—I said "Don't murder me"—one of them kicked me in the head whilst I was trying to shove him off—there is a hole now in it—you can put a nut in it—this collar (<hi rend="italic">produced, smeared with bleed</hi>) I had on at the time—they ran away—I felt them both have their hands in my pockets—I could not swear which of them took the money—when I came away from home I put 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, and I had a silk handkerchief—before the men seized me I had two or three threepenny pieces in the right-hand trousers pocket, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the left-hand pocket—while I was down, a little boy ran and called his father, who came to my assistance—the men then ran away—where they went to I do not know—I do not remember seeing prisoner before he was at the station—I said I would not press the charge at the station, as I did not want the trouble of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 38, Hill Street, Wellington Street, Blackfriars Road—about 10. 45, on the night of the 11th January, as I was coming round the corner from Friar Street into Hill Street, prisoner and another young man I saw had hold of the prosecutor—I thought there was some<lb></lb>thing the matter, and I did not walk so quick—I walked as still as they did—when I got to my door I stood and watched them—they could not see me—the prisoner and another man brought Scott down the street—I am positive prisoner is one of the men—when they got nearly opposite my door, on the other side of the street, both of them put their legs in front of Mr. Scott, and threw him on his face, and I saw the prisoner kick Scott whilst he was down, and afterwards both of them knelt down and put their hands in his pockets, one on each side—I knocked at the door, and my father came out and said "You big thieves"—just as he said that, they jumped up and ran away—I and my father ran after them—my father got nearer to them than me—he was about 3 yards off them—I never lost sight of them—I am certain the prisoner is one of the men.</p>

I live at 131, Suffolk Street—on the 11th January, shortly after 11 o'clock in the evening, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" at the corner of Hill Street—as I was turning the corner prisoner knocked me down against the corner house, but I picked myself up and ran after him, and caught him almost as soon as Mr. Seeds—a person who was along with Seeds said that the prisoner had knocked a man down and robbed him, and brought him back from Belvedere Place—blood was running down prosecutor's neck—I had no constable nor anybody to assist me—I threw him in Suffolk Street twice, and he <hi rend="italic">throwed</hi> me—a constable then came, and assisted me in taking him to the station—I never lost sight of him after he knocked me down—I am positive he is the man—he threw some money away in Belvedere Place, and said he would go back with me before I had the encounter.</p>

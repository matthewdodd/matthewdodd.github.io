               <p>I placed some plate on a bed in the dressing-room; there was a cream-jug, three salt cellars, and a sugar-bason; they were clean, and placed there to be put away; it was a front room—I left the room then, and went there again about ten minutes afterwards—I heard the plate rattle in the room—I supposed it was Mr. Gillman returned home—I went to the door, tried it, and could not open it—I called out to know who was there, and I received no answer—I then tried the bedroom door adjoining, and that was fastened too—I called to the housemaid, who was downstairs in the kitchen, to come to my assistance, and also my brother, who was in the house—he went to the front of the house with a ladder, and got into the dressing-room through the window—he opened the door for me, and we found the plate gone, with the exception of the silver waiter—in the next room there was a gold watch taken, and some jewellery—the drawers were taken out, and some boxes un<lb></lb>fastened, which contained them—the watch-case was on the bed empty—I had before this, about 4 o'clock, after I had placed the silver on the bad, been into the dining-room, and noticed a cart and two men, outside; one was holding a nose-bag on the horse's head, and the other was sitting in the cart—it was standing on the opposite side of the road, opposite the next house—I could not describe the horse—I did not know the men at all—I should not know them again—I only saw the back of the one that was holding the nose-bag.</p>

I am in the service of Mrs. Hollis, who lives next door to Mr. Gillman—on Monday, the 15th September, about half-past 4 o'clock, I noticed three men coming down the road from Wimbledon in a cart, drawn by a dark pony; it had a double seat to it—it went to the bottom of the road, then turned round, came back again, and stopped opposite Mr. Gillman's—one of them, who was in light clothes, got out of the cart; it was the prisoner Wood—he went in at Mr. Gillman's gate; he passed our house—he held Mr. Gillman's gate in his hand, and said to the other two, "Don't go up there; stay where you are"—they turned the horse's head towards Wandsworth—one of them got out and went to the cross-turning, and the other sat still in the cart—I am sure of Wood—I am not equally sure of the other two.</p>

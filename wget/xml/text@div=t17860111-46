             sworn.</p>

               <p>Being in company with the prisoner before the robbery was committed, I had a suspicion of him, I afterwards saw him go past the house, though he could not get out of the house without being helped out, I saw him go past apparently well as I am this moment, I saw him take a mahogany table and put it on his head and take it away with him, I followed him and afterwards met Mrs. Gittos with the table in her hand, and I informed her of the person that had stolen the table, I did not see him stopped because the people were assembled.</p>

               <p>Court. Where have you been this afternoon? - I have been attending the Court at the New Sessions House at the Old Bailey.</p>

               <p>What at the public-house? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Gittos. Have you known this man any time? - Yes, he is a neighbour of ours, he is a tallow-chandler.</p>

               <p>Court. He seems to me to be in liquor, I cannot examine a witness who is in liquor against a man for felony.</p>

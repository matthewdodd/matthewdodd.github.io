               <p>What are the things that you now produce? - Here is a cotton gown, a lawn apron, a muslin apron, a black silk cloak, and a white quilt.</p>

               <p>(The things deposed to by the Prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Overy. What business may you be? - I sell all kinds of linen drapery goods, muslins, lawns, Irish, and every thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Do you sell them made up in garments, or in the piece? - No, in the piece.</p>
               <p>How came you to purchase these sort of things? - I frequently buy both, of pawnbrokers, and of gentlemens servants, all sorts of left off cloaths; I was recommended to the prisoner last summer, I bought something of her at that time, as she took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260026"></xptr> in things in pledge, I said I should be glad to deal with her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Then you bought these things in the way of business? - Certainly, I bought them openly and publickly in her shop, there were many people that were in and out at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you afterwards dispose of these things to the person in Holywell-street? - No, my Lord, I wanted the white quilt for my own private use, or I should not have bought the other things; I carried them to Mrs. Simpson, she sold them behind St. Clement's, I seldom go to cloaths shops myself.</p>
               <p>Did you put any mark upon these things? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>That is a very common gown, is not it? Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Nor in the aprons? - No, here is one I had the curiosity to count the darns in it, there were between 60 and 70 darns.</p>
               <p>No more, at what o'clock was you there? About eight on the Friday evening.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Ireland at home then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she go out that night? - I did not see her go out, I was very much fatigued, and sat down, and she was in and out in her back shop and her fore shop some time, for a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>What o'clock did you go there? - About eight she was in her shop in and out many times.</p>
               <p>Did people come in to sell, as well as to pledge? - I cannot pretend to say what they came about, but many different people came in.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you come to Mrs. Ireland's that evening, with a view to purchase any of these specific articles? - No, I called by chance, as I do at other places to know if she had any thing.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Ireland has had an inclination to get rid of a lump of goods, you are the person that take them off her hands? No, sir.</p>
               <p>Had you ever done it in any other instance before? - Not in particular, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did you buy any thing else besides this property? - No.</p>
               <p>How much did you give for these things? I gave three and twenty shillings, and I sold all but the quilt for 17 s. 6 d. for I told the woman who had them, that I thought they were very dear; I said, well says I, I will give you so, and so for them, she said she would not let me have them, I wanted the quilt, the other things I sold for 17 s. 6 d. which is reckoning the quilt at 6 s. which is in the indictment, I find only valued at 3 s.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Pray what value do you set on these things, they are your own property now? - They are thirty-eight shillings in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with the value that was set on these goods when they were set down in the indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then in your conscience, do not you believe they were the just value? - No, sir, I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Then you think they are worth more? Yes, a great deal more.</p>
               <p>How much more do you think, speaking reasonably? - I cannot tell, the gown cost me twenty-eight shillings before it was made, this apron cost 13 s. 6 d. the other apron 16 or 17 s. it was damaged muslin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Let us look at that damaged muslin apron, I believe nobody will give 6 d. for it now.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Overy. Very likely you might be glad to get rid of them? - I had no reason to be glad to get rid of these things.</p>

I desired Mrs. Overy to go to the prisoner; we went to White Cross-street, when Mrs. Overy cried out, there is Mrs. Ireland, says I, you sit in the coach I will speak to her; says the prisoner, what do you want, (she keeps a chandler's shop in Red Lion Market, White Cross-street;) I went into the parlour with her; pray says I, do you recollect selling to Mrs. Overy, who spoke to you in the coach, any wearing apparel, a day or two ago? - Lord bless me, says she, I hope there is nothing the matter, says I nothing particular, only these things were stolen; with that she fell down on her knees, and her daughter at the same time on her knees, imploring for mercy; and for God's sake to make it up, any sum whatever she would give; I told her, no I could not, she must go with me to Bow-street, where my application was; she was very unwilling to go, but she went to the door under pretence of getting her hat and cloak, and made off.</p>

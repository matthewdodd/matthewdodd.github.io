On the 22d of October, about one o'clock, the crupper hung in the back-room leading from the wharf to the counting-house. I missed it about three o'clock, and asked him if he had seen it? he said he had not. Between six and seven Judd came and desired me to attend next day at the Thames Police Office, which I did, and found the prisoner in custody, with the crupper and two horse-boots, which were mine, He was our servant, and worked three years with us at 24 s. per week. I had not seen the boots for some time.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 22d of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was with Beech and two others, and saw the prisoner go up Church-street, with something concealed under his greatcoat; I asked him what he had got? he said a piece of harness, and that he worked for Briant. While we were examining it Beech said it was a crupper - the prisoner immediately ran away as hard as he could. I pursued and secured him, without losing sight of him. As he ran he tried to pull his great-coat off.</p>

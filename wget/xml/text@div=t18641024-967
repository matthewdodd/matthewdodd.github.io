                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 439). On Saturday night, 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> October, I was on duty in St. George's-street, St. George's—there was a disturbance there about 12 o'clock—a man complained to me of being assaulted, and pointed the prisoner out—while I was speaking, the prisoner came up, and said, "What the have you to do with it? I could tight a dozen like you"—he struck me in the mouth, and knocked me against the shutters—I then took him info custody, and lie struck and kicked me several times—a public carriage attendant came to my assistance, and he was knocked down—Police<lb></lb>men Hart and Kenny then came up—Kenny assisted in getting me up—I heard him say, "I am stabbed"—I looked round, and saw him on the ground; his face was covered with blood—Sergeant Dillon then came up, and asked the prisoner to go quietly to the station—he went five or six yards, and then threw himself down, and said he would be d—if he would go for any one; he would not be taken by a dozen men—it took four constables to get him to the station.</p>

I went to this disturbance—I found the prisoner in the custody of Stenner—Stenner was on the ground—I got. him on his feet, and then I got hold of the prisoner by the collar of his coat—he struck me twice above the eye with a knife—I said to Hart, Hold him tight: he ha stabbed me"—I took the knife from him, but lost it in the struggle—I do not believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife—we found this on him at the station—after I was stabbed, I received a blow on the back of my head with a brick—I was very nearly senseless—I was under the care of Mr. Ross, the surgeon, for eight days—my eye is still very weak.</p>

               <p>there was a crowd of 400 or 500 people—I saw the prisoner there—he was kicking and plunging violently—Hart had hold of him—I saw Stenner and Kenny bleeding in the face—they appeared quite exhausted—"I said to the prisoner.

You have been in trouble before, and ought to know better"—he said, "Yes, I will go with you;" and stood up—he walked ten or fifteen yards quietly, and he said, "I am b——if I go any further"—he they threw himself down, and commenced kicking and plunging violently—it took four constables to take him to the station.</p>

I am a surgeon, and live at No. 10, Commercial-terrace, Commercial-road—I was called to the Police-station on the morning in question, and found Kenny bleeding from a punctured wound immediately beneath the left eyebrow—the wound took a downward course immediately beneath the skin of the upper eyelid—it was. caused by a narrow, sharp-pointed instrument—he was suffering from other slight wounds—the small blade of a knife would cause such a wound as that over the left eye—I attended him eight or nine days.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would a stone have caused such a wound, or a hair<lb></lb>pin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the wound was wide enough to admit the broad end of my probe—I probed it a quarter of an inch—I don't think a wound caused by a hair-pin would have admitted my probe.</p>

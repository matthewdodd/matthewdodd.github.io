               <p>Wright. He at first said the pocket was picked in Hackney-road, and afterwards in Weymouth-terrace, which is one hundred and fifty yards out of the road; and he told the gentleman he would pursue and get the handkerchief back if he would give him 2s.</p>

            . On the 18th of April I was in Hackney-road - I can't say where I had my pocket picked, but Sewell came and spoke to me - "I said I don't think I have got my handkerchief, I have left it in my other coat pocket;" I did not say where, but the coat was at my office- I did not go there again till the next morning, and the handkerchief was not in it - when Sewell told me of my loss, he pointed out two boys, but I could not say who they were - he said if I would give him 2s, he would go after them, as he was a poor lad out of employ; he did not run after them at that time.</p>

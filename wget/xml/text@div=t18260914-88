               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not communicated with the solicitor for the Mint? A. Not respecting you at all, nor with the officers; I have been in gaol for not paying some duties to the Crown, and I was twelve or thirteen months in Giltspur-street, sent from this bar. I never lived in Hill-street or Paul-street, nor kept a brothel there, nor in that neighbourhood.</p>

Never a shilling. I have been a coach-master; I have worked as a confectioner last week; I do not expect a farthing for giving this information - I have done it for the good of the public. I work for different shopkeepers.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 1st of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw Romaine holding the prisoner by the collar - he said he suspected he had bad money about him; Payne came up, and we took him into the Black Raven, public-house, and in his right-hand breeches pocket I found a paper, containing forty counterfeit sixpences, and in his other pocket 5s. 6d. loose - I found a good sixpence, and about 6d. in copper on him; Payne picked up 3s. 6d., which I saw drop from his hand behind him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How far was Romaine from him when the 3s. 6d. fell? A. About a yard in front of him - I saw it drop from the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you know Romaine? A. Yes, by seeing him about the office; I do not think I had seen him for two months before; I do not know how he gets his living - I never knew him as a common informer.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PAYRE. I am a patrol of Bow-street. I saw Romaine collaring the prisoner; we took him to the Black Raven; I saw the 3s. 6d. drop from him, and took it up; nobody but him could have dropped it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How came you there at that moment? A. It was quite accidental. I had had no communication with Newsam.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. These forty sixpences are all counterfeit; the 3s. 6d. is three counterfeit shillings and a bad sixpence - the five shillings are counterfeit; the sixpences are all from one die.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, entered into a long Defence, stating that Romaine kept several bad houses, and that he had been entrapped through his villainy; that he was continually laying bad money in the way of the unwary, for them to pick up, and that he had been convicted of getting 30l. from persons to get a bill thrown out by the Grand Jury.</p>

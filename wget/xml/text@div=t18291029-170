               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know a person named Boyd? A. Yes; he receives money from me, for finishing the houses - I bought the property of Mr. Staley, who pays Boyd; Boyd has the power of letting the houses - he is to have them at a certain price; I had paid for these sashes in the purchases - they were there when I purchased the property; the prisoner did not make them - I saw sashes in the house before I knew the prisoner - I cannot swear they were these.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you proprietor of the ground? A. I have the lease of eleven houses; I advance money to the builders, and then grant leases; the prisoner applied about a lease of that house - I said when it was complete I should have no objection to grant a lease to him, or any one that Staley had appointed; this was five months ago.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not your agreement with the Brewers' company, that the houses were to be fit for inhabiting at a given time? A. Yes, and they are not - I am not certain that they will not be taken from me.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I assisted in making the sashes for this house; I received money from Mr. Staley - I fixed up these sashes before the prisoner engaged to finish the house; I had made the basement sashes, and some of the attics, before he entered into any agreement with me. On the 28th of September, I saw the prisoner with one sash in his hand; I said, "What are you going to do with that?" he said, "Stop me if you dare" - I said, "I shall stop the sash;" this is the one - it was a quarter-past twelve o'clock in the day; the sashes were then out of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not you know that he made a claim of right to them? A. No - there was no agreement between him and me that he was to finish the house in a certain time, or to forfeit the things in it; there was no such agreement made with my son-in-law, to my knowledge; I made an agreement with the prisoner, in the presence of my son-in-law,

            ; I know this paper; I admit this - the prisoner never said he had any claim of right - I made part of the sashes, and Mr. Scott's money paid me; the prisoner did not employ me - there was an agreement that the prisoner should have the house at a certain time; these sashes were removed a few hours before the time.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did the prisoner in any way contribute to put the sashes in the house? A. No. except the glass, he being a <rs id="t18291029-170-deflabel961" type="occupation">painter and glazier</rs>

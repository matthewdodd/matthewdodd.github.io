            . I lost a cap and a handkerchief; the Prisoner came to my Mrs. to beg the favour of her to go with a message to a gentlewoman who owed her some money, and my Mrs. gave her a breakfast; this handkerchief was in an elbow chair in the kitchen, and I saw her take the handkerchief into her right hand, and put it under her cloak, but I took no notice of it till my Mrs. came home; when she came home, I said to her, Did not you see a handkerchief in the great chair? Yes, said she; then said I, Nanny has taken it. The next day she came again, and my Mrs. spoke to her about it, but she denied it; said I, Nanny, do not deny it, for I saw you take it; she said she knew nothing of it. She came the next day again; there is a bureau in the parlour, and all the drawers except one were locked up, and there I had put my cap; the cap lay uppermost, and was taken out of the drawer; the next morning the cap was missed, and the Prisoner came the next day as usual ; said I, Nanny, you have got my cap, and she said she had not; we talked of searching her pocket, and she pulled out a dirty cap, which was none of mine; I told her, if it was pawned or sold, I would go and fetch it, as likewise the handkerchief ; she said she never saw any thing of the cap and handkerchief , and wondered I should think so of her .</p>

            . The Prisoner came to me to do a message for her in Spring Garden, and I left her and my maid in the parlour; before I went out I went into the kitchen, and saw the handkerchief, it was a silk handkerchief, and when I came home, Peggy said the Prisoner had taken the handkerchief, and was gone away with it; said I, it is a strange thing you should see a person take your handkerchief, and not stop her with it.</p>

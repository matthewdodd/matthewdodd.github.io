                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Samuel Strong, Larchin, and Co., brewers. The prisoner was in their employ—two policemen came to me on the 9th of Feb., about half-past nine o'clock, at night and asked me if I had given any one orders to take anything "from my master's premises, which I had not—I do not particularly recollect these boards, and nails, and hinges, but we had such at some premises of my masters in Waltham-court, Cartwright-street, Rosemary-lane—the prisoner is a bricklayer.</p>

               <p>name was Tredgett, and he lived close by—I went to him, and asked him if he had authorized the prisoner to take any boards anywhere—he said, "No"—I went back, and told the prisoner, and began to search him—he put his hand into his left hand pocket, and took it out, closed—I asked what he had got there—he said, "Nothing"—I took hold of his hand, and found these four hinges—I said, "What have you got here?"—he said, in a low voice, "Throw them away, throw them away!"—I said that was worse than the boards—I found in his coat pocket, 1 3/4 lbs. weight of nails, which were the same sort some I examined at the houses.</p>

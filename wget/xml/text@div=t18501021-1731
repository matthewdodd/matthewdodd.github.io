                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. About two years ago the two prisoners, and another person with them, came to my shop—Jones asked me for two ounces of tea and one pound of sugar—they came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Jones laid down a sovereign, and said, "How much do they come to?"—I said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—she said, "Can you give me a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, and the rest in small silver?"—I had not that kind of change in my till; I went to my cash-box, almost within reach of my hand, and got the change in the manner that they required—I put down the change on the counter—Jones then said, "How much ie this lump-sugar?"—I said, "6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, it is the best"—the turned to consult with the other, and she said, "The lady we come for is very particular about a halfpenny or a penny," and she would not take it—I took the sugar from the counter, and placed it back in the hole where I took it from—I had to go about a yard to put the sugar back, and I had to turn my back to them—the sovereign and the change were then left on the counter—when I turned to the counter again, Jones said, "Is your coffee pretty good?"—I said, "Yes" she said, "Let me have two ounces"—I ground two ounces; and when I returned to the counter, Stone and her held a conference together—she said, "Well, about this sugar; it is not worth while to go to another shop about this pound of sugar; I will take one pound; and if she makes any words about it, I will pay the halfpenny or penny out of my own pocket, and I will never go out again for her"—she then said, "Let me have one pound of sugar"—I got one pound of sugar back again; I placed it on die counter; I then reckoned the goods up—it made a little alteration in the change, from their having the coffee—I said, "Where is the sovereign?"—Jones said, "You have taken it up, Sir"—I said I had not—Jones persisted in it that I had, and she appealed to the other, and said, "Did not you see it?"—Stone then laid, "You took it up, don't you remember? when I gave you the loaf<lb></lb>sugar back, you took it up"—I persisted that I had not taken it—they appealed one to the other, and persisted that I had—I had no shopman or other person there, and they went away—I then looked about in my cash-box, and my till, and my pocket, and I could not find it—I am satisfied that I had not had it—about six months afterwards the two prisoners came again, not the third person—they asked for tea and sugar, and laid a sovereign on the counter, and wanted change—I did not know them till the moment when I wanted to take up the sovereign—I laid the change down, and said, "Where is the sovereign?" and they said I had taken it up—I then looked at Jones, and said, "You are the very woman that robbed me about six months ago"—I said to my shopman, "Go directly to Bow-street, and get an officer"—there was no sovereign on the counter then, there had been—when my shopman had got his apron off and his bat on, to go, Jones stooped down, and lifted up a sovereign, and said, "Here it is; now see what trouble (I think she said) you might have got the gentleman into by saying he took it, and here it is"—I think Stone said, "We might have got into trouble through your saying the gentleman took the sovereign up when he did not"—I got the sovereign from Jones, and I thought I would not take the trouble of doing anything—I think Stone said, "Perhaps you knocked it down with your shawl."</p>

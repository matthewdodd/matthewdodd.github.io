                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 13th of September I was in the garden of Mr. Cheese, at Paddington, watching—I met the prisoner in the middle of the garden, with a bag of onions—I asked what he had got—he said a few onions, but I found he had about three pecks.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Flora tea-gardens at Bayswater, I had a quantity of onions taken out of my ground, and placed on the ground to dry—on the 13th of September I missed about half a bushel, or three pecks—I lost twenty bushels in about ten days—the prisoner had no business there—it was three o'clock in the morning when he was stopped—I do no business till the afternoon—the onions found are such as were on my premises.</p>

I was disturbed about two o'clock by the watchman. I got up, and went into the wash-house, and found the window-sash thrown up. I am sure I had left it shut - it is a glazed window - the shutters are inside. I had closed them, but not barred them, and the sash was quite closed. I found nothing broken - I missed three silver salt spoons.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutrix's house is on my beat. I went round at two o'clock, and found every house safe. I returned to my box in twenty minutes, hung up my lanthorn, looked up Easton-street, and saw two men opposite the prosecutrixes house - they crossed over to the iron railing of the house. I walked up the street, they went away, and turned round Wood-street, within one door of the house. I looked, and saw the wash-house window open. I called a watchman from Easton-street, and left him to watch while I knocked at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220014"></xptr>door four or five times, and sprung my rattle. Hurley came out on the balcony undressed; five or six watchmen came up, two of them went in at the window. Hurley let me in, and we found a quantity of house-breaking implements in the front parlour, and a pair of shoes, matches. tinder-box, and dark lanthorn; and as I was going to call five o'clock, I saw a young man who said I was called for by somebody in Exmouth-street. I ran there, and Bellamy said the robbers were in his cellar. We found the prisoner in the coal cellar, which is three doors from the prosecutrix's house - he was sitting down in a corner, without any shoes on. I took him to the watch-house, and tried the left foot shoe on him - it fitted him exactly; he said he did not know how he came there. He could have got into this cellar by getting out of the back door of Thomas's house, and getting over two walls. I have found none of the property - his hands were black with coal dirt.</p>

            . I live two doors from Thomas's. I was alarmed about three o'clock, and was present afterwards, when the prisoner was found in the cellar of a house belonging to me, which I let to another person; he had no shoes. I saw a pair of right and left shoes tried on him at the watch-house; they fitted him. There is a wall in Thomas's yard, not four feet high on her side - he could get over there on to a water but, and into my yard. At day-light I found under that wall a crow-bar and a glove, which corresponds with one found in the prisoner's hat.</p>

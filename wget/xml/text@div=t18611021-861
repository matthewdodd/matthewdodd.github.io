                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Kelly, a labourer, and keep a small shop at Chelsea—on 23d September, about 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in for a loaf—it came to 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown—I put it in a drawer, and gave him change—there was no other money there—he came again next morning for two skins of blacking, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me a shilling—I gave him change, and laid the shilling on the top of the chest of drawers by itself—he went away—a few hours afterwards a man came in to whom I gave the shilling in change, and he returned it to me—it was in my sight all the while he had it—I took it the next day to buy some milk, and the man bent it with his teeth, and returned it—I then showed it to my husband—I also found that the halfcrown was bad, and informed the police—on the next Wednesday I met the prisoner in Grosvenor-road, and gave him into custody—I gave the police<lb></lb>man the money—my mother-in-law gave the other half-crown.</p>

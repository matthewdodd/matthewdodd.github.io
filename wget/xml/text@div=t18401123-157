Field, in Upper Lambeth-marsh—they had an acceptance payable in Ireland, and they asked me how I received such bills—to accommodate them I wrote to the manager of the Provincial Bank of Waterford to receive the bill, and to remit the sum to J. C. and J. Field, Lambeth-marsh—I signed my letter "W. G. Harrison"—on the 22nd of October Field's clerk called at my counting-house—I found they had not received the bill—I after<lb></lb>wards found it had been remitted and directed to me, in Upper Lambeth-marsh, instead of them—in consequence of this I went to Spooner and</p>

G. Harrison' on the bill?"—he said, "No, I wrote 'George Harrison' in full; the gentleman gave me the bill back, and said I was to attach the W to it"—I asked him if his name was Harrison, and he said yes, and that he told them it was—I said, "What did you do with the money?"—he said he gave the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes to Mrs. Harrison; the sovereigns he put in his waistcoat-pocket, that he got tipsy, and lost five of them—he said he had been very sorry ever since, and had been over to Mrs. Harrison last Saturday week, for her to get a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan to make up the money, in case the other party should call for it—I took him into custody—pre<lb></lb>vious to this I went to Harrison, and got this letter there from Mrs. Har<lb></lb>rison—it is a letter which had enclosed the letter of credit—I had not got it in my possession when I went to Pryke—I do not think I said any thing about it.</p>

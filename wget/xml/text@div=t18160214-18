This pistol was in the front shop, which is certainly part of Mr. Manton's dwelling-house. On that pistol being missed, and other things, I, Mr. Manton's clerk, and Mr. Plank, went to the prisoner's lodgings; they were at a baker's, 51, High-street, going down to St. Giles's. When we arrived at 51, we went up stairs, and knocked at the door of a room in that house; no one answered. Our clerk, as well as myself, looked inside, and we saw a key in the door, and the reflection of a fire as well. At last we got into the room. by Plank bursting open the door with his foot. We then found the prisoner at the bar in the room, behind the bed curtains, concealed; he was putting on a shirt at the time. Plank searched him in my presence, and duplicates were found on him. He said he had got the duplicate of the pistol for which we came in search. Plank asked him that questions there was no promise nor threat held out to him, but the contrary. Plank asked him where did you pledge that pistol, where is the duplicate, give it to me, stop a minute, I will give it to you; was his answer. He delivered this duplicate, and afterwards Plank examined him, and found other duplicates.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I accompanied the last witness and Mr. Manton's clerk to the prisoner lodgings. When we went up stairs, there were three rooms, on the floor, and they were all fast, and a key was discovered in one. I called the landlady to see me break it open; I bursted the door open, and found the prisoner concealed behind the curtains. I asked him for the ticket of the pistol he had pledged at Mr. Hulm's, he said he would give it me in a moment; at length he produced some tickets, but not the one I wished. I then put my hand into his pocket, and pulled out a bundle of tickets, and among them was the ticket for the pistol.</p>

It was brought to Mr. Manton's to be repaired; I will swear to the work and to the number; putting the lowest possible value on it, in the state it now is, it is worth ten guineas; I would give ten guineas for it; that one pistol now, would cost twenty five guineas.</p>

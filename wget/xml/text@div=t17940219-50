               <p>At seven o'clock on the 20th of January I missed two pair of shoes out of the window I live in <placeName id="t17940219-50-crimeloc281">Union-street, Westminster</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was your window broke at all? - No, they opened the door and took them out, the door was on the latch. When I came out of my parlour into the shop I observed the door open, it was that that made me look about my shop, and I missed my shoes.</p>
               <p>MOORE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. On Tuesday the 21st of January, I was going into Strutton Ground, and as I was coming back again I saw the two prisoners at the bar, going down Duck-lane, Horton seemed to have something in his pockets, with that I was in a hurry going back I did not watch them then, I went home and came back again to the place, and they were coming up again, and Kelly had a bundle in a blue apron tied up under his left arm; I made a stop, they repassed me by for some considerable distance, I believe it may be an hundred yards, or better, I perceived them look back, I did not turn back, I goes round to Percival into Tothill-street, to desire him to go with me, I left them again after I had watched them for a considerable time, Percival he went with me, we went into the Broad Sanctuary, there we found the prisoners, they were coming into the Broad Sanctuary, they went to pass us and we stopped them, Percival took hold of Horton, and I took hold of Kelly, and took the bun<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190119"></xptr>dle from him and searched him, the bundle was in the apron. I asked him what he had got there? he said an old pair of breeches which he was going to carry to Lambeth to his mother to mend; I opened the bundle, I saw there two pair of slippers in the bundle; Percival was holding both the prisoners while I was searching him, I took them away and locked them up. Percival has had the slippers ever since in his possession. Knowing the marks, I goes to Mr. Langdon to ask him whether they were his? he said, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. At the different times you met these men were they together? - Both together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Horton say any thing about this business at all? - Not to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Horton behind Kelly? - He was as close to him as he could walk.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was this that you saw them? - Between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>- PERCIVAL sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the man was examined? - Yes, I held both prisoners while Moore took the slippers, they were wrapped up in a blue apron with an old pair of breeches; I have kept them ever since. Horton told the magistrate that he and the other were going up Charing Cross, and he picked the slippers up, they were lapped up in two papers, and they picked them up and throwed them into the hamper that was on their jack ass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to Horton before this to induce him to say this? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the examination taken in writing? - Not Horton's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other's? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Langdon. These slippers are my property, here is the mark on the bottom, they are womens slippers, E. L. is stamped with iron on the heels.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Kely. Last Tuesday morning was a month, as I was going up King-street, about half after six, to the best of my recollection, I saw something wrapped up in a piece of paper, and I went to look at it, and I found they were these two pair of shoes, and I chucked them into Horton's hamper; then when I came back I had a pair of breeches and a pair of stockings that I was going to take to my mother to be washed and mended, and I tied them up in the bundle, going along by Westminster Abbey, one of them gentlemen stopped me and took my bundle from me, and searched me and found these two pair of shoes, and took me before the justice. I have been the chief support of my mother and two children ever since my father's death. I never saw the prisoner but once before in my life, nor ever had any acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Horton. As I was going along the church yard; Westminster, going to my work, I saw a mob, and I stopped to see what was the matter, these two men stopped me as I was walking along, and said, I was concerned with this prisoner at the bar, as I was going to my work.</p>

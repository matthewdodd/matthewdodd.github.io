No, there was a gas light there: I am certain it was the same man who took it that gave it to me; he did not appear tipsy; there was nobody else in the court; I pursued him about twenty yards - I believe upon my oath that he is the man.</p>

I saw the prisoner passing with the box on his shoulder, closely pursued by Steele; I saw the prisoner turn back and give him the box and run away; I followed into Birchin-lane, and from there into a court which has no thoroughfare, where he was taken. I think he had been drinking.</p>

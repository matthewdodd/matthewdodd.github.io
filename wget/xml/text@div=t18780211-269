                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On the 15th January I received a warrant for the apprehension of Parker in the name of Warren—on the 16th I went with Marshall to 2, Warren Street, Tottenham Court Road—I saw the two male prisoners let themselves into the house with a latch key—I followed to the top floor front room with Marshall, where I found the four prisoners—I told them all I was a detective, and that I should arrest Parker and Johnson for passing in the name of Warren at No. 6, Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square, and for forging and uttering reference tickets of a <hi rend="italic">Bazaar</hi> paper and thereby obtaining different kinds of property from different persons—I could not read the warrant, for there was a little scuffing, but I told them I had a warrant—Parker said "I know nothing about the name of Warren, I have always had to work hard for my living and you cannot prove anything to the contrary"—Johnson said "I know nothing about the name of Warren, I am a tailor, and these are two young women that we know''—I asked the women if they were married to the men—they said "No"—I said I should arrest them on my own responsibility for being concerned with the men in forging and uttering these tickets—each woman said "I knew there was something wrong, but all I have had to do with it is to pledge the things that have been given to us by the men"—the female Parker said "I have known Parker (meaning Warren) for about eighteen months, I knew him through meet<lb></lb>ing him at a music hall''—I then gave Johnson into the custody of Marshall—I requested Parker to turn out his pockets, he did so—there were a number of old letters and memoranda; amongst them was a letter un<lb></lb>opened bearing the Halifax post-mark of 15th January; it was addressed to Mr. A. Wyld, 125, Drummond Street, Euston Road—that letter I afterwards found to contain a diamond ring—I produce the letter and the ring—I pointed to a cage of canaries in the room and said ''Whose is that?"—the female Parker said "It is mine, I paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—I asked whose cockatoo that was—Stiles said "That is mine," and I asked, pointing to a dead parrot, "Whose is that?"—Stiles said, "That is mine too, and the poor devil died last night"—I afterwards searched the room and found a number of memorandum forms in the name of Charles Warren and corresponding with the two produced, except that there is no writing on them—I also found a number of forged reference tickets in the name of J. Wyld, 125, Drummond Street, Euston Road, and a number in the name of C. Warren, 6, Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square—I also found fourteen pawn tickets in the drawer and in the cupboard, and these four copies of the <hi rend="italic">Bazaar</hi> paper in which a number of advertisements are marked for the sale of everything, from a donkey to a diamond—the writing opposite the advertisements is like the writing on the memoran<lb></lb>dum to Mrs. Watts—I also found a number of letters in a similar hand<lb></lb>writing, some of them relate to the advertisements which are marked.</p>

J. Howden, of 35, Howard Street, Bolton, and will expire in September, 1878—the forged ticket expires in that month, but one is dated 14th, the other 16th—after the prisoners were arrested I received an advertisement for insertion—I communicated with the police—the advertisements were on separate pieces of paper, without any headings, and referred to the sale of canaries—I have received numbers of letters from people in the country in the same writing as these memo<lb></lb>randa, and containing these spurious tickets in nearly all cases—I handed them to Sergeant Andrews—I have not compared them with the adver<lb></lb>tisements.</p>

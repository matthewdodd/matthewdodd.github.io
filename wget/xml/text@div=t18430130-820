                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Good, as linen-drapers, in High-street, Borough. The prisoner was our shopman for nearly two years—in consequence of some circumstances I directed Johnson George, on the 17th of Jan., to mark some copper money—on the 18th a policeman was sent for, and the prisoner's box was searched in my presence, a quantity of copper was found there, and some was marked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Gainsford and Good. On the 17th of Jan., by direction of Mr. Gainsford, I marked six penny-pieces, and about two o'clock placed them on a recess behind where the prisoner was in the habit of serving—about an hour afterwards I missed five of them, and the other one after five o'clock—I saw the copper that was found in the pri<lb></lb>soner's box—the policeman brought it to me from the station—I examined it—among it I found the sixpence which I had previously marked and laid in</p>

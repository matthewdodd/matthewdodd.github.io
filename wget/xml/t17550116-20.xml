I live in Poland-street, Spital-fields; my wife went on Christmas-day to her father's house; on the 1st of January her father came and told me my wife, which was at his house, had lost a dimity gown and a shift; he said he thought the person that stole them was in the house; I went with him; then we challenged the prisoner with taking them, she would not own she had. My wife went out to see if she could find the things, she returned and said, she had found the shift at

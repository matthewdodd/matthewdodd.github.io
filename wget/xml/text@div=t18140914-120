I lost four one-pound notes on the 20th of July, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I had been at the George in St. Martin's-le-grand, at my benefit club; I went into the public-house about nine o'clock; I staid till ten o'clock.</p>

            How came you to lose your notes - A. I met with this young lady, the prisoner. I spoke to her first; she asked me to go with her; I went with her to Mr. Cohen's house, in New-rents; it is a house for the reception of men and women. I was perfectly sober. At Mr. Cohen's I had a glass of shrub; I had five one-pound notes in my pocket-book. I changed a one-pound note there I staid with the prisoner half an hour there; there was nobody else in my company, only the prisoner and me.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the George at ten o'clock; where had you been - A. I went home, and then a friend and me walked about the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been picking up women together - A. We were looking about us; we were returning home when I met the Molloy, my friend, took a woman with him into the house. I went up stairs with the prisoner. Molloy stopped down stairs, waiting for me. I returned down stairs. She came out of the house before me. I paid the people of the house as I was coming out. I felt for my pocket-book, I found my notes were gone. I did not look at my pocketbook before she left me.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was not gone before that time - A. I looked at my pocket-book when I went into the house; I am sure I had four one-pound notes with me. I looked after she; I could not tell which way she went. This was on Tuesday night. I did not see the prisoner until the next Tuesday, a week after, and then at the watchhouse she said if she had so much money she would return it me. She never admitted that she had taken it.</p>

            Were you at this club - A. Yes; I came away at half past ten, and then Vaughn and I walked about the street. When he went into Cohen's, I knew he had five pounds, and as Vaughn came down stairs, he said let me see if my money is right. He examined the pocket-book; the notes were gone. This was between the 19th and 20th of July. The prisoner was not taken till a week afterwards; she then said if she had so much money about her she would return it.</p>

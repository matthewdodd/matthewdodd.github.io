I heard a noise at the front of the house, as if some person was cutting, I went out of the door in Ave Maria Lane, and went under the arch-way, I saw a person at the corner shutter of the front in Stationers'-court; I passed him, and took no notice, and went a little way on, he went about eight or ten yards from the place, when I had passed him, he returned again, and I saw him in the act of cutting the lead with an instrument. He moved<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290040"></xptr>from the place, I followed him into the Lane, I told him he had been doing what he ought not to do, he said, D - you, what do you want of me, he ran down Ave Maria Lane, I ran after him, he was stopped, I never lost sight of him, he was brought into the shop.</p>

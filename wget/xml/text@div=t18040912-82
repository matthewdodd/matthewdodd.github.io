             sworn. - I was with Bishop in Poland-street, and he called to me, and said he was robbed of half a guinea and a shilling; he had got hold of the girl by the hand; I got hold of the other, and we took her down to the watch-house, so that she had not an opportunity of getting her hand into her pocket; we found it in one of her pockets - the half-guinea, the shilling, and some halfpence, and in the other pocket we found half a crown and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bishop.) Look at that money, do you know it? - A. Yes, there is a little circle on one of the shillings, and on the half-guinea there is a little dent about the middle of it.</p>

Please you, my Lord, it is about three weeks ago, it was between five and six o'clock in the evening, I met with a gentleman; he took me to a house in Soho-square, and he made me a present of half a guinea; I met with that young man in the evening about ten o'clock, on Saturday, I was going to buy me something for my Sunday's dinner; the young man followed me, and I happened to have the money in my hand; he said I had robbed him; I am as innocent as a child unborn; that young man asked me to take him home; I told him I was far from home, I could not take him home.</p>

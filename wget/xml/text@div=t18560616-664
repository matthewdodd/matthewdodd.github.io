                  </hi>. I am a confectioner of Brighton, and have a farm at Rusper, near Horsham. On 5th April I advertised, offering some hay for sale, and in answer received this letter—("April 8th, 1856. Sir,—I shall feel obliged by your sending me, at the earliest opportunity, I load of clover hay, and if I approve of same on the receipt of the above, I will forward you a cheque for the amount. J. B. Arnold.")—I sent a load and a half to the Willow-walk station of the Brighten Railway, consigned to J, B. Arnold, on 17th April—previous to that I had seat Mr. Green to London to make inquiries, and had sent samples, and he made a representa<lb></lb>tion to we, in consequence of which I sent up the hay—on 17th April I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir,—I shall be down at Rusper on Thursday next about the middle of the day, when I hope to have the plea<lb></lb>sore of seeing you. Be kind enough to let me have the clover as soon as you can. P.S. Tell me whether I shall send you a cheque, or settle with you when I come down to Rusper.")—three loads of seed had been consigned to the same person; those were the only two lots I had sent—I came up to town on 2nd May, went to No. 8, Arnold s-place, knocked at the door, but found nobody; I satisfied myself that I could not get in, and went next door and inquired—I determined still further to watch, and on 3rd May went again, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning—I could see that some<lb></lb>body had gone into the house in the night, because the curtains were in a different state—I stopped till about 11 o'clock, then rapped at the door, and saw Phillips—I asked him if Mr. Arnold was at home—he said, "No, he has gone to Brighton, he went on Thursday, and is gone for several days, I think"—he wished to know my business, but I walked away, and did not tell him—he seemed confused, came out at the door, and I turned round, and saw him looking after me down the street—I gave information at the station, and went from there to my farm—on 5th May I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir,—Yours I received this morning; I shall feel much obliged by your sending me all the hay you can, between now and Thursday. When I come down to Rusper, I will settle all up. <hi rend="italic">Signed,</hi> J. B. Arnold.")—that was in answer to a letter which I wrote to 3, Arnold's-place, and asked Mr. Green copy—I saw it when it was copied—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—on 6th May I gave information to the police—I watched at the Willow-walk station with A policeman nod Mr. Green—(I had previously sent up four loads and a half of hay)—between 5 and 6 o'clock Gardner came out with a load of hay, and went on the road; he had not got far when another person came out to assist him—we kept back, to see if any man followed him—these two went on a good bit, till they got into the Kent-road, where the two prisoners joined them—they were taken into custody; Gardner was taken also, but was discharged by the Magistrate—I have not received a farthing for the hay.</p>

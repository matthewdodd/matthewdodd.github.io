I received several severe blows on my body; they run away-my hat fell off, and in getting up I picked a hat up, and saw a man running without a hat, in a slanting direction from me, I called out stop thief! he turned into Gower-street - I lost sight of him while he turned the corner, but saw him again immediately; he was stopped in Montague-place, it proved to be the prisoner; I asked him whether the hat that I had, was his; he said, it was; it must have belonged to one of the men who accosted me, it was close by my side. I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN SUMMERS. I am in the 2d Regiment of Life-Guards, I was going up Keppel-street, and heard the rattle sprung and the cry of stop thief! I saw the prisoner running fast down the street without a hat; I met him, he dodged me, I laid hold of him - He said, "let me go, I am not the thief!" I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>RICHARD SMITH. I am a patrol; about half-past nine o'clock, I heard the cry of stop thief! and saw the prisoner running very fast, without a hat, in the middle of the road, just by Montague-place; I followed him - He was stopped in Keppel-street. I never lost sight of him - He claimed the hat.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMART. I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought into the watch-house. He claimed the hat.</p>
               <p>DAVID MYLAND. I am a watchman. I heard the alarm; the prisoner went from the end of Montague-place without a hat. I tried to stop him, but he got from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the scuffle, and went to look at them; one of the men knocked my hat off; I heard the cry and tried to make my escape, to avoid disgrace.</p>
               <p>SMART. The prisoner did not give this account at the watch-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Chelsea, and get my living by labouring. On the 30th of January I lodged in George-street for one night—the house is let out in lodgings for men—I had two sovereigns and a half wrapped up in a piece of paper in my watch pocket—I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock—I do not think the prisoner lives in the house—I had put my trowsen on the top of the bed, over against the wall—one side was close to the wall, and there I put my trowsers—in the morning I saw the prisoner with my trowsen in her hand—I cannot exactly tell the time—it was daylight—I asked her what business she had with them—she said she was going to throw them on the bed, as she saw them on the floor—I do not know whether she slept in the room—there were three or four beds there—I did not get up till near twelve o'clock—I then missed my money—I went out to inquire where she lived—I was two or three hours before I could find out, and they said she was. not at home—I went for a policeman, and saw one just by the Compasses, in Grosvenor-row—I took him to the house, and gave her into custody—the policeman, found one sovereign and a half in her hand, in the piece of paper which they had both been; and she had most of the other sovereign in silver in her pocket—I am sure it was the same piece of paper.</p>

I went and found the prisoner—I have known her before as a common prostitute, for three years, her hus<lb></lb>band is a very respectable man, residing at Chelsea-market, and allows her a maintenance—I found one sovereign and a half in her hand, in this piece of paper—she was so obstinate she would not allow me to search her—a female searched her.</p>

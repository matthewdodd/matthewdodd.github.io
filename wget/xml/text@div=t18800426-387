                  </hi>. I keep a public-house at 32, Harbour Street, Kings<lb></lb>land Road—on Thursday, 16th March, I closed my house as usual and went down in the cellar—at about 11.50 I heard a noise just over my head, went up and looked over the bar, and saw the prisoner lying there—he had his hat and boots off—I asked him what he was doing—he said "Nothing"—I had seen him in the house just before 11 o'clock, in the same part—he was not there when I shut up—nothing was undone—he tried to get out—I shoved him back, and gave him in charge—he was sober—I have seen him in the house before.</p>

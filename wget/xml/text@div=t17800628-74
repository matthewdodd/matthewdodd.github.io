               <p>The Right Honourable Lord FAIRFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I was walking at the bottom of Little Brook-street, New Bond-street, at twelve o'clock at night or rather after; on the 8th of June, three Life-guard men came galloping up Bond-street, enquiring the way to <placeName id="t17800628-74-crimeloc385">Woodstock-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17800628-74-crimeloc385" type="placeName" value="Woodstock-street"></interp>

                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t17800628-74-off383 t17800628-74-crimeloc385"></join>; I pointed them the way, and from curiosity followed them. When I came to Woodstock-street, I found the goods of a house burning in the middle of the street. A life-guard man was making passes with his broad-sword at a man who was hanging out of a window, on the first floor; however he could not touch him. I told him he was a fool for not drawing his pistol. He asked me who I was? I said a friend. He replied then draw your sword, which I did, and having a pocket-pistol in my pocket, I drew that; I cocked it and pulled the trigger at the man who was hanging out of the window. I imagine he saw that, for he sprang into the house again. The pistol missed fire.</p>
               <p>How was he hanging out? - By his hands; it appeared as if he wanted to make his escape by dropping into the area.</p>
               <p>He got in again? - Yes, then the Lifeguard man got off his horse, drew his pistol and went into the house, I followed him immediately, and presently the prisoner Wilson came down stairs to the ground-floor. I observed the partition in the rooms below stairs were entirely broke; every pannel I believe of the wainscoting was broke, and I could perceive Wilson dodge the life-guard man who was presenting a pistol at him, ordering him to surrender, which I suppose he refused, and upon that the life-guard man turned back and went out of the house, as I concluded, to call his comrades, there being two others at the door. The prisoner then came from the back room to the front room; I was left the only person in the passage, and seeing him come forwards, I went towards him and drawing another pistol which I had in my pocket, I presented it at him, and ordered him to surrender, swearing I would shoot him if he refused, upon which he surrendered. I took him by the collar and brought him out of the house, and was going to take him to the house I live in in Hanover-square, where there were some soldiers. I had got him into Blenheim-street, when the people of the neighbourhood cried out to me, For God's sake do not go, there is another man just come out of the house, and you will take him very easily. Upon which I delivered up the prisoner to some friends I had in Blenheim-street, and turned back to look after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280173"></xptr> the other person. Upon enquiry I was informed that he had got into a livery-stable yard, I think it is at the bottom of Woodstock-street. The gates of that yard were locked as well as pallisadoed; there were a great number of people in the place; I asked them for the person who had run there; they sai d he had been there but had made his escape; and then they described him to have his head and his face bloody. Upon turning about I saw a crowd at the top of Blenheim-street, and the people cried out there is the other prisoner. I ran there and saw the man with his face cut. I secured him immediately. That man is the prisoner Rees. I took him, and brought him and Wilson to my house in Hanover-square, from thence I detached a corporal and three men to the Tilt-yard.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it when your lordship, apprehended him? - It was rather on Thursday morning, the watchman had gone twelve.</p>
               <p>At that time the partitions, I think your lordship said, in the house of Schomberg were broke down? - Yes, every part of the house.</p>
               <p>How many persons were in the house when your lordship got there? - The life-guards got there before me, as they rode full gallop. The people told me the mob consisted of from eight to twelve. There were women and children at their doors planet-struck at seeing the devastation that had been made.</p>
               <p>Did your lordship observe any other persons besides the prisoners (either making their escape or in the house) that were seen to have been part of the mob? - Wilson was hanging by his hands no the outside the house; it was imagined the remainder made their escape from the back yard. Having lodged the prisoners I came back and found the trap-door at the top of the house was open, and I suspected they had made their escape that way, and Mr. Schomberg was informed they had escaped.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand your lordship did not see Rees in the house? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You saw Wilson hanging by his hands but did not see any persons in the house at that time? - I imagine there were none.</p>
               <p>What sort of a place was Wilson hanging over, if he had dropped from his hands where would he have fallen to? - Into the area and upon the trooper's broad sword.</p>
               <p>What height might it be from the ground? - I suppose twenty foot; it was from the one-pair-of-stairs room.</p>
               <p>From Wilson. Whether your lordship saw me destroying any part of the goods or house? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Wilson. Or if I had any weapons about me fit to destroy any part of the goods or the house? - He had none.</p>
               <p>Wilson. Whether I was or not much in liquor when his lordship took me? - I believe he was excessively.</p>
               <p>Wilson. If his lordship can be certain that I was the man at the window at that time of night, when it must be dark, and many people were in the house? - There was light enough in the street from the fire of the goods to have lighted all Oxford-street; I could easily distinguish him, and had him in my own house an hour and an half before I dispatched him to the guard-house, and I bound his arms before I sent him away for he was very unruly.</p>
               <p>After he was apprehended was his deportment peaceable or otherwise? - He was very unruly, I was obliged to gag him and tie his hands.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had he any kind of weapon? - None that I saw; I did not examine his pockets.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say to you when you took him? - He said, I had no right to take him; and after he was in my house he swore, By God it was lucky that I had taken him or else that the house, he was then in, should be the next on fire, but he was mad with liquor.</p>

               <p>My lord, I did not go along with the mob there, nor did I see the place broke open; I went accidently there, being in liquor, and followed some people who said there was a fire in that street; just as I got to the door the guards came up. I ran right forward; they were coming that way which I was going, and so they laid hold of me. I was much in liquor, I did not know where I was; the next day they took me down to some house, I cannot say what house it was, or the street it was in; the soldiers began to abuse them; and being in liquor I foolishly said some words to them, which might anger them, upon which they put me in a chair, tied me in it, and there I sat till my lord sent me down.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner ever since he has been in England; he came here in April 1777.</p>
               <p>What countryman is he? - A Scotchman; he was in the army in America and was discharged for a lameness in his arm; he lived as a servant with me, and went on messages, but he was not able to use his arm much; he lived with me till July, 1778, and then he was not discharged from me for any misdemeanour; but his brother took him with a view to teach him the cabinet making business. He lived with his brother a few months, and then went to live with Mr. Petherall, who is a customer of mine, and he used to come backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>What is his character? - A very honest just servant as I would desire to employ; he was quite a stranger to me when I took him, but he behaved so well that I looked upon him as one of my own family.</p>
               <p>Was he a sober man? - Very sober, quiet, and inoffensive, he was not given to quarrelling; if there was a quarrel in the street he never went out amongst them; I never had a more quiet inoffensive servant, and I have had twenty or thirty since I had him.</p>

               <p>Wilson was my servant till he was taken up, from the time he left Mr. Petherall; he came to live with me about a year and an half ago. I have known him three years; seeing his behaviour at Mr. Hollingshed's, I had so great an opinion of him that I took him without a character. I have always marked him for his good behaviour during his being in Mr. Hollingshed's service; I found him the best and most upright servant I ever had in my life. I have been attending here five days to give him a character. I did not consider it as a talk upon me, I thought it was my duty. I have a nephew who has continued to supply his place till he saw the event of this. He said,</p>
               <p>"Don't take a porter, Sir, I will do the business of porter myself till you see the fate of Wilson." If your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury shall think proper to discharge him he shall go directly into my service. I have intrusted him with all that I have except the key of my iron chest.</p>

               <p>Is his arm quite well? - No, it was contracted in his elbow from his childhood; he used to get his bread in his own country in a more reputable manner than being a porter till he was trepanned into his majesty's service.</p>

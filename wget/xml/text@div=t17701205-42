I met the two prisoners; Williams leered a little before he came quite up to me: he took the bundle containing the things mentioned in the indictment, from under my left arm, and put it under his own arm; he did not speak a word, but turned about and went off with my bundle. I had two keys in my hand; I struck him on the face with them; I had my other hand upon the bundle; upon my striking him he let it go, and struck me on the right-side of my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you strike him?</p>
               <p>Gill. Upon the side of his face, very trifling; he tore my cap from my head, and pulled my hair in a dreadful manner. I cried out murder: there were some people gathering potatoes in an adjoining field came out to my assitance, and the prisoners ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was this to the road?</p>
               <p>Gill. The length of a field from the King's road; the men from the potatoe field pursued them, and I went home bare-headed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see either of the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Gill. No, never as I know of; they were taken in a very little time. Taylor stood about three yards from me. At the time Williams robbed me, he passed me, and stood still when about three yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in your bundle?</p>
               <p>Gill. A bed-gown and a flannel waistcoat. The man brought the prisoners to my house soon after I got home; I knew them directly; they said they had never seen me.</p>

            . I was at work in the field, digging up potatoes; I saw the two prisoners about Chelsea common about two o'clock with a girl of the town; they continued there till about half past four, as near as I can guess. We heard the prosecutor cry out, Murder! we jumped over the hedge immediately. They were about two or three hundred yards from us; the prisoner ran away; the prosecutor desired we would pursue them, which two men and I did. We met a boy that told us which way they were gone; we took them just by Chelsea college; they were walking under the trees.</p>
               <p>Q. from Taylor. Did you see us upon the common from half after two to half after four.</p>

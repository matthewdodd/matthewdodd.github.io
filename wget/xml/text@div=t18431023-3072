                  </hi>. I am a gold-refiner, and live in Barbican.

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a chemist and Prussian<lb></lb>blue maker, in Elder-street, Spitalfields—it was formerly the business of my son—he has been dead three years. In Feb. last the prisoner was in my ser<lb></lb>vice, at a salary of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—he had no authority from me to draw bills</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230191"></xptr>
               <p>by procuration in my name—he was not in any way interested in the affairs of my business, except by payment of his salary—I did not give him autho<lb></lb>rity in Feb., or at any time, to draw this bill, or any other, by procuration—I first knew there was such a bill five or six weeks ago from the gentleman who held it—I have never received any proceeds for this bill, either in money or in money's worth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe your concern sustained con<lb></lb>siderable loss just before your son's death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might—I never was in<lb></lb>formed of a loss of 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it never was suggested together—I have occa<lb></lb>sionally drawn on my customers for their accounts, I cannot say how many times since my son's death, but then I endorsed them—my name went to them—the prisoner presented the bills to me, and came for my acceptance, for me to put "E. Hatton and Co." on them—I never authorized him to draw a bill by procuration, nor ever authorised it to be done, I am quite sure—he had the management of this concern—I lived at a distance, but occasionally came there on business—the money was generally sent to me at the end of the week by some one from the factory, or the prisoner brought it himself—the endorsement, "E. Hatton," on this bill—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—is in my hand<lb></lb>writing—this other endorsement is also in my writing—this other one is also, and so is this one—(<hi rend="italic">these were all drawn by procuration by the prisoner</hi>)—this cheque on my bankers is in my handwriting—this signature, "E. Hatton," to this letter, is in my handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner ever draw bills in his own name, for the purpose of carrying on the concern; I mean bills drawn by himself, without mentioning your name at all, in order that he might raise money by discounting these bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till lately—he has done so lately, as I have been given to un<lb></lb>derstand—this is my acceptance to this bill drawn by the prisoner in his own name on the firm—this other one is mine—I did not give him unlimited au<lb></lb>thority to raise money in any way he thought best, for the purpose of carrying on the business, not without my knowledge—I have no recollection of having sworn before the Magistrate, that, except in one instance where I accepted a bill drawn by the prisoner for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was for his own salary, I never accepted a bill in my life drawn by him—I never knew of any others but what my hand went to—I never told the Magistrate that I never accepted a bill drawn by the prisoner, except that one for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his salary—I acknow<lb></lb>ledged there were several other bills, but not by procuration—I never accepted any bill drawn by the prisoner in his own name without I put my hand to it. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I wish you would give me an answer; I want to understand what it is you are prepared to swear; do you mean to deny that you told the Magistrate that you had never accepted a bill drawn by the prisoner oh the firm, except the one for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for salary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I certainly did not say it; not by procuration, the bills are so different—I do not know anything of other bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am speaking of bills drawn by your own clerk, and accepted by you, to get money to carry on the business by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I acknowledge there were three bills of this kind before the Magistrate, of Mr. Sirrell's—they were the first that I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say now, on your oath, that those that I have shown you to-day, which have your own handwriting on them, were not seen by you before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying, till you saw these three, you had no idea that he had ever drawn a bill by procuration on your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never was aware of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever authorize, or were you ever aware that</p>

               <p>the prisoner had drawn, accepted, or issued any bill of exchange for any pur<lb></lb>pose, except that to which, as drawer, indorser, or acceptor, you had put your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Gaviller. On the 7th of June, in the morning, I saw my master bring down the plate; he put it on the sideboard; half a dozen fish-forks, one gravy-spoon, half a dozen table-spoons, and one dozen teaspoons. I put them them into the drawer of the sideboard. A little before three o'clock in the afternoon we missed five table-spoons, a gravy spoon, and a tea-spoon.</p>

            . I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time see the prisoner in the house of Mrs. Prior - A. Yes, on the 11th of June, between four and five in the afternoon. Mr. Prior is a quaker. I saw them in close conversation. I went up and asked what was the matter. The prisoner said Mr. Prior had three spoons of his, and he wanted to keep them. Mr. Prior thought there was some suspicion attached to them. He would not let him have them: he gave them up to me before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the spoons produced by Garrod - A. They are my spoons, and the three produced by Wood are mine. The prisoner told me he sold the other two to a person of the name of Bland. I went to Bland. Bland said he did not buy spoons to keep: he bought them to sell; therefore he took the cypher out. He told me he sold the two tablespoons for twenty-six shillings and sixpence; that would be nearly the value of old silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Bland live - A. In Norton Falgate.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think to be the value of the whole that you lost - A. I do not know; I put them down ten shillings each, the table-spoons, and the tea-spoon one shilling, nominal value.</p>

               <p>JURY. to Wood. When you saw the prisoner at Mr. Prior's did he refer you to any person that had gave him them to pledge - A. No; he claimed them as his own.</p>

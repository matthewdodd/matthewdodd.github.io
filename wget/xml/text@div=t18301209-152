            . This money was mine - there were thirteen penny-pieces, and twenty-two halfpence, which I had put on the counter, in a little shop in <placeName id="t18301209-152-crimeloc864">Essex-street, Battle-bridge</placeName>

On the 15th of November I went out about eight yards from the shop - I saw the prisoner come up the street, and turn into the shop; I stooped down, and saw him draw his hand from the place where the money was - I was going in, and he came out; when he had got a few yards I called Master! he then ran down a street; a person I spoke to ran after him, and gave him in charge of the Policeman - he was brought back, and I asked him to give me my money; he said he would see me d-d first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. By virtue of your oath, who left that money on the table? A. I did - I did not swear that my mother took it out of the till, and left it on the table; I had gone to the next door but one; I did not say I ad left the house in care of a neighbour.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me running? A. No, I was not in that street - I found some paper on you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been employed in a cotton-warehouse, and the gentleman sold me a little soiled cotton - I retailed it about; he used to take half in money and half in goods for it - this was my own money, and I can account for every farthing of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Greenwich—on Thursday, 15th November, I was at work at the Surrey Commercial Docks unloading deals—I left work about nine at night—about twelve I was at Greenwich—I met Louisa Reed at the corner of Bridge Street and stopped a moment to speak to her, and while I was talking to her the prisoner ran up and stabbed me in the neck, saying "<hi rend="italic">Cock</hi> that, <hi rend="italic">Rossy,"</hi> and ran away—I did not see where he came from—I had not had any words with him—I saw a knife in his hand—I did not <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> the blow, but I felt the blood running down—Reed ran after him, and a policeman came up and caught him—I was taken to the Seamen's Hospital, where my wound was attended to—I did not strike the prisoner before he attacked me.</p>

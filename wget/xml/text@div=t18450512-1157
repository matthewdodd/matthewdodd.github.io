                  </hi>. I am stoker on board a steam-boat. On the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 13th of May I was coming home over Tower-hill, about two o'clock—I was sober—I met an elderly woman, who asked if I was good-natured—I said, "Not to give you beer"—she walked away, and the pri<lb></lb>soner came up—I told her to go along, I wanted nothing to do with her—she made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi>, and took my watch out of my pocket—I caught her arm, and she <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> herself on the ground—I held her fast—the witness was coming up, and saw her with the watch in her hand—the guard of the watch had been round my neck—she broke that, and the chain also.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He asked me to go a little way with him, and said he would give me half-a-crown; he then gave me his watch till he got change; he threw me down, and because I would not let him take liberties with me he gave me in charge. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not give her the watch—she dragged it out of my pocket—I said, "You have got my watch," and seized her</p>

                  </hi>. I live in George-street. I was coming over Tower-hill about two o'clock that morning—I saw the prosecutor had the prisoner down, and called for the help of the police—I said, "What have you lost?"—he said his watch—I said, "It is in her hand"—I took it out of the prisoner's hand—the officer came and took it from me.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character, and a witness engaged to take her till she got a situation.)</p>

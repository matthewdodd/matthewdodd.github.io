I am a travelling hawker in the country with ferns—on Tuesday, 8th August, I came with my wife from Reading to Woking<lb></lb>ham, in Berkshire—we then went to Golds' lodging-house, in Denmark Street—the prisoner was not there then, but I went into the town, and when I returned to Gold's lodging-house, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I went into the kitchen, and the prisoner was there with his mistress—I was there during the evening going in and out—I had had a drop of drink, but I was not drunk—Joyce had had some beer, but he was not the worse—neither of us were drunk—there was no quarrel while I was sitting in the kitchen, but the prisoner was <hi rend="italic">jawing about;</hi> he <hi rend="italic">was jawing</hi> with me and the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>—I supposed he wanted to fight—he did mention once or twice that he would fight me or anyone—I told him to hold his tongue, we did not want to have any bother—he is a hawker, I have known him for years—I went out about 6 o'clock, and returned about 10 o'clock, or a few minutes after<lb></lb>wards, and the prisoner and his wife had then gone to bed—my wife and I then went up to bed into the same room where the prisoner and his <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> were in, we were all four to sleep in that room, there were two beds in it—I found the prisoner lying on his bed with his trousers and shirt on, his wife was in bed—I said "Who is that <hi rend="italic">Punch?"</hi>—the prisoner said "Yes "—he is called <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>, I never knew his right name—I said "All right old fellow go to sleep and good luck to you "—he said "You hit me three times three downstairs, and I don't like it"—I had only hit him in play downstairs when he wanted to fight—I said "Come on <hi rend="italic">Punch,"</hi> and hit him with my open hand—he said "<hi rend="italic">No</hi>, we don't want to fight," and laughed and said "Then stand some beer"—I said "I will stand a bushel if you like that was upstairs—when he said "You hit me three times three, and I don't like it," I said "Go to sleep and settle it in the morning if there is any<lb></lb>thing the matter"—I was in bed then, I only had my trousers and waist<lb></lb>coat to pull off, my shoes were undone—my mistress said "What do you want to quarrel with him for <hi rend="italic">V</hi> and then the two women began to quarrel, and his mistress scrambled out of bed and tore my mistress down, who had not got her clothes off, it took her longer to go to bed than me, and she was standing in the room getting her clothes off—the prisoner then jumped out of bed and set-to and hit her—there was a little light in the room when we first went up, but it was down low and it went out—when the prisoner attacked my wife I got out of bed and caught hold of him and pulled him back, and then there was a general fight; he turned round to me directly I caught hold of him and began fighting, and we closed together <hi rend="italic">scrambling</hi>,</p>

"<hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>, is that you?" he said "Yes "—Headland said "Good-night, and good luck to you "—<hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> said "You struck me"—Headland said "Don't you like it?"and they began again, but I cannot tell who struck the first blow because I was not inside the room—I heard the prisoner cry "Don't Peter, don't," and then there</p>

               <p>was silence again—I asked my husband to go in and quiet them as we were the only sober people in the house, but he said "Never mind, they—can't hurt one another on the bed"—the two women then began, they were—scuffling, and Headland directly got up and a scuffling began between the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> men but I did not see anything—I heard Peter say "I am stabbed"—the prisoner said "Perhaps I have," and then he said "I have, I have, I have "—I told my husband to light a light and stop him from going down, if he had done such a thing, and I went into the room and bound Peter's throat up with an apron—I did not see what became of the prisoner, the constable and the doctor came into the room—I saw Headland's throat, he was holding it with his thumb and finger, and when I came with a light he asked me to look at it—I thought his head was off and I bound his wife's apron round it—I was very timid, there was no one left in the room but me and him.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Wokingham—on Tuesday night, 8th August about 11.30, I was sent for to Gold's lodging-house and found Headland lying on a bed—his throat was very much cut from the centre of the windpipe up to the left ear; it was a long incised wound, extending between 4 and 5 inches; it was very deep; it had slipped over the windpipe, but it got slighter as it got nearer the ear; that was where the knife would come out—he had lost a great quantity of blood before my arrival—the cut escaped the windpipe, owing to the flabby state of the skin, but it had struck it; the looseness of the skin prevented further injury—there was a wound about 4 inches long on his left arm half way between his elbow and shoulder—I sewed up his throat and arm—he would not neces<lb></lb>sarily have lost his life if the windpipe had been cut, but it would have been dangerous to life—the cut was near the carotid artery—the injuries could have been inflicted with this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), there was blood on it when I first saw it, some of which was wet—the cut began from the centre of the throat and went to the side upwards; it appeared to be a stab to the throat and then to be drawn outwards—I saw the knife about 11 o'clock, Superin<lb></lb>tendent Millard showed it to me with blood on the handle principally, but. there was some on the blade.</p>

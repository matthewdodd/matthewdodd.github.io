               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. The prosecutor was drunk? A. Yes, and did not know what he was doing - some of his buttons were undone, and somebody had certainly been there for the purpose they stated; I will not swear their hands were in his pockets, but they were about them - they were not assisting to button up his braces; I do not consider that it was their duty to assist him, there were plenty of Police about; I found nothing on Brown - I found a towel and handkerchief in Spry's hat: Jones did not claim them - there is a gas lamp in the court.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know that you had a shilling and sixpence in the same pocket? A. I am not positive; I believe I had eased myself in the court - the money might have come from the pocket while doing so; I had been to the Crown-tavern, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Spry's Defence. As we were in St. John-street, the prosecutor came up, put his arms round our necks, and asked where we were going; we asked if we should see him home - he said Yes; he said he wanted to ease himself - we took him up a turning; he fell down - England came up the court, and brought the Police; the prosecutor said he believed the handkerchief was his - the Magistrate asked for the cap, and they said it was at the station, but it could not be found.</p>

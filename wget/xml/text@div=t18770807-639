                  </hi>. I am employed as a clerk, and live at King's Cross Road police-station—my brother is an inspector of police, G Division—on 16th June I went to 153, Fleet Street, and ascended to the top storey, where I found Estrabrook carrying on the business of a photographer—I had my like<lb></lb>ness taken—Baker was in the room—I had known him before by working with him at Crosse and Black well's, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Soho Square, about two years ago—when my photograph was finished Baker said he could show a better photo than mine and took from his breast pocket these two pictures, which he called "The Champagne Supper"—Estrabrook was in the room and saw Baker show the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On 14th July I received a warrant from Sir Thomas Dakin to take the prisoners in custody and to search the place at 153, Fleet Street, which I did in company with Taylor, of the City police and Inspector Latter—Baker was on the second floor when I went up, and I called him out and followed Estrabrook up, who was going up in front of me—when we got to the studio I told Estrabrook we were police officers—I said "I have a warrant to arrest you both, also another which authorises me to search these rooms"—I produced the warrants and read them both to them—they made no reply—Baker was then in his shirt<lb></lb>sleeves—I directed Latter and Taylor to go downstairs with him to get his coat, which they did; whilst they were gone Estrabrook seemed very over<lb></lb>come, and he said "I am guilty of this 1"—I said "Now, I suppose you have got some of these negatives—you will save time if you get them"—He got up and was about to go his bedroom; I followed and said "I mean The Champagne Supper,' and 'The Four Ages'"—I went into the front room and be went to a cupboard, and amongst others he produced this negative of "The Champagne Supper"(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said "I want 'The Four Ages'"—he said he would give it me, and he went again to the same cupboard, and from another shelf produced a lot of negatives, amongst them this "The Four Ages "(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—by that time Baker had returned, and they were afterwards conveyed to the station by Latter and Taylor, and we then returned in company with Inspector Peel and searched the premises—I counted the negatives and Peel ticked them off—there were 150, all more or less obscene, some very bad—there were 375 actual printed photo<lb></lb>graphs—the negative produced is a very fair specimen, as also the corres<lb></lb>ponding print—there is a negative also of this print but I have not got it—these twenty or thirty prints are specimens.</p>

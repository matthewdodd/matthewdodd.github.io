                  </hi>. I live in Lambeth. On Sunday, 29th March, I was in Victoria Street, Westminster, about 10 o'clock at night—I was walking towards Westminster, to turn down the Abbey Yard, to go home—the prisoner came up to me and began to talk; she asked me to go home with her—I refused, and pushed her away—she followed me into the Abbey Yard—I said, "It is no use your following me, I won't go home with you"—I felt my watch taken, and felt the guard broken—I accused her of stealing it—it was worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she began to throw herself about—I took hold of her, and endeavoured to get my watch—she bit my arm through—I called for a policeman—I was sober—a policeman came and took the prisoner on the spot—going to the station another policeman came up, and on the way the prisoner called to three women on the other side of the way—she called some name; I could not say what name—this is my watch.</p>

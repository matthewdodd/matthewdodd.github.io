             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Monkwell-street, on the 27th of February, my house was broke open, the house was secured in every part of it, the evening of the 26th; I make a practice of examining it myself; I went to bed about eleven, I am always last up, we have a light to the stair-case, and I saw through that window the next morning, that something was the matter; I then went into the kitchen, and my servant told me I had been robbed; in the kitchen we have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060100"></xptr> closet, which has a sink and cistern in it, I perceived the lead light of that closet was taken out; I then went to the kitchen window and looked through it, and saw a ladder, like a lamp-lighters ladder, was left standing on the dust bin, which reached up to a window; the kitchen is up one pair of stairs, it was a lamp-lighter's ladder, it had not been there before; in looking further out of the kitchen window, I saw upon a little ledge, under the kitchen window, the iron bar laying which the light had been tied to; I then saw we had been robbed of a great quantity of plate, some of the plate stood upon a shelf in this closet, in the kitchen, it was kept for common use; and out of the dining room, a great many articles were lost, and my servant told me there was a bit of candle and a glove left on the dresser in the kitchen; my maid gave me a glove, which, she said, was found in the kitchen the next morning after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any of your plate recovered? - None at all.</p>
               <p>How did the suspicion fall on the prisoner? - From the circumstance of the robbery, it appeared that it must be done by some person well acquainted with the house; in the manner of getting into my next door neighbour's yard, as the readiest access to my yard; the prisoner was my apprentice, he served seven years with me, he had been gone from me, and last summer I took him into my house to work for me, he left my service about the 18th of December.</p>
               <p>Court. State more particularly, but confining yourself to what you know of your own knowledge, what led you to suspect the prisoner, and how the prisoner came to be taken up for the robbery? - I suspected him for several reasons, it appeared it must be done by somebody well acquainted with the house, for I had a very sharp dog, and it must be somebody that knew the dog, upon that suspicion I had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Was he searched then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was found upon him? - There was a right-hand glove found upon him in his pocket, which corresponded with the left hand glove that was found in my house; I saw the left hand glove in the kitchen, my maid servant gave it me.</p>
               <p>When did she give it you? - On Sunday.</p>
               <p>Was any thing else found upon him that led to a suspicion? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself on his examination? - He denied all knowledge of the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long after was he apprehended? - On the Tuesday fortnight following.</p>
               <p>In the intermediate space of time, had you caused any body else to be apprehended for this offence? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Dean? - Yes, he worked journeyman with me at the same time.</p>
               <p>Was Dean never taken up? - Not to my knowledge, I never heard it, nor of his being examined.</p>
               <p>Had you a journeyman of the name of Bird? - Yes, he is not with me now.</p>
               <p>What is become of Bird? - I really do not know, he is out of employ; I discharged him about that time.</p>
               <p>Did not you discharge him from some suspicion of his being concerned in this business? - No.</p>
               <p>Had he any hand in procuring the prisoner to be apprehended? - Oh yes! I told him, and another man, that if they would apprehend him, I would give them five guineas.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the glove was found? - Yes, I was at the office when it was found.</p>

               <p>What sort of a man is Bird, as to his general character? - I looked upon him to be an honest sober man.</p>
               <p>What did you part with him for? - I had no suspicion of his dishonesty.</p>
               <p>What family has he? - I believe he is a single man.</p>

            . I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and live in Chiswell-street. I was sent for to see this child, which was between a fortnight and a month old- it was dead; I saw it on the day the accident happened - I examined the body; the death appeared to me to be occasioned by the passage of air into the lungs being obstructed - the mother pressing the child, without intending any hurt, might occasion the death; I could see no mark of violence whatever - I saw nothing to induce me to believe the child had received any external injury to occasion its suffocatin; the passage of the air might be obstructed by very gentle pressure.</p>

            , M. D. I live in New Basinghall-street. I saw the body of the child on the 1st of January; it had been dead three or four days; there was no mark of external violence - I suppose its death to have been occasioned by respiration being stopped, by pressure of some kind; it might he stopped by unintentional pressure: if the mother was struggling with any body, it might be occasioned by pressure on the chest; I saw no marks whatever of violence - if it had been the pressure of a hard substance, such as wood, the child's body would have exhibited some marks.</p>

            . I am the father of the child - it was not christened On Thursday night, the 27th of December, the day after boxing-day, a little after one o'clock, my wife came after me - I had been at a public-house with some friends - I went there a little after nine; we left the Mail Coach public-house, Camomile-street, at twelve o'clock, and went to another, a quarter of a mile farther; we went to have a parting glass at Mr. Purcell's house - we had something to drink at another public-house before - the doors of the house were closed; I do not know how many yards his house was from the other; the second public-house was the Gully-hole - we knocked, but we could not get in; we drank at another, Tomkins', in Widegate-alley - I think that was about half a mile, or a quarter of a mile, from the one we had left; I was not drunk - the clock had struck nine, I think, when I went into the first house; I cannot swear it - we did not stay five minutes at that public-house; we had some more gin there - my wife, with the child, had been with me all the evening - she came to me at the Mail Coach, about five minutes after nine; the prisoner's house was shut - I did not attempt to force the door-way in - I knocked, and we were admitted; I asked the prisoner to draw us some liquor - he looked in our faces, and said he would not draw it; there were others drinking there - he took a young man who was with me by the collar, and shoved him out - he went to turn me out; I said, "Open the door, and I will walk out;" he shut the door after I was out - he shut my wife in; I called her out, and knocked to know if he was going to let her out; the door was opened to let her out, and closed upon her; I will swear that I was not making a rush at the door to endeavour to get it open - I was not drunk at all; I had not been at work that day - I was walking about, looking for work in the early part of the day; as soon as my wife got to the door it was jammed on her, and the child.</p>

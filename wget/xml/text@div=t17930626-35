            , the prisoner, brought the horse to my door to sell, in Whitechapel-road side, on Thursday the 13th of June, to the best of my remembrance, he asked me seven Guineas for it; I told him it was too much money; and he told me that it belonged to a man and that he wanted to part from it sadly, he did not know what to do with it; with that I told him to go to the man, and if he could buy it for me for four guineas, I would give him half a crown for himself; with that I suppose he was gone as much as an hour, or an hour and a half, to the best of my remembrance, with that he came back, and told me I might have the horse at that price that was bid; with that I found the horse very lame; after I had it, I thought the horse would not suit me, being so lame, I took it to Smithfield on Friday, when Mr. Matthews owned it; the horse was detained up against one of the rails, and somebody came up to me, and said that my horse was stopped, that it was stole; I ran up immediately and said, if he would swear it was his horse, before a magistrate, he should have it; with that I desired the horse to be put up at livery; and Mr. Matthews and his friends went to the Bull and Butcher, in Smithfield, while I went to Whitechapel and took this Andrew Crawford going into his own door.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he sold you the horse was he known to you, or was he a stranger? - I knew him very well by being about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where to find him? - did not know justly at the time, but I was directed when I went after him from one Mr. Meads, the Red Lyon. I asked him how he came by the horse? he told me, as I said before, that he had it to sell for a man; I asked him what the man was? he told me that he was something of a travelling drover, or something of that kind, to the best of my remembrance; with that we went to Smithfield, and there several gentlemen questioned him there, and there they told him if he could not make no better story then that, they thought bad would come of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This horse was sold to you in broad day-light? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him perfectly well by eye-sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that he was a horse-jobber? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, was it worth more than what you gave for it? - I had it at Smithfield, and there I was bid four guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You live in the neighbourhood where the man resides? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if he had stole the horse he could not have come to a worse neighbourhood to conceal it? - That is what I have said all along.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you at the first time, long before there was any suspicion, that the horse was not his, but he sold it for another man? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260048"></xptr>Q. He twice exposed himself to your view in the business? - He did, he left the horse along with me sometime, and I told him that I bought it for another young man, and he did not like it, and so I took it for myself; he wished me to put the horse in the stable the first time he came, till he came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at this bill? - I have seen it; they were distributed by the prisoner's wife in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you, Mr. Allen, supposing you had a stolen horse in your possession, could you take better steps than this man has taken? - I took all the pains I could to find the man that he said he bought the horse of, one

               <p>Q. Do you know how he used to get his living? - I cannot say; I am always out from morning to night; I know nothing of him only as a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day on which he was taken up? - On Friday the 11th, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he was on the Friday proceeding that Friday? - He was at home in his apartments between nine and ten.</p>

How long had you been at home before you saw the prisoner on that evening? - I had been out about an hour; he had been out and came in again; he went out, and came in again about half after nine, as near as I can guess; between seven and eight I first saw him at my house and he went out for about an hour, as near as I can guess, and then he came home, and went to bed; at ten o'clock I went to bed; I went to his room and asked if all were in bed? and then I went to bed; he slept level with the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fastened the door of your house? - I did myself; it was fastened with a double lock and two bolts; I left the key in the door; the room that I sleep in is close by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you fastened the door was the prisoner in his room or not? - He was in his room, for I bid him good night, and likewise his wife.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lock him in his own room? - I had no business to do that; he fastened his own door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the door when you got up in the morning? - I found it safe as when I left it at night.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time in the morning was it you got up? - About a quarter before seven, as near as I can guess; I found the door locked and bolted the same way precisely as I left it.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it was between seven and eight you saw him on that Friday? - I always leave work at seven o'clock, and when I leave work I go home.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect you saw him on Friday more than any other day? - Because being in his appartment.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was that day? - By his being taken up the week following, I asked him what he owed for rent? and wrote out a receipt for him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up? - The 14th I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know the day by the rent? - It was agreed with him to pay me so much a week for the room, and I asked him for the money on the 7th of this month.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Fore-street, Cripplegate; I am a shoemaker, I know Crawford, I have worked for him this four or five years.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you tell us what you know about the affair of the horse for which the man was taken up? - There was a relation of mine who wanted to buy a horse, I applied to Mr. Crawford as a horse-dealer for one about three weeks ago; I believe it was a Thursday, I am not quite positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long before he was taken up? - That I cannot tell, to the best of my knowledge it was a Thursday, I believe three weeks to day, but I am not certain. A relation wanted to buy a horse, I applied to Mr. Crawford, he told me that he thought he had got a horse that would suit him; I met him afterwards at the time appointed, just at the Adam and Eve, Tottenham-court-road, with my acquaintance; my acquaintance said he should like to see how the horse would go; the prisoner had the horse there; while this was going forward a person came up to the prisoner at the bar, and said, that he wanted to sell a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time this person mentioned he wanted to sell a horse, do you recollect whether that person was on a horse? - He was, and it was a black one I believe, but I am not much conversant in horses. The prisoner said that he had a horse of his own to sell, and therefore he declined buying of it. The man I did not know, but they seemed to know each other, then the man said I wish you would sell this horse for me, then the prisoner said, what money do you expect for it; he said, he should expect five guineas for the horse, but says he, if you cannot get that, sell it for what you can get for it; the prisoner took the horse from the man and the man went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years have you known this man? - About four years.</p>
               <p>Q. From the length of time you have known him what character has he borne as to honesty? - He always paid me very honest, I never heard any thing till this happened.</p>

               <p>Court. You say this was three weeks ago? - It was, to the best of my knowledge on a Thursday.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260052"></xptr>Q. Then that is about the 6th of June? - It was the beginning of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your livelihood? - By shoe making.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a master or a journeyman? - I have been a master for many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you ascertain the time better? - No, I cannot, I believe it was on a Thursday, but I cannot say better than that.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. I think you said that it was of a Friday morning that you turned him out? - Yes, and I saw him again on Friday afternoon, but I cannot tell exactly what time of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court to Thomas. How long have you lived in Fore-street? - About seven years, and have kept the house as long.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your next door neighbour? - Mr. Walker, the Green Dragon is on one side; I live in three Mariner-court; Bodel a cheesemonger, lives on the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this man come on the horse and ask the prisoner at the bar to sell the horse for him, did you hear nothing about where he was to meet him to pay him the money? - No, no such a thing passed in my hearing.</p>

               <p>Court to Thomas. Did the prisoner and the man that came up to him on the black horse, appear to know each other? - They did, they appeared to know each other very well.</p>

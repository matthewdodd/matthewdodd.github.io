                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Kay, of Kensington. The prisoner was his pot-man up to 15th Aug.—I had missed a key of the till about a month ago, while he was in our service, and I had got another key—I did not have the lock altered—I missed money from the till, and charged the prisoner with robbing it—he denied it—on the Saturday night before I went before the Magistrate, I put a sovereign and a half into a canvas bag, which I put into the far end of the till, and locked it with the key that I still kept—on the Tuesday or Wednesday I missed it—I had kept the key myself—after that I discharged the prisoner—on 17th Aug., the morning I went before the Magistrate, I spoke to a constable, and while I was speaking the prisoner came up—I asked him if he would give up that key that he had access to my till with—he said he had not got any key—the policeman asked him to show what he had got in his pockets, and he pulled out some tickets belonging to me, copper tickets which my husband gives to workmen—I knew them—the prisoner said that Kelly and two other men had each given him one—he had six, and he accounted only for three—he used to receive the tickets from the men for beer—when they were brought to me I used to keep them in the same till from which I lost the bag—I saw the bag at the station—this is it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 198). I was called by Mrs. Kay on the morning of 17th Aug.—while I was speaking to her the prisoner came up—she said, "I have missed a key; I should like to have my pot-man searched"—she said to him, "Unless you give me that key, I will gire you into cus<lb></lb>tody"—he said, "I have none"—I said, "Well, turn out your pockets," and he pulled out these tickets—I found on him this canvas bag, and a sovereign and a half in it, a shilling, a sixpence, and a fourpenny-piece—when the bag was found, he said to Mrs. Kay, "I suppose you will say that is yours too."</p>

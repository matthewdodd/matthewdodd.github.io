                  </hi>. I live in Brook-street, Ratcliff. I know the prisoner—I hung a black and white cotton gown out to dry on Thursday, the 5th of May—I saw it safe at about a quarter to nine o'clock—I misted it after<lb></lb>wards—I have not found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer. About a quarter-peat nine o'clock that evening, I saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. Allison's yard with a dark cotton gown, and walk into the next house—I watched him—he tried to tie it up in a bundle, but somebody coming down stairs he could not—I knew him before, and knew him to be a bad character—he came out of the house and passed me with a piece of the gown banging out, and went into a court—I stopped him and said, "Little, you have got Mrs. Allison's gown"—he said a very bed word, and a friend who was with him ran away with the bundle, and has not been taken since—there was a wet sheet and shirt in the bundle also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had no gown or bundle. He said, "You had better bring the old woman's gown back." I said, "What gown?" he said at Wor<lb></lb>ship-street he did not know it was a gown. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I saw t piece of the gown as he passed my window hanging out of the handkerchief—this was at a quarter-past nine o'clock at night, but it was right under the gas-light—I could not swear to the pattern of the gown—I knew the gown well—the prosecutrix is my mother-in-law—I have had no quarrel with the pri<lb></lb>soner—I would have employed him before this.</p>

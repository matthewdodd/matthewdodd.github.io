I know the prisoner, his father lodged in my house about a twelvemonth, and he occasionally came to see him; he came on the 14th of October and asked for his father - I said I did not know where he was (he lodged with me then); he went out of the shop, returned in a few minutes, and said he had seen his father, who would give him nothing, and he must have something; I said I had nothing to give him, his father's affairs were nothing to me; his father is a carpenter, and the prisoner sells fish about; he hastened round the counter, stood there a minute or two, then turned round and said, I deserved all I should meet with for marrying his old father - I said we were not married; we do not cohabit together; he then took the bread and cheese off the shelf and walked out with it - he returned in five or six minutes in his shirt sleeves, and said he was ready for any one I could find, and if he was there, he would throw him into the river: I have trusted his father with bread.</p>

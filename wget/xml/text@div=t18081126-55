               <p>Q. Had you any thing in pawn at Mr. Murray's - A. Yes; on the 8th of this month, between eight and nine, I went to Mr. Murray's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before this, with other things, pawned your husband's shirt - A. I had pawned it by itself.</p>
               <p>Q. You had pawned that and other articles - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to redeem these articles out of pawn on Saturday night - A. Yes, and then according as I paid the pawnbroker, Mr. Murray, he laid them on the counter for me; I saw him lay the shirt on the counter; I took them up, I did not count them; I swept them off the counter into my apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you swept the shirt into your apron along with the rest - A. I do not know; I went out a distance from the door; I missed the shirt about twenty or thirty yards distance from the door; there was a woman along with me, I sent her back to know whether I had left the shirt behind me or not; I went home and searched the things that I had in my apron, I could not find the shirt; I returned to Mr. Murray and enquired whether I had left the shirt there; he said no. When I was in Mr. Murray's shop and took the things out, the prisoner was in the shop and stood close by me; I asked Mr. Murray who this woman was; he told me her name was

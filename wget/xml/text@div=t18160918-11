            . I live at No. 16, Frederick place, Hampstead Road. I know the prosecutor, who has been examined here. I know his handwriting and I have seen him write. I look at the signature to this promissory note, and say I believe it not to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDEREWS. I am a cabinet-maker; I have been living two years opposite to St. James's Chapel; I don't keep a shop there; I am a journeyman, living in a private house; not a house of my own; I am a lodger; I work for Mr. Osborne, in Tottenham-court-road; he does not keep a broker's shop; he keeps an upholsterer's; there are very few old goods; he sometimes has old goods; he does not often buy goods at sales. I have worked for him a year and a quarter; I will not swear that he does not sometimes deal both in new and old goods; I work as a cabinet-maker for my bread; that is all. I have known Mr. Crisp fifteen or sixteen years; he has generally resided at Yarmouth. I once lived at Yarmouth, I corresponded with him; I can't tell how often; oftener perhaps than once a year; perhaps oftener than twice a year, I can't speak exactly. I have not got all the letters, nor any of them. I kept them a certain time; I did not look to see if I had any of them before I came out. I lived at Yarmouth until the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How often within these fifteen years have you corresponded with him - A. By letter, note, and doing business with him always.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times may he have written to you A. I can't say how often; more than three or four times; I have bad at least as many letters of his as that; perhaps not more. I can't say exactly within what time last past, but within the last two years, I may have received three; one of which have I preserved. I can't say exactly where Crisp first told make should want me as a witness to disprove this hand-writing. Upon my word, I don't know when he first came to me. That is the best account I can give of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Within how many months or weeks last past did he come to you to tell you he should want you as a witness - A. I think it was about last Christmas time; it is so long back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take you any where along with him - A.Not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you what he wanted with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon your oath, did you not tell him, it is no use calling upon me Mr. Crisp, I do not know your hand-writing - A. I never told him such a thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you meet him - A. I met him at the Prince of Wales.</p>
               <p>Q.By accident - A. Yes, by accident. </p>
               <p>Q. How near is that to your house - A. I lodge at the Prince of Wales.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not tell us that you lodged at a private house - A. Why, it is not a shop.</p>
               <p>Q.But in as much as you said it was a private house, and you now say it is a public-house; reconcile those two accounts if you can? - </p>
               <p>Q.Then you cannot give us any other account of it - A. No; it is a public-house, the landlord's name is Bees; I believe he is a married man; I am not sure of that; there is a person there who officiates as his wife. This application was made about Christmas. The next time when I saw Crisp again, was when he came up to Town about this business again; I don't know when it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not bring papers and specimens of writing to you - A. Yes, he brought banker's checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not produce specimens of his handwriting at your request, because you could not undertake to prove his hand-writing - A. No; he did not. These checks were signed by the name of Crisp: I believe this was better than six months ago; he did not produce them upon my expressing a desire for his doing so; nor upon my telling him that I could not swear to his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did he produce them, for what reason - A. I don't know; he gave no particular reason.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ALLEY. I do not derive my information of this being or not being his hand-writing from those checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say it is not his, handwriting from any other circumstance - A. Oh dear yes; I had a sufficient knowledge of his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. If you knew his hand-writing, for what possible use could he have produced those checks to you - A.He did not produce them to me in particular; but to several other persons.</p>
               <p>Q. But what did he say - A.He shewed them I believe to shew that the writing corresponded, and I was to see it amongst the rest. I don't know that he put it down by me in particular; I can't recollect at the present time what was said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he should want you as a witness - A. He asked me if I was sufficiently acquainted with his hand-writing to swear to it; and I told him, I was, and he afterwards shewed me these checks. I can't recollect the names of all the persons who were present when these checks were produced, but I believe Mr. Smallman and Mr. Loddy; I don't recollect any body else.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY BLACKHURNE. I live at Yarmouth. I am acquainted with the prosecutor, Mr. Crisp; I have known him seven years; I have had frequent opportunities of becoming acquainted with his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill, and tell me if you believe it to be his hand writing - A. On my oath I believe it is not; I think there is no similarity; I have seen him write repeatedly.</p>

I look at this bill, it has not the slightest likeness to his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I was never at the Prince of Wales public-house. He first came to tell me I would be of use in January; he did not show me anything; I am positive of that; I think Capt. Shepperd was present. He came to my house, and he asked me if I should know his hand writing, I said I should; he asked me if I had any bills of his, and I replied I believed I had. I had seen some of them frequently, and I have looked at them and my receipts since that.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you would not swear that you believed this was not his hand writing, unless you looked at the bills and receipts by yours - A. Yes I would.</p>

            . I was the attorney for the prisoner at the bar. In the action which he brought against Mr. Crisp, he delivered to me the bill upon which I brought that action; he delivered to me that bill at Chancery Chambers; they are in the County of Middlesex. (The forged bill put into the hands of the witness) I cannot say anything to this bill. The action I brought was upon a bill for a similar amount; this looks like it but I will not swear positively to it. I don't know it because there is same writing on it since I had it. I will not positively swear at this is the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you still upon the rolls - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you doubt that too - A. No, but the bill upon which I brought the action had no such writing as there appears upon th1s.</p>
               <p>Q.It does not purport to have had that writing on before the action was brought but that hand writing appears to be the writing of Mr. Smith the officer of my Lord Ellenborough - A. And that makes the doubt.</p>
               <p>Q.That writing must have been put on subsequent to the bringing of the action. Suppose it was not on, is that the bill you brought the action on; and if it be, when and from whom did you receive it - A.

I was at home at the time. I found them afterwards upon the prisoner. On the morning of the 18th of April the prisoner came to me; he said he had been in a French prison; he was in great distress. I gave him a breakfast, and after breakfast he said he was very tired, he wanted to lie down. I permitted him to lie down in my house. I had got to go about half after twelve o'clock, and when I came home he was coming down stairs again; he asked me to give him some beer. I gave him some. I thought he looked rather bigger than when he came in by bulk. I stopped him, and searched him; I found on him a jacket, waistcoat, a pair of breeches, and a silk handkerchief. The breeches belonged to me; the other things to a lodger of mine; they were left in my care. I gave him in the charge of Turnbridge.</p>
               <p>JOHN TURNBRIDGE. I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner. Mr. Riley gave me a handkerchief, jacket, and waistcoat. I searched him; I found the waistcoat and black breeches on him, under his trowsers, and the shirt he had on his person. I know it to be false about his coming out of a French prison; I know his person well before, and I have seen him in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did come from a French prison. I came down the street groggy; this gentleman took me in. I have been eighteen years and eleven days in His Majesty's service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a tobacconist, and live at Bridge-house-place, Newington, Surrey. Stainer came to our shop on the 14th of April, for 1/4<hi rend="italic">oz</hi>. of tobacco—it came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a sixpence—I had not change enough—he said he would have 1/2<hi rend="italic">oz</hi>.—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and took his sixpence, and laid it at the corner of the till—Langley then came in—I took the till out, and showed him the sixpence—it was a bad one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Budden, who keeps the Rose. I saw Stainer about five o'clock, on the 14th of April—he offered me a sixpence—I just laid it in the till—there were other sixpences there—the officer came in at one door as the prisoner went out—he asked me for it—I had just laid the sixpence out of my fingers—I gave it him—I am sure it was the same sixpence—it was just in one corner of the till—I had not lost sight of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is yours a till that draws out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we put the money through a notch in the counter—when I drew it out I saw a good deal of silver in the till—I had just laid the sixpence out of my hand when the officer came, but not out of my sight—all the silver was in my sight, and that among the rest.</p>

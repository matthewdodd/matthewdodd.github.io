He came into my room on Wednesday, and asked what o'clock it was; I said I did not know, for my watch was not going, and that I wanted to sell it; he asked what I wanted for it - I said 26s.; he said it was worth that, and he would buy it: he asked if I would let him have it, to see how it went; I refused: he asked if I would let him take it to a watch-maker, and he would pay me for it on Saturday - I was not willing; he said I need not be afraid, he would return it next night - he, accordingly, took it into his bed-room; next morning I found he was gone, and the watch also - I found it at the pawnbroker's; I also lost four shirts, a table-cloth, and towel.</p>

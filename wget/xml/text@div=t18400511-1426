                  </hi>. I live at Chalfont St. Peter's, near Uxbridge. In January I was carman to Mr. Richard Hatch, and on the 10th of January I went to town with the prisoner Hazell, with a load and a half of hay—master allowed me two trusses of hay to feed the horses with—we took two that journey for the horses—on coming back we stopped at the Coach and Horses public-house at Ealing, about two o'clock in the day, and put the horses in, that they should have their hay which my master allowed—went into the public-house to have a pint of beer, and while there I saw Hazell take a truss of hay off the wagon, and carry it into the stable to Shackell—I went to the stable on purpose to untie the truss of hay to give the horses some—Shackell prevented me from touching it, and said, "That is my hay"—I said, "How came it your hay?"—he said, "I have bought that truss of hay of John Hazell"—I went and fetched Hazell to Shackell, and said, "Hazell, have you sold this truss of hay?"—he said, "Yes, it is all right"—while I was talking to him, Shackell took the hay up and carried it from that stable to another—I said, "We have got nothing to feed the horses, I shall put them to and get on the road home"—I did so, and went back to Chalfont—the horses seemed distressed before they got home for want of it—as we went home Hazell said the horses looked thin—that was the first time I had gone to town with the wagon—I left Mr. Hatch's employ the last day of March—I came back on the 18th of April—I did not tell him of this, as he did not ask me about it when I came back—I went up with the wagon the next week, and six or seven weeks after—I knew this was not right.</p>

I received some blows - there was evidently a gang of them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at the corner of Redcross-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief!- I immediately crossed over to the corner of Golden-lane, and caught hold of the prisoner; there was a cry of Rescue! and at the corner of Beech-street he struck me a violent blow in the face, and afterwards a violent blow on the left side of the breast; he was secured.</p>

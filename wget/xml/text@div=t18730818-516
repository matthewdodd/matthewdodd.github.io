                  </hi>. I live at 10, Back Hill, Hatton Garden, and am the prisoner's daughter—on the morning of 30th May, about 8 o'clock, I was in my bedroom with my little cousin, Margaret Ross, twelve years old—I sent her down stairs—I could not see my father at the time, but he was on the stairs, and she was playing towards him—I saw her bend forward, and thought she was going to jump on my father's back—I did not see what he did, but I heard her cry out "Annie, Annie!"—I went towards her, and saw my father as though he was fighting or pushing away something from im, and making a horrible noise with his mouth—I did not see anything in his hand—I caught the child and pressed her to me, and saw blood on my arm—I called my mother and caught my father by the neck, and pushed him down the stairs—he had been drinking a little, and did not seem right in his mind—he had been in bed all night—I think this might ave been an accident; he has been such a kind disposition all his life—he is a cabinet-maker by trade; he was very fond of the child and she of him; she loves him—she has been to see him in prison and kissed him there—she would go to him now—(<hi rend="italic">The child was brought into Court and readily went to the prisoner and kissed him</hi>).</p>

I am the wife of John Horagan, and live in the same house as the prisoner—about 8 o'clock on the morning of 30th May I saw the prisoner struggling between his wife and daughter on the landing—he had a razor iu his hand—I took it from him and gave it to the constable—I saw a wound on the child's neck—he seemed very much excited—I thought he was going mad—he always seemed very affectionate to the child and the child to him.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—the child was brought there on 30th May—she had a blanched look from loss of blood from the wound—it was two-thirds of an inch long on the right side of the neck; it was dangerous—she might have bled to death—it was such a wound as might be caused by a razor—the child is quite well now—it had cut the external jugular vein—in so young a child it would not require much strength to sever its head from its body.</p>

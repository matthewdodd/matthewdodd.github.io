            . What have you to say against the Prisoner? Do you know him?</p>
               <p>Tall. Yes, Sir; the Prisoner at the Bar stole my Handkerchiefs; sixteen in Number; seven Silk, four Linen, and five Cotton, and one Linen Apron.</p>
               <p>Q. When were these stole from you ?</p>
               <p>Tall. The 29th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say the Prisoner stole them?</p>
               <p>Tall Because I saw the Goods in his Apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see them in his Apron?</p>
               <p>Tall. At the Door.</p>
               <p>Q. What immediately ?</p>
               <p>Tall I live in Mountague street, Cox's square; these Things they hung on a Nail at the Door: About three o'Clock in the Afternoon, I heard the Crack of the String that was broke: I was serving in the Shop, and I took hold of him, and called for Assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with him?</p>
               <p>Tall. I carried him before the Justice, and he committed him to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Tall. He told the Justice he was going to buy an Handkerchief of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was so?</p>
               <p>Tall. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Boy before?</p>
               <p>Tall. Yes, I saw him two Days before this happened.</p>

            . Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Leech. In Petticoat Lane. I was at Mrs. Tall's House, at the Time these Handkerchiefs were lost; I believe it was about two o'Clock. I was buying something, and I heard something snap; and I went to the Door, and this young Man had the Handkerchiefs in his Hand; and I took them out of his Hand: He had got a green Apron on, and just about to put them into his Apron; so I took them out of his Hand, and gave them to Mrs. Tall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know how many there were ?</p>
               <p>Leech. No, I did not know how many there were. Mrs. Tall keeps an old Cloath-shop, and they hung at the Door; the Prisoner was secured, and carried before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Handkerchiefs afterwards?</p>
               <p>Leech. The Constable had them.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say in your Defence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I saw these Handkerchiefs hang at the Door; I went to look at an Handkerchief, and went to take hold of them, and the String broke, and they dropped down; and I took them up, and was about to carry them into the Shop, and they took hold of me.</p>

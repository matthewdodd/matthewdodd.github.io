                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry James Fitzroy—I was married to him at the parish church of St. Michael, at Worcester, on 29th May, 1878—at that time I was a widow and my name was Kate Walsh Smith—Henry James Fitzroy was the eldest son of Lord Charles Fitzroy—before my marriage I knew Mr. Froggatt as a solicitor practising in Argyll Street, Regent Street, and in preparing a deed of settlement he acted as solicitor for my husband; I had no separate solicitor acting for me—this is my signature to this deed, and this "Henry Fitzroy" is my husband's—the others are the signatures of Mr. Froggatt and Mr. Meare, the trustees—that deed was signed at Worcester on the morning of my marriage by those different parties—I had not known Mr. Mears before, he was quite a stranger to me and to my husband; Mr. Froggatt introduced him to me at Worcester; he lived there—Mr. Froggatt was present at my marriage, and after the ceremony he took possession of the deed—I lived with my husband till 9th May, 1875—up to that time the dividends were paid from time to time into my husband's account at Drummond's bank—in December, 1875, I received this letter from the defendant; it is his writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "7th December, 1875. 6, Argyll Street, Regent Street Dear Mrs. Fitzroy,—I send you by book-post copy of your settlement. Mr. Webber called here yesterday and would not make the affidavit without he was paid a guinea. I went to him this morning; he has gone to Brighton, and will not be back till to-night. I will see him, pay him the guinea, and get his affidavit.") I also received this letter, dated 4th January, 1876; it is the defendant's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had sent her settlement to be copied and would send copy to-morrow, and that he would pay in to her credit at the Bank of England dividends amounting</hi> to 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) This letter of 5th July, 1876, is also in the defendant's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had paid in the dividends.</hi>) This is the copy of the deed, which I received with the letter of 7th December, 1875—after my husband left me in May, 1875, I opened an account in my own name, at the Western Branch of the Bank, of England—being a married woman, they would not take the account as my own, and it was headed in the name of Mr. Webber, a friend of mine, a wine merchant, and the dividends were duly paid in by the defendant to that account—after my husband left me I had obtained a protection order, to protect property which I was separately entitled to—from that time until 1877 I did not know that the trust had been interfered with by anybody; I thought I was receiving my dividends from the proper funds—at the latter part of 1877 it came to my knowledge that the defendant was being prose<lb></lb>cuted; I then consulted another solicitor, Mr. Yorke—I subsequently saw Mr. Froggatt at a restaurant on Ludgate Hill—at that time he was on bail on the charge of the turf frauds—I met him at his request, that was in writing; I have not got the letter—I asked him what was he going to do</p>

               <p>about my money—he said it would be all right, as he would not be convicted, I need not be at all alarmed; I was to see him next day after the trial would be finished—at that time I believed that my property was safe in the hands of trustees—during the proceedings it was brought to my knowledge that the whole of my trust property had been disposed of—I do not know what has become of it—I never sanctioned in any way the dealing with the property by the trustees.</p>

Farrer, Ouvry, and Co. in reference to myself, but I have not—I do not know the signature to the letter produced—I do not know a person, of the name of Benjamin, nor was I aware that my husband was in very great difficulties until the first year of our marriage—it was then that Mr. Froggatt managed his monetary affairs—I did not know that some of the stock was sold out and not reinvested—I have read this letter (<hi rend="italic">blue paper</hi>); it is in Mr. Fitzroy's handwriting—I did not know that Mr. Fitzroy autho<lb></lb>rised Mr. Froggatt to sell out—Mr. Yorke is my solicitor at present—I have not said that I wished to prosecute my husband for misappropriating these moneys—I do not know that my husband has attempted to upset our marriage on the ground that I have a husband living; I never heard it from Mr. Fitzroy or anybody—I saw my solicitor, Mr. Yorke, in August last about this case, and commenced a Chancery suit for the recovery of this trust money—I do not know that Mr. Yorke has done things without my sanction, nor do I know that he has applied to the Court of Chancery to distribute this trust money. (<hi rend="italic">The statement of claim was here put in.</hi>) I don't remember the date exactly that the defendant came out of prison; it was after the writ was issued, and he was thereupon arrested—I told Mr. Yorke to take proceedings against him, and I left it entirely in his hands—I have never heard of such a thing as a "Ne-exeat"—I brought a Chancery suit, and obtained a decree—as far as I know, interrogatories were not administered to Mr. Froggatt—the dividends were paid to me in July and January—I believe the writ was issued after I found that the dividend was not paid in to my account in January, 1878—I do not know that Mr. Farrer bought the reversion in the year 1873—I never knew that the defendant was dealing with this trust fund under my husband's direction; I never heard of it—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my husband's handwriting—I think he</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have never received any of the money—I have never seen Mr. Fitzroy since he left me—he has not contributed to my support, nor do I know" where he is—I believe he is not in this country—in 1873 there were proceedings against him in Bankruptcy—Messrs. Farrer, Ouvry, and Farrer, are solicitors to the Duke of Grafton's and to Lord Fitzroy's family—I was led to believe by Mr. Webber that the reversion was purchased at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings—I have never heard of my first husband since the London went down—the action that was brought against me was by Madame Ox, a milliner—on that occasion I was represented by a solicitor and counsel—Mr. Roberts was my solicitor, and Mr. Besley my counsel—I left the conduct of the case entirely in the hands of my solicitor, and he put what answer he thought fit—I also resisted the claim on the score of its being very exorbitant—after I last saw Mr. Smith I was left entirely on my own resources up to the time I married Mr. Fitzroy—Mr. Froggatt did not act for me as my solicitor before my marriage—I acquainted Mr. Froggatt with everything concerning my former husband, and gave him the letters and papers—before my marriage to Mr. Fitzroy I gave directions to Mr. Froggatt to make certain inquiries—since November, when I first became acquainted with Mr. Yorke, I placed the matter entirely in his hands to manage for me.</p>

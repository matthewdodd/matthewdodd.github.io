                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Jones, a pastrycook, of 169, Old Street—on Sunday, 26th May, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner came in for two penny kidney pies and gave me a florin—she spoke with rather a foreign accent—I gave her her change and put it in the till—after she left I discovered that it was bad—there was no other florin in the till, only sixpences and shillings—I had slight suspicions of her, and looked in the till and found the florin was rather dark—I pot it to my teeth, it bent easily, and I put it under a bottle on a shelf and gave it to my sister, Mrs. Jones, when she came home, with a description of the person from whom I had received it—on the Monday I was called up from the bakehouse by Mrs. Jones, between three and four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, and saw the prisoner in the shop—I said, "You came in yesterday and passed a bad two-shilling piece"—she said, "I did not come in;" after<lb></lb>wards she said, "A gentleman gave it to me, and I did not know it was bad"—Mrs. Jones showed me a half-crown which she had taken—the pri<lb></lb>soner was given in charge.</p>

I am one of the principal clerks to Copestake &amp; Co—on 9th December the prisoner was brought there by a gentleman employed in the establishment (a communication had been made by our Ipswich traveller, in consequence of which the goods were not supplied)—he said that he had succeeded Mr. Ward, of Ipswich, as a draper, and wished to commence an account—I asked him for references, he referred me to Messrs. Bradbury &amp; Co., of Aldermanbury, and Messrs. Brown, Davie &amp; Co., of Love Lane, the prosecutors—I communicated with Brad<lb></lb>bury &amp; Co., who showed me a document, and also with Brown, Davis &amp; Co, the same day, while the prisoner was selecting goods to the amount of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see him after I came back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Ladbury, Collison &amp; Viney, and am well acquainted with drapery goods—I saw the articles left at the shop in the Butter Market, Ipswich, and valued them at 159<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were no silks, only bonnets, flowers, and hosiery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, of Kington, in Hereford<lb></lb>shire—in March, 1868, the prisoner entered my service, as assistant, at a salary of 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he said nothing to me about 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of capital, or that his father had left him 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was well acquainted with business, and knew the value of things—he stayed till the end of last November—I had not known him before—he referred me to Mr. Smith, of Birmingham, who wrote to me, and said that he had had him with him nearly three years—he left me to take a business with Mr. Ward of Ipswich—he conducted himself well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that he bought the business upon the understanding that it returned between</hi> 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year; but that in three weeks he took</hi> 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">less than he was led to expect, that the goods he removed were not worth so much as those he put on the premises, and that he left nearly</hi> 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">worth of good there, which would have paid hit creditors</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in the pound; whereas, had he wished to defraud, he could have sold the whole. That he always intended to pay for the goods he ordered, and should have done so had not Ward's business turned out a gross swindle.</hi>

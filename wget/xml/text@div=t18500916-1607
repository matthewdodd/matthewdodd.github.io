                  </hi>. I live in Houndsditch, and make cigars. On 30th April the prisoner came to my place, and said he could sell three boxes of cigars; he had a gentleman who would buy them—I said I could not go with him, but I sent Mr. Bullock, a friend, with him to the Tower Shades—he was to bring back the cigars or the money—he had three cases, containing seven pounds and a half altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. On 30th April, I was at Mr. Allen's—the prisoner was there—Mr. Allen requested me to go with the prisoner with some cigars—I was to bring back the cigars or the money—he said he would not trust the prisoner with the property himself—I went with the prisoner to a beer-shop and coffee-house in Thames-street—he spoke to some person connected with the house, and asked whether the gentleman was there that he had spoken about previously—the person said he was gone to the Shades—I went with the prisoner to the Shades—I went in at the doorway in Tower-street—I sat down a few minutes, and the prisoner said he would go up-stairs and see if the gentleman was there—he went up, and came down again and said it was all right, the gentleman was up-stairs, and he would take the cigars up to him—I let him have them, and waited six or seven minutes—I then found that the staircase led out of the house on to Tower-hill, and the prisoner was gone.</p>

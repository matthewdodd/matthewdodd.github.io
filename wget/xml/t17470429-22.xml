            . What have you to alledge against the Prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Mayhew. For stealing of Check, the 30th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Mayhew . The Corner of Woodstreet.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the Prisoner with respect to this Loss ?</p>
               <p>Mayhew. The Prisoner took it the 30th of March; I can't say that I saw her take it; I called my Wife to serve her; she came into my Shop under a Pretence to be a Customer, I saw her take it down to look upon it, I did not see her take it away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find it again?</p>
               <p>Mayhew . The very next Morning, she past by the Door with the Check under her Arm; I took her and brought her back with the Check under her Arm; I know it to be my own by a particular Mark that it has.</p>

            . Have you any thing to say?</p>
               <p>Mayhew . The Prisoner at the Bar came into my Shop, the 30th of March, when I came down, she had got a Piece of Check in her Hand, which was not that which was lost; we differed about the Price; she told me that a Gardener's Wife at Hackney had bought it for 10 d. and I asked two and twenty Pence for it; well, says she, I am going as far as Knightrider-street, and I will have a couple of Aprons, and I will buy a Gown of this thing; I saw this Piece of Check upon the Compter, while she was in the Shop; that which she was bargaining for, was of another Sort; she said, I'll call when I come back; I said good Woman do you know the Shop? she said yes; after she was gone, I was clearing the Compter; I said, Mr Mayhew , where's that Piece of Check? I don't know, says he; I said then that Woman has it; the next Day she locked up over the Bulk of the Door, and I said she had got the Check under her Arm; we could not swear to the Length; so Mr Mayhew , my Spouse, brought her back , and that Check I can prove to be my own; this happened to be a Piece I have had a pretty while, that no Body liked it; that I had it often before my Eyes.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself?</p>

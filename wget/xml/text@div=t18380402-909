                  </hi>. I am a jobber, and live at Chaste-side, Enfield. On the 15th of December I turned my mare-pony out on Chase Green-com<lb></lb>mon—I missed her next morning, and on the 18th I found her at Ed<lb></lb>monton, in possession of Walledge, a policeman—it was delivered up to me—she is worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Edmonton police. On Saturday morning, the 16th of December, about four o'clock, I was on duty at Winchmore-hill, and saw the prisoner and his brother William with a pony, in Hopper's-lane—William was leading it, and the prisoner driving it—it was in an hempen halter—they were about three miles, from Chase Green-common—it was the same pony as was afterwards claimed and de<lb></lb>livered up to Hill—I suspected by their manner that it was not their own property, and asked them about it—they both said they were going to take it to the pound, but they were going in a different direction—they were on the way to London—I took the horse from William Norton, and led it myself—I told them I was not satisfied, and they must go with me—we went for a quarter of a mile, or further—I questioned them closely, and not being satisfied with their answers, I took out my truncheon to secure them, and William ran away—I secured the prisoner—William was taken a fortnight afterwards, and tried—the prisoner was committed to the House of Correction as a vagabond, and was there at the time of William 's trial—he was afterwards taken for this.</p>

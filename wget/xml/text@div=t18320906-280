            . I had been out with the prosecutor on the 31st of July, and when I came home, about ten o'clock at night; I found my box broken open, and the property spoken of belonging to the witness, was gone; in about ten minutes the prisoner came home, and said he knew nothing about it; I then said I would go and tell my friend John - as we were going along, I saw him take something, and put it into his hat, and I went to friend John, and told him of it - the prisoner again called God to witness that he had seen nothing of it; John said, "Give him into custody," and the duplicates were found in his hat.</p>

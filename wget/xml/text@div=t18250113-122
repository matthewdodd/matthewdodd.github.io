               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you had any conversation with a gentleman on the subject of this charge? A. Yes; Mr. Manning - he asked whether I thought this was laid out in dress for the poor girl? I told him that she had not a shift to her back that was not full of holes, and therefore it could not be laid out in dress. I never told him I had questioned my wife about it; and was surprised to find that she had sent her to pawn eleven table-spoons, nor any part of the property - I never said any thing of that kind. I did not live on good terms with my wife through my servants. I owed her a quarter' wages on the 14th of November. She was apprehended on the 1st or 2d of December - she had applied for her wages, and I told her on account of my things being gone I would not pay her till I had made inquiry. She still remained in my service.</p>

               <p>"To tell you the truth she was quite a favourite with Mr. Humphries, and I left the house, three weeks, on that account;" she asked what Mr. Humphries wanted to do with her - I told her I had not seen him, and I should not like to see him on the business - I saw Mr. Humphries last week; he then said he had questioned Mrs. Humphries, and she confessed that she knew where eight of the spoons were - I asked him if he meant to prosecute, he said</p>
               <p>"Yes; for if I don't. I shall have all Mrs. H.'s friends upon me, and I am obliged to prosecute." - Mrs. Humphries did not tell me, that she knew where eight of the spoons were - it was Mr. Humphries.</p>

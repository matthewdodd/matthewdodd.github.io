            . I am a servant to Dr. Kerr; he is a <rs id="t18131027-3-viclabel19" type="occupation">physician</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18131027-3-victim78 t18131027-3-viclabel19"></join>; his Christian name is William. The prisoner had been in Dr. Kerr's service about two months. He had left the Doctor's service about five weeks before the Doctor lost his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the horse on the night of the 2nd of October - A. Yes. about half past seven o'clock in the evening, on Saturday. I fed him, and left him safe in the stable. He had a halter on, and was fastened to the manger.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a door out of the coach-house into the stable - A. Yes, the stable door was not bolted; the coach-house door that led into the street was bolted. The prisoner had been there in the afternoon about twenty minutes. He let me in the stable yard, and passed into the street the way that he came in. He went away about a quarter before five. I saw no more of him. I went to the stable about five o'clock on Sunday morning; upon my going there I found the horse was gone. The back door of the stable was wide open; the door of the coach-house was open leading into the stable yard; the coach-house door, leading into the street, was shut, but not bolted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a saddle and a bridle - A. Yes. After I missed the horse I went into the saddle room and missed the saddle and bridle. It was a curb bridle, with black reins. I then communicated to my master that the horse, saddle, and bridle were gone. I enquired of the London Mail respecting the prisoner and the horse. I got from them an account that such a man had been on the road. After that, I went to Stanmore in Middlesex; I saw the prisoner there, and Dr. Kerr's horse. I saw the prisoner at the Abercorn Arms; the horse was at Dr. Guest's, a farrier's. The horse that I saw at Dr. Guest's, was Dr. Kerr's horse. It was the same horse that I lost out of the stable; he was a chesnut horse, with a bald face. The horse appeared to me to have been rid hard; he had been down, and broken in his knee, his nose, and his head. The prisoner was in hold at that time at the Abercorn Arms, in the tap-room. I saw the saddle and the bridle in the stable at the Abercorn Arms; they were the property of my master. I am sure they were the Doctor's bridle and saddle. The next time I saw the prisoner was at the magistrate's. I am sure that the horse that I saw at Dr. Guest's, at Stanmore, was Dr. Kerr's horse.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner and the horse together - A. Yes, I did, down at the magistrate's.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I live at Dunstable; that is in the Northampton road from town. I first saw the prisoner as I was standing at my own door on Sunday morning, the 3d of October; he was upon a chesnut horse. I saw that horse afterwards at the magistrate's. He came along the road as if from Northampton to London. I received information; I went in pursuit of him on horseback. I came up with him at Stanmore, in Middlesex; he was standing at the stable door of the Abercorn Arms, and I saw the horse in the stable as I passed by. I sent for a constable; a constable came; his name is Chapman. I told the constable to take him in charge for stealing the horse; the prisoner denied it, and said it was not Dr. Kerr's horse.</p>

            . I am the ostler at the Abercorn Arms. On Sunday, a little after three in the afternoon, the prisoner came in on a chesnut horse with a bald face. The horse seemed very much tired. He desired me to give the horse some hay and water. He said he had but a very little time to stop. The horse appeared to have been rid hard, he had two broken knees, a cut on his nose, and a cut above his eye. I gave the horse a little hay and water. The horse was in the stable. Mr. Arnold, the butcher, of Dunstable, came and asked if such a person had been there. I shewed the prisoner to Arnold; he was at the stable door; the prisoner was delivered over into the charge of the constable; the horse I took care of. I believe one of the post boys took the horse to the farrier. That horse that the post boy took to the farrier was the horse that the prisoner led into the stable. There was no other chesnut horse with a bald face there. The prisoner took that horse into our house.</p>

            . I am a constable at Stanmore. I apprehended the prisoner at the stable door of the Abercorn Arms. Arnold gave me charge of him on suspicion of stealing Dr. Kerr's horse. I asked Arnold his name and address. He told me to keep the prisoner in custody until he went to Dr. Kerr's. I kept him in custody until Tuesday, then Arnold and Dr. Kerr's coachman came to me. I took him then before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had the prisoner in custody had you any conversation with him - A. Yes; he owned to every thing. I promised him no favour, nor threatened him. He owned to stealing the horse; he said he was a guilty man, that he had offended the laws of his country. I took him before the magistrate, and the ostler rode the horse down to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Langdon. Was the horse that the ostler rode to the magistrate, Dr. Kerr's horse - A. Yes, it was. I fed and attended the horse. My master gave fifty guineas for it. It was a riding horse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270006"></xptr>Jury, there were no locks broke. I hope you will be so good as to ask the coachman if he saw any thing of that. I trust to the mercy of the court.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did they live together as man and wife - A. About six weeks; they removed; he was taken to the Fleet Prison for debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever live together after that - A. Yes; he was there a long time, and some few months after he came out, they lived together again in London. I went into business by myself, and she lived with me. I should not suppose they lived together that time for more than two or three months; he went on so bad; she and I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her lately - A. I see her this morning; she lives with me now, and has ever since, I live in Whitecross-street.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner Garlick - A. Yes; I saw him married on the 27th of January, 1812, to Charity Lewis. I knew her some years before he had her, she was a ladies maid, and house-keeper in a gentleman's family; part of her time she followed the millinery and mantua making business, and she was a laundress; after he married her, she was obliged to do any thing, because he could not maintain her; they lived together upwards of two years after he married her, they lived together up to the present time.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. I believe you are a coach-master at Chelsea? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of something that passed between one of your servants and the prosecutor, he made a claim of a gelding that you had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you state to the Court how you came in possession of that gelding? - A. Mr. White, who keeps the White Horse inn at Chelsea, informed me that there was a brown gelding for sale, in the possession of Mr. Salmon, for trial.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a brown gelding in the indictment, and the other witness has stated it to be a bay gelding.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Q. The horse is a very old horse? A. Yes; I purchased the horse of the prisoner at the bar on the 5th of August, 1803.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you purchased it of the prisoner? - A. I am sure of it, I paid him the money myself, and had a receipt from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that receipt? - A. That is the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner state to you when you purchased the horse? - A. He gave it a good character; he said it belonged to a person in the country, a friend of his, who was in the smuggling line, and the poor man was so unlucky, he was turned up. The same horse was sent to me for sale, which Mr. Salmon had on trial; it would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100021"></xptr>not suit him, he thought it would not be heavy enough for him in winter; the horse was sent down to my stable, and I agreed with Mr. Morgan for the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him for it? - A. Seven guineas, and he gave me the receipt; I did not see him write it, he gave it me out of his own hand. After that I set the horse to work once a day; he never went into any other hands after I had him; I put him regularly to work, day after day, till owned by Mr. Ellis on the 13th of January, 1804.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that is the same horse that you bought of the prisoner? - A. I am sure it is the same horse.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner was afterwards taken up, and you appeared about this horse? - A. Yes, at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated there what you have stated today? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. There was a man of the name of Salmon that had this horse - whose horse did he state it to be? - A. The prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. For sale; and the prisoner said he had it from a man that was turned up - The man that he bought it of was a man that was sent on board the hulks, did he not tell you so? - A. No, he did not say that, nothing of that passed.</p>

               <p>Q. This horse you worked from the time you got him to the time the owner owned him, half a dozen times a day, as business required? - A. No, only once a day.</p>
               <p>Q. He was always exposed on the road? - A. Always.</p>

               <p>Q. There was no concealment of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor? - A. I never knew him till he owned the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse was worked publicly in the road while you had him, so as to be seen by any body that passed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to tell me that a brown horse is a bay horse? - A. There is a very little difference between a dark bay and a brown horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not a brown horse different from a bay horse? - A. A brown horse is merely similar to a dark bay.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not call a brown horse a bay? - A. It is a dark bay, and nearly brown.</p>
               <p>Q. You know more about horses than I do, what do you call it? - A. I call it a dark bay horse, and another person might call it a brown horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Q. Do not horses change their colour very much? - A. Yes, this is a very old horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A dark bay and a brown are of very little difference, one person might call it a dark bay, and another person a brown horse.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. You apprehended the prisoner - do you know Mr. Yardley's hand-writing, the chief clerk at the Office? (shewing the witness a paper) - A. This is Mr. Chamber's writing, and Mr. Yardley's is underneath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. That is not evidence - you were at Bow-street, and Messrs. Dallat's attorney attended there to manage the business? - A. I never saw that gentleman before at any Public-office, I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Maslin.) Q. You are sure that the horse that you purchased of the prisoner is the same horse that the prosecutor claimed? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This horse, when I bought him, was a bright bay, and full of saddle-marks, and from a blow on the off eye he had got the skin quite over the off eye; I do not know whether he is quite blind, he has been grazed on one knee, and there is a knot on it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say that the horse was a broken knee'd horse? - A. When I sold him to Mr. Maslin, I do not say it was a broken knee then; the hair was only a little rubbed off.</p>
               <p>Maslin. I did not perceive that any was rubbed off when I bought him first.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Maslin:) Q. You do not call him a broken knee'd horse, unless the skin is broken? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had this horse; I was employed by Dallats' people to get a horse for a poor relation of theirs that wanted one to go in an errand cart, that used to go to the fishmongers at Billingsgate to Chelsea. The first time I saw this horse was in a cart, and the name of Rickets was on the cart; I wanted to deal with the man for the horse, and the man would not sell me the horse at that time; I looked at the horse a good while, and we were joking with the man a good while, seeing the white marks down his withers; the man said he was a good old servant, and a better horse there never was. I saw the horse afterwards two or three times, more or less; I saw the horse, I suppose, for a fortnight or three weeks after that; the man came to me one day, and said he had met with a misfortune; the words were never expressed by me as Mr. Maslin has said; he says that I said he was seized upon by smuggling; he asked me if my friends were suited, and I said they were not; he brought the horse the next day to me at eleven o'clock, and I took it over to Mr. Dallat's, and they told me they did not want it, - they had either furnished themselves with a horse, or a friend had. I was in the habit of going to Mr. White, and I was telling him that I had such a horse, and that I was disappointed with the person that wanted it, and that I must take it to Smithfield; he said to me, Mrs. Salmon wants a horse to go in her cart;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100022"></xptr>I said, it would suit her very well; he then said he was going out to-morrow, and he would inform her; I was to give six pounds six shillings for the horse to the man; he said to me, make what you can, I don't care so as I have my own money; I wanted to part with the horse, he had eat near a truss of hay; Mr. White informed Mrs. Salmon of it; and the first time I saw the horse after that was in Mrs. Salmon's cart; we could not agree about the price, and Mr. White said she should not have it; I did not see the horse again till I saw it in Mr. Maslin's stage; Mr. White went up to Mr. Maslin to know if he liked the horse, and the answer was that he liked it. I was one night at Mr. Knight's, and Mr. Maslin was there; he said, Morgan, I may as well pay you for that horse; I said, if you please: he asked me into the parlour, I do not think there was any body present but Mr. White; Mr. White said we should spend a shilling a piece, or half a crown, and Mr. Maslin paid me seven guineas for the horse.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

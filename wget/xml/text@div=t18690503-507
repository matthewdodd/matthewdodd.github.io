                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 7, Old Kent Road—the prisoner was in my employment for about five months—I slept in the top room, and the prisoner in the room underneath—on 4th April, I and my wife went to bed at the usual hour, a little before 11 o'clock—I left the prisoner in his room previous to my going up stairs—somewhere about 4 o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by a blow at the side of the head—I was not sensible; I could not move—I heard my wife screaming that we were being murdered—she had not left the bed then—I did not see the prisoner—I was bleeding—I lay there till I came to my senses a little, and when I got out of bed my wife was at the window, calling, "Police!" and "Murder!"—there was no light—there was a chair, which I always place at my bedside, with my watch and the candlestick on it; that got turned over—I was feeling about the floor for the candle, and I laid my hand upon the poker, which was on the floor—my wife called to me to keep to the door, and she was calling, "Police!"—it was not many seconds before the police came, and broke the shop door open—I did not see the prisoner at all, I was too much stunned—I was not aware that I was bleeding till I got out of bed—the policeman came up to our room, and brought the prisoner up with him—that must have been a few minutes after the occur<lb></lb>rence—the policeman said, "This is you that has done this"—I believe he said he knew nothing about it; that was all he said—he was taken into custody—I saw this carving-knife found outside my bedroom door, on the landing—it had been used at supper the night before—the prisoner had</p>

               <p>supper with us—there was blood upon the knife when found—I found this hammer just outside the back door, on the ground—it had been kept in the out-house since I used it last; that was on Good Friday, about a fortnight before—the prisoner had been to that out-house the night before this occurrence, at the time he was coming in, just before going to bed, a few minutes before 11 o'clock—I met him at he was coming from the out-house, he was at one door, and I at the other—I did not see whether he had anything in his hand—he had gone near the place where I afterwards found the hammer—about six weeks before this, I had accused the prisoner of something, rightly; but after some discussion about the matter, I consented to forgive him, and that matter passed away—on the night of 3rd April, the very night before this happened, I said to him, "Frank you will either hare to write or go to your father, and tell him to give you a suit of clothes, for the clothes you are wearing are not fit for you to wear, and I consider your father ought to do his duty by you, for the way in which he sent you here, was not a be<lb></lb>coming way at all for a father to send a lad out to any employment—do you think he will give you a suit of of clothes?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Well, you can tell him that if he does not, I shall have to send you away"—he made no answer—that was somewhere about 10 o'clock; he had had his supper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Except those two small matters, you had no quarrel or dispute with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my wife and I live very happily, we do not quarrel—I know inspector Turpin—my wife and I used to quarrel, but we do not now; we did before Christmas, we have exchanged blows—I have broken the crockery—on Christmas day I sent the plum pudding into the fire, and part of a cheese after it—I have been violent when I have been in drink, but I have not taken drink since Christmas, thank God—I used occa<lb></lb>sionally to drink too much, but I was never a drunkard, it used to effect me—my wife has left my house more than once, and gone for protection elsewhere, to her mother's—that'has not been since Christmas—at Christmas, she went to her mother's, and stayed a day or two, but not since—I have not been drunk since Christmas—I took a pledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—on 4th April we went to bed about 11 o'clock—I was disturbed at 4 o'clock in the morning with a stab on my chin—I put up my hand, and I received another on my finger, and that roused me up—I saw somebody near the bed, it was the prisoner, I think, at least, I am sure—it was just breaking day when I rote up in the bed—I screamed, "Murder!"—I looked down, and saw my husband was bleeding from a wound in his head—the person who was in the room was near the bed; he was standing over me, aiming blows at me—I did not see with what—I threw out my arms, and that was how it was I received the blows on my hands and arms—the prisoner then left the room—I am not able to say positively that it was the prisoner—I then jumped out of bed, flew to the window, and called to the police—my husband jumped out of bed just as I rushed to the window—a policeman came, not many minutes afterwards—he broke a panel in the door, and got into the house, and came up to our bed-room—the person in the room did nut say anything—he had his trowsers and shirt on.</p>

On 4th April, at a few minutes to 4 o'clock, I heard cries of "Police!" and saw Mrs. Nicholls looking out of the window of 7, Old Kent Road—I knocked in the panel of the shop door, and got into the house—as I went up stairs, I observed that the windows were securely fastened—I went into the first-floor bed-room, and there found the prisoner—he was in the act of taking off his trowsers—I asked who he was, and what he wanted there—he said he lived there—I then went up to the second floor, and there saw Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls, both bleeding—Mr. Nicholls was bleeding from the right temple, and Mrs. Nicholls from the chin and hand—I found this knife in the lobby, outside the bed-room door—there was blood upon it—all the things in the room confused and knocked about, and tumbled down; chairs and tables and all were knocked down—the watch was lying outside on the landing, and the chain under the door—I told the prisoner I should have to take him into custody for feloniously wounding and attempting to murder Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I found the doors of the house, back and front, all securely fastened—I went round, and tried all the windows and doors, and found them all fastened.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 15, Eltham Place—on Monday morning, the 4th, a little after 4 o'clock, I was called into Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls; he had received a severe contusion on the right temple; it was not an incised wound such as would be inflicted with a knife, it was not bleeding when I saw it, it had been; the skin was broken—the wound itself was not much, but there was a severe contusion; it was done with some blunt instrument—there were no other injuries to Mr. Nicholls—I attended him for a few days; there was no danger; he has scarcely re<lb></lb>covered yet—I believe he has been under his own medical man since.</p>

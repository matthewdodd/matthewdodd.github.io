I went out of town for two months, and returned on the 29th of October - I had occasionally lodged there for three years-when I went away I left my boxes in her care. I desired her to take particular care of one of the boxes, which contained linen, and was put in a closet at the top of the house, for safety; she frequently told me that her landlord would not wait for her rent more than ten days. I said if she was in any difficulty she was to let me know, and I would assist her in the payment of her rent, and on no account to suffer the landlord to seize; she said there was no danger of that. When I returned home I asked her if I could have my apartment, she said, Yes. I enquired how she got on, she said, very well. Next morning to my surprise, the constable and the landlord, came and charged her with something, which raised my suspicion; I enquired about my box of plate and linen; she said she had moved it to friend's house for safety. In about half an hour I told her I had found a friend who would let me move my things to his house, which I wished immediately to do; she said I could not have the box of plate and linen, as the person had been put to bed in the house, and it was in her room. I said I must have it. In about half an hour I sent for her son - He is about fourteen years of age-to shew me the house, and told him to bring it down-it appeared, in his hands, very light, as if it was empty. I fetched the key, and found all the plate and linen gone. We took it to his mother's house, and told her it was empty; she said she knew it, but it was all safe. I asked her how that could be, when she gave me a paper with sixteen duplicates. The next morning she desired I would give her that day to redeem them, as she had contrived to get two or three beds out of the house. I asked her if she had taken any thing else, she said she had taken twenty-five books - She gave me three duplicates of them, but said she could not find the rest; she said the box being heavy, the lid had burst open in moving it. The prisoner, Campbell, said that was the truth. On examining the duplicates I found Campbell had pledged some of the things, and Bostock the others. I got two officers and searched her, and found a large bunch of keys upon her; they asked her to shew them the key she opened the box with, which she reluctantly did. They found above sixty duplicates upon her, some of which related to my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. I thought her an honest character. I found she had received 20l. for my things. A gentleman who lodged in the house owed her 40l.</p>

            . On the 5th of June I went to the shop disguised, and asked the prisoner for a pair of mangle end irons; he weighed them - they were 22 lbs., and I paid him 5s. for them; they came to 5s. 6d., but he said never mind the 6d., I could pay that when I went again: I went with the prosecutor to the factory - he asked the prisoner, in my presence, if anyone had been there, and he said No, only a person who left a letter; he did not ask if he had sold anything.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DAVID PAINE re-examined. I asked if anyone had been there; he said No, only the letter - I did not say "Has any customer been here?" he should have kept the money till I came, and given it to me, and have entered it in a book, which he had not done; I called him again about eleven o'clock and said "Let us have a balance;" as he had owed me 30s. some time before - he was to work it out; I took the book to see what he owed me then, and it was about 13s., which I made him give me a memorandum for in this book.</p>

            . I went to the prosecutor and purchased a sack of coke, for which I paid 3s. to the prisoner - it was on a Saturday; I believe he put the money into his pocket.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DAVID PAINE re-examined. I had no conversation with him about this last transaction; I went out of town and returned on the Tuesday morning - I did not ask the prisoner if he had received any money; it was his duty to enter it in this book, which he should have given me when he saw me - here is no entry on the 5th or on the 7th; the second purchase was not with my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had laid out some money for his master while he was from town; and that he intended to settle with him on the day he was apprehended.</p>

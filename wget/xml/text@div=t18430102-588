I was living with my mother in 1841—I met the prisoner repeatedly, and I married him at Lam<lb></lb>beth church, on the 11th of October, 1841—I had no money—I have had one child by the prisoner—he left me eight months after I was married—he came back to me after I was confined, but he did not live with me till he was taken, for I went and left him, as he did not use me altogether well, and he was out</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to my shop to buy a comb; I live in Sloan-street; it was four weeks go to day; she offered me half a crown to change, and I sent the half crown out with my little girl to the next door to change; the woman followed the little girl into the other shop; then afterwards she brought me these two bad shillings and some halfpence, my little girl brought the two bad shillings to me; then when I gave them the woman she refused them, and said they were bad, she bid me change them; I sent them back to Mrs. Cunnington to change them, not knowing that they had been changed by the prisoner, and Mrs. Cunnington said they were not the two shillings she gave in change.</p>

            Do you know the nature of an oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you swear that, that is not true, by which the prisoner may be affected, what will become of you? - Go to Hell.</p>
               <p>sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You was directed by your mother to carry the two shillings that was objected to, to Mrs. Cunnington's house? - Yes. I went in to Mrs. Cunnington for change for half a crown, and the woman, the prisoner, followed me; Mrs. Cunnington laid down the two shillings; the woman took them up with one hand, and laid down two others with the other hand, and I took the two shillings that she laid down, into my mother.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know whether the girl can swear that ever I was in the shop? - I am sure she was in the shop.</p>

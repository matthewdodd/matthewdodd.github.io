               <p>I am servant to Hodson and Co. On the 6th of April, in the afternoon, I saw twelve pounds of thread taken out of the warehouse; I pursued, and saw the prisoner throw it away in a passage, two doors below our house.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of him? - I only saw his arm when he took it; he was out of my sight; when he dropped it, I was about eight yards off, I believe; I did not lose sight of him afterwards; I did not see his face.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of him? - I can swear that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240166"></xptr>to be the <rs id="t17900424-52-deflabel292" type="occupation">boy</rs>

               <p>(Produces the thread.)</p>
               <p>Do you know that to be this thread? - Yes; I opened it myself: I gave it to the constable.</p>

Hallet said he had a piece of spun yarn in his pocket, which he made fast to the tobacco, and carried the other end to the under part of the deck, near the fore-scuttle; and, in the night-time, between nine and ten o'clock, he took an opportunity, and broke the scuttle, and hauled the tobacco up out of the hole; the hatches were all locked down; the tarpauling was over the scuttle, so that we could not discover it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the skuttle?</p>
               <p>Boyes. That is a small hatch: he acknowledged they carried the tobacco on shore, and sold it for 5 s. we made enquiry after the man, but he is got away; Herring said he was with Hallet in selling the tobacco, and had part of the money. They say themselves there were 10 lb. and they sold it for 5 s.</p>

               <p>Boyes. Herring came home with me by the run, the other I hire to work on board.</p>

            . I am mate of this ship. On Sunday morning the 11th of November, I went on board; the people there said there had been thieves on board. I took a candle and looked about the vessels; there were none broke on the Saturday; I saw a quantity of tobacco was gone, about 20 or 30 pounds. On Sunday morning, I went in search of the two prisoners, who were gone that morning: I took Hallett, who told me there were more concerned than himself. He told me where he had disposed of it, and shewed me the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to do for him in return for telling you?</p>
               <p>Steward. Nothing at all. I told him he should go along with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he expect not to be prosecuted for telling you so?</p>
               <p>Steward. I suppose he understood he was not to be prosecuted. On the Sunday night, I acquainted the captain with it, (I had let him go) the captain thought proper to take him up, and carry him before the Justice, and there he confest the same. When Herring was taken up, he confess'd he was concerned, but he said but little Hallet said Herring was as much concerned as he was.</p>
               <p>Hallet's Defence.</p>
               <p>The mate came on shore, on Summer's key, on Sunday, and took us on board, and told me, if would tell him which way the tobacco went, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070021"></xptr> should not be hurt, and I went and showed them the house where we sold it.</p>

               <p>Herring's Defence.</p>
               <p>I confessed nothing about it, because I was innocent.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. On the 28th of July I saw the prisoner come to Mr. Squires', the Devonshire Arms public-house, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning - I was in the house searching it because there had been a robbery; while I was in the cellar I saw a cupboard locked; I opened it, and found these two spoons in it; I asked Austin where he got them, he gave me some account, and I took the prisoner.</p>

            . I had the care of the cupboard at the Devonshire Arms - I keep my cords and provisions there; I put those two spoons in on the Thursday before; I got them from the prisoner; I had lent him some money before - he wanted some more, and I said I would not lend him any more till he gave me some security; he then brought these spoons - I knew he was in the Earl of Limerick's service; I did not open the spoons to see if there was any coronet on them.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to Lord Limerick's, in Mansfield-street, and the butler wished the prisoner to stop with me while he looked over the plate; I asked the prisoner what he had done; he said, nothing that he knew of - but in a few minutes he said he had given Austin two tea-spoons, as a security; the butler then returned, and was very very angry with him, but would not give him in charge; the prisoner, however, went with me to the office.</p>

            . I was butler to the Earl of Limerick - the prisoner has been two years in his service, and had twenty-four guineas a year; I heard there were two spoons at the office, and I went, and knew them - I went back, and spoke to the prisoner about them; they have a crest on them - the prisoner had property in his care to the amount of 500l.; I always found him honest.</p>

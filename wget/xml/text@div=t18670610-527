I was footman to Mr. Richard Stoneleigh Illingworth, of 9, Norfolk Crescent—on Friday, the 3rd of May, Barwell came there about a quarter to nine in the evening—I had known him before—I took him into the pantry—there was some plate there—I cannot remember what plate there was in the basket, but I can remember the plate that was stolen, two table-spoons, three tea-spoons, one dessert-spoon, five forks, and two egg-spoons, all silver; the spoons had my master's crest on them—I had seen them safe at dinner-time—I left the pantry for a short time to take up the coffee, and left Barwell in the pantry—I was away about five minutes—I went back to the pantry, Barwell was there, and he said he must be going—I went out afterwards to get some beer for the maid<lb></lb>servants—Barwell went out with me—I was away on that occasion about four minutes, or five it might have been—when I came back, from some<lb></lb>thing said to me, I examined the plate basket—I then missed the plate mentioned in the indictment.</p>

John, what do you mean?"—he was just roused out of his sleep—I decline to answer whether I have ever pawned any plate before—I was asked at the police-court if I had ever pawned or sold any plate, and I declined to answer, and I decline now.</p>

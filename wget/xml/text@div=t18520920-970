On Sunday evening, 5th Sept., from about half past 6 to quarter to 7 o'clock I was at the Duke of Clarence public house with my brother, Charles Graham, and my son John, John Hurd, Thomas Thompson, and William Bird—a man named Buchanan came in and said something, and after that a lot of Irish rushed in—all the prisoners were among them—there might be a dozen or more—Gallivan and Griffin came up to Hurd, and said, "This is one of them," and knocked him down—they then fell to kicking him—I stood at the side, and they fastened on me—<hi rend="italic">Ferrison</hi> knocked me down and kicked me in the fore<lb></lb>head, and Griffin likewise kicked me—by <hi rend="italic">Ferrison</hi> I mean the third one from me (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Gallivan</hi>)—I never heard of him by any other name—the farther one from me is Griffin—the next is <hi rend="italic">Ferrison</hi>, no, not <hi rend="italic">Ferrison</hi>—yes, <hi rend="italic">Ferrison</hi>—I have known them all by sight for years—the fourth is Callaghan—it was Ferris who kicked me—no, Gallivan kicked me—I did not say that Ferris kicked me—I was hit in the forehead, and knocked down, and then I was kicked by the prisoners—it was Gallivan who knocked me down—the third one from me now (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Gallivan</hi>)—he hit me in the forehead, and knocked me down, and then he kicked me—they all kicked me—Ferris kicked me in the head—I can swear that three out of the four kicked me—all of them, <hi rend="italic">barring</hi> Callaghan, kicked me, but he was there—this was not going on above four or five minutes, I believe, but I do not know, for I was dragged out senseless and bleeding, and taken to Mr. Flower, the surgeon.</p>

Last Sunday fortnight I was at the Duke of Clarence public house—six of us went there to have a half pint of gin—before they served us a man named Buchanan came and gave some alarm—the four prisoners rushed in, and about a dozen men after them—Griffin <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> hold of Hurd, and said, "That is the b—who struck me"—Gallivan <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> hold of Hurd, struck him, and knocked him down—then my brother was knocked down, and I can solemnly swear that all four of them kicked him; I saw them all four round him, and I saw them all four hoist up their feet—I saw him receive a kick on the head and on the eye: they dragged him out, and he had no senses—I cannot tell who dragged him out, they were Englishmen—they took him to Mr. King's, the doctor's; he was smothered in blood before he was dragged out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 140.) On the morning of Friday, the 8th of May, about twenty minutes after seven, I was on duty in Lee-road, at Lee, in Kent, near the beer-shop called the Scotchman, it is near Blackbeath—I heard abusive language inside, and remained outside some time, and saw the prisoner come out—as soon as he came out he swore be would smash the windows—the door of the house was open—I then went across the road to him, to persuade him to be quiet and go home—I was doing so for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I did not lay hold of him or do anything to him—he was swearing and abusing me and the land<lb></lb>lady all that time—he was not very drunk—he had been drinking—he said if I did not go on the other side of the road, he would report me off my beat—I said if he would be quiet and go home, I would go oh the other side of the road—I turned about to go on the other side of the road, thinking I might get rid of him, and just as I was in the act of turning round he up with his fist and struck me across the head—I then took hold of him by the collar, to take him to the station—that was the first time I had taken hold of him—he made great resistance and kicked me on the legs—I bad hold of his collar with both hands—he kicked my legs from under me, and we both went down together—it was a very violent kick—it threw me into the road—my leg is very much bruised—I got up and was stooping to pull him up quick out of the way of a watering-cart that was watering the road, and he gave me a severe kick in the side—I lost my breath through it—as soon as I came to myself I got up and laid hold of him by the collar again—I had previously called to a man named Leopard, as I thought, to assist me, but it proved to be a man named Smith—he refused to assist me—I called to several to assist me but they refused—I then called to a man named Thomas, who came to my assistance a few minutes after I was kicked—he is a shoe maker, and lives a few doors from the beer-shop—he persuaded me to tie the prisoner's hands, and went in doors and brought out a handkerchief—I had at that time received a great many blows and kicks besides the kick on the legs and stomach and the blow on the head—I laid him down in the road to tie his hands, and when I was stooping by the side of him he kicked me on the side of my eye three times, and also on the back of my head—he had a shoe on and tent the toe of it through the back part of my hat—he was in the act of repeating the blow, and Thomas caught hold of his legs—while this was going on he swore he would break my b—y head, and swore he would kick my eye out, and that he would break my legs—a man came up in a cart who assisted me in tying his legs—we got him into the cart and took him to the station—I was attended by Mr. Taylor, a surgeon, of Deptford—I felt very bad in my head and inside, and brought up a great quantity of blood—I am still unwell from bis kicking me—I had nothing the matter before—I have only done three hours' duty last week in the cool of the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Woods, and live as the Salmon and Ball, in Bunhill-row. I lost the articles stated in the indict<lb></lb>ment on the 25th of February—I saw the watch last night at the station-house—the prisoner is my own brother—he came to visit me last Thursday fortnight, and left on the 25th of February—he did not tell me he was going—I was not at home—I came home at nine o'clock, and missed him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You sent word for me to come from Ireland, and said you had something to give me, because I was poor—and you gave me the clothes and watch to pay my way home. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not—I have spoken the truth—I did not give him any of them—I never opened my lips to him about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am high-constable of Aylesbury, in Buckingham<lb></lb>shire, I saw the prisoner at Aylesbury, on the 26th of February, in a silversmith's shop, offering this watch for sale—he had a large parcel on his back—I called to him as he went away, and inquired of him what he had got—he said they were things his sister had given him to fetch home to his wife in Ireland—I took them back to the silversmith's shop, and examined the bundle—I found a coat, three shirts, some flannel, arsenate, and a variety of other things—he said his sister lived somewhere in Angel-court—I wrote a letter to that place, and found the woman—it was in the prosecutrix's neighbourhood—I had an answer to the letter, and the Magistrate committed him, and an application was made for a <hi rend="italic">hubeas</hi> to bring him up here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I got the things from my sister—I sent a letter to her—and she gave me an answer that she had given me the things.</p>

These are all my husband's property, and were all in my house the day the prisoner left—I never lent them to him, or gave him any one of them—I did not know of his taking them, till I came home at nine o'clock at night—I am in the haberdashery lime, and attend the markets—I had been to Romford, in Essex, that day, to sell haberdashery—I had not sent for him to come over from Ireland—he told me he started from home last Monday three weeks—I did not invite him over—he told me he had buried his wife, and had nothing to depend on, and came to me to see if I could give him assistance—I had no assistance for myself, but said if he would wait with patience I would let him have some of what I had, and would do the best for him, as he was my own brother—and without my knowledge he went off with the things.</p>

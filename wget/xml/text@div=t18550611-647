               <p>policeman—I came down stairs, and found the fan light over the street door forced open—there is a small window which opens, and the fastenings were forced away—I had seen it the night before, and fastened it myself about 12 o'clock—I was the last person up—I also observed some finger marks, and marks of corduroy trousers, and a mark at the bottom of the shutters something like a crowbar—I saw the prisoners in custody about half an hour afterwards at the Leman-street station—I did not lose anything, and the house had not been entered, only the fan light broken—my house is in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel.</p>

I was on duty at a quarter-past 3 o'clock that morning in Whitechapel-road—I saw the two prisoners and two others standing against the doorway of the last witness—I am sure the prisoners were two of those I saw—one of them was lifted up by the other three to the fan light, and the fan light was forced open—I could not dis<lb></lb>tinguish which it was—I and my brother officer were about twelve yards away—we went up, and they all four ran away—I ran about 700 yards and took Wilson—at that time there were two others in front of him, and I saw one pass a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> to the other—when I took Wilson he said, "I will go quietly"—he walked quietly a short distance, he then became very violent, and tried to throw me—I found on him a knife and some lucifers—he was perfectly sober—he shammed drunk in the station—he had corduroy trousers on of a very small cord, like the mark on the top of the fan light—the other officer took Frome—the other two got away.</p>

            . - Mr. Bolland. Do you remember delivering some sacks of flour to the prisoner, and how many sacks of flour did you deliver to him to go to Mr. Stock's at <placeName id="t18080217-81-crimeloc474">Islington</placeName>

               <p>JOHN STOCKS. - Mr. Bolland. You are a baker living in Camden street, Islington. - A. Yes, I ordered twenty sacks of flour of Mr. George, Jordan's waggon was standing at the door after he delivered the sacks; upon searching the waggon, I found a sack laid across down on the waggon it was covered with the tarpaulin, it could not have fell down, so it must have been laid down in that manner; the hay that he had brought for his horses was throwed up and the tail of the waggon was fastened up ready to go away; after he came back. I asked him to point out the twenty sacks of flour he had pitched, but he could not do it, he had intermixed them with some other sacks that were there, that had been brought in about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to point out to him that there was not twenty sacks. - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. Was it not possible on a certain number of sacks being moved away from the waggon it might have fell down there. - A. No, it was impossible to fall down against the front of the waggon, the taupaulin was tucked under the sides.</p>

            . I and my brother officer received an information, we went to where he was to deliver a load of flour; I was some distance at a public house watching him; when I saw him fasten up the tail of the waggon, I went over and asked him if Sir George was come to town, he said no; I asked him his name, he said

            ; I said then you are my prisoner for stealing a sack of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the waggon. - A. No, Mrs. Stock understanding what it was, she said to the prisoner; I hope you have not done just the same to us; he said no madam there is your twenty sacks of flour there; he pointed out to the twenty sacks; then I took him to the public house; soon after Mr. Stock's man came; he said therewas a sack of flour in the waggon. I went over and saw the sack of flour in the waggon, it lay quite flat and the taupaulin over it fastened at two corners.</p>

               <p>COURT. - Gentlemen of the Jury, we are all of opinion that it does not amount to a larceny; the offence was not compleated, if the waggon had been driven away it might be then.</p>

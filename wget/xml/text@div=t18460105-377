                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house and beer-shop at No. 123, Lower Thames-street. I have known the prisoner twenty-five years—about June last he was indebted to me about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in June he came to me with this bill, and said if I would discount it he would pay me the whole account, if I would give him the difference—I have known Mr. Morgan, of Stafford, twenty-six years—it purports to be accepted by him—I know him to be a respectable man—he is a stationer at Stafford, and was formerly the post-master—I took the bill, and gave the prisoner altogether 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there had been money previously lent—the bill was disho<lb></lb>noured</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050047"></xptr>
               <p>when due—the prisoner called on me about ten or eleven o'clock on the day it was due—I said, "Ryley, is that bill paid?"—he said, "It will be before banking hours," that there had been some disappointment with the party the money was to come up with, but he assured me it would be all right in the afternoon—I saw him again two or three days after, and said, "Ryley, this bill is not paid"—he said, "No, it is not"—I said, "It strikes me very forcibly there is something wrong about it"—he said, "No, there is not"—I said, "Well, I know Mr. Morgan, of Stafford, to be a respectable man, if you do not pay it I shall write to him"—he said, if I did he was a ruined man—I then said, "This is not Mr. Morgan's acceptance"—the prisoner said if I did write to Mr. Morgan the sooner he put himself in the Thames the better—I then said, "Is it your's?"—he made no answer—I afterwards gave him in charge for forging the acceptance—to the best of my belief the body of the bill is not in Mr. Morgan's handwriting—to the best of my belief it is the pri<lb></lb>soner's, and the acceptance also—I speak to the best of my belief—I will not swear it is his handwriting—I have not known Mr. Morgan's handwriting recently—I have seen him write several times—I believe both the body of the bill and the acceptance to be the handwriting of the prisoner—I believe they are not Mr. Morgan's writing.</p>

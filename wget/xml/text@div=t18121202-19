               <p>JOHN LACEY HAWKINS. I am one of the marshal-men. On the 20th of November I was in Aldersgate-street a little after six in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of the Castle and Falcon gateway, with a rough great coat under his arm, with something bulky in it. I thought he came out of the gateway rather sly; he appeared to be looking at his shadow I touched him on the arm, I said, my friend, I do not wish to be troublesome, I should like to know what you have got; he said, come along with me to the public-house, and I'll shew you; I said, why not give it a name, say what it is, and I dare say I shall be satisfied; he said, come to the public-house. I said, why give that trouble, I dare say it is your own; I am an officer. He went into a public-house in Little Britain and I followed after; he sat himself down by a table, and chucked this bag on the further side of him. I reached over and felt the bag. I then said, I am afraid there is something wrong, he said there was not; I said, you work at the Castle and Falcon, do not you; he said he did, for Mr. Wallington. He sent a person out for Mr. Wallington, he did not come. I said, I will go with you; I went with him, and going to the accompting-house, he said he was going to send them down to Egham. I told him I thought Mr. Wallington's concern was too large to send two pecks of beans down to Egham.</p>

            . I am a bailiff to Mr. Jacob Bosanquet, of Broxonbury, near Waltham-cross, Hertfordshire. On the 3d of September I missed two of his heifers out of a mead, called <placeName id="t18271025-74-crimeloc452">South-mead, in Hertfordshire</placeName>

            . I am a salesman at Smithfield - I live in Essex. Seven or eight weeks before the 3d of September I bought ten beasts out of those belonging to Mr. Bosanquet - he had about forty. I looked at the whole, and drew ten out of them: I noticed the whole in selecting them. I particularly noticed one which I rejected as not fit for market. On the 3d of September I saw the prisoner trying to get two heifers into Smithfield-market; it being fair day he had a great deal of trouble - one of them passed close by my cattle - I knew it to be the one I had so particularly handled at Bosanquet's. I questioned him about it for twenty minutes - he said he was employed by a person named Brown, to bring them to market, and was not to sell them unless he made 17l. a piece for them before his master came - I had them tied up with my stock, as he said his master would soon he there. I made him stop, and kept my eye on him: I was very busy, and the first opportunity he had he made off. I let the beasts remain there till the market was over, and then sent them home by Gibbs to Mr. Bosanquet. I looked for the prisoner daily, and met him on the 1st of October, near Shoreditch church - I jumped out of my gig, and took him.</p>

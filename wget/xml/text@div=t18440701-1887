                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William Jegon, coal-merchant, Upper Thames-street. The prisoner was one of his carmen—on the 25th of June, he had four tons of coals to deliver to Mr. Ellis, at Bromley—the coals were not the property of Mr. Jegon, but of Mr. Skipper, who transacts his business at Mr. Jegon's coal wharf—he contracts with Mr. Jegon to cart his coals to any of his customers, and is liable for their safe delivery.</p>

On Tuesday, the 25th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner accosted me, and asked if I wanted any coals—I said, "No"—he said he had half-a-ton of very good coals, and he would let me have them cheap—I said, "What do you want for them?"—he said 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, <hi rend="italic"></hi> "No, I don't want any to-day," and walked away—he followed me, and said, "Will you take three sacks?"—I said, "What do you want for them?"—he said 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said if they were good he could bring them in—he brought them in—I said, "What will you take for the remainder of the half-ton?"—he said 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—I then said, "You may bring then in"—he did so, and I gave him four half-crowns and one shilling—I usually pay 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a cwt.—these were cheaper, which in<lb></lb>duced meto buy them.</p>

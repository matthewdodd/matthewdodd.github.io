                  </hi>. I am a general salesman and live in Brick-lane. The prisoner came, on the evening of the 30th of August, about seven o'clock—he looked at several paintings two of which he selected, and said he had a very good customer of me—they were large, one a painting, and one a print—one was of Thomas Belcher—he said he should like to make a present of it to his brother, and he was very intimate with him—he asked the price—I said I could not take less than a guinea for the two—he said very well, he would see me the next day, and bring the cus<lb></lb>tomer—I had seen him put something into his pocket which I thought was his spectacles—I then missed the small painting, and called the boy to ask him about it—the prisoner went away directly I called the boy—I sent after the prisoner ask if he had taken it by mistake—the boy came back without it—I can out after him—the policeman saw me, and followed—I came up, and asked if he had taken it by mistake—he said no, he would come back—I said there was no need if he had not taken it—he said "No, search me"—I put my hand into his pocket and took it out—this is it.</p>

               <p>Court. Prisoner, - I feel it to be my duty to distinguish your case from that of ordinary larcenies, and it is necessary that the public should know why that sentence is passed upon you which I am about to pass. Nothing can create more misery and anguish in the mind of a mother, than to have a child taken from the place it knows; it is therefore not only an act of great injustice, but of great brutality and cruelty; I have, therefore, in every case of this sort, immediately passed a sentence as severe as the law would permit me; I regret that I cannot pass a more severe sentence upon you. If children are taken from their parents by the visitation of Providence, they must submit to that; but if they are in a state of suspence, not knowing whether they are living or dead, and unable to find them, it is the utmost misery that a parent can feel. I therefore pronounce upon you, that you be <rs id="t18010415-112-punish637" type="punishmentDescription">

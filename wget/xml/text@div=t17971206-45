I am a constable; I found these pots at the prisoner's lodgings, and this large lump of pewter in a melted state, (produces it;) there are five of the pots marked with Mr. Blake's name, the other is a plain pot with a mark of a star upon the side; I found two of the pots in the chimney corner, by the side of this frying-pan, (producing it;) I desired Blake to hold her while I searched, and she made her escape from him; when I apprehended her that same evening, she said, she melted pewter did not belong to her, she did not know how it came there; I found out a sort of cupboard, and I went into it upon all fours, and at the other side there was a door into another room, and a man came up, and asked me what I wanted there.</p>

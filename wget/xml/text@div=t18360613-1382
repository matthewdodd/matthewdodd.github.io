                  </hi>. I am a tin toy dealer—a dealer in all sorts of toys in fact, and live at No. 3, Nelson street, Church-street, Shoreditch. I was at the Sol's Arms last Thursday—I went there about half-past two o'clock—I have not been in court while Wagstaff gave his evidence—there were about eight or nine persons sitting at the table, but I cannot say exactly—the most I took notice of, was two gentlemen sitting nearly opposite me—there was some silver on the table—I said there from half-past to till near four o'clock it might be four or after four—I did not stay there till the officers came in—the two prisoners were there, sitting at the table—several persons came in after, me, but I took very little notice of them—and several went in and out—just as I got up to come out, there was a man came and asked if any body wanted to buy a watch, which is frequent thing at a public house—I was just getting up to come out at the time—I went out immediately—I am quite sure Wilson was in the room at the time the watch was offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known Wilson before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never saw him before, or Nelson—I knew none of the persons there—I certainly noticed some persons come in—Wilson and Nelson were there when I first went in—I did not notice whether they went in and out—but several persons did—I was sitting considering about my work and so forth—I did not particu<lb></lb>larly notice who went in and out—I notice the witness, Wagstaff, because he had his arm in a sling—the man who came in said, "Does any body want to buy a watch?"—I cannot tell now how many persons came in at that time, for they were bobbing about—every now and then the door opened, and one two, or more, came, I did not take particular notice—but just as I got or up, a man came and said, "Any body want to buy a watch?"—I did not notice whether there were any people with him—I went away directly.</p>

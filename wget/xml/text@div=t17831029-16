               <p>Does that door lead only into your house or into White's? - There is a street-door, this is my room door that was broke open, the street-door was on the latch, I returned between six and seven, I borrowed a candle from below, and went immediately up to my room, and I put the key in the door to try to unlock it, I found the key did not turn, and I went down stairs, and as I was going down stairs, the prisoner at the bar opened the door and looked over me, and he struck at the candle which I had in my hand, I ran down stairs, perceiving that there were more than one man in the room, and called murder and fire, the prisoner ran after me and knocked me down with his double fist on the crown of my head, and stepped over me, I am very positive to the prisoner, because I had the candle, I got up and was in the street very near as soon as him, and called stop thief, by which means this man was taken, another man came down and called stop thief, and he escaped, I did not find my leg hurt then.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner taken? - No, they brought him back, and asked me if I knew him, I said that was the man that opened the door and looked at me, he was taken in Sydney's alley, about two of three hundred yards off, the prisoner was taken before Justice Welch and committed, I went up stairs immediately, and found the room in the greatest confusion, the bed curtains torn down and laid on the floor, all my dirty linen was in a foul clothes basket in the closet, and they were removed from that place.</p>
               <p>Was the trunk removed from the place where it was left? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where were the tea-spoons? - The teaspoons were on a tea-board in the closet, they had reached out the tea-board and taken the spoons, and knocked down the china, and broke it, the teaspoons were taken from the room and when the prisoner was brought back, they were conveyed on the table, one bundle of the things they dropped in the passage, they were all in the house when I went away, every thing in its place, and they were all removed out of the place, if I had brought them all I must have had a cart, they had cut a bit of wood out of each drawer to try to open it.</p>

               <p>Does it stand open? - It is most commonly latched, I had been out about ten minutes, I went out at my shop-door, not at the street-door, and I cannot tell whether the door was latched or no, I heard the cry of murder and thieves, and a mob was gathering, and this woman was crying out, I ran up stairs and found her apartments open in the most distressed manner; the first thing I saw was a bundle in a dirty coloured apron, I did not see the prisoner till after he was brought back, and when he was brought back, the prosecutrix said, that is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290060"></xptr> the person, I will swear to him; he knocked me down.</p>

               <p>Could you distinguish people's faces? - I will not be sure, I heard stop thief cried, being on the same side of the way as the robbery was committed, I turned back, I saw the prisoner between where I was and the house that was robbed, which was about four doors, I did not see him come out of the house, but within four doors of the house, he was running, he passed me, and I hearing stop thief cried the second time, made after him, knowing him to be the man, because there was nobody else between the house and me, and stop thief was cried from that house, I pursued him, he turned round into Cranbourn-alley, he was not out of my sight till he fell down.</p>

               <p>Did you see him fall down? - I cannot swear that I saw him fall, but in the fall I lost him, which was just at the turning, the mob was to thick that I could not come to take him, I came up to him directly as he got up.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not lose sight of him, long enough for any other person to have come in his place? - No.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - I am positive of that.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again when you saw him get up? - I know him to be the man that I pursued.</p>
               <p>Is that the man? - That is the man, I took him by the arm, I did not loose him till I gave him into the hands of the man that belonged to the house, Mr. White.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough when he came by for you to distinguish the face? - Yes, as he came past the publick house door I saw him by the lamp, and the light of the place.</p>
               <p>Then it was not light enough for you to distinguish without the help of the lamp? - No.</p>

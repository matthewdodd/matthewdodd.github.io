                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, and live at Pimlico. On the 7th of December, about three o'clock, I went out of my shop, and locked the door, leaving nobody there—I came home about five o'clock, and found a pane of glass which had been broken before and had a slate behind it pushed in, and seven volumes gone—they were safe when I left the shop—the window was cracked before, and had a small hole in it.</p>

On the 7th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, Lloyd and Westley came in company together to our shop, but only Lloyd came in, Westley was waiting outside for him—Lloyd asked me if I bought waste paper—I told him "Yes"—he said he was sent by a neighbour of mine who lived opposite, where he had offered it, but she was not in want of any—I asked him who the books belonged to—he had brought four—he said they belonged to his mother and father, but were of no use to them, they could not read them—I found two were Latin cata<lb></lb>logues—I told him they were no use but as waste paper—he wanted 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I said I would only give 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb.—he asked me to give him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and took his name and addres—he left the shop and joined Westley—he gave me the name of William Vitzer, No. 5, Symons-street.</p>

On the 7th of September, Roe was at work with me moving some goods for Mr. Berry, at Duncannon Cottage, which is about six doors from the prosecutor's shop—Roe had a barrow full of goods, and I had some things on my head—we met Lloyd with a book in his hand—he told Roe he had got it from Mr. Mac Pherson's shop—I went on with Roe to Mr. Berry's with the things, and as we returned, I saw Roe go up to the prosecutor's window, put his hand through and take out a book, and give it to Westley, who was waiting close by with Lloyd—it was a broken window—Roe then went with me into Duncannon Cottage—Lloyd, West<lb></lb>ley, and another boy in a white pinafore, who was discharged at Queen-square, waited till we came out—we went down the street, and Roe said he would wait for them at the corner of Harriett-street, but we did not see them after.</p>

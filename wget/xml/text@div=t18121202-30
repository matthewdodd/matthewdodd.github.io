I had not been down stairs many minutes before I heard that he had left the warehouse. I went up stairs into the workshop, where I had called him down. I searched about the room, and on the ground, by the side of the shop-board, I found these pantaloons, which I had just been shewing to a customer in the warehouse. I let the pantaloons lay. In the evening he came down, and told me he had a favour to ask of me. I asked him what that was. He said, he wanted to go out for money that a man owed him. I told him he had better go up, and work, it was so early in the evening, when he returned he would be fit for nothing. He said, he must go out, let the consequence be what it would. I told him, if he was determined to leave his work, he must: he was not an apprentice that I could hold him. That gave me a suspicion there was something going away. Then I went up stairs, and saw the pantaloons were gone; and when I came down I challenged the prisoner with it. I took him into the parlour, and searched him, and in his hat I found these pantaloons. The prisoner is a young man of respectable connections.</p>

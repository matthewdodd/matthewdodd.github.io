On the 22d of October the prisoner came and agreed with me for a lodging, about ten in the morning; he said he should be there till May, and to have tea every morning; he was to have half a bed in the prosecutor's room; he told me he then lodged at the Red Lion in Holbourn; I told him I did not chuse to take any body in without a character; he came a second time and brought a bundle, about twelve o'clock; I gave him the key; he desired a pen and ink to write a letter, as he said to his mother; he went up, and staid about a quarter of an hour; I had not been for his character; he came down again and left the key, and pen and ink in the parlour on the bureau, I did not see he had any bundle away with him. I went to enquire his character, but could not find any such person that he recommended me to. The next morning Mr. Wood missed his things; I went up into the room, and looked about for the prisoner's bundle, and I found a bundle of hay-bands put behind a hamper; I saw no more of him till I saw him in Wood-street Compter on the 5th of November; I asked him if he knew me; he said he knew nothing of me; I said I knew him very well, he was the person that I wanted; I said, look at me again; do you not know Mrs. Hickman, where you left the hay-bands; he said again he knew nothing of me; here are the hay-bands; (producing a large quantity in a handkerchief) he had a great coat on, what he carried out must be under that.</p>

I am a surgeon, living at 129, Camberwell Road—I was called on the 31st August to the Castle public-house—I found a dead man there, lying on a table—he had a recent bruise on the forehead, a little abrasion on the nose, blood hanging about the nostrils, a bruise on the face, and the pupils of his eyes somewhat dilated—I made <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examin-ation on the 2nd September—the cause of death was effusion of blood over the anterior part of the brain into the ventricles, which I attribute to the blows.</p>

I am a detective officer of the <hi rend="italic">P</hi> division—I went to the Castle public-house on the 31st August—I saw deceased on the table, dead—I went in search of the prisoner, and found him next morning about 9.30 in a stable in Robin Hood Yard, washing himself—I said "John, I am going to take you into custody for causing his death"—he said "Very well, I am quite willing to go with you, I done no more than any other man would have done; last night I went home a little earlier than usual, found my wife out, and went in search of her; I saw her with the old gentleman, they were laughing and talking, I crossed over the road and allowed them to go past, and when I came back I saw them again, all at once I missed him, and went into the Castle to have a half-pint of beer, and saw them at the bar having a half-quartern of gin; I went round into their compart-ment, I could not stand it any longer; I went towards my wife and hit her in the face. The old gentleman got up and said 'Don't hit the woman,' that was the first thing he said, I then hit him two or three times, he dropped down on to the side of his head, fell on to the table, and his nose bled, but I did not think I had killed him; I then got hold of my wife and dragged her out"—on the road to the station he said "I used to five with that old gentleman in Islington, I removed from there; one day I was at home with a stiff neck, a little girl came to the door to see my missis, I put my head out of the window and saw the old gentleman beckoning her round the corner with his finger, I then went out and caught the two talking together; I cautioned him then that if I ever caught him along with her again it would be the wont for him.</p>

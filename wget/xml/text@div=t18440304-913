                  </hi>. I live in Norfolk-buildings, Somers-town, and am a shoemaker. On the 23rd of Feb., the prisoner came to my father's shop and asked if he would change him a pair of shoes—my father said he was rather tipsy, and he appeared so—I then saw him go to Mr. Green's, take something off the rail outside, and put it into is hat—I ran to Mrs. Green, and told her—I then went after him—I saw him do several other things of the same sort—I spoke to the policeman who brought him back, took his hat off, and there was a waistcoat in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Green. Somerville came to me, and I went outside the door and missed this waistcoat—the prisoner was brought back with it in his hat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I bought the boots in the street. I picked the waistcoat off the rail, that is the fact, but the woman was in the shop at the time; that cannot be brought against me; it may after a time, but not now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 641.) On the 20th of Aug., about eight o'clock at night, I was directed to watch a house in Half Moon-street—I saw the prisoner coming, whistling close by me, from Long-alley, with this plate of brass on his shoulder—he went into Mr. Ford's, in Half Moon-street—he had this apron over part of the brass, and part was not covered—I saw a "D" and "9" and "6" on it—I followed him into the house, and asked him where the property was that he had brought in—he said he had brought none—I said, "Yes, you did"—I looked round and saw this piece of brass partly covered with the cloth, and said, "This is what I went," and took him to the station—he said he came by it honestly, he bought it of Mr. Foster, in St. John's-square, Clerkenwell.</p>

                  </hi> I am shopman to Mr. William Farmer, of St. John-street. The prisoner was in the habit of coming there to make small purchases—on the evening of the 20th of Aug. he came and asked me to cut him off a small piece of brass—when I had cut about an inch and a half, he sent me to the back of the premised, about 120 feet, and requested me to cut him off a piece of steel, similar to what he had—I did, and them he desired me to go back again, and cut him ten inches from another piece—I went, and when I came back, he was gone—I went to the door, and met him on the threshold—he paid for the goods he had purchased, and went away—I did not miss the piece of brass till the policeman brought it—it bears my mark—I had cut the prisoner a piece off it or one like it—I could not swear it was this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the Plough public house, in Fore-street, Cripplegate. I had known the prisoner for about a fortnight before this happened, by frequenting my house on two or three occasions—on Tuesday morning, 13th May, he was there, in the billiard</p>

               <p>room, on the first floor—I saw him at 11 o'clock—it is a public billiard room—Ballard, the marker, was in the room at the time—the prisoner left about 10 minutes past 12 o'clock at noon—that same afternoon I missed my gold watch, with a gold locket and hair guard attached to it, from my dressing room table in my bedroom on the second floor—you can get from the billiard room to my bedroom by going up the second flight of stairs, you would then get to it at once—I had seen my watch safe at 5 minutes to 11 o'clock that morning—on leaving my bedroom then, I left my door open—on missing my watch I sent for Bull, the officer—I did not see the prisoner again until Thursday, 15th May; he then came to my house, between 12 and 1 o'clock, with a young man whom I did not know—upon seeing the prisoner, I asked him to give me back my watch which he had stolen—that was the first thing I said to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an optician and jeweller, and live at No. 12, Crosby-row, Walworth-road—I know the prisoner by seeing him pass by, nothing more. On 13th May last he came to my shop, and brought a gold watch, and offered it to me for sale—there was nothing attached to it—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him if it was his own—he said no, it did not belong to him, but to a young man in the city—I asked him what the young man wanted to sell it for—he said, because he wanted money—he asked 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I gave him three guineas—I remember Mrs. Stanton coming to my shop about 6 o'clock on the Thursday evening, two days afterwards—before she came, I had sold the watch to a gentleman—I do not know his name—I sold it in my shop over the counter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you examined before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was not examined on oath—I am sorry to say I was in custody—I was</p>

               <p>charged with receiving this watch—I am an optician and jeweller—I am not a watch maker—I have carried on business in the Walworth-road for about seven years, and there has never been any complaint against me—I have not been in business before that—I have never been in trouble—I swear that—I know the value of this watch—I have been informed that it is worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was stated to be worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the papers against me—it would be worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the trade, it would be worth something more to a purchaser—I sold it to a gentleman—I do not know that gentleman, not by name, I know him by sight—I got 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—that I swear—I sold it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to a gentleman I do not know.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did it get back to the prosecutrix? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The gentleman seeing the account in the newspapers, and knowing me, brought back the watch to me, and said, "Mr. Jones, I have seen the account of this watch in the newspapers, and, not wishing you to get into trouble, you return me the money I gave you for it, and there is the watch"—that is the truth—the gentleman came on a Saturday night—he gave me no address, I know nothing more—he came into my shop on Saturday night, just as I was busy with two or three customers, and gave me the watch, and said he had seen the account in the newspapers, and, not wishing to get me into trouble, he would give up the watch if I would return him the money, which I did</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not think it worth while to ask him his name or address, so that he might be a witness for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I never had been used to these cases before—I do not know who the man is—I pledge myself to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were you in custody before the watch was returned to the prosecutrix? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The watch was returned when I was out of custody—I was out on bail to get the watch back again—it was given up at the police court, Guildhall; I brought it in the first instance; as soon as I received the watch, I took it to the prosecutrix—it was given up to her in the police court—I offered myself as a witness immediately—the Alderman refused to allow me to be sworn—I could not offer myself as a witness, because I was given into custody for receiving the watch, well knowing it was stolen—I certainly can swear that I did not know it was stolen—I did not know it was stolen at the time the prisoner brought it to me—I did not ask him, when he brought it, whether it was <hi rend="italic">square,</hi> or whether it was got <hi rend="italic">on the cross;</hi> nothing of the kind, I asked no such question—I said nothing about its being <hi rend="italic">regular,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">on the cross,</hi> nor anything to that effect—I did not say that I wanted to know whether I could hang it in my window, or whether I should keep it quiet; I never said anything of the kind to him—I swear that—I did not say to the prisoner that he ought to have told me in the first instance that it was stolen; he represented to me that It belonged to a young man in the City, and that he gave it him to sell because he wanted the money, and that was on Whit Tuesday, and I considered it very feasible.</p>

I was at the Standard, public-house, on this night - I saw Hill eating some oysters, and heard her say she had lost her purse, and while she was gone out of the room the prisoner took the purse from her pocket, and put it behind the board - I went and took it - there was only a penny piece with a hole in it, and a button without a shank. I saw her searched at the watch-house, and saw her put her hand into her bosom, and slip it down by the side of her; I mentioned it to the person who searched her, and we found half-a-crown lying by her side.</p>

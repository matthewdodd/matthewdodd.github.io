                  </hi>. I am a farrier, and live in Shad's-row, Gray's Inn-road. On Monday night, the 3rd of May, I went out—I returned in about two hours—I found my parlour-door open, and missed the property stated from the parlour—the handkerchief was in the coat pocket—the front door opens with a latch-key—it is a private house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to a pawnbroker. On Tuesday afternoon, the 4th of May, the prisoner offered this coat in pledge—he gave the name of John Davis, and said he had brought it for his father, who lived at No. 20, Barbican—while he was in the shop, the policeman came in, and went with him, to see if he lived there—after he was gone, this handkerchief was found underneath a ledge which runs along the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Rose-and-Crown-yard, St. John-street, Smithfield. On the 4th of May, about a quarter-past two o'clock in the afternoon, as I came out of Rose-and-Crown-yard, I saw the prisoner in company with three others—the prisoner had a bundle under his arm, tied in a handkerchief like that now produced—I followed them, having re<lb></lb>ceived information from some children near the prosecutor's house—they walked down St. John-street, round Smithfield, to and fro, and then went down Charterhouse-street—I gave notice to a policeman, seeing them go to Mr. Whitaker's shop.</p>

I was fetched to Mr. Whitaker's shop—I found the prisoner there, attempting to pledge this coat—I asked him if he would go with me, as Mr. Whitaker had stated he came from his father's, in Barbican—he said he would—when we got out<lb></lb>side, he said it was no use going any further; a boy bad given it to him in Smithfield—at the station he said a man had given it to him in St. John-street, and told him to pledge it for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and what he got over that he might keep, and if he only got that, he was to have 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but he was not to bring it away with him.</p>

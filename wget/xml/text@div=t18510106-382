                  </hi>. I live in Fountain-street, Macclesfield, Cheshire I am a boatman, and in the habit of coming to London with a boat. On 19th Dec., about ten o'clock, I met the prisoner at the top of the New-road, and went with her to 10, George-street, Grove's-row, Marylebone, which is a private house—we went into the kitchen—she asked me to send for some drink—I pulled my money out in my hand, and she snatched it away; it wast two shillings, a sixpence, and twelve halfpence—I had looked at it about eight o'clock, when I started from the City—she went out of the kitchen, and I followed her—she made a noise, and two young men came from a back place and caught hold of me while she got clear away—after she was gone they let me go—they did not hurt me or speak to me, or I to them—I walked up and down the road for an hour and a half, and at last I saw her come home with another young man, and go into the same house with him—I went and told a constable—(I had before given him a description of the girl, and he said I must get more description of her)—he went with me and took the prisoner into custody—I charged her with snatching the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my hand—she said she had not seen me with her eyes before—the two shillings I had, had a lion on one side of them—I had had them twelve months; they were given me as a present by my sister.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He was to stop with me for the night, and the money was not sufficient—he gave me the three shillings while I was on the bed.</p>

On the. night of 19th Dec., about a quarter before eleven, I met the last witness in George-street, Lisson-grove—he complained of being robbed—I saw him again at a quarter to twelve, and in consequence of information he then gave me I went with him to 10, George-street, Lisson-grove, which is a common brothel—I went into the kitchen with him, and found the prisoner there, and a young man who was drunk—I told the prisoner she was charged with robbing the prosecutor of three shillings—she said, "I know nothing about it; I never saw him before till to-night"—I took her in custody, took her to the station, and gave her to the female searcher—the prosecutor was sober—when I took the prisoner she said, referring to the drunken man, "Here is a man here who can prove that he has been with me all the whole night." <hi rend="smallCaps">ANN BROWN</hi>.

             was ashore. The prisoner was cabin boy. Martin belonged to the big Aimwell; he and Hill were in the Blucher. Hill gave me a bottle of wine out of the cabin; I drank a drop, we took it on board the Aimwell - Francis was with us; we played at cards, and Martin and Hill went and fetched a bottle of gin from the cabin of the Blucher, and while they were gone Francis and I watched them, and saw them go to the cabin - they got down the sky light. The gin was drank among us, and just as we had done King came in; we had some raisins and things eating; we went to sleep, and when I awoke Hill was in bed - he and Martin were talking together; they were tipsy - I told the mate of it.</p>

            . I am a constable in the London Docks; the watchman sent me to take the prisoners. I saw King coming from the Aimwell with his bed and bedding, as if he was leaving the vessel. I saw Martin soon after, and asked him what he did on board the Blucher; he said nothing. I found eight dollars and a half in his waistcoat pocket; he said he took them of a Spanish captain. I found a few raisins on Martin, and a bottle of gin and brandy. I went on board the Blucher cabin with the mate and found the locker forced open.</p>

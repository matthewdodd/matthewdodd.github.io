               <p>I was not in the garret; I went to speak to the gentlewoman that lodged in the two pair of stairs, to ask a person to give me a character; she was not at home.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Had you fastened your garret-door? - Yes; I had the key in my parlour.</p>
               <p>What, did you lock the door? - Oh yes! I locked it myself, and hung the key in my parlour; when I came up, the door was standing wide open; it was wrenched open.</p>
               <p>What marks were there upon the door of its having been wrenched open? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it was slipped back, and an old lock? - No, no, no, no! I am too well used to it for that, it is not a bad lock.</p>
               <p>There were no marks of violence on the door? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What does the bolt of the lock shut into? - Into a great iron staple.</p>
               <p>In what condition was that staple? - It was in the same place.</p>

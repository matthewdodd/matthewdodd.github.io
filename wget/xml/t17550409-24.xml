               <p>Timperly. No, not to make observation on any thing; he left his wife in possession, and I thought I had no right to go into the room then.</p>

            . I was servant to the prisoner and his wife, they gave me a shilling a week; I remember all these things being in the room, except the saucepan; but I did not know whose goods they were; the prisoner's wife sent me with some of the goods to pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the hearing?</p>
               <p>Aldervice. He was; he and she were in bed at the same time when I went to pawn them.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods did you carry to pawn?</p>
               <p>Aldervice. I carried the sheets and looking-glass, and borrowed a shilling on each; these I carried at twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give it to?</p>
               <p>Aldervice. To Mrs. Willes (their right name is Wallis); he was in bed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sheet taken off the bed when he was in bed?</p>
               <p>Aldervice. No, it was taken off before. I pawned a blanket for eight-pence by her orders; the prisoner was then in trouble, and not at home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether the goods mentioned were not in the room the day I was taken?</p>
               <p>Aldervice. They were all in the room; except the sheet and blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms had he?</p>
               <p>Aldervice. One; I lay up stairs with my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was the prisoner in?</p>
               <p>Aldervice. He is a painter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man awake or asleep when the woman gave you directions?</p>
               <p>Aldervice. I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When did you charge the prisoners with this robbery?</p>

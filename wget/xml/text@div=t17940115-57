               <p>Q. Where is the kitchen, on the ground floor? - It is below in the cellar, and when he came close to the cellar door, he made a full stand, and dragged away the two shirts with him; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150147"></xptr>were hanging on the side of the door, pinned on a listing, he got them off from the pin; there was a backney coach passing at the time, and he jumped up behind the backney coach, and I followed him, when I saw him take them away I pursued him, and I said, you dog I have got you now; with that he jumped off the coach with the two shirts on his arm in this manner, and ran off; I still kept the pursuit, as soon as I got to the bottom of the street, I thought the watchman would take him, and I hallooed out stop thief! and the watchman followed him directly, and sprung his rattle, and he ran up as far as the Angel inn, and running through the gateway right opposite, he got through the two posts, and I kept following him, and I was close up to him in the passage, but I was afraid to touch him, for fear of his knocking me down, when he got out of the passage he fell down, and I stood over him, and says I to the man, it is there you lay last, and gave charge to the watchman of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the shirts? - He threw them away; I saw him just as he got half way past the coach.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming from work last Saturday night was a week, about half past twelve, I came from my pay table, I had been at work hard all the week, I was going down Monmouth-street to buy me an handkerchief to wear; just very nigh the bottom a man runs against me, and knocked me down backwards; there was a coach going by, and the man jumped up behind, and this gentleman comes up to me, and when I recovered myself again I heard a cry of stop thief! and I got up and ran after this man, and this gentleman ran after me, and catched hold of me, and said I stole these shirts. I have not a friend in the world, I work hard for my living.</p>

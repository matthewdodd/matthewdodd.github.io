                  </hi>. I am a shoe-maker, and live at Woolwich. On Monday, the 26th of October, I had some shoes safe in my shop—I missed a pair on the Wednesday following—on Thursday evening I saw McGee and another little boy under my window, talking together—McGee ran away, I ran after him, and accused him of having taken my shoes—he denied it — I said I should take him to the shop where I had seen the shoes—(I had seen them at a pawnbroker's)—I took him, but they could not identify him, and I let him go—I saw him afterwards with Hawks-worth, the same evening—I had Hawksworth apprehended, and the pawn<lb></lb>broker identified him—these are my shoes, I had not sold them.</p>

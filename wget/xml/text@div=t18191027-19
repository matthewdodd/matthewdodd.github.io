On the 2d of October, between ten and eleven o'clock, I brought the tea-things from my mistress's breakfast-table, and placed them on a table under the kitchen-window; there is a garden before the house two or three yards long - any one can open the gate - the kitchen-window is even with the ground; a person in the garden can put their hands in at the window. I left the things there, and went up stairs on other business. In about half an hour I heard a noise as if something was at the window, and in consequence of information from

             I went to look, and missed two silver tea-spoons, which were there when I went away. I found the window half open. I am sure I left it shut down close.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it fastened - A. No, my Lord, it is a sash-window. I do not know the value of the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner at all - A. No my Lord. Before I missed the spoons I was in the parlour, and saw a man come into the garden with apples in his hand - that was not the prisoner; I saw him go out at the gate, and did not see him do any thing at the window. As soon as I missed the spoons, I went out and saw the prisoner in Pott-street, which is about five minutes walk from our house - he was then with the other man. I had not seen them together before. They turned down at the bottom where there is no thoroughfare. As they returned I collared the other man, and told him to stand still, for he had been robbing; the prisoner heard it and immediately walked away. The other man desired me to let him go; he lifted up his hand to strike me, and I let him go.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner go to - A. He walked up the street, and Lloyd, the officer, took him, but found nothing on him, except some money. My mistress was up in the bed-room at the time; I saw her go up - she could not come down without my seeing or hearing her - she did not go out. I was out of the house about two minutes in pursuit of the men.</p>

            . I live opposite the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner and another young man going along the Bethnal-green-road; I saw the prisoner take four apples out of his pocket. He opened Mr. Timmons's gate, and went through the garden to the kitchen-window - it was the prisoner at the bar; I saw him push the window open. He immediately went out of the garden to the other young man, who was waiting for him; when he got to him he clapped his hands together as a signal, and gave him the four apples. Then the other young man went to the kitchen-window with them, put his hand in, and brought something out, which shone like silver - I immediately went over and told the servant. They both went down Pott-street. The man put the silver into his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear to join him when he came out - A. Yes, they went away together - he was about twenty yards from him when he took the spoons out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Mrs. Timmons at the time - A. I saw her up stairs in her room through the window; I do not think they saw me. I saw only four apples. They had neither basket, donkey, or cart.</p>

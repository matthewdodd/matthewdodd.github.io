               <p>Q. What do you say with respect to the Money, or any things you have lost?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I have lost all these things, and a great many more than are mentioned in the Indictment.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you any other Reason to say that they robb'd you?</p>
               <p>Cooper. When they were first taken up there was a Spoon in their Room; I found also a Purse in their Room; but they had taken out the Money. After they had come out of Bridewell the Purse was found in their Room:- That was in March .</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in Bridewell ?</p>

            . What are you?</p>
               <p>Jones. I am Constable. I had a Search-Warrant brought me by Mrs Cooper to search the Prisoners Lodgings in Pear-tree-court by Clerkenwell Church, and Mrs Cooper found these things under the Bed. This was the Saturday; the Prisoners had been then in Bridewell almost a Week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else there when you search'd their Lodgings?</p>
               <p>Jones. There was one Body, Justice Hole sent him.</p>
               <p>Cooper. That Man knock'd me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he knock the Woman down?</p>
               <p>Jones. He push'd her down upon the Bed, and said, she would swear every thing in the house was her's.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoners. What have you to say for yourselves with respect to the Facts that have been charg'd upon you. There was a Purse, which she swears belongs to her, which was found in your Room; how came that Purse there?</p>

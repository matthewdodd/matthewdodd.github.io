               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a lodger of yours - A. He slept three nights in the house in a two pair of stairs room, there were three beds and bedding in the room. On the morning after Good Friday I missed two sheets out of the room. The prisoner was brought to my house on the Saturday by the officer; I knew the sheets when I saw them, they are worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>JOHN KINNERSLEY. I am an officer. I was sent for by Mr. Jones, a dealer in old clothes Sparrow corner; I there found the prisoner, he had a pair of sheets in his possession; I took the prisoner to the counter on suspicion; this was on Good Friday. The prisoner at the Mansion-house said who the sheets belonged to. He went with me to Mrs. Conigan, and Mrs. Conigan claimed the sheets. These are the sheets.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my sheets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was a woman with me, she went off before the constable came, I had been there five days, I went out drinking, and I had run out my money; I took them to the pawnbroker's to sell them.</p>

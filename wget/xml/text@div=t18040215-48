Yes, with my husband; I knew the prisoner at the bar for near two years; she came to my master's house when he was out of town, on Tuesday, the 2d of January, and asked me if I would let her sleep in the house a few nights; I told her I would, I could do such a thing, but I was afraid of getting anger of my mistress.</p>

               <p>Q. What silk was it? - A. A cloak, which had been laid by for mourning; I asked her whether she had touched any thing else; she said, no, she never put that there; I told her there was nobody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150036"></xptr>in the house to touch it but her; she then confessed.</p>

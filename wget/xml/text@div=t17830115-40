             Sworn.</p>
               <p>You are clerk to justice Wilmot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see either of the prisoners at the bar? - Yes, both of them; I heard Hayland declare in the office upon his examination, that he had delivered and sold some hops, I think he said a bag of hops to a brewer in Virginia Street, Ratcliffe Highway; he did not say where he got it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cotton's Council. Did you take it down in writing? - No, I did not, In consequence of that information a search warrant was issued out, and delivered to the officer, and soon afterwards there was a part of a bag of hops brought into the office from, as I understand Mr. Cotton's house; Hayland, said he, had sold some hops to Cotton, he wanted to make a discovery, he was charged with having that bag of hops in his custody, they took Hayland and the hops together.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not Hayland asked whose hop bag it was, and how he came by it? I do not know that he said how he came by it; he said, he had delivered and sold a bag of hops to one Cotton in Virginia Street, nobody knew any such person as Cotton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cotton's Council. Pray Mr. justice's clerk, how came Hayland was not asked whose hops these were, and how he got them? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. When Hayland was charged with stealing hops that were found upon him, did nobody ask him where he had got these hops, and whose they were? - That was asked of him, I believe before, and he had acknowledged before to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cotton's Council. You was not present? - The officer is in Court.</p>
               <p>When Hayland said he had sold a bag of hops to Cotton, then there was a search warrant made out.</p>
               <p>Court. Were no questions asked? - I cannot say there was.</p>
               <p>When a man is charged for felony, and tells where he has sold the goods, is it an usual thing in your office not to ask him where he got them? - It is not my place to ask him, he might be asked it, the justice examined him, I do not recollect his being asked it. - Was he present when that bag was brought back? - I really am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Take time and recollect, Sir, you as a justice's clerk must know what it is your duty to attend to? - There is another besides me, I do not do all the business.</p>
               <p>But you was present then, was Hayland there when Cotton and the bag was brought back, that is a plain question? - Upon my word, I cannot say directly.</p>
               <p>Did Hayland ever see in your presence that bag that was brought back? - I think he did.</p>
               <p>Recollect, Sir? - I did not expect to be called upon here.</p>
               <p>You must expect it, it is your duty to be called upon, for what purpose are examinations taken before a magistrate? - That is very true, Sir.</p>

               <p>I do not know what kind of clerk you are, you are but a very bad witness; do you know it was not? - It was done all that was necessary; the examination of Hayland was taken down and returned.</p>

               <p>Was you present when this bag of hops was brought back from Cotton's? - I was.</p>
               <p>Then cannot you recollect whether Hayland was there, and acknowledged he had sold it to Cotton? - I recollect he acknowledged he had sold it to Cotton, I do not know that I saw the bag any more.</p>

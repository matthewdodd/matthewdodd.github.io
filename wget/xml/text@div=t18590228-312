                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hill, living at Wood-street, King's-square, Middlesex—my husband is a publican—on Friday, 17th December, two men came to our house between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—Jones I can swear to—I don't know the other—Jones came towards the parlour—I got up and said, "What is it you want; is it the bagatelle room?"—he said it was—I went and got the bagatelle balls,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185902280015"></xptr>
               <p>and my husband took them up stairs—after a time Tones came down again and asked for a pint of porter, and walked up stairs with it—about ten minutes after they both came down and went out of the door—Jones went out first and held the door open with his right hand for the other to pass out—his left hand was in his pocket After they had gone I ran up stairs and the balls were gone—there were nine of them—they were ivory, and are valued at 18".—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—can swear to three of them—Mr. Hill knows the marks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness—on 17th December, two men came into our house—Jones I recollect perfectly—Hill I will not swear to, but I think him to be the other man—my wife answered them first—went up and took the balls to them, and put them on the table out of the bag—they called for a pint of porter which I took up to them—there were nine balls—these are three of them, I can swear to them—I have often handled them—described one as being partly dark and partly red, with the colour nearly gone out of it—and one has been plugged on one side, with a darker colour about the size of a pepper-corn—the other has a crack on one side, about three parts of an inch long—am quite certain these are the balls—there were no other persons but the prisoners in the room that afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Tarrant, a pawnbroker of Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriars. On 17th December, Jones came with nine bagatelle balls, which he wanted to pledge for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—asked him to whom they belonged—he said they were his own—asked if he had any more—he said he had not—heard a noise outside the door like the rattling of bagatelle balls, and I went out, and found a person with a hand in each pocket, rattling something which I thought to be bagatelle balls—do not see that person here—returned to Jones, detained him, and gave him into custody with the balls.</p>

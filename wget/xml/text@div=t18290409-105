I had the basket to take to Parliament-street; I felt hungry, and gave a boy a penny to get me a loaf; I set down the basket to rest myself, and went to look for the boy, who was gone a long while - I told two young men to look after the basket while I went- I could not find the boy, and when I came back the basket and the young men were gone.</p>

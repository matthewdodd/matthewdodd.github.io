On the sixth of August I was coming home to my lodging in Red-Lion Square, betwixt twelve and one in the morning, when I met this girl in the street, to the best of my knowledge, at the top of Drury-Lane. She asked me where I was going; I replied to my lodging. Said she, I have a very good lodging, you may go along with me. She took hold of me, and said I should. I asked her what I must give her for the night, and offered her half a crown. She would not take it at first, so I was going away. Then she said, Come, I will take your money, rather than part with you. I then said, If you are an honest girl, I will give you a little more. She then replied, she had a good room, and no person should come to meddle with me. I went with her, but do not know the name of the street. She locked the door. I put my breeches under my head, when I went to bed, and soon fell asleep. The next thing I heard was her calling to some of her acquaintance at the window. It awaked me, and I immediately sought for my breeches, and found them much in the same place where I had placed them; but my money was gone, which was half a guinea, twelve shillings, and three half crowns. I had put it in a purse in my right hand breeches pocket. I then said, Young woman, you told me you would be very honest. Do you miss any thing? said she. I said, I miss all my money, and if you do not give it me, I will go for a constable. Said she, I do not care for what you or a constable can do. I immediately went, and met with a young man, who directed me to a constable, while he watched at the door. The constable and I came, but she was gone to another house. We went there, and found her in bed with another woman. She had tied a handkerchief about her face, that she might appear like a man. Said the constable, Let us take the things from about this head, and see whether it is a man or a woman. We did so, and found it to be the woman. She then abused the constable in such a manner, as nothing could be like it. I was just come from Tunbridge-Wells, and was as sober as I am this minute. I have lost my place by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your money when you went into the room?</p>
               <p>Ross. I am sure I had.</p>

            . I am the officer. I went with the prosecutor, and found her in another house. After we discovered her, by undressing her head, she was in a terrible passion, and swore and made a great noise. She said she had got the money, and she would take care and keep it. There were many people heard her say that.</p>

               <p>I met with this footman, at ten at night, in Parker's Lane, along with another woman: she had a husband, and he could not be with her; but she called me over and said, There is a man will lie with you all night. He then came, and told me he would give me half a crown. I went home with him, and lay with him. Some time after he said he had lost some money. He then searched his purse, and found half a crown in it, and then said, if I would make it up half a guinea, he would let me go: I replied, if I had it, I would spend it. Here is a note of hand which he gave me, with his name at the bottom of it. (Produced in Court.)</p>

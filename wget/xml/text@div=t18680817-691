I am the wife of George Parker, of 8, James Street, Oxford Street—the prisoner and his wife lived in the same house; they occupied the back room, third floor—I occupy the fourth floor front—on 20th July, about 10.30 at night, I came out of my room on to the landing, hearing cries of murder proceeding from their room, also cries of "Police, will no one come to assist me?"—it was a female voice—I did not hear a man's voice at all—I next heard her say, "For God's sake, don't"—I could</p>

I live at 9, James Street, Oxford Street, next door to the prisoner—on the night of 20th July, I was in my bed-room, the back room first floor, with my window open—I heard a person fall down—I came out to her as quick as I could—I found her lying on the leads, on her right side, with her hand under her head, insensible—I asked for some water and a towel, which was brought me, and I washed her face—she had a cut on the side of her head, which was bleeding—the blood was running from her—she was about five minutes before she came-to, and when I lifted up her head, she said, "Oh, don't hurt me."</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital when the prisoner's wife was brought there, on 20th July, about 11.45 at night—I found that she had dislocation of the left hip joint, several ribs fractured on the right side, and numerous scratches on the front of the throat, I should say from a person's nails—I did not notice any wound in the head; I ex<lb></lb>amined it, but not very carefully; there may have been one, but I think I should have seen it if there had been one—she was not bleeding at all about the face—the body was covered with contusions, which were produced by some blunt instrument, or a fist, or by rough handling—the blood the last witness speaks to, on the head, might have been from the scratches on</p>

               <p>the neck—a fall from a window would not produce all the injuries I found; it would produce the dislocation of the hip joint, and some of the contu<lb></lb>sions on the side, but I can't see how the fractured ribs would have been produced by the fall—she must have fallen on the left side to dislocate the hip, and I can't imagine how the ribs on the right side could have been fractured by the fall, nor the bruises about the body generally—she was in danger of her life, but she is now convalescent—she left the hospital on the 10th August—she is a slight woman.</p>

I am a currier, and live at 4, Henrietta Street, Man<lb></lb>Chester Square, in the back parlour, which looks out on the back of the house where the prisoner lives—on the night of 20th July, I heard cries of "Murder! help! police!" in a woman's voice, from the back, that con<lb></lb>tinued for about half an hour—after that I heard a fall of something, I could not imagine what, and a crash of a window, and then the window shut, the sound was like broken glass, and then a fall of some heavy body—it was a dull sound, as if it fell on the pavement, or something at the back of the house, and immediately after I heard a man's voice say, "Take that"—I ran round, and found the deceased on the leads of No. 8, just under the window—I fancy she must have fallen upon the next window, before she reached the leads, by my hearing the glass break—there was a window broken on the second door—I did not observe whether the leads were flat, or whether there were ribs to it—there is a wall six or seven feet high round the leads.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hawker, and live at No. 3, Wine-court, White-chapel. On 27th Aug. last, about 3 o'clock in the day, I was near Petticoat-lane—I had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with me, all in silver—it was in my left pocket—I felt it last when it was taken from me—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in Petticoat-lane, a fight between two boys—I was looking on—I saw these two men with a female—I had never seen them before—I said it was a pity to see them fighting, and some one gave me a blow in the face—on my receiving that blow, Benjamin said to me, "Don't interfere with the boys fighting; come with me, and we will have something to drink"—I went with them to the Horns public house, and I paid for two pots of ale, which we had in the parlour—we then came to the bar, and Benjamin called out for a quartern of whiskey, for which I paid 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Benjamin put something into it from a pot which stood by, which made it look like sherry—it was white before—I drank part of it, and they the rest—there was no harm in what the prisoner put into it—a person came in and asked the landlord for change for a sove<lb></lb>reign—the landlord said he could not do it without going up stairs, and I gave him change—we afterwards left, and went to a beer house, and had some beer, and I began to feel rather queer—I said I had better think about going home—Benjamin said, "We are going your way, and will accompany you"—we left the beer house, and all went together—we went to Thrawl-street, Spitalfields—Benjamin had said before, when I said about going home, "You had better come home with me and have some tea"—after this, Cornelius went into a house, and a female met him, and I went into the passage of the house—when I got into the passage, Cornelius came out of a back room, and gave me a blow upon the face—it partly sent me to the ground—while I was falling, Benjamin gave me a blow on the side of the face, and I fell to the ground—the woman, when I was on the ground, tore part of my hair out of my head—Benjamin leaped on me, with his knee across my chest, and said, "Kill the b—"—I bled from the mouth and nose—I found they were after my money, and I took my hand from under me, and felt in my left hand pocket, and the money was there—Cornelius put his hand also in my pocket—I seized him by the arm—I never saw any money, but I thought he, Benjamin, took something from Cornelius's hand,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150087"></xptr>
               <p>and then made his escape with the woman—I held Cornelius, and afterwards took him to Brick-lane, and saw a constable in Brick-lane—my money was all gone—Cornelius was taken to the station house, and I charged him with assaulting me and robbing me—I was taken to the hospital, and afterwards, while I was there, Benjamin was brought to me—I am sure that Benjamin is the man that escaped.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 17). The prosecutor gave Cornelius Donohue into my custody—it was about 8 o'clock in the evening—he was in liquor—he charged Cornelius with assaulting him—seeing them come arm in arm together, I thought he was joking—I referred him to the Magistrate for a summons—(we have not the power to take a person into custody for a mere assault, unless we have seen it, without a summons)—when I said could not take him for the assault, he said he charged him with robbing him of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Cornelius said, "I did not do it; I took another man, my brother Benjamin, off from him, with whom he was fighting; I never took any money from him"—I then took him to the station house—the prosecutor was so ill that he was obliged to go to the hospital—he seemed to be injured internally, in the throat—there was blood came from him—it appeared to have come from the mouth—he told me there was another man—he gave me no description, but he told me it was a brother of this man's—I took Benjamin on the Friday morning, and took him to the hospital—directly I took him into the ward, the prosecutor said, "That is the man that knelt upon my chest"—Benjamin said, "I don't know anything at all about it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cornelius Donohue. Q.</hi> Did the prosecutor come up quietly with me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, quietly, and not as if he was alarmed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I live at No. 3, Wine-court, Whitechapel-road. I hawk round the streets with a barrow of crockery—I was going to buy some goods in Sun-street, Bishopsgate, to go to market—no one that I know of knew that I had this money—I was very drunk—I was drinking from 3 o'clock till 8—I can swear that these are the men who took my money—I am sure that I felt it when on the ground—the reason I did not charge Benjamin at first, was because I was the worse for liquor—the reason he came up quietly was that we had several struggles in the street, and he saw the constable, and thought it would be better if he went quietly—it was about sixty yards from where it took place, that I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners in their defence put in the following paper</hi>: "On the morning in question we went into the Horns public house together, and there saw the prosecutor drinking with a woman; he accosted us, and asked us to take a glass of ale with him; we did so, and he left the public house with the female; we saw no more of him till about 7 o'clock in the evening, when we accidentally met him, very much intoxicated, and bleeding from the nose; he knocked up against the prisoner Benjamin, and upon our reasoning with him, he struck Benjamin in the chest; the prisoner Cor<lb></lb>nelius then went up to him, to endeavour to make peace, upon which he asked him to go and have some drink with him, at the same time shaking</p>

               <p>his hand; Cornelius then advised his brother Benjamin to go away home, which he did, and not notice an intoxicated man; the prisoner Cornelius then walked a little way with him for peace's sake, when he met two policemen; the prosecutor then gave Cornelius in charge for an assault only, but the policeman refused to take him, on the grounds that he had not witnessed the affair, and advised complainant to summon him, and told prisoner to go about his business; the prosecutor, finding that he could not get hold of the prisoner by fair means, then said, 'Well, if you won't take him in charge for the assault, I shall charge him with robbing me,' and the prisoner Cornelius was then taken into custody; at that time no mention was made of Benjamin being concerned in robbing him, until the following day, when he was arrested. We beg to submit, that the man must have been during the day in bad society, and being in a state of intoxication, was robbed by some one, when in a fight with some people, as he himself admits, and that, meeting us, he gave us unjustly in charge; besides, if he had been robbed by Cornelius, would he not have given him in charge for the robbery in the first instance, instead of the assault?")</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to William Neville and others, of Gresham Street; on the afternoon of 7th Dec the prisoner came and produced this order—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "70, Burlington Arcade, 27—11—57; Messrs. Neville, let the bearer have twelve dozen men's white merino, half hose, from Mrs. Darke.")—I told the prisoner that I did not know him, and asked if he could give me a reference to any house in the neighbourhood to whom I could apply; he said he did not know—I named several houses to him, amongst them Messrs. Morley's—he said he thought they might know him, and I accompanied him there—I asked him if he brought the order from Mrs. Darke; he said, "Yes"—they did not recognize him at Morley's, and I returned with him to our warehouse, gave him a portion of the goods ordered, and sent a porter with him with orders to give him into custody if the order was not genuine.</p>

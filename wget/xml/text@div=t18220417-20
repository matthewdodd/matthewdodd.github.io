I knocked him down each time that I struck him; he got up, and was angry with me. Chandler said he would be answerable for the beer, if I would not hit him again - three of us sat down, and we all drank the beer; he drank some. This lasted ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and after I got up he hit me under the chin - I do not know whether it was with his fist or not. I went to strike him again, but whether I did or not I do not know; I followed him in before this; he had asked me to pay his fine. He asked me to fight him, I said I would not because he was less than myself; then he struck me under the chin, without saying any thing more; I tried to hit him again, but do not know whether I did or not, and then he cut me on the thigh; I saw nothing in his hand - then he cut me on the hip; we were struggling all this time; I had gone up to him to follow him in, and tried to strike him; I saw nothing in his hand - we had been quarrelling all the while. My hip and thigh bled; we were talking angrily together from the first - I gave him the first blow.</p>

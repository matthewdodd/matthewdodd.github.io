His wife was employed in rubbing something in a wet rag, which she threw under the bed, and which I afterwards picked up. I told them to stand up, for they were prisoners., I was tying them together, when the man threw his left hand up, and put something in his mouth; I immediately seized him by the throat, and he chuckled a little, and he threw up forty into my hand; they are all brass, in the shape of a sixpence; there is a mark of a little a on almost all of them; they were so when I took hold of them. I searched him; but there was nothing more on him. I then searched his wife, and found a quantity on he; they were in her pocket; there were also six finished in her pocket. All the pieces I found, finished, or unfinished, were marked with the letter a, which on all of them seemed to me made with the same punch. The finished ones were rolled up with paper between them; they were brighte when I found them, than they are now they now assume a greenish appearance. The bustle brought Squibbing with the other two prisoner, and I tied them all together, and searched the two Mitchells; on the elder

A small pair of plyers; they are brassy also. Also a small quantity of cream of letter, and a small quantity of salt. I don't know the use of these articles; a rubbing stick like the other, and a little drop of aquafortis in a bottle; two pieces of pumic stone, and a sheat of sand paper, unused. I also found some six pences, which fell behind young Mitchell; they appeared to fall from her; I picked them up near her. there were still a finished state, wraped up in paper, like the others; they have also the letter a.

             M'MILLAN. I am a rope-maker by trade. I know the four prisoners at the bar, from a late acquaintance; the first time I saw them was at Diffield, in Yorkshire; that is about seven weeks since. From a short conversation then, I learned that he was a drover. I saw no more of them until about a fortnight after, when I saw them together in Hull; I then formed a public-house acquaintance with them; but nothing farther. I agreed to travel to London with them, and the man said, that I should not want any of the necessaries of life. Accordingly, I agreed to travel with them to London. We embarked at Hull, and came to Burton, where we stopped that night; I did not see any of them do any thing extraordinary until we got to Stamford; I there saw James Mahoffey employed with a file scouring and rubbing of brass under a hedge; it was a wet day. It was a thin sheet, which had been cut up, and rounded to the size of sixpences; nothing more passed until we got to Peterborough, which was at about five o'clock in the evening; James Mahoffey went to work, I saw him; I had a full opportunity of seeing him colour some of these pieces; he put colour out of a piece of paper, and it produced an effect to make it look like silver. We did not drive cattle on the way to London; it was on a Sunday when we arrived in London. We occupied a room in Mrs. O'Neill's; the four prisoners at the bar and I went to Mrs. O'Neill's, in Carrier-street, St. Giles's; we had a ledging there until Tuesday, consisting of two beds; that served the whole five. We remained there until Tuesday, and then we took the lodging for a week, on condition that I was to sleep below in another bed, and we were to pay seven shillings and sixpence a week; we continued there from Tuesday until the Monday following. During the time we were there, we lived together; they were then employed in the same service which absolutely I have sworn to; I saw them. I went to the cutler's to get the scissors sharpened for the same execution. On the Monday, I was down along with Mary Mitchell, the younger, at Greenwich, and circulated twelve. We afterwards went on Tuesday to M'Lawrence's, in Bainbridge-street; two rooms were taken there; the one on the right hand belonged to the two Mitchell's; the other to Mahoffey and me. The morning after I went to this house, Mahoffey after preparing seventeen sixpences, gave me a penny to procure a pennyworth of aquafortis; I went to a chemist's, and got it, without any qustions what it was to do; by his request, I gave it to

In about fifteen minutes after that, she came into the room in which I was, with that cup, and delivered it into Mahoffey's hand in his room; it had then some stuff in it, more than it has now. He immediately applied it to colour those seventeen pieces which he had prepared; he succeeded in that, and affected it. He then wrapped them up in paper, sundry with paper, and told me to go up Highgate-road, and buy any small article; but return him two pence out of each sixpence. On my return from that place, I was apprehended. I put them all off but five. The last words Mahoffey said to me were if I was apprehended, to swallow them, and they would injure me not; that was the same evening on which I was afterwards escorted to Bainbridge-street by three officers. Those five which I had not uttered, the gentleman of the name of Squibb got.</p>

I have been so a considerable time, and am conversant with transactions of this nature; I have seen the various things produced to day; from my experience, I think they are complete to finish the counterfeit money of the description now produced; they are tools proper for making the pieces that have been produced, and they appear to have been appropriated to such a purpose.

I received information on 23d June, and a memorandum of a note was given to me—in consequence of that, I went to a small chandler's shop, kept by the prisoner, in Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields—I saw the prisoner—I asked for Mr. Mitchell—he said "My name is Mitchell"—I asked him whether he had received a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note of late; he said "No"—I told him I wanted to speak to him—he came out of the shop, and when we were outside, I asked him again whether he had not received a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said "No"—I asked him again, and he said No"—I said "Are you quite certain?"—he said "Yes; in fact, I never remember having one in my possession"—I then told him who I was, and I asked him whether there was any other man living in Flower and Dean-street, named Mitchell—he said not to his knowledge—I then told him there was a note which had been stolen, paid into the Bank of England with his name on it—he said that was impossible, for he could neither read nor write—I told him to be particular—and asked him on several occasions, if he had not passed one—he said no; he had never had one for the last seven months—I then left him—I went to him again on 7th July, took him in custody, and charged him with receiving the note, well knowing it to be stolen—he said he knew nothing about any note, and he knew nothing about me—I told him that was ridiculous, for he must remember the time I was there speaking about a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note.</p>

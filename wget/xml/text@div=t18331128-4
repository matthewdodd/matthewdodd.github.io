            . I occupy a house No 14, Brewer-street, Clerkenwell. I have been there two years nearly; I know Coverdale; he was allowed to sleep in the same house as I had known him a long time, and he could not pay for a lodging - Foster also slept in the house for about two months, as near as I can say - Coverdale occupied the front-room first-floor when he was there, and Foster the back top-room - I was only put in to take care of the house - On Tuesday, the 12th of November, I came home to dinner between twelve and one o'clock in the afternoon - I found on the table a table-cloth and some other things underneath it, but what they were I cannot say - Coverdale was there, and he said it was a few things he had brought from his sister's, and asked my permission, that they should remain there, and I agreed - on the following Friday, the 15th, I found a policeman at my house, and I was taken into custody - I had not observed what was contained in the table-cloth between the 12th and 15th - I had not been into Foster's room - I had seen Tyrrell at the house two or three times, but not at the present time; he used to come to see Coverdale or Foster; he was acquainted with both of them - on the 15th of November I was put into the New Prison, and found Foster and Coverdale there; directly I went in they spoke to me, and two or three days afterwards, or the next day, I asked Foster and Coverdale how they came to bring me into such a mess as that - they said, they never should have thought of doing anything of the kind, if it had not been for Tyrrell - they said they should not have known anything about it, if it had not been for Tyrrell - they both said he told them there was a gold watch, and several other things there; both of them spoke - they both sanctioned it; Coverdale, I believe, told me, but both told me - Coverdale said, they never should have thought of going to the place at all if it had not been for Tyrrell; and that he said, there was a gold watch and a great deal of property there; and Coverdale said he left the window open on purpose for them to go in, but the boy shut the window, and did not fasten it, and by that means they got in - they both said, they got in through the window, and they said all the money they had was 4l. 17s.; that it was reported they had a great deal - they did not tell me what were the other things they got - I was kept in prison till the Wednesday morning; I told what I had heard, and was let out as a witness - I do not know that all the stolen things were in my house; I did not see more than I have told - I had no share in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You do not know what stolen goods are, I suppose? A. No; I do not - I was never in custody before - I was trusted to take care of the house; I had permission from the gentleman it belonged to to let one person in, and the other was only there at different times, when he had no money to pay for his lodging - I am a labouring man; bricklaying was the last job I did; I did that the very day I was taken, for Mr. Cockerton, who keeps the oil-shop at the corner of Islington church-yard; I was plaistering up a ceiling - I had a job for Mr. Thompson, up at Paddington - he belongs to the playhouse in Little Church-street, Portman Market - I should have gone to Cockerton's that night, if I had not been stopped, and have not been out of work for some months, except for a day or so - at Paddington I begun work at six o'clock, and was done at eleven - I do not work for any body else, but on my own account - I worked for Mr. Edhall, Bunhill-row, in digging foundations, and pulling down old buildings - I was bred up a labouring man - I was a witness here a night or two ago, against another man; some goods in that case got into my house, which turned out to be stolen; I knew nothing about them; I never asked them where they got them - I had no lodger at all but the two persons I speak off, besides my own family - they used to say they were bakers, and used<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280011"></xptr>to job where they could - I did not make it my business to inquire where the things came from; if I had thought they came from anywhere wrong I should have inquired; he said he brought them from his sister's.</p>
               <p>Q. How much? A. None at all - nothing; you mean, did they give me any money; you did not ask me the question, but you might as well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What was your reason for permitting those two men to lodge there? A. I had known Coverdale for ten or twelve years, and Foster being a friend of his, it was in consequence of the extreme poverty of Coverdale, that I allowed him to lodge at the house; and Foster being his friend; I saw but very little of the property; I slept at No. 14, Brewer-street, on the 12th of November; it was twelve o'clock when I got home from Paddington; I swear I slept at this house the night the robbery was committed - I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock; it was not a little later; I suppose the prosecutor's house is about two miles from my house; on my oath, I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock on the 12th of November; Mrs. Childs slept with me that night; she is my wife - she was examined here last Monday on another robbery - I slept that night with her at No. 14, Brewer-street, and for a fortnight before; a little boy slept in that bed too.</p>

               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, I ask you whether, on the 12th of November, you did not sleep from your home, and if Coverdale did not sleep with your wife? A. I am sure he did not; that I will swear - not on that night, or any other night after twelve o'clock - I know nothing about what was done when I was not at home - I have not come here to give evidence to save myself - I was not told to split for the purpose of saving my wife and family - I was not told by anybody to make the statement I have here to night, for the purpose of saving my wife and children - my wife and children have nothing to do with it - Campbell the police-officer came to the prison while I was in there, and asked, if I knew any thing about it, and I told him I did not, and that is true; I did not know it then; I knew that they had brought things to my house, but I did not know how many, nor questioned them to know what they brought them for; Campbell told me nothing about them; he asked, if I knew anything about them, and I told him no; I had seen the table-cloth and two or three other things; I now know they were part of the things stated by Campbell, to be part of what was stolen from the prosecutor's; but I did not know it then; without a doubt Campbell was inquiring about the very things found at my house - I knew nothing of the robbery then; they had got the things away - I told him I knew nothing about it, further than what he saw; and that was true - I did not know at that time that there were things of that description at my house; I knew the table-cloth was there - I had not seen the glass there; the table-cloth was the largest thing I saw in that house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken of a conversation between Coverdale and Foster; on your solemn oath, during that entire conversation, was a word said by Foster in that conversation? A. There was; he stated it as well as Coverdale; not only once, but more than once; Foster said that Tyrrell left open the window for them to go in; both told me so at different times, and one said, "Yes, did not he;" one told me the story, and the one who was telling me, said, "Did not he so;""Was not it so;" and the other said, "Yes;" both told me the story at different times; I worked for Mr. Cockerton, No. 1, Rufford's-row, High-street, Islington, last; and for Mr. Redhall before; and Mr. Field; I could tell you for the last sixteen years who I did work for; I said, I worked for Mr. Thompson, at Paddington - I worked for Mr. Field, as much as a month ago, I dare say; last Monday was the first time I was ever in court in my life; in this court or any other - I was never at the police-office on any charge, except the one you are speaking of - I was never in charge about a Jew's house that was robbed; my wife was not in custody for that; I was never taken on any charge before this one, and never in my life at a police-office; I got no share at all; that I will swear - my wife got nothing that I know of; she never told me what Coverdale gave her; not on this case; she had a gown that was here the other night - I saw her wear the gown - I knew it was stolen after she had worn it.</p>

I am street-keeper, and live at No. 6, Clarendon-street, Camden-town; on the morning of the 15th of November, I was on the watch and saw Foster and Coverdale in the neighbourhood of Brewer-street; Deyken, I, and Price followed them about a mile - when they came nearly half-a-mile, they got to high words, as if they had fallen out, and were in the act of parting, when I took Foster in custody - Deyken took Coverdale - we took them to the station house, in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell - I then had the assistance of a policeman - I searched Foster, found on him one sovereign, half-a-sovereign, one good half-crown, and one bad one, and five duplicates, and a knife and a small brass padlock - Mr. Keyzer claims the padlock - I asked Foster his name, he said Foster, and that he was lodging with his brother at Bermondsey - we then immediately went off with Baylis the policeman to No. 14, Brewer-street - I searched Foster's room there; the top back room, and found in it these articles which I produce - I did not go into any other room.</p>

Jamieson - the house I searched was Child's - I have no knowledge of its being Foster's room, except I understood it was - his wife, who I found in the room, said she was his wife - I only know what I have been told - I never saw Childs till this happened - I found this padlock on Foster and found the money on him - it is a common padlock.</p>

            . I am a constable and live at No. 22, Grenville-street, Somers-town - I apprehended Coverdale, and found on him a pair of scizzors, 6s. in money, 2 half-crowns, and a shilling, and a gardener's knife - I afterwards went to No. 14, Brewer-street - Baylis was in my company; when we went to the house I suspected the property might be in we asked; if Smith lived there, and were told he was just gone out - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280012"></xptr>found a quantity of things in the first floor front room; Baylis took them away.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. You did not search Foster? A. No.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BAYLIS. I am a policeman G. 5. I live at No. 56, Whiskin-street, Clerkenwell. I produce a quantity of articles, which I found in the two first-floor, front rooms; I cannot say which room I found each article in; they both belonged to Child's; I found four plated table-spoons, four plated tea-spoons, two table-cloths, a scarlet apron, canister, a bladder of lard, a cream strainer, five knives and three forks - I found them in the first floor front rooms; three handkerchiefs, a black veil, work box, roasting jack, four wine glasses, a violin case, two bows, five packets of nails, four plated table-spoons, and one plated tea-spoon; I found some articles in both the front rooms first floor, and the remaining articles, beginning with the roasting jack, in the upper room; I found some keys in the upper room; a key which I found in the upper room fitted the prosecutor's yard gate - here is the lock; I found another key which fitted the lock of the workshop door - both the keys were found in the upper room, with the roasting jack and other things.</p>
               <p>MARY CHILDS. I am the wife of the witness Childs. I saw the prisoner Tyrrell at my house on a Monday - I cannot say the day of the month - I think it was on the Monday before I was examined at the police-office - it was on the Monday night before Mr. Keyzer's robbery - he came to Coverdale and Foster, who were at home - he saw them and was there about half-an-hour; he had been to visit them before, often at different times - I think he went away alone - I saw Coverdale the following morning - he did not sleep at home that night - I received some things from Coverdale next day - I did not see them opened - there was a few handkerchiefs, and I think an apron, a bladder of lard, and a tin canister; the lard was in a tin screen; there was two table-cloths, and knives and forks - I think five, and four plated table-spoons, and I think the same quantity of tea-spoons - he merely gave them to me or put them on the table, and desired me to take care of them for a day or two - I put the spoons and forks in my bed room, in a drawer by themselves - my bed room is the adjoining room to where Coverdale slept - he had one front room, and I occupied one front room and a back room - those articles were afterwards found on the premises - I had received them from Coverdale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I think I examined you a few nights ago? A. Yes, and I told you then I did not examine that bundle; I never saw the contents - the property in the other case came in a basket - I could not be off seeing these table-spoons, and tea-spoons because I put them in my drawer; I did not see the bundle open, but the things were afterwards given to me; I cannot say whether this was the night of the 12th of November; I think it was on a Tuesday, my husband slept at home; on the night before the 12th of November - he slept at home, for months; he went to bed between twelve and one o'clock that night; he walks from here to Paddington to earn a shilling, and returns home every night before twelve o'clock; he slept at home that night and got up in the morning between five and six o'clock to the best of my knowledge - I slept in the same room; I always do; Coverdale's room is the next room to mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear he was not out on the night of the 12th of November? A. I won't swear to the day of the month; yes, I could do so; he never slept from home one night, nor was he out till between two and three o'clock in the morning; not for some months, he was never out later than twelve o'clock; the articles were brought to our house between six and seven o'clock in the morning I think; that was not before my husband had left for his work; he leaves a little before six o'clock; the things were brought I think about seven o'clock; I did not shew him the things that had been brought; I saw but very few of them, or I might have had suspicion; I am not to ask my lodgers, how they come by things.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 5, Charles-mews, Drummond-street. I drove a cabriolet, No. 1331, at that time; I was applied to on the morning of the 12th of November, in Tottenham-court-road, by Coverdale, about a quarter after five o'clock; he came up and asked me to go and take up in the New-road; I stopped first in Tottenham-court-road to take something to drink with him; he told me to turn to the left, I pulled up at the Adam and Eve, down a turning, he asked me to wait there; I remained there nearly ten minutes, when he came back, got in, and told me to go to the New-road, and at the corner of Southampton-street; he told me to stop; three men came with a parcel of things, and put them into the cab; a tall person got in and told me to drive to the Angel at Islington; I was going to pull up there, he said, "Go to the right;" I was going down St. John-street; he said, "No, to the right there," I drove down Goswell-street-road, and came up to Coverdale and another, who asked where I had been - (but before that my traces had broken off, and another cab passed mine;) while I was stopping in Goswell-street, Coverdale said, "Where have you been," I said, "My trace broke, and I stopped to mend it; he said, "Well come on here;" I went on to the corner of Rawstorne-street, he told me to turn round, and I drove to Brewer-street, and Coverdale, and him, and another man took the things out of the cab, and took them into the house; I know the prosecutor's house; I received the things at the corner of Southampton-street, fifteen or twenty yards from the prosecutor's house; I there saw Coverdale and two others; I don't know either of the others; I did not see the other men's faccs; I have never sworn that I did know the persons of the others except Coverdale - this deposition is my hand-writing; it was read over to me before I signed it, but I am rather hard of hearing, sometimes I don't hear - when I got to Tottenham-court-road I saw Coverdale there alone; as we came along, two persons were there Coverdale and another; and they said, "Don't go so fast;" I don't know who the other was; I swear I did not know which of them it was; I have no recollection except of Coverdale; I don't recollect seeing the other prisoners, except at Hatton-garden; I know there were three men followed the cab to Brewer-street; I am not positive there was not four - the first thing they took out of the cab looked like a frame,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280013"></xptr>like a looking-glass; it was outside the flap, on the knee boot, and there was a fiddle-case, and two or three things like a sack; this was about five o'clock in the morning, nearer six o'clock; it was dark.</p>

             (policeman E 14). I live at No. 9, Frances-street, Tottenham-court-road. I apprehended Tyrrell at the premises of Mr. Keyzer in the New-road; I afterwards went to No. 12, Pear-tree-street, Clerkenwell, and got there a quantity of perforated zinc, solder cassia, colouring, and rosin; they are the subject of another indictment - I asked Tyrrell if he knew Childs, he said, he did; I asked if he knew a man named Foster, he said, he did not - he denied all knowledge of a person named Coverdale - I asked him when he had been at Child's, he said, he had not seen any of that party for some months.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM KEYZER. I had a padlock similar to the one found on Foster - I will not swear to it, it is a common one - I cannot say whether when I came down in the morning the window was fastened or not - one key opens my shop-door which leads to the counting-house- I cannot identify the property found at Tyrrell's lodging.</p>

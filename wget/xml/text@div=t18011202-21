             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Williams: On the 20th of October last I saw the prisoner come to my master's shop, about half past seven or eight in the morning, and said, if you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020020"></xptr>please, Mr. Williams sent me back for two pair of boots; my master was not at home, and I said I did not know which they were; he said, let me come in, I know which they are; he came in and took them down off the brass hooks from the glass door; a pair of brown tops and a pair of black tops with tassels; he took them and ran away; I did not think he was a thief at first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long was the prisoner in the shop? - A. He was hardly two minutes in the shop; I had never seen him before.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear positively to the person of a man you never saw before, and then only for a few minutes? - A. I am sure it is the same.</p>

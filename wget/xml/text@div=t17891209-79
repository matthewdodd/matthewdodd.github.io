               <p>I am a porter. On the 3d of November, coming down Noble-street, about half past six, I saw three suspicious people, the prisoner and two more, cross over to the prosecutor's house; I walked down towards Falcon-square; I stopped a little there; I came back pretty quick, and saw the prisoner, and the other two hoist up the window; I saw one of them put the prisoner into the window, hoisting up his leg; then one crossed over, and the other walked towards Falcon-square; I went and looked in at the window, and said, what, you are there, are you, you shall not have the Bath stove; I saw him with the stove, the back towards his knees, carrying it towards the door that goes into the passage; he was moving it towards the door; he dropped down to hide himself behind the stove; I called out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. It was dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was no light in the room? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You had not been in the room to see where this stove was before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had he his hat on? - Yes, but I saw the left side of him towards the window.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you see the Bath stove off the ground? - Upon my oath I did; I saw his hands under it; it was six inches from the ground.</p>

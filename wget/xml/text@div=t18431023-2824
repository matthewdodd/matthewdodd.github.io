                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 25th of Sept., about half-past five o'clock, I stopped the prisoner coming towards Battersea-bridge with a sack—I asked what he had got—he said his own property—I found it was this lead—he said his master had given it to him to make a bob, and if I was not satisfied I could go with him to his work—he walked back—I followed him—he said, "It is no use your going, master is gone to Newcastle"—I said, "I thought your master gave it you"—he said the foreman did—he went to the factory, threw the lead down, and ran off, but I followed and took him back—the foreman said he had stolen the lead—it corresponded with a piece on the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Fetter-lane. The prisoner was in my employ—on the 27th of December, (yesterday week,) I had marked three bags with my name at the bottom, in the after<lb></lb>noon, while he was gone home—they were quite empty—I put them into the same place where I found them, which was in his flannel-jacket pocket, while he went home at dinner-time—he had lived with my father three years and five months; and with me, since Michaelmas-day—when he came in at half-past five or twenty minutes to six o'clock, I told him to go down and do his business as usual—he accordingly went back—at twenty minutes past six o'clock he came through the shop, and went out into the street—I kept my eye on him till he got sixteen or twenty yards—I then called him back—I had the officer in waiting across the road—he came over, and I said, "Take him into the room, and search him"—he found three half-quartern bags of flour; and round his neck there was a handkerchief which had some more flour in it; and in his pocket, six biscuits—that was my flour, it had been taken from the bin; and more than that, I had greased the scoop, and the flour stuck to it—here is the flour, and here are the bags.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of St. Andrew, Holborn. I was desired by the prosecutor's father, on this occasion, to watch the prisoner coming out, as he suspected he would have some flour—I stationed myself opposite the house, and saw him come out about twenty minutes after six o'clock—I saw the prosecutor call him back, and I followed him, took him into the parlour, and searched him—I found a bag containing flour on each side of him—I said to him, "You have been carrying on a strange game, I am afraid"—he did not say any thing—I searched him, and found one bag of flour on each side of his bosom, under the braces, between the shirt—one paper bag in his left-hand coat-pocket, and 41bs. of flour tied up in a hand<lb></lb>kerchief in his hat—all this time he was in a fit—Mr. Green sent for his wife, and after an hour, I think, she arrived—he was lying on the floor during the whole of the time—I took him into custody.</p>

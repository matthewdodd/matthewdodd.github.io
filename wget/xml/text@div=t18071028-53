               <p>Q. How was Mr. Dawkins' health about October last. - A. He had been confined to his room from the latter end of September. In the beginning of October Feltham managed his business.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that you informed your master, were you directed to apply to his attorney Mr. Fielder. - A. I went with Mr. Fielder to get a warrant from Marlborough-street; I searched the prisoner Shipman's apartment, No. 13, Carrington-street, Shepherd's market. We made search in a cellar in front of the street, the officer found six candle boxes; these three boxes had my master's name, J. Dawkins, burnt in them, No. 2, 4, and 5; they had store and mould candles. We found a box, with two pair of boots and a pair of shoes, with my master's name in them.</p>

               <p>Blake. One pair of boots has not my master's name on them; but I was always in the habit of cleaning of them. I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Had you at any time seen these boxes and these boots and shoes in your master's possession. - A. I had; I missed them boxes from the store room; I informed my master of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Does not every tallow chandler send out his candles in boxes with the name burnt on it. - A. He does, every box has my master's name on it, but I described them boxes as having seen them in my master's possession shortly before.</p>

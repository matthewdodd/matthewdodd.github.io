                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's son. I am going on for nineteen years of age—my father lived at No. 20, Drury-court, Drury-lane—he had only part of the house—he is a stone-mason—I lived with him—I had been out all night before the 15th of November, and came home be between twelve and one o'clock in the middle of that day—my father was at home when I came back, and he accused me for being out all night—he asked where I had been—I said to my sister's—I had been there, but was not there all night—when I told him I had been to my sister's, we had a few words, and I made him a saucy answer—he was very much in liquor, and tried to strike me—my sister was there at the time, (but not the same sister at whose house I had been)—she got up between us to make peace, and then he stabbed me with the table-knife which he was eating his dinner with—he was at dinner at the time—we had a bit of a scuffle before he stabbed me—he tried to strike me, but I kept off the blow, and then he stabbed me—I went back—he followed me just by the cupboard—he was eating his dinner with the knife—he stabbed me in the side—I fell down, and do not remember what happened afterwards—I only received one stab—I went to the doctor's, and was then taken to Charing-cross hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am turned thirteen years of age, and am the prisoner's daughter. I remember the 15th of November last—I sat down to dinner with my father that day, about half-past twelve o'clock—my father was very much in liquor at the time—while we were at dinner my brother came in, and my father accused him for stopping out all night—my brother said he had been to my sister's, to convey her boxes to her lodging—my father still continued accusing him for stopping out all night—my brother then said "Ah!" impudently, and my father thought he said something else, and stood up and made an attempt to strike him—he had a knife in his hand at the time, eating his dinner with it—my brother put his hand to wards him to keep the blow off—I went between them to make peace, and then my father stabbed him with the knife he had been eating his dinner with—he stabbed him in the side, and he fell down—I told him to go to the doctor's, and went with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital. On the 15th of November John Quinn was brought there—I found a wound on his abdomen—it was a small wound—I do not know the depth, as no in strument was introduced to try it—it had been done by some sharp-pointed instrument, and was a dangerous wound—he appeared to suffer a good deal from it—he appeared very faint, and in a very bad state—he was three weeks in the hospital, or it might be more—he was completely recovered when discharged.</p>

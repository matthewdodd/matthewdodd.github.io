                  </hi> I keep the Grapes' public-house, in Rose-street, Covent-garden. On the 29th of October, between one and two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in with others—he called for a quartern of gin, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a crown-piece, I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put the crown-piece into the till—there was not another crown there—the prisoner went away—something occurred afterwards, which led me to examine the crown—I saw it was bad—I put it into the till again—the prisoner came again in the course of twenty minutes—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther he wanted half-a-pint of beer or some 1 liquor, hut he gave me another crown-piece, which I discovered was bad—I said, "This is another bad crown-piece"—I called my waiter to go and take him—I recognized him to be the same party—he ran away, and was brought back by the police<lb></lb>man—I marked the two crown-pieces, and gave them to the policeman.</p>

               <p>I very seldom keep open so late—the reason was we had persons there that we could not get out—there might be half-a-dozen persons coming in and out—I know Jane Smith—I just let her look at the crown-piece, but she gave it me back—it did not pass from her hand to the waiter—I think she gave it back to me—that was the first crown-piece—shortly after that she went away—I did not tell the policeman that the prisoner was not the man who uttered the first crown—the minute I said the second was bad he ran away—I had only a few shillings and sixpences in my till beside—the prisoner had gone before I gave the crown-piece to Smith.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 129.) I was in the street on the morning of the 29th of October—I received a hint to take the prisoner—I took him to Mrs. Warner's, and received from her these two crown<lb></lb>pieces—she marked them—I found on the prisoner a shilling, a sixpence, a penny, and a good crown-piece—I first saw him about a dozen or fourteen yards from the public-house—a woman, whose name I do not know, said to me, "That is the man that gave a bad crown-piece at Mrs. Warner's"—I then watched him, and saw him go back to the house—there were two men with him—when he came out the second time I took him.</p>

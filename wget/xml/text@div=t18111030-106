On the 25th of December, the prisoner and another man came in and asked for pudding; I told them I did not sell it; they went out and came in again, and asked for two ounces of ham, they said they must toss up for it; they tossed the money under the scale, and went out; they came in again and said they must have two ounces more, they must toss up for it; the prisoner throwed a halfpenny the other side of the counter, and asked me to pick it up; I said no, that may go for the ham; the prisoner said no, pick it up. I stooped to pick it up, in the mean while the ham was taken away; I said, a thief has stolen my ham; the other man said, I will soon have him, and ran out; I locked the door and kept the prisoner in.</p>

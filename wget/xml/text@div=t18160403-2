I had seen them in the house before I went out; I slept in the bed; it is now in court. The value of the bed is three pounds; the bolster is worth ten shillings. I understood that the door of my house had been double locked. When I came home, I found a number of my neighbours in the house, and my wife.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I left my house about seven o'clock in the morning; I left nobody in the house. I returned a little after eight in the evening; I returned before my husband. I had double locked the street door when I went out. When I returned, I found it on the single lock. The moment I came home I went up stairs, seeing the doors open; I found the bed missing, the first thing of the bedstead, also a quilt, a counterpane, a blanket, a trunk, a bolster, and two pillows. I can't say how any one got in. The bed was worth three pounds; the bolster ten shillings; the two pillows ten shillings. I have seen my property since; the officer has got it.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I went in company with Dalton, on the morning of Monday, the 11th; I went to a house in Little Middlesex-street, Whitechapel; I found the three prisoners were there, the bed, two pillows, and a bolster. I believe Mr. Jonas keeps the house; the girl, Sarah Levi, is the daughter of Levi Abrahams, I believe. They were all sitting in the lower room, and the bed was in the middle of the room; the bolster and pillows were with the bed. No other persons were in the room but the prisoners. I asked them whose bed that was, and they all three denied all knowledge of it, and did not know whose it was; they knew nothing at all about it. I went between ten and eleven o'clock on the Monday morning; they were picking the marks out of the other property. I took them into custody. I did not search any other part of the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. This was the third day after the robbery; the robbery was on the Saturday. I know Jonas has a husband living, that I believe. I know Levi lives some where else. In these three days, I don't know who might have brought these things there.</p>

               <p>EBENEZAR DALTON. I am a police officer, and went also to this house. I can only speak to the same facts to which the last witness has spoken; his account is correct.</p>

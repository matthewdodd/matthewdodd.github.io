                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas Pavey, a grocer, of Broad Street, Bloomsbury—on Tuesday, 18th May, the prisoner came there—I served him with a quarter of a pound of eightpenny cheese—he put down a half-crown—I told him it was bad, it was a rank bad one—he asked me to bend it in three places, which I did—he asked me to give it him; I did so, and he said he would go to the corner, where he took it—he went away, but did not return—on 24th May, about 9 o'clock, he came again for a quarter of a pound of the best cheese—I knew him again directly—he put down a half-crown—Mr. Pavey took it up, and said it was bad—I directly ran round the counter, and said that was the same man that came in the week before—the prisoner said I was mistaken, he was not the man, he only came up from the country the morning before.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner came to my shop on the 24th—I took up a half-crown which he put down, and said, "This won't do"—he said, "What is the matter with it?"—on that the last witness flew round the counter, and said, "You are the man that came last week with a bad half-crown, I knew you directly you came into the door"—he said, "Not me, I only came from the country this morning"—a constable was sent for, and he was given into custody—I gave the half-crown to the constable.</p>

I produce a half-crown which I received from last witness—I searched the prisoner, and found on him a good sovereign and three good half-crowns—when he was told the half-crown was bad, he said it could not be him that passed it, because he had only come from the country that morning—he gave his address in Essex.</p>

As to the other, when the young woman said I had passed it, I told her it was a mistake, for I was in the country. I have a letter here stating that I went to Strood on the 16th, and stopped there till the 20th.</p>

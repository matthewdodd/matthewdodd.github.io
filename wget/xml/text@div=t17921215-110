Richardson and Co. I then observed that there was 10 l. more than the quarter part of that ticket, and that I apprehended there were deductions made from the prizes; the prisoner said, the bond was not dated at the period at which he became entitled to his prize but afterward; I asked him if he knew who the witness to the bond was, because I had my doubts respecting it; he said, he believed he could find him out; I asked him how he became possessed of it; he said, it came to him in a parcel addressed to him at a house in Norwich; I think he said, the flying or rampart horse; I wished to see the letter it came in, and also to know who the witness was, as I thought I ought to have information of that kind before I made application to Messrs. Richardson; I desired Mr. Sewel to return into Norfolk for that purpose, and to learn every information he could respecting the bond; I was induced to do this in consequence of my believing what the prisoner said was true, and thinking that the payments had been made by some clerks in the house, and might have patched up this bond and have quieted the prisoner without Messrs. Richardson's knowledge, and I was the more led to make that sort of enquiry seeing two sums written by way of interest on the bond; on the subject of both of which he gave as blind an account as he did of the bond, and which he had admitted to have received in bank bills addressed to him in a similar manner as the bond itself, from which payments, he said, he had been inclined to rest satisfied with the bond till he had occasion for the money, which he then had for a considerable part of it. In consequence of my advice they returned into Norfolk as they left me, promising to go there; they came to my house again on the 8th of November, Mr. Sewel and the prisoner; I was out when they came in but found them there; the prisoner was desirous of having Richardson and Co. proceeded against by an arrest for the recovery of the bond; having still my doubts about the validity of it, as they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150157"></xptr>had brought up no information or cover conveying the bond, I waved proceeding by an arrest, said, I knew the house of Richardson and Goodluck to be solvent, and that there would be no danger of a personal application, which I wished to have made on the circumstance of the bond, thinking as I did, that the prisoner had been imposed upon by the clerks. I desired an application might be made by myself that I might observe the countenances of the parties and the nature of their receiving the application. Dunnett and Sewel went with me, when we went to the lottery office I perceived Mr. Richardson there; I told him I had an occasion to speak to him on a letter of business, and wished he would give an opportunity of doing it in a private room; he invited me up stairs, I told him the two gentlemen with me, pointing to Mr. Sewel and the prisoner at the bar were concerned in what I wished to speak to him about, and therefore I desired they might come up at the same time; he consented to it, and we all went up together; Mr. Sewel then gave this bond to me in the presence of the prisoner; I gave it to Mr. Richardson, told him I was applied to by an attorney and the prisoner respecting the money that was due on the bond, that the prisoner did not want all the money, but a part of it, that I wished him to look on the bond and give his answer to it, and then gave it to Mr. Richardson; Mr. Richardson read it, was much agitated I could perceive while he was reading it; he locked at me says he, Mr. Railton I have known you many years, I am astonished at the demand, and if the parties had presented the bond without your being present I would have deemed them madmen, but out of respect to you I shall give such answers as I think proper; I then asked him if the signature to the bond, purporting to be Richardson was his signature; he said, it was not; I asked him if the signature of any of the gentlemen who were his partners appeared to be their signatures; he said, they did not; I asked him if he knew the signature of the person purporting to be a witness Roberts, he said, they had a clerk of the name of Roberts, he said, it was not his signature; he, desirous of giving me any information in his power; after he had denied the writing of himself and partners, said, that if I wanted the satisfaction to see his partners he would desire them to come up without any comment at all, without any observation they each denied the hand writing on the bond to be theirs; I then communicated to them my sentiment that he might have been imposed upon by some person in their house, and I would wish the books to be searched, which they readily consented to, and searched the books so as to discover this man had no dealings with them at the period which he mentioned; there were some transactions that appeared afterwards to be done with him, and there appeared to be about 8 d. or 4 d. owing for the postage of a letter or something, and the prisoner was that overpaid, he then asked the prisoner what he brought the bond there for; then he demanded the 2.510 l. for which it purports to be given, he said he demanded the money of Mr. Richardson; it was after this period that Mr. Richardson wanted to know what to do; I then said, if it would turn out fatal to the prisoner I was sorry I had been made use of. A constable was sent for and he was taken into custody, and taken before a magistrate; I am sure it is the bond, for I put my initials on the margin; I put it under the seal of the prisoner, then I put the bond under a cover sealed by the prisoner and myself, and afterwards I put my initials on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Railton, I believe before this you had never seen the prisoner at the bar? - Nor knew him, nor did I know Mr. Sewel.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150158"></xptr>Q. Mr. Tilbury nor yourself was agent to Mr. Sewel? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner at the bar was first introduced to you you looked upon him quite a country man, an ignorant man who might easily be imposed upon? - I did in the manner I have alluded to in my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came first to you you compleatly had the idea in your mind, and that was the reason you had the desire of his going back again; his persisting that he had bought a quarter share of a lottery ticket which had been fortunate to be drawn a 10,000 l. prize? - I thought him imposed upon as a countryman and that Richardson and Co. had paid the money to some of their clerks who had quieted this man by this bond.</p>
               <p>Q. At the last you felt yourself extremely concerned to have any thing to do in this business. You went twice to the house of Richardson and Co.? - I went only once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Sewel or the prisoner tender the bond? - Mr. Sewel produced the bond to me; he always produced it to me; Mr. Sewel also told me that he had his doubt about the bond and that Dunnett admitted it to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Dunnett did not make use of such expression as admit? - Yes, he did, and that he had it for payment of a lottery ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. We are then to understand that the prisoner having expressed a doubt about this bond went to the house of Richardson and Co. whose bond it was. Did he ever hesitate going to Richardson's house? - I cannot say he did; I advised Mr. Sewel not to part with the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first time you had seen him to that time he might have come back again or not? - To be sure he might, I would have much rather he would have gone off than stayed.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was led to imagine that this man was imposed upon by another circumstance, that the bond itself was not done in a business way yet the indorsement was? - No, he had wrote the indorsement himself.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact when you came to make the enquiry you did hear of such a person of the name of Roberts? - Yes, that made me still the more believe the man could be cheated; I was satisfied there must be guilt somewhere, but I could not impute it any where.</p>
               <p>Q Still however the prisoner at the bar, in the course of all this examination stopped and heard it all and he remained fixed in his determination and you went with him? - Because I wished to see how Richardson and Goodluck would treat it in countenance and observation.</p>
               <p>Q. He was there and stopped all the while to hear it? - Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. To Railton. I would ask you, sir, from your opportunity of observing of the prisoner at the bar whether he shewed any particularity in his conduct during the whole or part of the time you saw him? - I thought his countenance was wild and distracted even from the first time I saw him he gave frequent stares and looks, not quite in my opinion consistent with a person in his senses; that was the impression his conduct made on my mind in the moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not imagine that his conduct betrayed the conduct of a man out of his mind? - When I told him the question was serious, he seemed very much agitated; and I could see that his mind was disturbed, whether it was the effect of a disordered mind, or the effect of conscious guilt, gentlemen, it will be for your verdict.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Richardson seemed to think the same as you? - The reason was, that he thought it was a bold thing, to demand money on a bond which was neither his writing nor his partners.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150159"></xptr>Q. Did you see, on that occasion, Mr. Arnold? - I saw all the partners, but one, Mr. Goodluck.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there is such a person as Mr. Goodluck? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Steele to Mr. Railton. Did it appear to you that Mr. Roberts. their clerk, had had correspondence with the prisoner? - It did.</p>
               <p>Mr. SEWEL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an attorney at Norwich. I have known the prisoner ever since my infancy. He has resided at Rainthorp Hall, about eight miles from Norwich. He had mentioned being possessed of such property, frequently. It may be four or five years back. He described himself to be possessed of property of three of four thousand pounds. I don't know from what house, but I recollect he had security for some property, derived from the lottery, as early as four years ago. About the 8th of October, he applied to me on the very subject of this bond. On the 20th of August the prisoner applied, and requested me to go over to Ingham with him, to look over a considerable estate he was about to purchase. I went over with him, and advised him against it. - The estate afterwards came to auction, and the prisoner became the purchaser of it, for 6000 l. - Afterwards he wished to recede from the bargain, as they applied to him for the deposit and duty. I was applied to to settle it, as he did not want to have it, the world was very censorious upon him, and he asked me to advertise for a meeting of his creditors. In consequence of that advertisement being inserted, the prisoner deposited that security, with other securities, in my possession, for to answer these demand. The amount of the other security might be 500 l. or upwards: all of them promissory notes. The debts claimed amounted to more than 700 l. After the others had been lodged with me I recommended the prisoner to look to the notes of hand first, and let this matter rest a little while. I wrote to the parties, whom the prisoner pretended were his debtors, and delivered the drafts to the prisoner, who said he was going over to Bury, and that he would deliver them to the parties. None of them paid, except 6 l. On the 30th of October, Dunnett applied to me to come to town with him. There was 700 l. to pay, and only 6 l. to pay it with. The prisoner was in the seed trade, and lived at some expence, in the stile of a private gentleman's son. In consequence of that I came, and arrived in town, on the 31st of October last; and called upon Mr. Railton. I cannot correct Mr. Railton in his statement, in one instance. I was before the Lord Mayor. The bond that I went to demand upon, I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say, you had known the prisoner from his infancy. Had you frequent opportunities of seeing him? - Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the habits of intimacy with him? - Yes, on very good terms. I have been with him at his uncle's house, when I was a school-boy, I used to go there to spend two or three days frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any observations on his conduct? - There was I thought something extremely singular in his conduct; it might be three years since he seemed very low, rather in a state of stupidity than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any sister? - He had two or three sisters.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them? - I know one and only one; I have heard that he went to a closet and took out a brace of pistols and attempted to shoot his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the circumstance of his having a fall from his horse? - That was the time I speak of, three years ago; I did not see him fall, I heard of it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150160"></xptr>that he was in consequence of that, in a state of stupidity for some time; it was after that time that I heard of the conduct he used to his sister; last November I heard of his conduct to his sister.</p>
               <p>Q Have you heard any thing of his attempting to drown himself? - I did hear it in the month of October, or the begining of November.</p>
               <p>Q. In short from the observations that you had made of him from being a school boy to the present time, there was always something peculiarly singular about him? - There was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Pray Mr. Sewel let us be a little grave. If he had applied to you to make his will would you have made it? - I did make his will in the month of March, in the present year.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consider him as a sane man at that time? - Undoubtedly so, or else I should not have made his will.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him to be a man of sound mind and memory, capable of disposing of his property; do you think that he continued of the same disposing powers till he came to London? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you meant to describe of him was, that he was not so gay, that he was not so talkative as some others, that he was occasionally dispirited, but always of a sound mind and disposing powers. Now we heard a good deal of what you have been told. Did you ever hear it insinuated that he was not a man of perfectly good understanding and capable of conducting all his affairs? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did you hear this anecdote about the unloaded pistol? - This I heard just before he came to town the last time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after he had been at Mr Railton's? - It might be a fortnight back or three weeks,</p>
               <p>Q. Then there had got a rumour in the country, that he had presented a pistol to his sister, and fell from his horse; but down to the time you visited Mr. Richardson, had you ever heard it hinted that he had been in danger of drowning? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I was present at the Lord Mayor's when the prisoner was examined, and he described this cover as the cover in which he received the bond. (The bond read by the clerk).</p>
               <p>Prisoner. May it please your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury. In the beginning of the year 1789, I sent money to the house of Messrs. Richardson and Co. to send me, in return, a quarter of a lottery ticket. In the month of March following, I was informed that the ticket was intitled to 10,000 l. Being greatly rejoiced at such an event, I was going on horse back, among my friends and acquaintances, when I had the misfortune to be thrown from my horse, and my skull was fractured. - And from that time I was incapable of attending to my business. As soon as I recovered my senses a little, I sent a letter to Messrs. Richardson and Co's. informing them, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150162"></xptr>was the fortunate adventurer, and became thereby intitled to the 10,000 l. prize, and would take their bond, payable on demand, for the same. On which, in a few days afterwards. Messrs. Richardson and Co. sent me an answer, desiring me to buy a quantity of lottery tickets, and they would send me their bond, as required, which they did: and they sent me 2510 l. and I received two different sums of money, as interest for the same, of Richardson and Goodluck.</p>
               <p>In the month of October, being in want of a few hundred pounds, to answer some demands: I desired Mr. Sewell to advertise a meeting of my creditors; and I requested him to come to town with me, to receive such monies as I should be intitled to, to answer the demands against me: and Mr. Sewell and myself came to town in October; and we went to Mr. Railton's. He advised us to go back again to get some necessary things wanting; accordingly I did. - When we went up again, and came again to London, we went with Mr. Railton to Mr. Richardson's; and when Mr. Richardson asked me if I wanted the money, I told him, yes. He sent for a constable, and charged me with commiting a forgery.</p>
               <p>I hope you will take my unfortunate case into consideration. I am innocent of the case before you, I have at all times been a man of property until now. And, my Lords and Gentlemen, I should have a number of respectable persons, in order to convince the Court of my innocence, and my character in general; and of the unfortunate situation of being deranged in my senses, as I am frequently laid up for a month, which is a hardship for me: but the great distance prevents their attendance; which I hope, my Lords and Gentlemen, you will take into consideration my unfortunate condition, in losing my senses. - And, my Lord, if the bond is a forgery, I have been greatly imposed upon, by those who remitted me the bond for my share of the ticket in the lottery. I never was in London till I came for the bond. If I had known it to have been a forgery, I would not have gone to have received the money, nor have had it in my possession. I never saw any of their writing, nor of their clerks, till I came to London. - Therefore, my Lord and Gentlemen, consider my unfortunate situation, of being deprived of my senses, which can be no more restored to me again.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an Assistant to the Poultry Compter. I remember the prisoner at the bar coming into my custody; his conduct has been very singular in many instances. He has pretended to write to people of Norwich, whom he has had no degree of claim on; and several other things that made me believe that the man was really out of his mind.</p>
               <p>The second or third day after the man was in custody, Mr. Railton and he were in the lodge together; and Mr. Railton said he must be out of his mind, or he would never have done as he had done; and in several instances behaving wild - such as making away with his things: - he did not mind whatever he had. He would give away every thing he had - he did not care to whom: I sincerely believe, and, I am on my oath, that the man is not right in his senses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you ever had occasion to observe mad people before? - I never was much used to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150163"></xptr>Q. Was you subpoened? - I always attend here the time the London Jury are sitting.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first communicate this? - Several times I communicated it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Roberts have you other grounds than those you have mentioned, to make you suppose this man was deranged? - He first of all employed Mr. Railton, then he employed Mr. Dalby the short hand writer; and at last he employed this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Roberts, who wrote these letters you have mentioned? - Mr. Dalby was applied to in the business for him, and he wrote to Norwich by the desire of Dunnett, there was an answer to this, and Mr. Dalby shewed me the answer to this letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Dalby employed as the confidential solicitor to a man under your custody; shewed you his client's letters and the answers? - He shewed me the answers, I cannot say he shewed me the letters himself.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Dalby shew you the answers? - As nearly as soon as he received them.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you thought it a strong proof of madness that the man did not receive the money he wrote for. Did you hear of this story of the pistol that hath been invented? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any fall from the horse? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to Mr. Railton, was what Mr. Railton said no more than this, that he believed he was mad; did not he say that his reason for stating him to be mad was his conduct? - Mr. Railton said he believed he was mad.</p>
               <p>Q. So Mr. Railton was coarse and indelicate enough to tell a poor man in his condition</p>
               <p>"you are mad;" and that is all, on your oath did Mr. Railton ever make use of such an expression without adding more; did not he say you must be mad to go to a house to demand money on that bond? - I tell you and what I tell you is verbatim.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Railton did not give any reason for thinking him mad: upon your oath did not you hear Mr. Railton say that his conduct was the conduct of a mad man, thinking to demand this money when it was not due? - I never heard so much discourse as that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Railton. I waited on him at two periods in the Compter, he was without friends, and without property, and without advice, and sought for me to advise him; I did not incline to undertake such a prosecution; I said that Mr. Chetham was a very proper person to advise with him; this was the first period I saw him, he was very much distressed; the second time I saw him I did not chose to go up into the prison to the man again, for I thought he looked agitated; this man has great truth in part that he says; when he came down to me, I asked him if he had employed Mr. Chetham, I told him it would be material, he should have some advice.</p>
               <p>Court. I think the indictment is ill conceived; I shall take the opinion of the Jury on the fact; the act of parliament describes a number of offences by indorsements and by assignments, &amp;c. but I take it in all, there must be a condition, and a penalty, to make it a bond obligatory, this is a writing obligatory, but I think it is not a bond obligatory, unless it has these two essential qualifications to it; I shall therefore reserve the law for the opinion of the Judges.</p>

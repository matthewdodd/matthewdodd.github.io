I lost these two pictures on the 20th of September, from my parlour; my waiter told me they were gone - I went and found them in a basket: the prisoner ran away, but we caught him - he said he knew nothing about them: I might have seen him in the house before, but I had not noticed him - we found in his pocket the duplicate of two other pictures, which I lost on the 6th.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there any pictures on the prisoner? A. No. I did not say these pictures were worth five hundred guineas - I said I had as many pictures in my house as were worth five hundred guineas; I valued these at 10s.</p>

            . I am the waiter. I saw the prisoner on the 20th of September - he came into the house with an empty basket, and called for a pint of porter at one end of the room; he drank that, and called for another pint at the other end of it, and then I saw the pictures were taken down - I stopped down to take a chair, and saw something like a picture in his basket; I told my master, who came into the room - the prisoner went out: we went and called Stop thief! and a milkman stopped him; there were five or six people in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the pictures in the basket in the room? A. Yes: the prisoner had not left the room then; I went to my master, and when he came in the prisoner was gone out of the room - he had not taken the pictures out of the room.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

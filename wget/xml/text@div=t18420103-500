                  </hi>. I am a trimming-seller, and live in Vigo-street, Re<lb></lb>gent-street. The prisoner came to our shop last Friday—I did not know him before—I was at dinner—a note was brought in to me by my boy from the shop—immediately on opening it I saw it was a forgery—I sent him into the shop, and immediately followed him, with the note in my hand—I saw the prisoner—I said, "Have you brought this note from Place and Carberry?" (from whom it purported to come)—he said "Yes"—I asked him who gave him the order—he said a man at Charing-cross had given it to him—I said it was rather odd a man at Charing-cross should give him the order to come to me, and asked where he was to take the goods when he got them—he said, "To Place and Carberry"—I said it was a forgery, sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—(<hi rend="italic">note read</hi>)—"16, Charing-cross, 31st December, 1841. Messrs. Place and Carberry will thank Mr. Bidgood to send by bearer, or immediately, 5 1/2 yards of double-milled blue kerseymere, for which they will settle on the bill being sent in to-morrow. For Place and Co. <hi rend="smallCaps">H. CARBERRY."</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, in partnership with Mr. Place. I never saw the prisoner till he was at Marlborough-street—I never sent him with this order to get these goods—it is a forgery, and was not written by me, nor by my authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have been led into this by some stranger. It appears by the evidence of the witnesses I was not known to them. I know nothing of their trade or calling. I could not write such an order; I do not know the way to do it. I carried the notes, but as to writing them I did not. It appears from the note, it does not express that I was positively to receive the goods, they are to be sent or delivered to the bearer. If they had taken me with a policeman to the spot, they would most likely have found the other party.</p>

            . I am the wife of Joseph Prichard - we live in Montague-street. I sent out my infant Elizabeth on the 4th of May, with a necklace of three rows of beads - my little girl who is nine years old took her out; she was out about two hours - I went out, and found that the child had lost the beads, which had been fastened by a clasp round her neck.</p>

I ran all round Spitalfields'-market, and called as loud as I could - he ran down a court which is no throughfare; I pointed him out to the Police-man- I am certain he is the boy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was it dark? A. Yes; there were not above three or four persons passing- I only saw the prisoner and another boy; the Magistrate discharged another boy as his master came and said he was at work at the time - I charged no boy but the prisoner; I did charge two boys, but the prisoner is the boy who took them - I made a mistake in saying I only charged one; the prisoner ran through the market- I lost sight of him three times, and then I ran up to him again with the child in my arms, and overtook him; I had never seen him before, but when he came up our street with wood - I swear he is the person.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You lost sight of him three times? A. Yes; I had seen him come up the street with wood - I saw his face distinctly by a gas-light; when he trod on my heels he was close to me, unsnapping the beads - there was another boy five yards from him, but this is the boy who took the beads.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty, and saw a number of people running; I followed them into Gregory-court - this little girl followed me with the child, and said, "That is the boy who took the necklace - give me my beads back, or my father will kill me;" the prisoner said, "It is a little boy who has run up the court, with a fustian jacket on;" I was taking the prisoner to the station-house, and he called to another boy to go to his father; an officer took that other boy, but he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you another boy took it? A. Yes - I went and found a boy in a cellar, but no one with a fustian jacket.</p>

            . On the night the prisoner was taken I was walking with him in Red Lion-street, and this little girl was on the other side of the way; I heard her say,"Oh, my God!" I turned my eyes, saw her running, and crying Stop thief! I saw a boy in a fustian coat run across the road - the prisoner ran after that boy; I said, "Stop, George, don't you ran," but he ran, and was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the shop? A. Yes, it is on the opposite side to that we were on - I had a blue coat, striped waistcoat, and corderoy trousers on; I did not see the little girl at the shop window - she was twenty yards from them when I heard this; we were beyond the shop I thought she was at play, but I turned and saw the thief, as I suppose; I saw a boy with a fustian coat on, run across into the market - when I told the prisoner to stop, he ran off, and I ran a little way; it could not be the prisoner who took them, for I was with him all the time till he ran after the thief; I do not know the court - I thought the fustian coat was a light brown or a grey; the prisoner had a black coat and an apron - I saw the prisoner was collared, and I went to his assistance, knowing him to be innocent; I insisted upon going in - no one was taken to the Magistrate but the prisoner and I.</p>

I saw this little girl run into the road - I did not see any other person run; I did not see any boy in a fustian Jacket - I was with another young girl, and we were behind the prisoner and this boy, about a yard and a half; we walked with them till they ran - they had not left us till the girl cried Stop thief!</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you were all four in company? A. Yes - we were behind the boys; I was a little acquainted with them: I saw the shop, and heard the girl scream Stop thief! I saw no one run but these two boys - the market might be about five yards off; I saw no boy in a fustian coat or jacket - I ran as far as the market, and they ran round.</p>

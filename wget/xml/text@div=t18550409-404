About 1 o'clock on Wednesday morning, 21st March, I was trying the doors in St. Ann's-place, West<lb></lb>minster—I came to Mr. Hull's workshop—he is a japanner and grainer—I tried the door, and found it was broken open—I found the door resisted being opened—I pulled the door to, and sprung my rattle for assist<lb></lb>ance, and No. 69 came to my assistance—we went inside, and found Wallace, Brown, and Summers inside the workshop, between the two doors—they were standing up behind the door—Mr. Hull was there—we had got him before we went inside—he lives twenty or thirty yards from there—I asked the prisoners what they wanted there—Brown said they were going to lodge there—I found these things down on the floor, just ready for packing up—I found this part of the padlock broken off, and I found this knife by the side.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 9, St. Ann's-court—I am a japanner—my workshop is at No. 3—no one sleeps there—I locked it up on Tuesday night, between 7 and 8 o'clock—I left all locked, the outer door, the inner door, and a desk—there is a sort of lobby between the outer door and the inner door, which takes you up stairs to another workshop over mine—when you are inside the outer door you may consider you are in the workshop—I rent the one shop; the other was empty—I have the key of the outer door, which locked up all—I left the outer door and the inner door quite secure—I was fetched by the policeman some few minutes after 1 o'clock on Wednesday morning—I went to the workshop—the door was open, the hasp was broken—this is the hasp that was on the outer door—I left it quite secure—when I got in, I found the last witness and another policeman—the prisoners were behind them—the policeman asked me to look about, and see if I could see anything missing—I discovered a quantity of old handles and brass, and these tools were on the floor—the handles and brass had been in drawers in the workshop—this stock and bit had been in the desk—these were in the workshop—they might be about a yard from the entrance—I found Wallace, and Brown, and Summers there—they wished to make acquaintance with me, but I knew nothing of them—they said they came to lodge there—I gave them no permission to come there to lodge—I missed the stock and bit, and a saw from the desk—there was a small drawer, which contained forty or fifty farthings, and they were thrown under the bench—this clock and these brushes are mine—I had left this clock safe the night before, and it was going, and all these brushes were there—they are mine—I went to the workshop the next morning, and</p>

I am a widow, and live at No. 19, St. Ann's-court—the four prisoners lodged in my house—Wallace, Summers, and Brown occupied the first floor back room—I knew Summers by the name of Dogherty—Hurst occupied a room at top, I believe the back room. On Wednesday morning, about half-past 1 o'clock, Hurst came down stairs into the yard. with a bundle in her hand, tied up in an apron—she put it on the dust hill, and she directly took it down and put it by the side of her—it contained paint brushes; I suppose about twenty, or two or three more—I heard her ask a little girl that I have the care of, to take them over to Mr. Hull—I went out to her and said the child should not take them—she said to me, "Will you take care of them?"—I said, "No; you had better go and call Mr. Hull yourself, or I will go and call him," and I sent to him, and he came and found the brushes in the yard—I could not say which room Hurst brought the brushes from—it was known then that the other three prisoners were in custody.</p>

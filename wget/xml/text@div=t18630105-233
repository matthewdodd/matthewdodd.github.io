                  </hi>. I was mate on board the barque <hi rend="italic">Martha Pope</hi>, on the voyage from Belise to London—William Curtis shipped as steward at Belise—he died on the ship coming into port, after which Mr. Giles, a doctor, made an examination of him—about four weeks after we left Belise I saw the captain strike him with a piece of skin, about as thick as my little finger, or a pen—that was the first time—he struck him more than once with that, and Curtis cried out, and said that he should not strike him, he would do his work—I saw him strike him again, perhaps a fortnight before we came to port—that was for not pumping—the ship was in distress, and we had to work all day and night—he was shamming very often—all our sails were blown away, the foreyard came down, and we had to pump all day and night, all hands—I pumped as well as the crew, and the boatswain also—the captain ordered the deceased to the pumps, and he was willing to do it at first, but he refused afterwards, and said that he was not able—the captain then struck him with the same thing—he had the same thing all the time—he fetched it out of the cabin on that occasion, and beat him again with, it—he did not lay under the pump all day, but I saw him these several times; the last time was a little before 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I remember two men carrying him down to the galley fire—they did tot throw him on to a sail; he had no bed on board, and he slept on a sail—that is a common thing for sailors, and he took sails to cover him—he did not appear to be in good health; be looked rather cold, and was shivering—he was always pale—I did not consider him ill then, but I did a few days after this—I did not see the captain beat him after that day, but he was not on deck—this was a fortnight or ten days before we came to harbour—he came on deck, and the captain sent him below—I saw the captain—flog him twice.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever sail with the captain before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the vessel became leaky the day we left Belise—there was very bad weather, and she sprung her main topmast about ten days after we left Belise—she was to a very great extent disabled—that might have the effect of starting the mast in the bull of the ship, and causing her to be more leaky and unmanageable—the crew consisted of eight, including the captain and the deceased; there were five before the mast, and three officer—after ten days the state of the vessel became such that it required in<lb></lb>cessant pumping night and day to keep her afloat—the captain worked like</p>

               <p>the other men, and, if he did not work, he steered the vessel—I have been at sea more than ten years—the captain told the deceased that, if he did not pump and do his work as well as the rest of us, we should all be lost—during the whole time, till the lad was taken below, I never saw the captain inflict upon him any more severe punishment than was inflicted on any of the crew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that the captain used that whip to any of the crew? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not seen him—he never punished the deceased more than the rest—he did punish the rest, but I cannot say whether it was with the same whip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the general behaviour of the captain kind and considerate to all the crew, including the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the general way to punish them was to take a rope's end—I did not see or hear of his inflicting punishment with any other instrument than this—the deceased shipped as cook and steward—he had no bed or hammock; other men bring beds on board, but he came on board without one—I once heard one of the men, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hart, say, "Say you are ill"—two of the sailors put the deceased on the sails, and the captain went to where he was lying and brought him nourishment from his cabin—the lad had diarrhoea; I have seen him going very often—I believe he remained two days covered up by the sails before he was taken down to the cabin—the sails were down below; the reserved sails, on which he was placed—up to that day I did not believe, from his appearance, that he was really ill—I spoke to the captain, and by his orders he was removed down below—the sail was in the forecastle, not in the captain's cabin—he remained there a day or two, and was then con<lb></lb>veyed away from the forecastle by the captain, and placed in a berth in the captain's own cabin, in which he made him a bed—it was a very different place to the forecastle; much more comfortable—he fell ill about ten days before we came to London, and, from that moment till we got into the river Thomas, the captain was unremitting in his attention upon him, giving him brandy, and stimulants, and everything he could, to nourish him and keep him up—it was five or six days before he died that the captain took him to his own cabin—while in the forecastle, the captain frequently went to him and took him things, and when he was in his own cabin he continued that attention till our arrival in the Port of London—the deceased cut his finger—I did not see him do it, but the crew told me how it occurred—I did not see the captain dress the wound and put balsam on it; I dressed it once—the deceased said that he fell and met with an accident some time before—he had a wound on his leg or foot; that was occasioned by the ship rolling very much—we had spar-wood on deck, and a single piece went adrift, and went against his foot—the vessel, at times, rolled and lurched, so that the spars and casks were rolling about the deck, and the sea was continually running over—I suffered injury by a spar striking me—during the whole voyage the lad never complained to me about ill-usage at the hands of the captain—among other cargo, we had some boxes of turtle—the chain was coiled on deck—I did not see the deceased fall over the turtle boxes and chain in one of the lurches of the ship, but I heard about it—I know that he also fell into the coal-hole and injured his head—he had a out over his eye—I asked him where he got it, and he said that he fell down and cut himself—after he was placed in the sail he was delirious, and out of his mind occasionally—I went to see him, and he was rolling and tearing about, so that, between the rolling of the ship and his rolling about, he may have injured himself—he had two shirts, one pair of trousers, and no bed, when</p>

               <p>he came on board—some of the men, and the captain particularly, furnished him with some of their own clothes on several occasions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the deceased delirious the day he was under the pump? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw him—he became delirious, to my knowledge, on the day the captain took him into his own cabin—he was two days on the sails; he then became delirious, and was taken into the cabin—I did not exactly imagine that he was about to die; I hoped he would get better—I thought he was ill, but I never thought he would die—the captain was very anxious that he should get better—the nourishment which the captain ordered for him was after he got so bad, but he had his food in the forecastle—I did not hear Dr. Giles give his evidence—all the seamen were not punished till their bodies were covered with bruises and cuts—others were not punished to that extent—the deceased was never beaten, to my knowledge, so as to bruise his body—I did not see him fall down the coal-hole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This day that the deceased was asked to pump; how long was that before the ship came into port? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nine or ten days—he shipped as cook and steward, but he was too dirty and lazy, so the captain sent him forward, and he took an ordinary seaman's watch—up to this pumping day he had dune his ordinary duty—he came on deck a fortnight after we left Belise as an ordinary seaman—he had refused to do his ordinary duty on several occasions—he was able enough to do it before he was ill, but he was not willing to come on deck, because he had no oil skin or sea-boots, and therefore would suffer more—there were several more <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> who had no oil skin or sea-boots—it is customary for the captain to disrate men—if they are not able to do their duty, they are sent before the mast.</p>

                  </hi>. I was boatswain on board—I remember the deceased lad, William Curtis—I saw the captain strike him once or twice, on the return voyage, with a small bit of tan stuff—I heard the captain tell the policeman to go and find the piece of rattan on board—I remember the captain fetching him up from below—he went down and hid himself in the coal bunker on the day that the mast went down, and the captain gave him a few strokes with the rattan, and told him to come on deck—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it was always the same piece I think—I do not remember his beating him more than twice, and the second time was the pumping—the deceased refused to pump, and was beaten a little by the captain—I do not remember whether he laid all day beside the pumps; I think he did till towards the afternoon; he was then put on the sails, and, I believe, the captain ordered him to be taken into the galley and warmed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> After the day when it was apparent that he was ill, you never saw the captain strike him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—when he was struck with this, his clothes were on—the captain never took his clothes off—the captain was kinder to the crew than a great many I have been with—this lad had the same rations, and food, and attention, that every one of us had—there was plenty of food and everything on board the ship—we used to help ourselves to what we liked, the provisions were not weighed—there was plenty of bread, and rice, and everything; and the captain wanted the deceased to be taken into the cooking galley, because it was warmer there, and he afterwards had him taken to his own cabin—I have sailed with cruel captains.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—on Wednesday, 17th September, I was called to see the deceased—his body was</p>

               <p>lying at an undertaker's shop in the West India Docks—I was called there with a view of accounting for the 
death of the man, in order that he might be buried, but I refused to make any statement without a post mortem examination—I received the Coroner's warrant to make one—it was the body of a youth quite eighteen; he might be nineteen; muscular, and well developed—the face, arms, hands, feet, legs, and, in fact, the whole anterior surface of the body, except the chest and upper part of the abdomen, was covered with wounds and bruises—there was one of par<lb></lb>ticular severity on the left instep, and another on the left foot—the hands were badly wounded—there was a wound on the left elbow, and a bruise above it—I opened the chest—the internal part of the body had very little fat—there had been on the right side a pleuracy of, I should think, a month's duration—there was adhesion, which I broke down in making the examination, and on the left side were some very old adhesions, they may have been six month, a year, or two years, indicating former attacks of pleuracy—the lungs were very much congested; the liver and heart were very healthy; the heart unusually firm—the gall bladder was very much distended; I pressed a considerable quantity of bile out of it—another thing which struck me was the staring and reddened eye of the corpse—the eyes were wide open and very red; the stomach very flat and quite empty—from the distended state of the gall-bladder, and the emptiness of the stomach and small intestines, I formed an opinion that the body had not had any nourishment, and formed the notion that somebody should be combined with me in the examination; and I examined the body no further—that examination was on Friday morning—on the following Tuesday, an inquest having been opened by the Coroner, the prisoner requested that a relative of his should be present—he was allowed to have Dr. Bristow—Dr. Edmunds was also called in; and Dr. Edmunds, Dr. Bristow, and myself, performed the second post mortem—on opening the head, the brain was large; it certainly was congested, but not to any extent—the membranes of the brain were much congested; a highly vascular state; which we always find from long exposure to cold—the captain was present also at this post mortem, and I stated my firm belief that the boy had not had anything for a fortnight, that being my previous impression—he said, "No, not so long as that; it is eight days"—that was said in the presence of us all—I should say that the inflammation of the pleura had existed a month—a great many of the wounds might be produced by this rattan, it is a very severe instrument wielded by a powerful man—they were round wounds and several of them would be accounted for by this knot—as to the wounds on his hands, if a man is punished he generally puts his hands and his face together, and he would only get the flicks on his face; it would not he in<lb></lb>tended to hit him on the head—there was not enough to cause death, with<lb></lb>out violence—
death resulted from exposure to cold, want of food suitable to his condition, and ill-usage, blows—when I came out of the <hi rend="italic">Lord Hood</hi>, where the inquest was going to be held, the captain was walking up and down—I did not know his name or who he was; he said, "What do you think of this case, doctor?"—I said, "It is a bad case"—he said, "What do you think it was done with?"—I said, "A rope"—he said, "How big a rope?"—I said, "About an inch thick"—he said, "No; it was not done with a rope at all, it was a rattan thong; do not make matters black against me and I will give you a sum of money, "or" some money"—I walked up to the beadle and said, "This man is attempting to bribe me," and walked away—when I got home I found that a Captain Stone had been and left a</p>

Q.</hi> Did he not tell you at the time he mentioned the rattan, that he never struck the lad with anything else, or was guilty of any ill-usage whatever, and that he had not acted cruelly to him during the whole voyage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he never said a word about having nursed the lad, and having him in his own cabin during the last ten days of the voyage—I have told you all he did say—he did not say that for the last eight or ten days before they arrived, the lad was in a state of delirium, and that his jaw was so locked that they could not get anything in—he said that he had offered the boy brandy when he was very ill, towards the last two days, but he thought his jaw was locked and he could not take it; but the jaw was not locked—I do not think he accounted for the lad not having had food by reason of the fact that he could not get it between his jaws, that his jaws were locked—I will swear he did not tell me so—it is my impression that he attributed his not having had food for two days to the fact that his jaw was locked; but he did not use the term "food," he said, "I tried to give him a little brandy, but could not because the jaw was looked—the post mortem was commenced on Friday, the 19th, and was continued on, I think, the following Tuesday—I opened the chest on the first day, but not the head or the abdomen, because I thought somebody else ought to be associated with me in so grave a case—when I stated my belief that he had had no food for fourteen days, I had not examined the abdominal viscers, but I could feel that the large intestines were empty—there were hardened feces in the rectum, because it is the receptacle for them—I mean to say that where man has been without food for eight days, there would be feces in the rectum, because it is by the continuance of food that they are forced out—it was not there to any great extent—I found none in the <hi rend="italic">colon</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> joins the <hi rend="italic">rectum</hi>—the appearances in the lungs were produced by cold, and are con<lb></lb>sistent with ordinary disease, irrespective of violence, and the vascularity of the brain also; the lungs were very healthy, but were congested by cold; the lungs may be healthy and yet inflamed—the appearance of the mem<lb></lb>branes of the brain might be produced by cold; there was no disease in the brain, it was only congested—it was just the state you would be in, if you were lying down drunk and exposed all night to the cold—cold produced it, I said so at first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you to tell the jury that this little rattan would inflict flesh wounds through the clothes of the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had no clothes on—I was not on board, but the captain said his clothes were blown over<lb></lb>board, and he laid naked on the sails—he did not say that he had flogged him when he was lying naked on the sails—it is my firm belief that some of the wounds were produced by this rattan, whether it would inflict such wounds through the clothes would depend upon the thickness of the clothes—if he had very thin clothing it would make no difference.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. and M.R.C S. I am a Licentiate of the College of Physicians, and live in Finsbury square—by the Coroner's directions I examined the deceased with Dr. Giles; that was the second examination on the Tuesday—it was the body of a well made young man about nineteen or twenty years of age—I have heard Dr. Giles's evidence—I do not take so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050065"></xptr>
               <p>serious a view of the external appearance of the body as he does; I should not put it into such strong language—there were several wounds on the hands and arms, and on the left elbow, and from twelve to fifteen trivial skin wounds on the face, not scratches but trifling abrasions, not injuring the texture of the skin and yet well defined marks—over the left eyebrow was a lacerated wound five-eights of an inch long, extending through the thickness of the skin, and surrounded by a little extravasated blood into the texture of the scalp—there were several wounds on the fore-arm, an abrased wound on the back of the hand, and a severe wound on the last knuckle of the right index finger—there was a severe contused wound on the left elbow, which was probably produced by a fall or a blow, probably a fall—several more wounds on the arm and wrist, and a severe wound on the second knuckle of the middle finger—there were no wounds on the front of the chest or abdomen, or on the trunk at all—on the right groin was a contusion, probably about a week old, and on the front of each thigh, were some pale red patches, such as might be produced by any bruising shortly before death—on the back of the right heel was a scratch from two to three inches long, which had not divided the skin throughout, and which might have been pro<lb></lb>duced by dragging the deceased over a nail on the deck, or some such thing as that—I should say it had been produced in that way—there was a round wound in front of the right instep, near the base of the great toe, and several more wounds and bruises about the legs—I did not see a second wound on the right foot; there was no wound there—I am sure it was the right instep; there was a similar wound on both insteps—there was a wound on the left leg, Dr. Giles is in error there, his memory has not served him; it was the most severe wound of all, and was on the front and outer side of the leg, about four inches above the uncle—there were several more wounds and bruises also about that leg, and there was a round wound in front of the instep, precisely like that on the right foot but a little more recent in date—the wound on the left instep was older than that on the right, and I should think that on the lower third of the leg was more recent still, that was the most serious of all, and was surrounded by a diffused erasypa<lb></lb>litie inflammation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not understand you to say that it contributed to the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but it was the only one in which the question could be raised—I should say that it was more than a week old, perhaps two weeks—the wounds were all under process of healing—we then turned the body over, and on the back of the trunk were scars as long as the hand, to which I am unable to give any name; they may have been years old, certainly many months, and not five or six weeks only—they were scars above the loin nearly twice the size of a man's hand in extent—the hand and abdomen had not been opened, but the chest had—I now opened the head; the skull was uninjured, but the membranes of the brain were adherent to the top, to the extent of a shilling; the membranes throughout were fiery red and very vascular, as also was the ball of the eye—the brain was hard and firm—those are the results of exposure to cold—I then opened the chest; the heart was healthy and exceedingly firm—the langs healthy, but largely con<lb></lb>gested at their lower portion—the right lung and the right side of the chest were perfectly healthy, the left lung was adhering to the wall of the chest by pleuretic adhesions, probably years old—I then passed to the abdo<lb></lb>men, the <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> was loaded with feculent matter from one end to the other—the stomach and small intestines were empty but perfectly, healthy, and their appearance was inconsistent with starvation, and so were all the appearances</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050066"></xptr>
               <p>of the body—I then examined the lining of the intestines, which was healthy throughout, that is important as excluding some forms of disease—the liver was healthy, but the spleen somewhat softened, more soil than usual—the kidneys were healthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is not inconsistent with starvation is it, to have the stomach empty, it is generally empty, is it not, from starvation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but it becomes transparent, you can see food through—the appearances which were the result of disease were hardly sufficient to account for death—the appearances I saw, aided by exposure to cold, would be sufficient to kill him, especially if aided by harsh treatment or flogging—I ought to say that there were no linear marks, such as would be produced by stripes—the knot might do it, if it was struck in this way; but my impression is that it did not—they were perfectly circular, and were in process of healing, there<lb></lb>fore, it is pure speculation for me to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the bruises you observed such as might be pro<lb></lb>duced by his being on board ship in very tempestuous weather, and being thrown about against the masts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say that all the wound on the limbs might be produced in that way, and also by the hands, including that which I consider the most serious—the serious part of that was the in<lb></lb>flammation, not the wound itself; it was an ordinary skin wound—it might be produced by a piece of logwood rolling about, or kicking a man's shins would produce it, and if he was in bad health and untended, that would cause inflammation—a delirious patient on board ship might cause some of those injuries—that one on the elbow was, I believe, produced by a fall; it is just the point where the body falls—the wound on the forehead might be produced by his sleeping on deck, and falling against the gunwale or capstan; we see such wounds every day produced by the same means—the wound on the leg, which was in process of healing, was not dangerous—it had begun to heal, but had become inflamed by exposure to cold, and it might get irri<lb></lb>tated by the salt water—the appearances I observed in the brain and lungs might have been caused by exposure to the cold, and to the salt water, wholly irrespective of the man being struck any blows at all; all the internal disease might be produced irrespective of any external violence, and I believe had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the internal disease be sufficient to cause death, without exposure to cold or violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not without exposure to cold, and violence would further contribute to accelerate it—if violence was com<lb></lb>mitted within three weeks or a fortnight, it would influence the lad's death; any violence would contribute to it, and the disease, without the violent would not in many cases—if the boy, in delirium, fell about among the cargo, I should not expect to find wounds on his trunk; they would be about the arms and legs, a man generally falls on his hands—wounds on the trunk might be caused by falling about the deck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there any marks on the knees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Trivial marks, such as might be made by the man kneeling on a rough deck, but not wounds in the proper sense of the term; a man might graze his knees kneeling on the deck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You seem to Bay that the marks of internal disease would not in your judgment account for his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not without exposure to cold—exposure to cold acting on the diseased state, I observed, was quite sufficient to cause death, wholly irrespective of the wounds I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Minerva-street, Hackney-road, and am an oilman. The prisoner assisted me occasionally in my business—on Tuesday evening, 28th Dec., at half-past six o'clock, I and the prisoner left my ware-house together—I closed the door—it was secured by a lock, and I carried the key with me—the things stated, were then safe in my house, which is in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green—the prisoner accompained me a little father than the top of the street, and we parted—at twelve o'clock I returned to my dwelling-house, which communicates with the warehouse at the back, and was let in by my lad—I missed from the upper rooms three coats, three waistcoats, a pair of trowsers, a silver-gilt watch, and a guard—I had been them safe when I put on my coat, before I left at half-past six—they exceed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in value—the prisoner came into my room while I was putting on my coat, but went down again directly—he could not have taken them then—I am quite positive the kitchen door and window were shut when I left.</p>

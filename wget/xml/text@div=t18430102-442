                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Old Oak-common, in the parish of Acton, Middlesex. On the 21st of Dec. I had a chestnut mare—between eight and nine o'clock in the morning I turned her out on Old Oak-common—between ten and eleven I was by the side of the canal towing-path at Shepherd's Bush—I looked back, seeing a horse coming, and thought it was ray mare—I waited till it came up to me—the two prisoners were with it—Carter was leading her—Smith was on her—he fell off, and when Carter came opposite me I asked him where he was going—he said to Paddington, that the mare belonged to the little boy's (Smith's) father—I caught hold of the big boy, (Carter) and the mare, and ran after Smith—he ran back to the Old Oak-bridge—I caught him afterwards—they had a rope on the mare's head made in the shape of a halter—Smith said when I took him that the other gave him some halfpence for him to come with him after her—I took them both to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 21st of Dec. the prosecutor brought the prisoners to the station with the mare, and gave them into my custody—Smith said Carter asked him to go down to the Old Oak-common, to fetch his father's horse—that he promised to give him a halfpenny and some more halfpence and a piece of beef when they got to Paddington—Carter denied it—this rope was round the mare's neck, made up like a halter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hatter at Hammersmith; the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my employ. On the 14th of March I heard something from Mr. Baker, a neighbour—I went to his house, and saw this hat, which is mine—I took it home—I showed it to the prisoner, and asked if he had sold it—he said he had never sold it, and knew nothing about it—I said, "When did you sell Mr. Baker this hat?"—he said, "One morning last week"—I said "What for?"—he said, "The regular price"—I said, "Do you mean 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d.?"</hi>—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What did you do with the money?"—he said "I have not had it"—I said, "Have you not sold this for half-a-crown, and kept the money?"—he said, "No"—I said, "You have not accounted for it?"—he said it would be time enough to account when he got the money—I had missed this hat on the Saturday previous—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. Baker, a tallow-chandler. The prisoner sold me this hat in Mr. Jennings' shop—I gave him half-a-crown for it—I did not go into the shop to buy a hat; I was coming by and he called me in, and told me he could show me the hat he had spoken to me about before—I took the hat to my master's, and put it in my box—I know it is the same hat by a mark I put in it—the prisoner said he would new line the hat, and sell it me for half-a-crown.</p>

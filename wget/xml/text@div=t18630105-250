I live at 2, New King-street, Deptford, and am a draper—on Saturday night, 3d January, the prisoner came into my shop about 7 o'clock, and asked for a cap front—I served her—when she paid for it she sat down on a chair a little way from the counter, in the middle of the shop, and began to arrange her parcels and bundles—I saw her, but I was busy, and did not notice her particularly—presently she stooped down and began scrambling on the floor close to where she was sitting—a chair fell over, but she took no notice, and continued scrambling on the floor—I thought she was rather tipsy—I did not see what she picked up—I walked forward till I was opposite her, to see what it was—I saw her pick up a pair of shoes, which she put in her bundle, and then immediately went out—about four or five minutes after she was gone, I went to the middle of the shop to see if all was right, and I missed a piece of print and a piece of linsey of about twenty-five yards, from the bar that was there—this is the piece of</p>

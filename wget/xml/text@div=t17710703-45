On Saturday morning, the fourth of May, a little after one o'clock, my wife awaked me, and said she heard strange voices, and saw a light in the room adjoining to where I lay, in which room the scholars lay; I was going to speak to them, or hollow out of the window: Mrs. Hickman reminded me of a great bell that was in the room; I rung it; the thieves were alarmed, and run away. When I went down, stairs, I found a window open, in a little scullery, that I had left fast over night; the shutters were thrown open, and the bolts of the shutters wrenched. I have no doubt but they came in there.</p>

               <p>In consequence of a robbery at Dover, Dixon's father was taken with the property that had been stolen at Dover; he was asked where the watches were, and he said, he was sent there to fetch them, innocently, and knew nothing where they were; and then said, that if they would not hurt him, he would give them information where they might find the watches; he wrote a letter to his wife the prisoner, desiring her to give the particulars of the burglary done at Dover.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you the letter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Produce it? - She denied having any knowledge of it, and said she knew nothing of the property, or any thing about it; we pressed her very much upon it, and told her if she would restore us the property, it was all we wished or wanted of her; but she still persisted in being ignorant, we went about the house to search, and Jealous and me were in the kitchen, and left Mr. Andrews and her in the parlour; in that parlour I found some drawers that were locked and could not get into them, and we went out of the room, and returning we found the drawers open, and her at them: there was the silver watch which Mr. Andrews swore to, we insisted on searching her, she refused, but we did search her, and Mr. Carpmeal took a watch out of her bosom, and Jealous found some rings.</p>

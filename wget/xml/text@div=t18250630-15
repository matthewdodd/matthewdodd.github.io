            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of May I saw the prisoner about one o'clock in the morning, getting over a wooden fence at Mr. Chadwick's; I asked what he was doing; he said he was foreman to Mr. Chadwick, and had a right to be there - that there were two men within the premises, who threatened to knock his brains out; I sprung the rattle, and asked where the men were - he said they were standing against the parlour window. I surrounded the premises with watchmen, and took the prisoner round to the front of the house; I called to Mr. Chadwick, and said I had got this person; I afterwards found those two pieces of marble slab near the place where he had got over.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Silcock, at the Salmon and Compasses, public-house, Pentonville. On the night of the 16th of May the prisoner came and knocked at the door after we had shut up - he said he wanted to speak to Mr. Silcock, and wanted to leave a piece of marble, as he had got two other pieces, and could not carry them; I took the piece, and put it down by the side of the clock; he then wanted to have something to drink, but my master would not draw it.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house about half-past one o'clock; I asked if he knew any thing about the matter: he said No. Next morning I asked him if he should like to send for any friend; he said Yes, he should like to get some friend to bail him; I said I could not take any bail - then he said he would give me a guinea to go to his master, and make it up as it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was intoxicated when he went into the yard, but took no property whatever; that he worked on his own account, and the marble found at his lodging was his own.</p>

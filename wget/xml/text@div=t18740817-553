I am a labourer, and live at Mary Street, Poplar—I was in Penny-fields about 10.30 o'clock on the night of 22nd July, when the two men were fighting—one appeared to me to be a Blackwall Cross man, and the other a seafaring man—the prisoner pulled up his sleeves and said "We will stick you if you come near me"—he had something in his hand, which appeared to me to be a dagger—the two men fell, and Hunt ran towards the prisoner, and the prisoner struck him a downward blow in the back—he ran into a boarding-house, and I pointed out the boarding-house to the constable—Hunt fell down on his face and hands, and he could get up without any assistance—the doctor came and cut his shirt off his back—he was bleeding through the shirt.</p>

            . I am a collector of rents, and live in Cumberland-street, Curtain-road. I bought a cask of ale and a cask of beer of the prisoner in June last. I intended to brew, and saw him at Mr. Pratt's, a <rs id="t18221023-104-viclabel557" type="occupation">sugar refiner</rs>

I asked him to give me instructions to brew - he did - but said he was going to brew himself next week, and if I would send him hops and malt he would brew for me. I said</p>
               <p>"It will be useless my sending hops and malt; if you'll buy them for me when you buy your own, I will pay you for them." He always told me he was a partner in the house, and it was generally believed in the neighbourhood. I sent a message to him, and received a cask of beer and ale from him, and paid him 16 s., which he said was for two bushels of malt and two pounds of hops.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. He offered to brew if you sent the malt and hops - A. Yes.</p>

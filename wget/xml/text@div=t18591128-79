I am 17 years old—I reside with my relatives in Plough-road, Rotherhithe—on Sunday, the 30th October, I went to Brighton by an excursion train—I had a third-class ticket—I went with my uncle about 6 o'clock that evening to the station—I saw Mr. French there; he said he would ride with me—I got into a third-class carriage with him—I was alone with him in the carriage—I told him I did not like that carriage, I would sooner go in another one, and he got out to look for another, but he came back and said, "Never mind, this is a nice carriage; we shall be nice and warm here"—when the train started he began talking about love, and saying what a nice place the country was for lovers to make love in—I did not answer him, but he kept on, and shortly afterwards, when we got in the dark, he put his arm round me and tried to kiss me, and put his hand up and down about my knees, with his hand outside my gown—I resisted that, and got up and stood against the window—I said I would get in another carriage—the prisoner did not do anything else to me—he was not long in doing it—he wanted to know if there was any recompense he could make, and would I forgive him—he kept talking, but I made no answer; and when the train came to the Three Bridges, I spoke to the guard and told him what had happened, and insisted on getting into another carriage, and went</p>

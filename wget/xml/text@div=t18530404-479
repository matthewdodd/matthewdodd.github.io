                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick Toole, we live at No. 8, George-street, St. Giles's. On 7th March, 1 left my room about a quarter past 11 o'clock at night—I locked the door, and took the key in my pocket—I came back about 12 o'clock—when I went in my room on the ground floor I found</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040037"></xptr>
               <p>the door wide open leading into the yard—it was not all wood, part of it was glass, and the glass was broken—breaking the glass would enable a person to put their hand through, and undo the bolts—that was how it was done—when I went out I left ray two children in bed, and a piece of bacon in my room weighing 12 3/4 lbs.—when I found the door open I went in the yard, and found the prisoner there—he was stooping down to a box of mine, which he had broken open with my poker; I seized bold of him by the neck, and stuck to him till the officer came—when I went out, I bad left that box underneath the table in my room—the prisoner was taken into custody on the door outside—he got there by his struggling with me to get away—the box contained some children's clothes, a shirt, and a smock frock and a purse with 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—the bacon had cost 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I had eaten about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of it—at that time the prisoner lived at the back of my yard—a person could get from the place where he lived to my yard—my house is in the parish of St. Giles's, my landlord lives at No. 3—he does not live in that house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUGHES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner ever been in your house before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and had ginger beer and pea soup which I sell—of course there are girls come there—I have no women come there to sleep—I have only one apartment—I do not know who lives up stairs, my husband was in gaol at that time—the prisoner came to my house twice—he did not sleep there—he could not, for I have only one bed—he was there all night, he did not sleep, he sat up all night—I was there, and others—there was one who was a friend of mine—we were sitting up all night—we keep open on the Saturday night—I recollect the prisoner's mother coming to my door—she did not ask me for him, he was standing on my floor—there was only my friend and me and him there then, but there had been more women there—I close <hi rend="italic">my</hi> shop at 1 o'clock on Saturday night—I sell ginger beer, and soup, and eatables—my husband was not in gaol for illegally selling gin in that place—we were not drinking anything that Saturday that the prisoner was there, only persons coming in for ginger beer—I never make a mistake and sell a little gin in the ginger beer—when I went out there was no one in the room, only the two children—the prisoner was there on the night my husband was taken—there came a drunken man in and the prisoner went towards him, and struck him down—he took my part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect the prisoner's mother <hi rend="italic">or</hi> father coming to your house for him, and did not he say, "Never mind, it is only the old man or old woman; you lend me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a drop of gin as you have got none in the house?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I lent it him on the Sunday morning—he did the robbery on the Monday night—the bacon was not there when I lent him the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—where the bacon is now is what I want to know—I was told there were two men on the top of the wall, and he raised the bacon to them, but I did not see them—I asked the prisoner for it—he told me he had not had it</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You keep a room for the sale of eatables and ginger beer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; my husband was in prison for having a drunken man come in our room and riot outside—I cannot tell how many people there were there on the night we sat up—my husband was in prison a fortnight, he was there at the time this happened—this robbery was on the Monday night, and on the Saturday night these people were sitting up—they were not people I knew, but strangers coming in for something—the prisoner remained in the room all night, and a female friend of mine—my little girl is seven years old, and the boy is four—they were in the room when I went out that Monday</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040038"></xptr>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything taken out of the box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the prisoner saw me put the money in the box on the Sunday morning when I lent him the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were three bolts to the back door, two of them were fastened—one of them is underneath, one in the middle, and one at the top—a man putting his hand through the glass could reach the two bolts.</p>

I live at the station house, at St. Giles—it is in Clark's-buildings, about 100 yards from where the prosecutor lives in George-street—on Monday night, 7th March, I was called to the house about 12 o'clock, I saw the prosecutrix had got hold of the prisoner by the neck—I asked what was the matter, she said he had robbed her of the bacon, and she would give him in charge—he said nothing—I took him to the station—I returned to the house, I found the glass in the door was broken, and I found the box in the back yard with the poker stuck in it—this is it—the staple has been forced off the lid—the staple is locked in the lock—the glass in the door was so broken, that a hand put in could undo the two lower bolts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know this house at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have not been there above five months—I think a person putting in their hand could reach and undo the bolts—I cannot say what is the height of the door—there was paper over the glass—the bolt is at the middle of the door—it is impossible for a man to put his hand through, and reach the bottom.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

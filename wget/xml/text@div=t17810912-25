When I came out, the prisoner followed me, and robbed me of 19 guineas. I was something in liquor. I cannot say how long I was in the house, but not above an hour at most.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with her in the house? - Yes; and I treated her with something to drink. I am sure it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Where did you go, when you came out of the house? - Into the street. She got familiar with me in the street, and robbed me of 19 guineas, and a note I had of Capt. Stevenson, and a protection. She took them out of my waistcoat pocket. They were both found upon her.</p>
               <p>Had she seen your money in the house? - I had the change of a guinea in my pocket. The guineas were in a purse: the silver was loose. I believe I hauled the silver out, to pay for the liquor, in the house.</p>
               <p>How long was she with you in the street? - A mighty little time. As soon as she had got the money, she was gone like a shot. It was on Monday. I searched for her all Tuesday, but could not find her. I found her on Wednesday. She had a whole band of music in the house. I asked her her name. She said her name was

            . I said, What, you are the pirate that took the Serapis: I have caught you, have I? I went to her at the lock-up house, and told her, if she had eight or ten guineas left, if she would give them me, I would send her about her business; for I had not a farthing left to take me home to Liverpool. I am sure I had the money when I came out of the house. I have found none of it since. As soon as she was gone, I put my hand to my pocket, and missed the money. I did not know where to follow her. I abused her, being a little in liquor; and some men came about me (of her consorts, I suppose), and asked me what I abused her for. I heard a watchman coming: I called Watch! Robbery! and then they all flew from me. I told the watchman I had been robbed of 20 l. and went with him to the watch-house.</p>

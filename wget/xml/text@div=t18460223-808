                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. James Courthorpe Peache—he is a timber merchant, and lives in Belvidere-road, Lambeth. On the forenoon of Satur<lb></lb>day, the 31st of Jan., my attention was called to the outside of the counting-house in the yard—I noticed that some of the lead pipe from the counting-house to the drain was cut away—on the next Monday morning I discovered that some further part of the lead had been removed from the ridge and round the chimney of the counting-house—the officer brought some lead, which turned out to have been removed from there—it was compared, and fitted the place—I had seen it right a few days before—the prisoner has been about the neighbourhood for some years.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 87.) On Saturday morning, the 31st of Jan., I was on duty in Waterloo-road—I saw the prisoner and another boy coming along St. Andrew's-terrace—the prisoner had a bag—I spoke to his companion, and the prisoner dropped the bag, and ran away—he was stopped for me, and I took him—I said I wanted him concerning some lead—(I saw that it was lead in the bag)—he aaid, "I know nothing at all about it"—I took the lead to the prosecutor's premises, and compared it with the marks on his counting-house—it fitted exactly.</p>

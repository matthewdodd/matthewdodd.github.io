               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you positive it is your cage? A. Yes; I know it by its appearance - [The witness tried to make the parrot repeat the words "Jacko, Pretty;" but would not.] - it has a defect in the right wing - it was moulting time; some large feathers are out of the right wing, and have never grown again.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday night, the 14th of August, I found this parrot and cage hanging up in the prisoner's room, in Rose-lane, Spitalfields - I asked if they were hers; she said Yes, that she gave 14s. for it fourteen months ago of a man named Adams, in Rosemary-lane. I took her in charge.</p>

            . I am wife of Joseph Smites. I occasionally char for the prosecutor - I saw her buy this parrot about fourteen months ago in Rosemary-lane - it has hung publicly out of her window every day since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did all the neighbourhood see it? A. She bought it of Adams, he had two others at the time; she bought the cage also of him - he asked 1l., and took 14s.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GOODING. The parrot was advertised - Mrs. Ansell told me what it could repeat, and it did repeat it; and she described the defect in its wing before it was found. I am often in the prisoner's neighbourhood, and never saw it hanging out of her window; if I had seen one in that low neighbourhood I should have noticed it.</p>
               <p>Before the case was concluded, the parrot repeated, the words"Jacko pretty."</p>

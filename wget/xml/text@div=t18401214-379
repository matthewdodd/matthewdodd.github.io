                  </hi>. I believe this to be my brother's diamond—the handle is altered now—I had it this day fortnight at Deptford, about eleven o'clock—I left it on a mat outside a house—when I came back it was gone—no one was working with me—Collier was about there—I offered him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give it to me—he said he bad not got it—he came to me on the Wednesday, and said he knew where it was—I threatened to hand him over to the police—he said he would not go—the next day I went with him to Boyce's, and saw Mrs. Boyce—she said her husband was not at home, and desired me to call on the Saturday night—I told her what I came for—the policeman and I went on the Saturday night—Boyce then produced the diamond, and said he had given 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—Collier told me he had sold it to Boyce.</p>

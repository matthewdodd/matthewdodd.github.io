               <p>Q. Can you say from your own experience that there is a compleat set of coining instruments? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure he said it was his? - A. Yes, I am; he afterwards, before we went away, changed the shoes again, and put on a pair that Harper brought out of the one-pair of stairs, that had a pair of silver buckles in them.</p>

               <p>I am an officer; I went in company with Armstrong and the other officers, to a house No. 1, in Nottingham-court; we knocked at the door several times, and could get no admittance; I pushed up the window and got in; and while I was getting in I heard some people coming up the cellar stairs; I then went to open the front door to let the other officers in, and then I went up stairs; and as I was going up stairs, I saw Ayscough's back, he had no shirt on; he was getting out at the staircase window; there was a woman there, and Mendham was setting himself down upon the tiles; Ayscough was going out headforemost, the woman ran away up higher; I had got hold of Ayscough by the leg, but being very heavy, I could not hold him; I halloaed to Armstrong to go to the front of the street; the tiles went down to the yard belonging to the public house; when I could hold Ayscough no longer, I let him drop: I went down and told Harper to go up stairs after the woman; I ran out into the street and followed Mendham; I saw him almost immediately on my getting out; I followed him and took him back to the house, he was about forty or fifty yards from the house; when I brought him back he wanted to go up stairs very bad; I looked particularly at his hands when I brought him back, and they were all grease and black, as if he had been at work; I delivered him up to Harper, and went to see if I could see any thing of Armstrong and the other man; I met him bringing him back; I then went into the cellar, and there was a press fixed, with a pair of does in it, and great deal of copper stamped and unstamped, and there were candles burning, and a curtain hanging up across the room facing the window; the dies were fixed in a press.</p>

               <p>I went with the other officers to this house; I went up stairs and apprehended the woman, her hands were black and dirty, and rather greasy, the same as the men's were, as if she had just come from work; I was in the cellar, and saw the dies and every thing there: Peach and the other officers searched the prisoners, I saw him take some halfpence from them.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with the other officers and apprehended the prisoners; I searched Mendham and Ayscough; I found these halfpence on Mendham, (producing them), which correspond with the dies; when I took them from him, they felt greasy, and blacked my thumb and finger: upon Ayscough I found four halfpence, and another struck with a head and a blank on the other side, it is a different die; the men's hands were black and greasy.</p>
               <p>Ayscough's defence. I called there to strip myself; I am assistant to the Dover coach; I was shaving myself at the time; the landlord of the house who made his escape, said, if you do not get out at the window, you will go to gaol; the woman of the house, Mrs. Clark, washed for me; when I came back to the house with Mr. Armstrong, they desired me to put my things on if I had any there; I took my shirt, and put that on; Mr. Peach took hold of my coat and waistcoat, and asked if they were mine, I made no answer, but put them on; the waistcoat was not mine, but through my fright I put it on; from thence they carried me to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Peach. He first refused to tell where his cloaths were, till he was told that if he did not, he would be handcuffed, and taken to the office naked as he was; I then went with him to the house, and they lay on a chair with his shirt, and he put them on.</p>
               <p>Mendham's defence. I came from the whitehorse, Buckingham gate, to Mrs. Clark, to ask her if she knew where my brother lived, and this man told me, if I did not get out of the house, I should be committed to prison; I lived along with Mr. Bennet, in Westminster, he is a bankrupt now; I have left the White-horse to go to him about a twelvemonth, I never knew any thing at all about the work; as to the halfpence that were found upon me, I took them on the over-night.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Peach.) Q. Did you see any other persons making their escape? - A. No; I was not backwards where they made their escape, Armstrong was.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Armstrong.) Q. Were you in such a situation that you could see whether there were more persons in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they have got out, and you not have seen them? - A. They might, the front way.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wray.) Q. Did you see any other persons in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no other person get out at the window? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was there time, from the time of your getting in, for any other person to have got out? - A. No; I think not.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Harper.) Q. Did you see any other person in the house? - A. No, only a woman.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How long was it after your first knocking at the door that you entered by the window? - A. Some minutes.</p>
               <p>Jones's defence. I am only a lodger in the house, I lodge at the top of the house; I am a widow with three fatherless children, I go out a chairing in general; I know nothing at all of the transactions in the house; I never go down but once a week to pay my rent; I am out sometimes five days out of six; I pay my rent to one Mrs Clark.</p>

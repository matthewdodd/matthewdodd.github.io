               <p>Was any thing said to make him acknowledge it? - I left word at the public house, that if he would come back, and would let me have my things, (I was a stranger to the law,) I should be glad to put myself to a guineas expence, and he was told what I should say; and he said he would suffer the law, he would not do it, then the woman that keeps the public house, and the pawnbroker had him taken up.</p>

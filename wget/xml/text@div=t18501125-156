On Sunday morning, 6th Oct., about ten minutes past twelve o'clock at night, I was on duty with Saunders in the Lewisham-road, and saw the prisoners making a noise—Marlow came up to me, looked me hard in the face, and said, "It is you, you b——r, is it?"—I said, "Yes, it is me"—I told him he had better go home, for I did not want any disturbance there—he said he would not go home, he had served one month at Maidstone, and the Magistrate told him we had no business to interfere with him—I told him to go home several times—they kept swearing and abusing me—I took out my watch, and said, "Now, if you will go home, I don't want to interfere with you; I will give you five minutes to disperse"—I waited five minutes—three of them went away—there were six—the prisoners and Benjamin Marlow stopped—I took hold of Everett gently by the shoulder,</p>

                  </hi> ( <hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 220). On Sunday morning, 6th Oct., a little after twelve o'clock, I was on duty with Frampton, in the Lewisham-road—the prisoners were making a disturbance, and Frampton told them to leave—he took out his watch, and gave them five minutes, at the end of which they ran up to a wood-stack, to draw some sticks, but they did not—Marlow said, "We mean to give it you to-night, you b—r"—we followed them to see where they were gone, and they met Frampton, and Marlow struck him in the breast twice, with his double fist—Frampton then took Marlow by the arm, and Marlow ran his head between Frampton's legs, and tried to throw him down—Everett and Benjamin Marlow then went to a wooden fence, and drew a paling each; Everett threw one at Frampton, which took him athwart the nose and right cheek-bone, and he fell down senseless—they immediately ran away —Frampton bled very much indeed—Marlow was taken a few days after<lb></lb>wards—when Everett threw the paling, Marlow was about three feet from him—he had just got away from Frampton—it was a wooden paling, with square edges, about three feet and a half long, and about an inch and a half thick—he stood about six yards from Frampton at the time he threw it—the middle part of it struck him.</p>

On Sun<lb></lb>day morning, 6th Oct., about one o'clock, Frampton was brought to me—he was bleeding considerably from the nose and cheek—the wound on the nose was an irregular-shaped cut; that on the cheek was a sharp, clean cut—a sharp-edged paling would be very likely to cause it—it</p>

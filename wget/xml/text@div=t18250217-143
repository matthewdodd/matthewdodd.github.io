I saw them at Marlborough-street about three weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You sell a variety of articles of this description, and these had no particular mark on them? A. No; they have our shop mark on them.</p>

I saw the parcel in my master's house, but did not see the contents till after it was found in the prisoner's box. It was delivered on the 25th of January, and, I think, on the 27th or 28th, an enquiry was made about it in the hearing of the prisoner. I heard him deny all knowledge of it several times. I think it was on the 9th of February that the things were found in his portmanteau - it was not locked - there were two black half handkerchiefs and one stiffner. The valet and I searched the box; we told Mr. Trotter of it, and he sent for an officer. The prisoner was out, but returned, and went into his own room before the officer came. Mr. Trotter called him down, and said there were some things missing, and he should search all the servants' boxes, and begin with his, as he was just come to the house. He and Mr. Trotter and I then went to his room: the box was searched, but the things were not there then. The officer came soon after, and Mr. Trotter desired him to search the prisoner, which he did, but nothing was found on him. The articles were found under the mattress of the prisoner's bed, in his own room, to which no one went, except the female servant to make the bed. I said, these are the two handkerchiefs; they came from Mr. Nicholl's: the prisoner said, "Yes; I acknowledge, Sir, they are your property - you may hang me if you like." He had been in the service about seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you said, you would hang him, if you could? A. I said, if it was my own brother I would hang him, if he were a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, on Saturday, you would hang the prisoner, if you could? A. No; I did not. I know Holt: I did not say so to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, that Counsel had better not cross-examine you, for you would hang him, if you could? A. I told him, that counsel had better not push me, for, if they did, I should state other things. Mr. Trotter is not here, nor the valet. The parcel was delivered on the Tuesday evening, and enquired for about the Thursday or Friday - the box was not locked; they were put in again in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 9th of February - are you quite sure you did not put them into the bed? A. Yes. He said he had seen that some one had been at his box, and he removed them to the bed.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was sent for. I found the articles under the mattress, while the prisoner was standing by; he said, "I did take them, you may hang me if you like;" he repeated it again, and said, "I acknowledge I did take them." I told him they had been seen in his box, and asked him why he had removed them; he said he found his box had been interrupted, and he was afraid some one had been looking into it, and he removed them under the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What had been said to him in the interval, you do not know? A. He said they had been laying behind the table in the hall, and he had taken them up stairs for his own use, and after enquiries had been made about them he did not like to produce them.</p>

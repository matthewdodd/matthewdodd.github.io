               <p>barman—before this he had been in my service, and was discharged—(he went into the service of my brother)—I cannot say when he left him—I wrote to him, and he came to me, I think about a month after he had left my brother's service—I wished him to come into my service, and I agreed with him for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the first six months, and 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the next six months—the last time he entered my service was on the 21st of December—I did not miss money from the till, but I have frequently missed money from a sideboard—in consequence of that I spoke to Mr. Bailey, and an arrange<lb></lb>ment was made to discover the thief—I marked, in Mr. Bailey's pre<lb></lb>sence, three half-crowns and three single shillings, with an M on one side, and a cross on the other, with the exception of one of the shil<lb></lb>lings—that was last Wednesday night, the 21st of February—I gave that money to Mr. Bailey—I came down the next morning, about five minutes before eight o'clock—it was the prisoner's duty to serve in the bar—he was down before me that morning—I found him in the bar when I came, and sent him into the cellar—while he was gone I opened the till, and in the first till I came to, I found three marked half-crowns, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. not marked—there was no other half-crown in till—I have four or five tills—I examined them all—I found no half-crowns, nor any other marked money in any of the other tills—I left the till in which I saw the money as I found it—the prisoner was to go out that day for a holiday—I was in the bar parlour, behind the liquor-shop, when he was going, which was at eleven o'clock, as near as possible—I stopped him, and took him into the bar parlour—I said I had frequently missed money, and before he went out I should like to see what he had got—he put his hand into his left-hand pocket, pulled his purse out, and put it down on the table—he then put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and took out some halfpence, his knife, and some other things—I examined the purse, and found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I asked him if he had any more money about him up stairs or down—he said he had not—I had a policeman waiting in the shop—I called the police<lb></lb>man, and I asked the prisoner, in the presence of the policeman, if he bad any more about him, either up stairs or down—he said he had not—I said I was certain he had, and told the policeman to search him, which he did—he did not take off his boots till after he had searched his coat pocket—the prisoner did not mention having any thing more about him then—the policeman found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. wrapped up in paper, in a handkerchief, in his coat pocket—I looked at it, and found two shillings marked in the same way that I had marked them—they were the same two shillings—I think I said, "That is the money I want"—he said it belonged to some other person; it was neither his nor mine—he was then taken into custody—I had advanced him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. two days after he came to my service—he had only been out to get his hair cut, from the time he came to my service till he was taken into custody—he was gone then about a quarter of an hour, that is all, to the best of my knowledge—he had paid the laundress—I did not see him pay her, but I saw it in his washing book—I attended before the Magistrate last Thursday, the day he was taken, at three or four o'clock in the afternoon—he had not said any thing in my hearing about receiving any money from a costermonger before he got before the Magistrate.</p>

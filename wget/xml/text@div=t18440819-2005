                  </hi>. I came out of the pit of the Olympic Theatre about twelve o'clock, on ths 3rd of July—I felt something, looked round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand, and putting it into his own pocket—I followed him—he crossed the road and came back as far as New<lb></lb>castle-street—he saw I was going to follow him as he was going into a public-house, and he did not go in—he then said what did I want—I said, "Never mind," and seized him—he struggled, and just as a policeman was coming up he threw the handkerchief on the pavement, and a witness took it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old. On the evening of the 1st March I was at Mrs. White's cookshop, Henrietta-street, St. James's—the prisoner was there—he asked me if I could get anything to sell—I said I could go and get four pieces of leather out of my father's drawer—he said, "Go, and get them," and he would sell them—I got them, and asked him to get as much as he could—he said the man would only give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me the sixpence, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out—he said he sold it to Mr. Bolls—I went to a coffee-shop, and bought a roll, a cup of coffee, and a penny<lb></lb>worth of butter—I did not get it at home, because ray mother would not give me any—she said there was only enough for the little children—my father said he would for<lb></lb>give me, if I told him the truth.</p>

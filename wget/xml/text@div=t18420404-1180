                  </hi>. I am a printer and bookseller, on Clerkenwell green. The prisoner came to work, about twelve o'clock in the forenoon of the 9th of March—he was not bound as an apprentice, but came to work as one—my daughter informed me of something, in consequence of which I left the printing-house, and went into Red Lion-street, about four doors distance from my residence—I saw the prisoner on the other side of the way, at some distance—he looked back, saw me, and immediately commenced running—I ran as fast as I could, crying "Stop thief!" shortly afterwards, he pushed his hat from his head into the gutter—a person who was selling oranges attempted to stop him, but he broke from him—he then turned down Badger-court, into St. John's-square, where a person laid hold of him—on his being stopped, a large quantity of type was found in his pocket—the policeman came up and took him into cus<lb></lb>tody—on returning to Red Lion-street his hat was lying in the gutter, and in it was a handkerchief, containing a large quantity of type, and also very near it, another parcel of type—it was my type—he had no business with it off my premises.</p>

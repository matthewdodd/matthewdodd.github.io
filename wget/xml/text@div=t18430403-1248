                  </hi>. I live in George-yard, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square. About ten o'clock, on the 11th of March, I was in a public-house in Exeter-street, Grosvenor-square—I stopped there till twelve—I came out with Bird and three or four others—the prisoner came out with us—he laid hold of my arm—we walked down to the bottom of the street arm in arm—I had a watch in my pocket when I left the house with a key, a ribbon, and 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were two half-crowns among them—my friend said something, in consequence of which I missed my watch from my right hand waistcoat pocket, and two half-crowns from my left hand waistcoat pocket—this is my watch and watch-key.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brown-street, Grosvenor-square. I came out of this public-house with the prisoner a few minutes before twelve o'clock—the prisoner and another one took hold of the prosecutor's arm, and while one was drawing his attention off, the prisoner took the money out of his left-hand waistcoat pocket—we went down the street to a public-house, and it was shut up—they proposed to go to a person's named Clark, to have something to drink—I followed them—they each laid hold of his arm again—the prisoner put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and took his watch out—he turned and spoke to the other two, and they said they should be off—I turned, and asked if he had not lost his watch—he said he had—I ran up the street—the prisoner was turning into a watering-place—I asked him to give me the watch—he said, "Do you think I have got the watch?"—I said, "I do not wish to do anything with you if you will give it up; never mind the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the policeman came up—I laid hold of the prisoner's collar and heard the watch drop, and the glass smash.</p>

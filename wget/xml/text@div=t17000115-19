He further said, that they used them very cruelly, and cut him in the Head, and stabbed him in the Back, and stript them of all their Cloaths, and took a pair of Boots and a Belt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="17000115003"></xptr>from him, and a Gelding with a Port. Manteau, and about 50 s. or 3 l. of his Masters Money. The Cloaths being shewn to the next Evidence, they declared that they were the same that was made for Mr. Leaver, and produced a Button and a peice of the Stuff that the Breeches were made of, before they were Died. It farther appeared, that the Prisoner had Mr. Leavers Cloaths upon his Back when he was taken and brought to the Dog Tavern by Newgate, which he did not deny, but said, he bought them of another Person. Another Evidence deposed, that two Men came to her House hard by Hampton-Court, one of whom she believed to be the Prisoner, and did bring two Horses with them, and ask'd her if she had any Grass, upon which she replied yes, but they agreeing upon the Price went away, and afterwards sent back the Horses by a Boy, one of which Horses was shewed Mr. Leavers Man, who said it was his Masters Horse. Another Evidence deposed as he was going that way, he saw a firing through a Hedge, and then came out some Men and set upon the Gentleman and his Man, and dragged them into the Fields; he farther said, that they forced him with threats to go with them and hold their Horses; then they pulled of the Genmans Coat, Breeches and Hat, and stampt upon his Face and Stomack, because he would not lye with his Face downward, upon which he desired them to spare his Life, and as they were going away, they threw the Evidence one of the Coats, which he took and put it upon Mr. Leavers Man, who he saw Wounded in the Back, upon which one of them said, Damn him, he is untying them, Shoot him, and ran after him, upon which he fell down and begg'd hard for his Life. Another Evidence said, that he was present with the Prisoner in the Robbery, that they and two more went through High-gate about duskish, and two of them were a Horseback, and two a Foot, and they staid in a Thicket on the left Hand for about half an Hour, at last they heard some Horsemen coming along the Road, upon which the Prisoner road up to Mr Leaver, and offered to seize him, but only caught hold of his Sword, which came out of his Scabbard, upon which Mr. Leaver rode away, and the Prisoner fired at him, because he could not stop him, and gave him the said Wound, of which he afterwards died, then they took them into the Fields and Robbed and bound them, and rode over to Whetstone, and so to Enfield Chace, and over Epping Forest, and from thence to the Green-man at Stratford, where they dined, and came to London the next Evening. Another Evidence deposed, that when he and some others came to apprehend him at the Blew Ball in German-street, they made a great resistance, and fired Pistols at them, and wounded several of them; but at length he was taken with Leavers Cloaths on, and a Pistol; and he likewise did endeavour to shorten his Sword to stab him; the Prisoner hearing the Evidence depose this said he was sorry he did not stab him to the Heart. The Chirurgeon likewise declared he Probed Mr. Leavers Wound, and found that the Bullet was lodged in his Guts, and that all such Wounds were always Mortal. The Prisoner denied the Facts, but it being so fully proved against him, the Jury thereupon found him <rs id="t17000115-19-verdict103" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Henry George Noyes, of Church-lane, Lee—on 23d December I was going down stairs, and I saw the prisoner Covill standing outside the window of an empty room—I afterwards went into the pantry, where the plate is, and I saw the prisoner James with his body half in at the pantry window—the window was not open before, but he had opened it—it was half open, and a piece was cut out of the window<lb></lb>frame—he was going in the direction of the plate, which stood on the dresser, and I think he had hold of the tea-pot—I said, "What do you want there," and they ran off—Covill stood outside with a basket in his hand—he had not moved from where I first saw him—he was in the same place—I went outside and gave information—I did not follow them any further than the gate—I had seen the pantry window that morning, not an hour before I saw the prisoners—I looked at the window; it was shut and fastened with a catch between the two windows—I had seen Covill a little better than a week before, one Monday; he came about the dust—I had heard something like a stone at the window some minutes before I saw James—I had seen him with Covill before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potman—on 23d December, about half-past 1 o'clock, I was going down Church-lane, Lee, I saw the prisoner, James, running—I stopped, and h e went through a railing and across a field—he got to the corner, and then he turned round to see if any one was looking after him—I went down Church-lane and I saw the servant on the edge of the foot-path looking down—in consequence of what she said, I went for a police<lb></lb>man,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001020066"></xptr>
               <p>and we went in the direction of Lewisham Church, and there met Covill with his mule and cart—James had disappeared—he was taken in custody afterwards, but I was not present at the time—I had seen Covill and James both together before on that raoruing—I can't say at what time—it must have been before 1 o'clock—I knew them well.</p>

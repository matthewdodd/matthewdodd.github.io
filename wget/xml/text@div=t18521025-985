                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Henry Moses and two others. On 21st Sep., in consequence of what I heard, I missed four sets of billiard balls—the prisoner was on the premises that day—I saw him in a little anteroom, where the balls were kept—he was making up cases—he came and told me he was about to leave—I then went and counted the billiard balls, and found there was another set gone—I went and told Mr. Henry Moses—he and I came and questioned the prisoner, whether he had got anything about him—he said he had not—his jacket was lying on one side—I felt it and found a set of billiard balls in it—I asked the prisoner if the jacket belonged to him—he said it did—I asked him why he did not put it on—he put it on, and I asked him what he bad in his pocket—he pulled out a set of billiard balls—I accused him of taking four other sets, which he strongly denied—I told him if he would be honest and tell the truth it would be in his favour—there were a great many other persons about who belonged to the premises.</p>

I was with Ashton on the night of the 5th of March, and assisted in searching the prisoner's house, at No. 7, Grove-place - I found an opera-glass in a little basket in a box, in the upper room, and a jemmy - there are only two rooms; there was one bedstead, which turns up, and another bed on the floor - as I was taking the male prisoner to the station people were hooting after him; I said, "You see they still suppose you to be a body-snatcher;" he said, "I wish it was no worse."</p>
               <p>John Druitt. Q. Were there not other things with the opera-glass, such as gloves, which you took away? A. There were; I did not at first take the opera-glass till after I had been to the station; it remained there when I returned, but a watch, which laid by the side of it, was gone - I was never at the house before; I asked Druitt about certain property which I found there - he said it had been brought to him only that morning by two young men, who asked him to take care of it, as they were afraid of getting into trouble about it - he could not tell me their names or address, this did not relate to the property in question.</p>

On Sunday night, the 4th of March, I made my house secure; I locked and bolted the doors, as usual, and the windows were fastened; next morning I found the warehouse had been entered at the back, and from there they got into the shop, which is part of the dwelling-house, and under the same roof; the shop and warehouse is on one floor, and are not divided; they are all one room - I had gone to bed about twelve o'clock, and was the last person up; I came down at four o'clock in the morning, being alarmed, and found the street door had been opened inside; they had entered at the ware-house, the casement of which was broken, and part of the inside shutter was broken and open; there was a hole in the window large enough for a man to get through - the shutter had been put up again: I missed 1 cwt. of tobacco, and 25 lbs, of cigars, worth 53l. together, and 10l. in 5s. papers of copper, which I had tied up myself; I saw it afterwards, and knew it to be mine; I have seen some of the tobacco since - I lost four bags.</p>

            . On Monday, the 5th of March, I went with another officer, to the prisoner's premises, about half-past eight o'clock at night; I did not find the male prisoner at home - I knocked at the door; a voice asked who was there: I said, "Open the door," and it was opened by Reeve - she screamed violently at seeing strangers, and said she could not open it without shutting it, as her foot was under it; I pushed it open, went up stairs, and on the stairs found a quantity of 5s. papers of halfpence piled up - I have them here; I went up stairs, and the room was strewed about with a great quantity of gloves, tobacco. and skeleton-keys; I asked Reeve if any young men had brought any thing there that morning - she said No, that no young men were in the habit of coming there at all; there were forty-eight keys in all, not all skeletons - there was a dark-lantern found in the back kitchen, and the inspector found a small crow-bar.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050017"></xptr>John Druitt Q. Did you not say the halfpence must have been laying there some time, as they were covered with dust? A. The papers were nearly all broken; I said I thought they must have laid there longer than the morning, but the bags would cover them with dust in a moment; I had not received information of this robbery; Reeve said the money was theirs, and they used it as they wanted it - I found a cash-box there, which has not been owned, and a life protector, also a new method of getting a light in a moment, and here are keys which will open the smallest places; Reeve said her son had been an ironmonger, and made the keys when in business - the skeleton-keys were in a bag on the mantel-piece in the upper room: there are 5l. 19s. in copper - there were three phosphorus-boxes.</p>


               <p>JOHN BUSAIN. I am an inspector of the Police. I assisted in searching the house, and apprehending the prisoners, on the evening of the 5th of March; I found two sacks up stairs, and a jemmy, which I applied to Mrs. Kemp's desk, which was broken open, and found it exactly corresponded with the marks on it - one part is rather shorter than at the other end; it appeared to have been done by that instrument - Druitt and his wife were out at the time; I apprehended the wife.</p>
               <p>John Druitt. Q. After you called me out of the station-house several times, what account did I give of the property found? A. That it had all been brought by two young men; I alluded particularly to the gloves.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Broad-street, St. Giles', on Monday morning, about half-past two o'clock, and saw the male prisoner standing at the end of a court; Mrs. Kemp's house is at the corner of that court - I saw him there for nearly an hour, from half-past two till half-past three; I kept going round my beat, and saw him there again before four; I asked what his business was - he said he was waiting there for a cabdriver, who was in the habit of coming to a corn-chandler's shop there, as he wanted him to give him a ride home, as he lived in the neighbourhood of Finsbury-square; I came back about four, and he was then gone -I saw a backney-coach drive up to the stand a little before four o'clock, and it was gone when I missed him; in about ten minutes I discovered that Mrs. Kemp's house was broken open - I have not a doubt of his person; there is a coach-stand right opposite her house.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Broad-street, St. Giles', on the night in question, from nine o'clock in the evening till six in the morning - I saw the male prisoner about half-past two o'clock, standing at the end of the court, within a foot of the prosecutrix's front door; I have not a doubt of him - it was a very stormy wet night; he had an umbrella under his arm, and appeared a respectable man; I thought he was standing out of the rain, and did not remove him.</p>
               <p>MRS. KEMP. I tied up these halfpence myself, and know them to be mine, and here are two sacks - my son's hand-writing is on this paper bag of tobacco.</p>
               <p>John Druitt's Defence. The things were all brought to me by Williams on the day in question, and the information given was that two persons were seen to bring the bags into my house; I have witnesses who saw me open my shutter at seven o'clock in the morning, before the things were brought - I met Williams on the previous Saturday night; he asked me to let him leave some things at my house on the Monday morning, as he was afraid of their being seized for rent - these things are what he brought; where he is I cannot ascertain.</p>
               <p>JAMES -. On the 12th of March I was taken into custody in the New-road, by this Policeman, with my son, as I was going home from the London-docks - I was locked up twenty-three hours, then brought up, and saw Druitt at Clerkenwell on the 13th of March, but never before: when I was in the yard the turnkey ordered us all to stand up - several people came in to identify parties - some person said, "That is the man in the fustain jacket," meaning Druitt.</p>
               <p>John Druitt. They said, "That is Druitt, the man in the fustian jacket," and after being pointed out it was easy to identify me.</p>

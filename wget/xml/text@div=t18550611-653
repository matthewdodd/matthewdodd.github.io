I live at Plaistow, in the cottage next to the Friends' Meeting House—on 12th May, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by a noise on the roof of the meeting house, which is adjoining the cottage where I live—I looked out of the window and saw two lads, one watching, and the other with the lead in his hand—there was another, but he was not with the others—I cannot affirm that the prisoner are the same persons, but they look like them—I looked at them, and the one with the lead threw it over the fence—I examined the roof of the meeting house with Catton, and this lead was taken off the roof, and some more was raised—I saw this lead fitted to the roof, and I believe it to be the same that came from there—the meeting house belongs to William Nash and others.</p>

I am a chemist, and live in Broadway, Plaistow-between 12 and 1 o'clock on 12th May, Neale was brought to my house he said he did not steal the lead, but Rowley and Brothers asked him to go and fetch it—I went with Graves to where he saw Neale leave the lead—I saw it lying in the street, and it was brought to my place—I went with Carroll to the out-house attached to the meeting house—I spread the lead out, and found the nail holes to correspond, and the place where it lapped over.</p>

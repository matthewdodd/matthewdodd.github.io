I saw eight rings then; I was serving another person with rings at the time; he went out first, I went out after the prisoner, I desired him to come back, he came back I seized his hand. I found the ring, this is the ring I now produce; when he went out I instantly missed the ring off the card, when he came back I seized the prisoner's hand and found it in his hand.

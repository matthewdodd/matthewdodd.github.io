On the 24th of February I went to bed about twelve o'clock, leaving my house quite secure - next morning I found a piece of glass removed from my fan-light - a bolt drawn and the fan-light opened- a man could then get in; I missed this property - when I went to bed the candle in my room had burnt very trifling, and in the morning I found it very much burned, and shaped as if for a dark lantern; I gave information at Bow-street, - some of my combs were afterwards produced to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was about a fornight after the robbery that you got information of the combs? A. Yes; I knew nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser, and live in Bear-street, Leicester-square. I saw the prisoner about three times previous to this transaction. On Thursday, the 9th of March, he came to be shaved, and when I had about half shaved him, he said that he had got some articles that would suit me - that they were tortoiseshell combs; I said I was not in the habit of selling them; he said he thought they would suit me, and I said if I saw them very likely I would buy them; after I had shaved him he called me aside, and said "I think they are the property of Mr. Goldsmith, who was robbed the other night - I think they are come by the cross;" he went away for them; I went to Goldsmith and told him of it - he went with me to Bow-street and got Cousins - we went directly to my house, and found the prisoner waiting there for me; I left Cousins outside - he shewed me some combs, and asked 5s. for the large, and the small ones were to be given in - they were worth 12s. or 14s. each; Cousins immediately came in and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he believed they had been the property of Goldsmith, and believed they had come on the cross? A. He said they were the property of Goldsmith; I did not hear the word believe in it; I only knew him by his being occasionally a customer, two or three times.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 9th of March I went with Guest to his house and took the prisoner there; I said "You are in my custody on suspicion of having stolen property in your possession," and at the same time took a parcel of combs from his hand; I collared him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060039"></xptr>- he said "Let me go, I will go quietly;" I let him go - he immediatley put his hand into his waistcoat pocket; I said "What are you going to do?" he said "I am a gas fitter; I have a burner there - I know you will find it;" I said "Keep your hand out;" I took him to a public-house - he put his hand in again; I took it out, and in that pocket I found a small crow-bar; I searched his lodgings and found two large and nine small combs, and two salt spoons; he said they were his lodgings; there was no marks on the prosecutor's fan-lights.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS to GUEST. Q. Had the prisoner shown you the gas-burner that morning? A. Yes, but not the bar.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, protested his innocence, and stated he had obtained the combs in exchange for one dozen of brass bell-pulls and 5l. with a man who came to his shop, representing himself in distress, and that after he had purchased them, the man prevailed on him to buy the salt-spoons, and that the article called by the witnesses a crow-bar, he used as a scraper in his business as a gas-fitter.</p>
               <p>COUSINS re-examined. When I took him he said he bought them of some man he did not know; he said nothing more as to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you the sum I gave for them? A. No; I never heard of an exchange of bell-pulls for them - he said at the office he bought them of a man- he was going to say something when Sir

            . I live at No. 32, Brownlow-street, Long-acre. On Wednesday the 22d or 23d of February, I called at the prisoner's house and found him extremely ill - he complained of a violent pain in his head; I advised him to apply leeches, and applied them to his head myself, between five and six o'clock in the evening, and stopped there till they were off - till ten; I saw him again between eleven and twelve next morning in bed, and he appeared very ill then; Wilson was there part of the day - he lodges in the house; I sat up in the parlour two nights to attend the prisoner (Thursday and Friday); Wilson used to sleep in the parlour, but slept in the attic those two nights; I went into the Price's room several times in the course of those two nights, and always found him in bed; Wilson took the key of the shop and street-door up stairs; I returned home on Saturday between nine and ten o'clock; I occasionally went home in the day time as I am married.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. You think it was on the 22d or 23d? A. It was on a Wednesday - he is married - his wife was there.</p>

            . I am in partnership with the prisoner as a brass-founder and gas-fitter; he was taken ill on Tuesday afternoon, about the 21st or 23d of February, with a pain in his head; Mrs. Standing came to visit him; I saw leeches applied on Wednesday night, about seven or eight o'clock; I was there when they were first applied, but went out; I came home and saw his head wrapped up about nine; Standing went home between nine and ten - she sat up in the parlour on Thursday and Friday nights, and I slept in the garret on that account; I took both the street and shop door keys up with me; the prisoner remained ill on Thursday and Friday; I went into his room every morning to see how he was - he was also ill on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Do you recollect when he was apprehended? A. Yes; I was taken on this charge myself - I believe Standing or his wife bought the leeches; I am in partnership with him, but my name is not on the card because he is the only person appointed by the gas company; I carry on the business now, but not in the same place.</p>

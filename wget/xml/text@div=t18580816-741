                  </hi>. I reside at 58, York Road, Lambeth—I was foreman to Mr. Lyons, a tailor, of 101, Fleet Street, till Thursday evening last—I have known the prisoner for some years; he had been in the same employment with me. On Wednesday, 28th July, about 12 or 1 o'clock in the day, I saw him in Bride Lane—I told the boy to run across and tell him I wanted to speak to him; he came—we had some conversation, and went round the corner to the Red Lion; I had about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money about me; it was loose in a small cash pocket in my trousers—these are the trousers I had on at the time, this is the pocket; there is a flap over it and a button: in order to get at the money I have to unbutton the flap—we had two glasses of ale a-piece at the Red Lion—the prisoner paid for it. I should say we were there about a quarter of an hour—we then went back to the shop together—we stayed there about half an hour. I was perfectly sober at the time I went to the Red Lion, I had had nothing to drink that morning previously to that; after being about half an hour at the shop we went to the Bell, in Fleet Street; we stayed there about a quarter of an hour—I had either one or two glasses of ale, and a glass of gin and bitten—I paid for it. I took the money to pay for it out of this pocket—I took out sixpence—I did not take out the money loose—I only paid for the last we had, the prisoner paid for some—at the time I paid the sixpence I am sure that my money was safe in my pocket—while we there we ordered dinner for two, to be ready at 2 o'clock; we then left—as we were coming down the passage he said to me, "Will you have a pinch of snuff?" I took a pinch, and we both went across the street to the shop door; and at the shop door he left me—he offered me the snuff out of a piece of paper—I took the pinch and was taking it as we were coming across the road—he left me directly we got to the shop door—as soon as I got to the shop door I lost all consciousness; the last thing I remember was being at the shop door—I do not remember anything more until I was woke up—I do not remember how I got into the counting-house—I found myself there when I recovered, lying on the floor—Leech the errand-boy, and a man named Grady were there then—I found my waistcoat all unbuttoned and my pocket turned inside out where I had had my money; the money was all gone, except three halfpence that was on the floor. I saw nothing more of the prisoner until he was in custody on the Friday morning—I went to the address he had given me, but I found no such person there. The counting-house</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PEARCE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between four and five years—we were not exactly fellow shopmen—we worked for the same master, but at different shops. I never heard anything very first-rate of his character—since he has left Mr. Lyons I have heard a good deal: he has a bad character for honesty, being con<lb></lb>nected with thieves and receivers of stolen goods—I am not aware that he was ever charged—the stolen goods I refer to are watches; it was Mr. Lyons, my employer, who gave me that information—he is not here—he has given me that information several times within the last eleven months—I did not pay much attention to it. I sent the boy over to fetch him because I had known the man so long that I took an interest in him, as he had been out of work so long, and he told me he was going into partnership with a man named Brett—I wanted to know how he was getting on as regards the partnership—I had heard of it some time before, from himself, at the shop. He was not frequently in the habit of coming to the shop. He was about four years in Mr. Henry Lyons' employ—he then left, and went to Mr. Simeon Lyons' in the Borough—I know of the prisoner having brought an action against Simeon Lyons, which was tried in July; he told me that he had recovered 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages, but I have since been told that he only recovered 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he told me he had received the money—I expect it was with that money he was going into partnership with Mr. Brett—Mr. Brett's shop is in Fleet Street, nearer Temple Bar than Mr. Lyons'. I live in the York Road—I am a householder; I swear that—I rent the house—I am married; I have been married about five years; I was married at Waterloo Church—I let lodgings to such lodgers as I can get; not to ladies that come there for short periods—some<lb></lb>times I have had ladies there—I have rented the house twelve months—before that I lived at 110, Fleet Street—I have three rooms; one is let to Mr. Franklin, the steward of the Oriental Club, and the other to Mr. Clifton, a commercial traveller—they were there last night. Mr. Lyons' shop is about half a dozen doors from the police station. I did not give any infor<lb></lb>mation of this robbery to any policeman till the next morning, but information had been previously given by Mr. Lyons—I myself gave information to a policeman on the Thursday morning, at Fleet Street station; that was not to the policeman who took the prisoner into custody—I gave the information to Shelford. It was about 12 o'clock in the day that the prisoner first came over to the shop—it was about ten minutes or a quarter past 2 when I re<lb></lb>covered my consciousness. I did not remain at the shop a minute afterwards—I did up my things and ran over to the Bell to ask if he was there at dinner; after that I went home—I had not got a penny about, me with the exception of the three halfpence. I had two pair of old trowsers and a waistcoat at the shon, and I sold them to a Jew, and took a cab and drove over to my sisters—I sold the things to pay for the cab, and went over to my brother-in-law's house in the Waterloo Road—he is a carman. I then went home. I stopped at my brother-in-law's all the afternoon—it was night before I went home—next morning I gave information at Fleet Street station. I do not know how long the prisoner has lived at Apollo Buildings, Walworth—he tells me he is married and has five children—I never visited him but once, and that was when he was at the New Cut, at Mr. Lyons' other shop—I knew him then to be a married man, with a family. The first public house we went into was the Red Lion, in Poppin's Court, Fleet Street—our shop is next door but one to Poppin's Court, and the Red Lion is the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160012"></xptr>
               <p>first house in Poppin's Court. I do not know Mr. Wilding, a butcher. There was no person there drinking with me—I swear that—there were several persons in front of the bar—there was no one drinking with me at the Bell. I do not know Mr. Booth. I do not remember as we were coming out of the Bell the prisoner speaking to a person who was going in—I recollect when the glass of gin and bitters was called for, the prisoner going out at the back door and coming in again in about two minutes; that was the only time he left me—I did not see him speak to anybody as he came out. On the previous night, Tuesday, I was at the Bell after business, to smoke a pipe, as I often did—we usually shut up at 9 o'clock—I did not tell the prisoner that I was out the greater part of the previous night—I might have said, "I was over here last night." Our shop is now closed; there was not sufficient business to keep it on—it is a ready made and bespoke shop—we keep an order book and a small cash book, that is here—I paid over to my matter the money I received, either on Saturday night or Monday morning—I had received 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that week. It is not an unfrequent occurrence for me to be a little intoxicated—I have been so, but always have been able to take care of myself. I am not a snuff-taker—my master has spoken to me several times about being intoxicated—sometimes I have had a little drop too much at the Bell, and sometimes at the Red Lion—I have never been intoxicated in the counting house before that I reoollect—I have been asleep there, not from stupefaction; I have been asleep in the counting house from the effects of drink, in the daytime. It was the barmaid at the Red Lion who served me, and Mr. Hadland the landlord; and at the Bell it was Mrs. Jervis the landlady—I had no money in my waistcoat pocket—I did not ask the landlady to give me credit, nothing of the sort, I swear that; nor did I ask anybody to give me credit—the person who served me did not say, "You had better go home, and do not drink any more till you have had something to eat"—no observation was made at either public house about my being drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I was errand-boy to Mr. Lyons in Fleet Street when this matter occurred—I had been employed there ten months. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday, July 28th, Mr. Peers told me to go across the road and call the prisoner—I did so—at that time Peers was perfectly sobers—he and the prisoner went over to the public house—afterwards I saw them crossing the street together, coming home. I saw Peers take some snuff—I did not see who gave it him, and I saw him come up to the door—the prisoner was with him—when he got to the door he left him—directly Peers got into the doorway, he became senseless—he went as far as the counter; I helped him from the counter into the counting-house, and there he laid down on the ground, and appeared to be asleep. In about half an hour the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160013"></xptr>
               <p>came in and asked for Mr. Peers—I said he was not at home (he was, in fact at that time, in the counting-house); he went away, and returned in less than five minutes, and said he wanted to see Mr. Peers about the dinner—I then went into the counting-house to see if I could wake him, and the prisoner went with me; he went into the counting-house—Peers was still on the ground in the same state; I shook him and tried to wake him; the prisoner said it was no use, and I was to let him sleep and go and mind the door—I did not do so—the prisoner stood leaning against the door-post—a man came into the shop and wished to see Mr. Lyons, and I went into the shop to him: I was in the shop talking to him less than five minutes; during that time the prisoner was in the counting-house with Peers—I could not see into the counting-house, while I was talking to the person in the shop—when that person went away, the witness Grady came in with a coat; he put it on the counter and asked me where Mr. Peers was—I said he was in the counting-house with Mr. Shire—Grady went towards the counting-house, and the prisoner came out almost directly: he said as Mr. Peers could not have his dinner, he would go over to the Bell and pay for it, and send it over to me and Grady; he said, "I suppose you will have it?" we said "Yes," and he went out. When Peers came into the shop, his waistcoat was buttoned at usual—I and Grady together roused him up; that was after the prisoner had gone—when I went to rouse him up, his waistcoat was unbuttoned and his pocket turned inside out: I mean the cash pocket (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—I succeeded in raising him then; I did not leave the premises at all while the prisoner was there, No one besides the prisoner, Grady, and myself went into the counting-house while Peers was there, no one came into the shop—no one could have gone in without my having seen, them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you leave Mr. Lyons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not left him: I have gone to the other shop—there was no one in the shop at Fleet Street but Peers and I—I did not sell goods: it was very seldom that people came in while Peers was away; if they did, I tried to serve them—I have not sold goods in Peers' absence above once—I saw a coat sold that week—I was not with Peers all the week, because we were without a boy At the other shop, and I had to be backward and forward from one shop to the other. I was there part of the Tuesday—it was on the Monday that I saw the coat sold, that was sold for £1—we had no cash-box or till; Peers kept the money by him—I knew Shire first by being shopman to Mr. Lyons in the New Cut; I do not know how long he was there—I have seen him at the shop in Fleet Street occasionally—I had not seen him there for two months before this Wednesday. It was about 12 o'clock when Peers told me to call the prisoner over, and it was about half-past I that he was in an unconscious state; I am quite sure of that—I have never seen Peers in a state like he was then; not so bad, not like he was then—I have not known him to be asleep in the counting-house, for hours together; I never knew him to be asleep there—he has not been drunk above once or twice; he had never been asleep in the counting-house before—I have seen him there drunk once or twice—I saw him and the prisoner come over from the Bell; I did not see the prisoner go back to the Bell after he came and asked for Peers; I did not see where he went to—I heard Peers tell him that he expected Mr. Lyons there; that was soon after he came over to speak to him, before they went to Poppin's Court—when the prisoner came first to the shop after Peers was in the counting-house, he asked if Peers was at home, and I told him "No;" that was an untruth—Peers did</p>

               <p>not tell me to say that he was not at home, I swear that—I had not before that been into the counting-house and shaken Peers; I did not go in till afterwards—I could see as Peers came across the road that his waistcoat was not unbuttoned: I looked at his dress, if it had been unbuttoned, I should have noticed it—we used not to have any particular dinner hour; we used to get it when we could—Peers used to have his dinner about twelve o'clock; I used to fetch his dinner, and he had it in the shop—I did not tell the prisoner the last time he called that I had been trying to get Peers up, or that I had been pulling him about: nothing of the kind—Grady did not say anything to that effect.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 19, Dean Street. I am a tailor, and work for Mr. Lyons. On Wednesday afternoon, 28th July, I went to Mr. Lyons' shop with a coat that I had made up—I did not find Peers in the shop; he was in the counting-house—I went to the door of the counting-house—there is a board running across before the door—I met the boy Leech inside the shop door, and asked him where Peers was—he said he was in the counting-house along with Shire—I went to the door and looked in over the counter, and I saw Peers lying on the floor and the prisoner leaning over him, nearly kneeling—I turned back from the door and laid my coat down on the counter—I then saw the prisoner standing at the door of the counting-house—I spoke to him, and he did not seem to answer me—I said "Good day," or something of that kind to him—then I went to speak to Leech, who was standing at the door, and the prisoner came up to us, and said he was going across the way to have his dinner—he said there were two dinners ordered, and if Mr. Peers could not have his, would I and the boy have what was left—we said "Yes"—he said he would order it, and went away; the dinner never came—after the prisoner was gone, Leech and I went to the counting-house to get Peers up—Leech shook him, and he woke up directly; before he shook him, I observed the state of his dress: his waistcoat was unbuttoned and open, and his pocket turned out—when he woke up, I asked him for the price of the coat I had made—he went to put his hand in his pocket, and he could not do it, because it was turned out—I had never seen him drunk before—he did not look like a drunken man usually does—there was blood from his nose when he woke up—he did not look like a man sober, but he did not look like a man drunk: he looked like a man half drunk and half sober; it was a stupid look.</p>

You cannot see quite into the counting-house from the shop, only a part of it—Peers was lying down inside the door, you could see his feet—I think</p>

               <p>the door of the counting-house opens into the counting-house—the door was quite open—Peers' feet were about a yard from the door. I was to have 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for making the coat—I was not always paid when I took the article home, except I wanted the money; I told Leech I wanted the money, and he went into the counting-house—he was not gone half a minute—it was after that that I went in with him and observed Peers' pocket turned out. I followed Leech to the counting-house—that was the same time; we went in together; I only went in once—I only looked in the first time, when I saw the prisoner there. I have known the prisoner a long time. I afterwards went over to the Bell to see if he was there, or if he had had his dinner; that was about an hour afterwards—Peers went over first, and when he returned I went over—I did not see Peers sell any clothes—I only saw one pocket open. I was not paid for the coat then—I was paid by Mr. Lyons in the Cut on the Saturday following.</p>

The prosecutor was not present when his wife gave me the directions—she went to the prisoner's house with me, she inquired for him and then called me and gave him into custody; I searched him, and found no snuff or powder of any kind upon him—I had received no information from the Fleet Street station or any other about this.</p>

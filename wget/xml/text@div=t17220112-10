            , who told him that it was Colthouse and Sinnament that had rob'd him. Upon Wild's Information they soon took Sinnament, who was convicted of, and hang'd for the same Fact. Sometime afterwards he heard the prisoner was committed at Oxford, by the Name of Sanderson, for picking of Pockets; upon which he wrote to Mr. Plater, his Friend in Oxford, giving him a Description of the prisoner, and desiring him to examine and enquire if Sanderson was not the same Person: Of which being satisfied by Mr. Plater, the prisoner was brought to London. Mr. Harle depos'd, that he, Mr. Metcalf, and Mr. Squib, riding out together, he and Mr. Metcalf, on Hounslow Health, outrid Mr. Squib; that near Butchers Grove they saw a Chaise; and on each side a Man on Horseback; and thinking they belong'd to the Chaise, when they met, as he was turning his Horse aside to give `em way, the prisoner catch'd hold of his Bridle and clapping a Pistol to his Breast, said, D - n ye, I'd rob ye altogether - be expeditious; then taking from him the Money mentioned in the Indictment, and his Bridle, he rob'd the Chaise and Mr. Metcalf. Mr. Squib depos'd, that being left behind Mr. Harle and Mr. Metcalf, the prisoner came up to him, and taking 17 s. from him, bid him dismount, lest he should follow him; Squib told him he would not; the prisoner reply'd,I wont trust ye, exchange is no robbery, and then cut his Bridle, and exchang'd Horses with him. Caeser (Servant to Mr. Metcalf) depos'd that he saw the prisoner follow his Master; that his Master was dismounted, and that he saw the prisoner change Horses with Mr. Squib. They were all positive that the prisoner was the Man. The prisoner in his Defence said, that there were but two Men committed the Robberies he was then indicted for, and two Men (Sinnament and the prisoner's Brother) had already been hang'd for the same: That his Brother and he were so much alike, that they could hardly be distinguish'd when they were seen together; that his Brother and Sinnament were seen together in a House the same Night; and at the time the Robbery was committed, he was lame of the Rheumatism, and could not go abroad. An Evidence for the prisoner depos'd, that she being at a House in Robin Hood's Court in Shoe lane, saw Sinnament and the prisoner's Brother come in together, and bring with `em a Saddle and 2 Swords,

Being askt how he came to remember the Day of the Month so nearly. he said he remember'd it, in that the Day before the prisoner came to his House, Mr. Lewis sent him in ren Chaldron of Coals, for which he paid him 12 l. 17 s. To prove this, he produc'd a blind Receit, which he himself could not read; but it being view'd by the Court, they at last found it bore Date May 7. and he having sworn to about the 13th of August, the Court ordered him to be taken into Custody.

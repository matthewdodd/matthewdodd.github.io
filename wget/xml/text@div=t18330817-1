I saw my place quite secure on Wednesday night, the 26th of June; the shutters in the front shop were quite fastened - I occupy the house - the shop is part of the dwelling-house - I was disturbed that night between twelve and one o'clock by the bell ringing - I opened my window, and saw a number of people outside - I came down stairs, and found a man named Way - I found the prisoner in custody of the police - I looked at my window, and found three shutters down; two were partly down, and one not quite down, and one square of glass broken in, that would enable a person to take any thing out of the shop very readily - a brass cock was shown to me some time after; this is it; it was part of my stock, and was in the window that night, when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it partnership property? A. Yes; the dwelling-house is my own, but that cock was the property of myself and my partner; there was a great number in the window; it is one I had for a particular purpose; I think it was made some years ago for a vat; it had been laying by a long time; it was in the window in my shop - we have a quantity of property in the window - I know it by the make, and having had it on hand a long while; it laid close to the glass in the window - the place was all quite safe the night before.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty, on the 26th of June, in Whitechapel-road, near Mr. Norbury's premises, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, walking down the road; I turned my head, and observed Mr. Norbury's shutters down - I stood still a second or two, looked towards the window, and observed the prisoner, accompanied by two women, standing at the window, where the shutters were - I heard a noise of glass breaking; the noise proceeded from the spot where the prisoner was standing - I walked across the road towards the prisoner, and observed him put his hand in the window, and take something out, and pass it to one of the women - I could not see what it was - I took him into custody - he made a dreadful resistance, I could scarcely hold him - I sprung my rattle, and got assistance - the women made their escape.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On which side of Whitechapel were you coming down? A. On the opposite side to Mr. Norbury's premises - it was about twenty or thirty yards from Mr. Norbury's house to the other side of the way - I did not say I saw you take the shutters down, nor break the window - I could not take the women and you too - they did not follow us to the station-house to my knowledge - two policemen came to my assistance after I sprung my rattle- I did not see either of the women, to be able to identify them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not a man in a white flannel jacket state to you that I was very much in liquor, that I was not the man; and you said, if he did not go away, you would take him? A. No; I saw no man in a white flannel jacket at all; nobody told me he was not the man; I have no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. From the moment you first saw him till you took him, was he out of your sight? A. No.</p>

On the night in question, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was going home from the theatre, and had occasion to pass his house to go to my house - I was right in the middle of the carriage way - I heard some glass breaking, and by the sound I looked across the road to where the glass was broken - I saw the prisoner, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170004"></xptr>two women apparently hiding him - they were standing near Mr. Norbury's window, as close as could be - the policeman crossed the road, and took him directly - he was in my sight from the time I heard the glass break till he was secured - I saw Morriss cross, and take him by the collar; he made great resistance to get away; I went up, and assisted the policeman to secure him - the two women went away towards the back of the hospital - I did not see anything taken from the window.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Messrs. Norbury. On the night of the 26th of June, I fastened the window shutters up, and the shop quite secure - I came down stairs on hearing the alarm between twelve and one o'clock, and found two of the shutters on the pavement, and one near the pavement; they were outside shutters - one shutter was shifted behind another, and the glass broken in; that glass was quite whole when I shut the shutters - I then found the prisoner in custody and alarmed my master; I had been alarmed by the bell ringing - I know this cock belongs to my master; I had seen it a few days previous - I know it to be my master's property - I have two masters.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you stop to shut the shop up after I was taken? A. Yes; nobody came near the warehouse except those who were standing round - the cock could not be taken out after I fastened the window, unless it was broken in again - there were people round, but nobody could take the cock out for I was standing against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you put your shutters up? A. My fellow apprentice went inside and unscrewed the bar for me - I did not leave the window till I put the shutters up - I did not see the cock lying near the window - the policeman found it - it was impossible for me to see it where I was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was time for the policeman himself to take the cock out of the window.</p>
               <p>MR. NORBURY re-examined. I left my apprentice at the shutters - both my apprentices were up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where was your other apprentice? A. Along with him in the passage; the other apprentice was in the passage and went in the shop to unscrew the bar, while the other was putting the shutters up outside.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at the Magpie public-house and took more than I ought - I was returning home and was stopped by two females, by the prosecutor's house - they asked me where I was going - I stopped to talk with them; in the meantime the policeman came up and charged me with taking this thing - I ask whether your lordship thinks I could go and take down the shutters without any implements - the witness said at the office, there was more men standing there, who, no doubt, were my confederates, and if they had taken them, no doubt, they would have found implements on them - I had not been there five minutes.</p>

I gave him the whole 10 l. - he returned me a 1 l. note and 1 s. He said he was going to some place in Berkshire, on Tuesday, and promised to call on me on Monday, but did not. I did not see him again till I saw him at Marlborough-street, which was about three weeks after. He was about five minutes consulting me.</p>

I said I did not think that I had sufficient change. I took it to the bar to my master, and told him what I had observed, and he declined changing it, and I took it back to the prisoner.

            . I am a waiter at Payne's Hotel, Brook-street, Bond-street. On Sunday, the 2d of January, I saw the prisoner at the Nelson Inn, North Cheam, where I then lived; he came in a horse and chaise, with another young man, they came into the house, and remained three-quarters of an hour, or an hour. The reckoning came to 9 s. 6 d. - the prisoner gave me a 10 l. Bank note, I took it to my master, at the bar, he could not change it. I then took it to a person named Lott, who keeps the tap at the inn, Mrs. Lott gave me a 5 l. and four 1 l. notes, and 1 l. in silver; I brought the change back, put it on the table, the prisoner took it up, and was going to put it into his pocket, when his companion said,</p>
               <p>"It is my change," and took it. They staid about ten minutes longer, gave me half a crown, and went away in the chaise together, to Epsom; they ordered dinner to be got for four persons on the Wednesday following. I was frequently in the room, and have no doubt of his person.</p>
               <p>AMEY LOTT. My husband keeps the tap of the Nelson inn, I remember early in January, the last witness brought me a 10 l. note, I gave him change, took the note up stairs, and put it into the drawer - there were two more 10 l. notes in the drawer; they were rolled together with some smaller ones. I put this by itself. I had no loose 10 l. notes in the drawer, except this. I locked the drawer, and always kept the key myself. I paid the same note to Mr. Taylor, who is clerk to Mr. Earl, of Kingston. I put no mark on it myself.</p>

            . In February last, I was servant to Mr. Braham, Euston-street, Euston-square, New Road. He keeps a private house - the prisoner lodged there for three weeks. He gave me a note which I did not look at. He said it was a 10 l. note, and told me to go and pay Mr. Lunn's bill, at the public-house, and bring him back the change - the note was open. I took it over and gave it to Mr. Lunn, jun. He deducted the bill, and gave me a 5 l. and three 1 l. notes, with some silver. I brought the change back and put it on the prisoner's table. He took the notes up, and asked me to get him five 1 l. notes for the 5 l. note, as it was a very old one. I did so, and gave them to him. I never changed a 10 l. note for him before. He went away about an hour after, and left no direction where he was gone to. I did not see him again till he was in custody. I believe he left on the 3d of February.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You was aware that I was going away - A. Yes; he told me to pay the publican as he was going. I believe it was on a Wednesday evening - he discharged his bills weekly.</p>

            . I am a solicitor, and live at Froome, Somersetshire. On the 5th of February, I was at the Sussex Hotel, Bouverie-street, and was desired to assist in securing the prisoner - he was out then. I went up into the sitting-room, where I found a young woman. There was another in the bed-room; both rooms looked into the street - the other woman came into the room. I took my station at the window, and they both went up into the bedroom. In consequence of information, I insisted on their coming down, and placed them at the back part of the room that they should not look out of the window. I placed myself so as to look out of the window without being seen. I did not see the prisoner in the street, he came into the room. I immediately went to him and charged him with uttering a 10 l. Bank of England note, knowing it to be forged. I did not tell him to whom he uttered it. He said I must be mistaken in the person, for he never changed a 10 l. Bank of England note in his life - I am perfectly sure that he said so. I kept him waiting till Mr. Ross came. He then told him he had uttered a 10 l. note to Mr. Tuson, and shewed him the note. He then admitted that he had paid it to Mr. Tuson, but added, that he had given his right name and address. I had two constables in waiting - I called them in, and delivered him up to them. He asked if he might be allowed to have some dinner, I permitted him. He then wished the constables to withdraw, which I permitted - I and Mr. Ross remained with him, I believe the young women were not there. He asked Mr. Ross, what end he could have in prosecuting him? and said he was the only man that could possibly save his brother, but if Mr. Ross persisted in what he was doing, he would turn against his brother, and nothing would save him (a person named

             was then in custody). I left him with the officers and proceeded to the Bank Solicitors' office. When I returned he held a full glass of wine in his hand, and asked if a guilty man could hold a glass so steadily. He was abusive, and was taken off in a coach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you be positive that I did not say I never passed a bad note - A. The impression on my mind was that he never changed a 10 l. Bank of England note. I did not mention Mr. Tuson's name to him.</p>

            . I am a solicitor, and live in Wardrobe-place, Doctors' Commons. On the 5th of February, I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120047"></xptr>to the Sussex hotel, the prisoner was not then within, he afterwards came in; he was in the custody of Mr. Miller. On my entering the room I charged him with passing a forged 10 l. Bank of England note; he said he had done no such thing. I said I had a charge of that nature against him. He asked to whom he had passed it? I told him to Dr. Tuson, of Percy-street, Rathbone-place. He said he believed he had passed a 10 l. note to Dr. Tuson, but he was not aware that it was forged, and that he had given his right name - he might have said that he gave his residence also, but I am not certain. I gave him in charge; he wished the officers to withdraw, they did so; he then said it would be of no service to me to prosecute him for this note, but that ultimately it might do me much mischief; that he was enabled to help my brother's case very materially, and that he was the only person who could do it (my brother was in custody on a charge of this nature). He said, if I suffered him to depart in the present instance he should feel grateful for it, as I must be aware it was a case that would at any rate affect his liberty, and perhaps his life; and if I would not comply, he should be compelled to be hostile, which I understood to mean respecting my brother.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any transactions with him yourself - A. Never. I saw him once by accident, but did not then know his name. He said a great deal more, which I do not recollect. I afterwards saw him at dinner, as Mr. Miller has stated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you that it was a serious charge, but under the mysterious circumstances of my being connected with your brother, I had not an opportunity of proving my innocence - A.

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes - I have been so twenty-six years. The note uttered to Mr. Tuson is forged in every respect, and is not the signature of C.

            . I am a cashier at the Bank, and sign 10 l. notes. There is no other of my name. The note is not signed by me.</p>
               <p>(The note was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have heard the evidence, which requires no ordinary mind to disconnect. I admit passing the notes, but you will find I gave no false names or addresses to them. I might have told Dr. Tuson that I was going to Kennington. Mrs. Cane did not bring me the change for three-quarters of an hour; but there is no evidence of my betraying any fear; and I will leave you to judge whether, in the course of passing six notes, there is sufficient to prove that I knew them to be forged, further than bare suspicion. Misfortune drove me to the life I have followed, which was depending on the chance of a billiard-table. I am aware that was not a reputable life, but I trust you will allow that in that life I may have taken the notes in question. You will see whether I passed the notes for any unnecessary articles - one was for wine, another for jewellery, and a third was to pay the publican. The bare suspicion of my knowing them to be forged, is not sufficient to prove me guilty of an offence which I am to suffer death for. The officers who apprehended me have not been called. -</p>

            . I am an officer, and assisted in apprehending the prisoner. I found 12 s. 6 d. on him, but no notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (in continuation.) It was my determination to plead Guilty, but the Court advised me not, and I put myself on my trial, not for the purpose of vindication, but that I might address you. I have made application to the Bank, with a full confession that I passed the notes, and praying their mercy on account of my youth, and having had no paternal protector since the age of sixteen. I wished to make every atonement in my power. Various misrepresentations have been made to influence their opinion. I have nothing but death before me, having been denied their clemency. Instead of my being the leader of a desperate gang, I was only the instrument of Stewart - he took advantage of my distresses; my wife and myself had not bread to eat for two days. Stewart said if I could pass bad notes he could get them for me. I was provided with one, and passed that; he got me another. He was apprehended in a day or two, and laid the blame on me; he was allowed to be transported for fourteen years. I was then sure that the officers were after me - I had no money to leave the country, and was led to the desperate resolution of passing more, to raise money to leave the country; at this time I became acquainted with Mr. Ross (the brother of the witness, who has only done his duty) - I informed him of my situation, and that the officers were after me - he was living with his father at home, enjoying a comfortable house and everything he wished for. He said if I would suffer him to join me, he would pass sufficient notes to get us both out of the country. I suffered him to participate in it, he passed notes with me, and through the means of his brother's taking me, he was allowed the clemency of the Bank; and I suppose, from misrepresentations on my character, I am to be cast for death. I now throw myself entirely on their mercy, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120048"></xptr>perhaps, before I suffer I shall detail the circumstances more particularly, and shew that I deserve the same mercy as others.</p>

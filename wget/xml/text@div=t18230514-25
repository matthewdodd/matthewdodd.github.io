On the 30th of April, about six o'clock in the morning, the watchman came to me, and I missed a deal - I found it in a yard, which I believe to be the prisoner's; we found him, and I gave him in charge - he seemed agitated. I asked him to shew me where my deal was; he took me to the premises, and shewed it me - it was a deal plank, which I had sawed into four pieces. I am certain it is mine.</p>

            . I am the watchman. I saw the prisoner at a quarter before one o'clock at night, with these four boards, coming from the new houses which Hurley was building, I questioned him; he said he bought them the evening before, at Paddington, and lived in Willsden-green. I did not detain him then, but next morning I took Hurley to the house, and found the deals.</p>

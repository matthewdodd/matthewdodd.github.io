             (Police-constable N 248). On the 9th of June, I fell in with the two prisoners in Maiden-lane, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the evening; one of them was in one field, and one in another - I saw Purvis crawl on his hands and knees, under the hedge, and then they both came out of the fields, and walked up the road - they then went into Cut-throat-lane, about three-quarters of a mile up the road; I there saw Purvis with his coat and waistcoat off, and he was putting on a striped shirt over his own shirt - I took them back, and in going back, Purvis said he had committed a robbery that would transport him, that he had robbed a poor laundress of eleven shirts, and two handkerchiefs - he told me to go and look under a bush, and I should find eleven shirts and a handkerchief in his flannel jacket; I went and found them - there was nothing found on Eather.</p>

               <p>Purvis' Defence. I got up at four o'clock, to take them home; I met my fellow prisoner as I was going along - we got nearly tipsy; I then thought I had better not take the things home then, and went to hide them - I went in the evening for them, and saw them safe; there was a man looking at me; I put them down, went on, and the officer took us.</p>

               <p>I arose in the morning early, and found the prisoner Morrell with a bag on his shoulders, and a little further I saw that gentleman the prisoner Cady, with a bag on his shoulders, as soon as he observed us he directly wriggled the bag from his shoulders and pretended to go against the wall, and when he found we followed him, he run away, and I cried out stop thief! I and my son took Morrell, Mr. Lou and another took the other, and we conducted them to the cage belonging to the church; the bags that were on his shoulders I took off with one hand, and I collared him with the other, and the other gentleman took the bag that Cady dropped, we carried them before the Justice and examined the contents of the bags, there was a copper in each, in an old apron, the copper belonging to the prosecutrix was in the possession of the prisoner Morrell (The copper produced and deposed to) here is a piece at the bottom that is patched; after we had taken that gentleman to the watch-house, the beadle searched that young man, and took out a pair of stockings out of his pocket, a knife and pair of small spring steelyards, at the Justices the prisoner Morrell said he found them; he made no confession, but he had a pair of stockings on his legs that belonged to Mrs. Trimmer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood Counsel for the Prisoner. How far was it that you saw him from this house of Mrs. Fortuam's? - I suppose 150 yards as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Was not it half a mile? - No nor a quarter.</p>
               <p>Was not he in the King's highway? - No, in no King's highway, he was in a field, he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>To prosecutrix. Are you sure of the copper? - I am sure of it, I have lived in the place these ten years, I never was in this Court before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Morrell. I desire to know what time they were robbed? - I cannot tell.</p>

I lodged at the Union public—house, Oxford—street—I went bed on the night of the 17th of April, in the front attic—the next morning, at half-past six o'clock, I got up, and missed a coat, trowsers, and shirt, and braces—two or three more persons were in the room when I awoke—this shirt has been mine, but I lost one once before, and I cannot say whether it was that.</p>

At half-past nine that evening the prosecutor went to bed—the prisoner came afterwards, and wanted half a bed—he had a pint of beer, and was then shown up to the bedroom where the prosecutor was—he remained there about ten minutes, and came down in his shirt-sleeves—I said, "Have you come down again?"—he said, "Yes, I want to go into the yard"—I pointed to it, and said, "Have you brought your clothes down?" as he had some things with him—he said, "No, only my shoes"—he had got the shoes in his hand—he did not return from the yard—I went to see, and he was gone away over a ten feet wall, and the pro<lb></lb>secutor's things were gone—I did not awake him—the next morning the prisoner passed—I sent my waiter and the prosecutor after him, and the shirt was found on him.</p>

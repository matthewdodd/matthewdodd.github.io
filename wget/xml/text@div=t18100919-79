            . I was serving in my master's shop, on the 8th of September, the prisoner came in, asked me what I could have a gold seal for; I told him about a guinea and a half; he asked me if it would make any difference, if he paid part of the money then, and paid the rest when he called for the seal; I told him no. I shewed him some, he took up two seals, the one which he had in his finger and thumb, he laid down, and the other he held in his hand, concealed under his little finger, he directly shifted his hand from the tray, along the glass case. I had a seal in my hand which I told him the price was twenty eight shillings, I put it along the counter, to his hand in which he had got the seal, to see whether he would take it in that hand in which he had the seal concealed; I pressed him very strongly to take hold of it, saying it was a very strong seal, and wished him to examine it; he directly shifted his hand off the glass case into his right hand breeches pocket, with the seal in his hand. I directly laid down the seal which I had in my hand, and took hold of him across the counter, by his collar; I asked him to deliver up the seal which he had in his hand, in his pocket; he immediately drew it out of his pocket, and gave it into my hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190044"></xptr>I still held his collar; he begged my pardon, and said, he did not intend to steal the seal; I told him I should call my master. I rung the bell and called my master.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of that seal that he had put into his pocket - A. Thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>furnished at Mr. Hughes's desire—I think both Mr. Hughes and Mr. Palmer used these offices afterwards, but I understood in the first instance that that was to be separate for Mr. Palmer's use—on going there I occasionally found both there—I cannot say whether any portion of this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Mr. Hughes' writing—I saw Mr. Hughes before he left this country, two or three days previous to the 30th June—I first heard that he had left, when I received a circular, on a Friday after 20th July—in consequence of the receipt of that circular I went down to his office—it was not closed, but there was a notice outside on the door, on some plate, directing his parcels and letters to be taken to College-hill, to Black and Snow—independent of the trade debt there was 4,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me from Hughes, and there was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not money that I had entrusted to him to invest—it was, more properly speaking, money on call, that I might have when<lb></lb>ever I chose to call for it—the 4,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was money entrusted to him to invest, and which I am a loser of, with the deeds—I think there was only 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I let him have on call—when I went to the office I saw Mr. Haines; he referred me to Messrs. Black and Snow, where I went—I saw Mr. Snow—I got no money—I did not learn from them where the bankrupt was gone to—I asked him if he would look at my deeds—I did not learn where the prisoner was, or where he had gone to—I enquired, and was told he was gone away for the benefit of his health.</p>

               <p>would give mo security two or three times the value of my advances—it was not understood between us that he was to be the borrower of these two sums of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he should give me security upon the estates—he did not say what he should give me—it was not understood between us that he should have the loan of these two sums, and give me security—I did not know what security would come to me until it came—I did not know that he was going to have the money, and to use it himself—I did not inquire when this account was sent in, upon what security these sums of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been invested, not even when I saw Dalston written here—I had such implicit confidence in my own solicitor that I considered any deeds that he sent me were perfectly correct—I had not got any deeds in August, 1856, in respect of these last two sums of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not inquire at all what this "In hand, Dalston" meant—of course I saw that the interest was being paid upon them from the respective periods when I advanced them to him—I did afterwards have handed over to me some deeds, which professed to be securities—you have the deeds there—you can look at them—he sent me those deeds as security for my money—he was my confidential solicitor—I cannot tell you upon what day I got these deeds—I believe it was somewhere in October, 1856—after October, 1856, I felt perfectly satisfied that my 4,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was safe—I did not know that Mr. Hughes was himself the borrower of the money at that time—I did not know that my money was outstanding and that he was paying me interest upon it as a loan to himself—I never knew it—I believed these deeds were security for my money—I did not consider Mr. Hughes was the borrower—I considered that he, as my solicitor, found me sound security—the last advance I made to him before March, 1856, I believe was in 1854—that was 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a Mr. Perryman—that was a specific loan to Perryman—the sum before that I believe was two sums of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a person of the name of Cheatle—I be<lb></lb>lieve that was in 1852—when he sent me the deeds I considered that it was a specific loan to Cheatle—I advanced these two sums of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 15th and 23d November, 18541 believe—I don't know when I got the deeds—I can't tell how soon after that I learnt that Cheatle had got the money—I never inquired whether he had got the money—Mr. Hughes did not tell me that he wanted the second 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up Cheatle's loan of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he wanted 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and these two sums of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. made the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Cheatle's name was not mentioned to me as the person who wanted the money—it waa mentioned to me when I saw the deeds—here is the application for it—the whole of this is in the prisoner's handwriting—this is the application upon which I lent the two sums of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "9th November, 1852.

Dear Sir, I have a security of a life estate in the dividends of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock, standing in the books of the Bank of England, in the name of Mr. John Williams, of Oxford-street, Silk-mercer, a policy of assurance for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two houses of the value of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would this suit you or your brother? Yours faithfully, David Hughes")—That is the letter upon which I advanced the sum of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I never received the dividend referred to there of Mr. Williams of Oxford-street—there was no charge ever made to me by Mr. Hughes for lending my money—no commission or anything of that sort; he was my solicitor—it was in that character that I handed him over the monies—I am one of the assignees—I don't recol<lb></lb>lect the number of ounces of plate that Mr. Hughes left behind in his house—the furniture and plate realized about 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know whether there was 1,600 ounces of plate amongst that—there was a large quantity of plate—that 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was realized by a sale under the bankruptcy—I am</p>

               <p>not aware that there is any reserved price put when there is a bankruptcy sale—I have heard that there was some building property at Shepherd's Bush, Dalston, and Holloway, and also a house in the Poultry, the house, in Gresham-stieet, and property at Turnham-green—we have no power to touch them—there may be property of considerable extent—I have asser<lb></lb>tained, through the solicitor to the assignees, the extent of the property—I understand that it is property to a considerable extent, but I know nothing about it—I have informed myself, as assignee, as to the value of this property as much as I have considered it my duty to do, through my solicitor—I have taken interest enough to realize everything that is possible to be realized—I know the house in the Poultry—I do not know whether it has been sold—I do not know the value of it—I have heard Mr. Hughes say that he refused 17,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the house in Gresham-street—I have not heard the names of the people who offered it—I believe it was taken for the Agra Bank—I certainly did not take the trouble to enquire whether that offer was made for it—I do not know whether it has been sold; it may have been; I have not ascertained the value—I leave such a concern as that to my solicitor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOVILL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to these houses at Shepherd's Bush, is there one which is encumbered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they are all encumbered—we have realized I should think between 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the bank ruptcy—the assignees are involved in, I believe, seven chancery suits—I did not see the prisoner's house till the time of the sale—some carriages were left behind unsold—there was I think, a brougham, or something of that kind, aud a four-wheeled phaeton—I think there were two ponies—the car<lb></lb>riage horses had been sold previously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you entrusted these monies to Mr. Hughes as your solicitor; did you know the defendant as a scrivener or as a solicitor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard a little about it lately, and I know a little more about it than I wish to know—I heard nothing about it till I heard it discussed under the bankruptcy—I was not aware that Mr. Cheatle was the person proposed: that was left entirely to Mr. Hughes—in 1856, he owed me, I think, 4,445<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was 4,440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—those were the names or as<lb></lb>sumed names of persons from whom the money was supposed to be due—I received from him in 1856 a bundle of securities—I do not know the precise date—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—this deed does not state from whom the mortgage was, or to whom—I do not know that I took the trouble to open the deed and read it or see from whom the mortgage was—I believe I read a portion of Trist and Lucas' deeds, because I knew the individual who had them before me—this purports to be a mortgage by Hughes—I never got from him any securities for the 4,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. except this bundle of deeds, and I have never been able to realize a single sixpence upon them—I first heard that he had gone to Melbourne about a fortnight after the 24th of July—I cannot say to a few days—I do not think it came out at the same time how he had gone—there were so many rumours at the time that we hardly knew what to believe.</p>

This was dated 1855, and was the account of the executors of D. Woodman with David Hughes</hi>)—Miss Woodman was also a client, and after her death Mr. Hambridge represented both—I applied to Hughes for the payment of the money shewn to bo due by that account, and I think the whole of it has been paid—there was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on security when Mr. Hughes left the country—the papers have been out of our hands, and therefore I do not know whether it was paid or not—he handed over to me certain deeds for, I think, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which Woodman had deposited; upon which I wrote this letter and sent it by post.

We shall be glad to receive a cheque for the amount immediately; the other matter and the accounts shall have out best attention, and we remain, yours truly, Trinder and Eyre.

To Messrs. Trinder and Eyre. Woodman E. and D. deceased. Gentlemen, I am surprised at your's of yesterday; all money received by me is received at interest and subject to six months call, and I either find security or hold the money without security, as most convenient to myself; these sums were so received by my late firm, and as I considered the course taken as somewhat offensive, as well with reference to these sums as also to my account, I shall be glad to be informed whether this mode of application is approved of and sanctioned by Mr. Hambridge. With respect to the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which mortgage is being taken by Miss Yeates, I received instructions from Mr. Hambridge to make the proposal to her, and she having assented to it, the same was forthwith prepared, and as the legacy is due to Miss Yeates I can hardly suppose that Mr. Hambridge would wish to alter an arrangement which he himself first proposed, and which indeed cannot now be changed. <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, David Hughes"—on 10th November, 1855, we received 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner—I recollect seeing him in July, 1855—I cannot pretend to say exactly what he said, but he explained the style in which he did business—he said, "I receive monies and I give security; I can give you this security, "taking one out of his safe;" or I can give you another security, at another place"—I also objected to the mode in which his bill of costs was made out; he had not specified the items—he called his clerk to bring in a large book, and explained to me the nature of his en<lb></lb>tries there; attendance from such a date to such a date, so many guineas—he</p>

               <p>said he was not in the habit of making it in the ordinary form in which solicitor's bills are usually made out—he charged the attendance in a lump, and I made the remark "You make out your bills more like a medical man"—he said "Yes, it is easier"—I then said, "There would not be so much difficulty in proving you a scrivener as we have in many cases"—he smiled and said, "No," or some such expression—I had gone there for the purpose of receiving the money, and with regard to ulterior proceedings if I had not obtained a settlement.</p>

I believe—I applied for that money and got it—I made application, I think, 12 months before I got it, and was put off by various excuses—I saw Hughes upon it myself—when I applied for the money, he said that I could not have it without giving six months notice—I gave the six months notice—he did not, at that time, say anything about re-investiug it for me—the note was returned to me as money in hand—I was dissatisfied with that, and required the money—I did not get it at the end of the first six months: I communicated with him again, and insisted upon having the money, and ultimately I got the money—besides these transactions the prisoner has made applications to me to advance money.</p>

Dear Sir,—Since my arrival in town I have seen Mr. James, and had detailed to me the particulars of the conversation which took place between you and him a few days ago. You will not, I feel sure, be surprised when I say that I was not at all satisfied with the proposal you appear to have made to him, or that I look on matters as he does. I wish you distinctly to understand that my determination to act with decision in this matter, (as was expressed to you in my last letter,) is not in the lewt altered. I told Mr. James last evening the course I meant to pursue; that I should this morning have an interview with my solicitors (Messrs. Wilde, Rees, Humphrey, and Wilde, of College-hill) and arrange with them to take the matter in hand and follow it up in the usual way, should the sum due at Midsummer not be paid on the 15th prox.

I am advised to hold them, and only part with them as the amount of the debt is liquidated. I need not say that my plans are not in the least disarranged, or my purposes altered by your letters to Mr. James; nor will it be of any avail in this matter to hold any further correspondence with him, as he very properly, although with reluctance, allows me to act as I see best, and as, indeed, I should act even if I had not his sanction.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not express to me that that was the first time he had heard of his bankruptcy—he said, "I will go back with you willingly, and I shall be able to put it all right"—he asked me to read the warrant—I shewed him the warrant, and I said, "I will read it to you now, or at the police-station—he said, "I should like to have it read now," and I then read the warrant to him—at the time he was very excited, and said, "That's all; it is not forgery, because I have committed no forgery—on his way to Melbourne he said some<lb></lb>thing about his affairs, but he appeared so confused that I could not under<lb></lb>stand what he did say—on the voyage home the prisoner did not say in my hearing that he had left a power of attorney to realize his property—he said something of the sort—the bankrupt did not say anything to me about his having been made a bankrupt." That is correct—I took him into custody on 7th June.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury; in order to establish the offence charged, it was necessary to prove, first, that the prisoner was a trader; secondly, that he had committed an act of bankruptcy; and, thirdly, that there was a good petitioning creditors debt; admitting that there was evidence as to the two last named points, he contended that the first was nega<lb></lb>tived; that so far from any trading as a scrivener being made out, the evidence established merely the ordinary relations of solicitor and client; he referred to a dictum of</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE GIBBS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">in Adams v. Malkin, 3, Campbells Reports, 534, in which the trading as a scrivener was explicitly defined; and urged that the present case could not he said to come within that definition.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">having no doubt that upon that point there was evidence for the Jury</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HAWLOMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">proceeded to take several objections upon the proceedings in bank<lb></lb>ruptcy; first, as to the petition, upon which the adjudication was founded; the petition described the bankrupt's residence as at 13, Gresham-street, which was in fact only his place of business, and therefore not strictly speaking hit residence: secondly, as to the advertisement in the Gazette; by the 104 section it was directed that such advertisement should clearly appear to be by the authority of the Bankruptcy Court; in the present case no such proof appeared; neither did the advertisement contain the appointment of the two days limited for the surrender of the bankrupt, which the 104 section seemed to require; it did not set forth the adjudication, or any particulars, but merely stated that he had been "declared" a bankrupt, a term, not to be found in the statute at all: thirdly, as to the summons; that was a summons to surrender, not to the Court, but to Mr. Commissioner Goulburn, on certain days, and by the evidence it appeared that that Commissioner was not in attendance on those occanons, so that the bankrupt could not possibly have complied with that summons;</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">he further contended that the non-surrender must be proved to be wilful; it was not enough to show that he had committed an act of bankruptcy by leaving this country, and so delaying his creditors; the case of Blake v. Lee, Ambler's Reports, 307, clearly shewed that the non-surrender must be a wilful one; all that the evidence disclosed here was a temporary pressure; there was no threat of bankruptcy before the prisoner quitted this country, nor any evidence of any intimation to that effect, but the steps taken were after he was on his way to Australia, when it was physically impossible that he could have any knowledge on the subject.</hi>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your house on the 31st of August? - A. Perfectly well, between four and five in the afternoon; she came to purchase some mourning; she said her husband's mother was dead; she was very difficult in her purchase.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay in the shop? - A. An hour and a half to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she buy any thing at last? - A. She purchased as many goods as came to the value of 12l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay you for them? - A. She did not; in the course of conversation, she said her husband kept a wine-vaults in Lime-street; that they had recently purchased the lease, and they had given 370l. for it; she went on to ask me for my custom, and I told her, I had no objection to give her a turn; as soon as the goods were looked out, I went to make out the bill of parcels, and I asked her what name I should make it out in; she told me Mrs. Allen; after that she entered into conversation where she was born, at Newbury, in Berkshire, and mentioned several people that I knew at Newbury; she then said, you may either send the goods home to my house, and I will pay for them, or I am going to Shoreditch to receive 15l. and I will call and pay for them when I come back; she said her mother had been dead about three months; she went away; I told her I should send the goods; I had not the smallest suspicion; I was behind the counter the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you missed any property? - A. I did not miss it; but as soon as she went out, my nephew, who is an assistant to me, said, uncle, I think that woman has robbed you.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a partner with you? - A. No; I made answer, that it was impossible she could have robbed me, as I had never been from the counter, and there had been no person in the shop during the time she was there; I did not quit the counter, but my people reached me what I asked for; upon that he went out of doors after her, and in about two or three minutes after I got information from a neighbour's boy that she was stopped by my nephew; she was brought back in about ten minutes; my nephew had hold of her arm; he had the handkerchiefs and muslin in his hand.</p>

             sworn. - On the 31st of August, about a quarter before eleven at night, I was sent for to Mr. Johnson's house, and received charge of the prisoner and these goods from Mr. Johnson. - (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140029"></xptr>Q. (To Johnson.) Do you know these things to be your's? - A. Yes, they have my own private mark bot upon the ticket and upon the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those things in your shop that day? - A. I believe they were; but where there are a hundred or a hundred and fifty handkerchiefs in a bundle, it is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if you saw them that day? - A. I had not shewn them to any body that day; but to swear I had those handkerchiefs in my shop that day I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such handkerchiefs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the muslin? - A. The muslin I can swear to, as having shewn her at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. Q. How many persons were there in your shop? - A. My nephew, myself, and another young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that young man here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She was brought back about seven o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to put her in custody till eleven o'clock? - A. She requested that I would send to the butcher whom she said she was going to receive 15l from; she kept crying and taking on very much, and I was very much flurried; my customers came in very fast, and I desired her to walk into a back room, where I knew she would be safe.</p>

             sworn. - I am nephew to Mr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the shop during the time the prisoner was there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see? - A. I saw her put her hand under her cloak, but I did not see any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the handkerchiefs that day? - A. Yes, I had seen them in the morning, and took particular notice of them; Mr. Johnson had been shewing them afterwards to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the muslin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any thing in her hand when she put it under her cloak? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From that it was that you suspected her? - A. Yes; when she went away I followed her out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep sight of her from the time of her leaving the shop? - A. Yes; I watched her into a pawnbroker's shop in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay there? - A. I don't think she was there above two minutes, if so much; directly that she came out I ran into the pawnbroker's; I came out again, and she was then running.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you? - A. No; directly that I came up to her, I told her Mr. Johnson would be glad to speak to her; it was hardly a moment after I came out of the pawnbroker's before I laid hold of her, and as I was bringing her back she dropped the black cotton, but I did not see her drop it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been looking at black cotton? - A. Yes, she had; soon after I saw her drop the silk handkerchiefs; a gentleman who was behind me picked up the black cotton and the silk handkerchiefs, and gave them to me; I brought her back to our shop, and gave her to Mr. Johnson; I don't know what passed; I had to attend to a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these handkerchiefs? - A. They are ours, and so is the black muslin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. By the cotton that you speak of, you don't mean that muslin? - A. Yes, it is cotton muslin.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, No. 219, Shoreditch: On the 31st of August the prisoner at the bar came into my shop, and laid down a piece of black cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she come into your shop? - A. About six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the cotton again? - A. I never had it in my hand; it appears to be the same cotton; I told her I never took in any black cotton, and then she offered three silk handkerchiefs, and asked me ten shillings upon them; I just gave them a slight look, and said three half crowns; she said that would not do; she took them up very quick, and was out of the shop immediately; Mr. Johnson's nephew came in to know what that lady had offered; I told him, and he went out immediately, and followed her; I went round to the door, and he had overtaken her just before; he brought her back to my door; I saw the black cotton drop from under her cloak upon the pavement; I then called to the young man, and I saw the three silk handkerchiefs in her hand, but did not see her drop them.</p>

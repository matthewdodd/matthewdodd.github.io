                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 633). On 22nd May, about 6 o'clock in the morning, I was in Bishopsgate-street; I saw the prisoner leave the pre<lb></lb>mises of Messrs. Pipers, the builders, with a horse and cart—in the cart there was a sack containing something, which I afterwards found was oats and cut hay—I followed him into Houndsditch, and he then went through different streets to Hunt-street, Mile-end New-town, which is about a mile from Messrs. Pipers by the way he went; he did not go the nearest way—he kept by the cart till he got to Hunt-street—he then took a sack out of the cart, and took it into a milk shed belonging to Mr. Waller—he remained in the shed a minute, or a minute and a half, and he came out without the sack—this is the sack—it is marked with the name of Truman, Hanbury, and Co.—the prisoner went away, and I went into the shed and found this sack that I had seen him carry in—I was close behind him—I saw him take it from his shoulders, and put it down—I went and found it contained hay and oats—Mr. Waller said it had been brought there by a man—I then went to a building in America-square where I found the cart, and in about two minutes the prisoner came to the cart—I told him I charged him with disposing of his horse's food, which he had taken out to feed his horse—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185606160052"></xptr>
               <p>said nothing—I asked him if he heard what I said—he said, "Yes"—I found this other sack in the cart, which contains the same description of food as that which was found in the prosecutor's loft—as the prisoner was going along, before he got to the milk shed, I saw him doing something to a sack in the cart—I saw the bottom of a sack, it appeared to me that lie was shooting something from one sack into another—I could not see what came out of the sack, but the large sack was high enough just to be seen above the cart.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you could see the bottom of one sack, and the top of the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I could just see the top of the bottom sack—one was in the other—I could see the bottom of the second sack, the one he was holding up—I could just see the top of the other sack—it was a common builder's cart—it has not very high sides—I could just see the top of the sack—I could not distinctly see what went from one sack to another—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being ready stated</hi>: "I saw him lift a sack to the cart, and do something; I could not see what he did, as the sides of the cart were too high")—I only found one sack in the cart—this sack was in the cart when I took him—I saw the top of the sack which was standing on the floor of the cart—I saw him putting something from one sack to the other—he was holding the second sack up, I could just see the top of the lower sack.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he held up the smaller sack by it's bottom, how could any be left in 'it; it would be empty altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say about that—I found another sack at Waller's, and in it was a mixture of beans and hay—I inquired about Waller, I heard he was a hard working man—he was discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. Was there a nosebag in the cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the horse was feeding from the nosebag—the cart stopped once before it got to Hunt-street—I kept it in view the whole time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PLATT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you see any part of the other sack, the one into which one sack was going? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the top of it—when the cart stopped I was at the tail of it—the sides of the cart go straight—the cart was not loaded—the prisoner was in the middle of the cart, close by the side—the sack was in some measure hidden by the side of the cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which sack was he holding up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This top one—it appeared to me that the effect of that would be to empty the sack alto<lb></lb>gether, but I found some in it afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horse keeper to Henry Thomas Piper and another, in Bishopsgate-street. The prisoner was one of their carmen—on the morning of 22nd May, I saw him put the horse in the cart to go out—he had this small sack in the cart, it had about a bushel and a half of mixture of corn and chaff—the sack was about three parts full—I had a mixture of that sort at home—I have brought a sample, which I have com<lb></lb>pared with this in the large sack—this in the small sack is the same—they appear to be the same sort as the quantity in the loft—I saw only one sack in the cart—I have looked at this sack which was found in the shed, I never saw it before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you saw him start you only saw one sack I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he had one nosebag—he would have to fill the nosebag from the sack—we do not buy this mixture ready made up, we buy the hay by the</p>

               <p>load—I cut it myself—the prisoner has been with us somewhere about four months—I respected him very much, I considered him a very honest man—I have not missed any of this mixture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much would he take out in a day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a bushel and a half, which would be this small sack three parts full—he might have consumed by half past 8 o'clock nearly as much as is gone from here—it was the supply for the day—this is the sack, and what the nose-bag had would make nearly a bushel.</p>

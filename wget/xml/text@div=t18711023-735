I live at 10, John's Place, Fulham—I know the prisoner—on Friday, 11th August, I saw her go past my door—I knew that she was ill—I took her by the hand, and asked her what was the matter with her—she said she had diarrhoea,—I said "Eliza, I fear it is not diarrheoa, it is something else"—she said "I ought to know"—she had a small bottle in her hand—I asked what it was—she said "Castor oil"—I said "The best thing you can have to take, but beware how you take it if you are in labour, which I am sure you are"—she said she was not—she was then living with her mother—I offered to go with her to the Union if she would go—about 8.45 next morning I went to her mother's house, and found the prisoner lying on a wooden box in a room up stairs; there was not a particle of bed or bed clothing in the room—I said "How are you, Eliza?"—she said "I am better"—I asked her if she had had a child—she said "No"—I observed that her dress, which was hanging up, was very much stained with blood, and I asked her how it came there—she said after she took the castor oil she had vomited a great deal of blood and likewise passed a great deal—she positively asserted that she had not had a child, she wished the Lord might strike her dead, so help her God she had not—I told her I would fetch a doctor—she said I could—I fetched Mr. Staples, the chemist, and her mother fetched a midwife—I went in with them—the prisoner was then washing the tea things—I asked them if they thought there was a child—they said "Yes," and I said "Then I will find it" and I did find it in a small coal cellar under the stairs, rolled in a piece of sacking; it had the after birth firmly pressed into the mouth—I had a hard job to pull it out, and blood flowed from the nose and mouth</p>

               <p>when I did so—the cord had been levered, but not tied—I and the mid-wife tied it afterwards; it had been cut with scissors—Mrs. Mumford took the child from me—I thought it was alive when I first took it; the body was quite warm—Mrs. Mumford put it on the table, and I said to the prisoner "What have you done, how comes this I"—she said she had placed this over the baby's mouth, because her mother should not hear it cry.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Morley's Buildings, Fulham, and am the wife of William Mumford, a groom—on Saturday morning, 12th August, Mrs. Knott fetched me to her house—I found the prisoner there, washing up the breakfast things—I said "Eliza, what is the matter?"—she said "Nothing"—I said "Your mother and Mrs. Steventon called to show me some linen that was in the copper, and there is labour; you have had a baby; tell me what you have done with it"—she said "So help me God I have not"—Mrs. Steventon and her mother went to the cupboard under the stairs, and brought the baby out, rolled in an old piece of sacking—the cord was not tied—there was a slight bruise on the forehead—the after-birth, when I saw it, was by the side of the baby's head—it was quite warm—I washed and dressed it, and then asked the prisoner what she had done it for, and why the did not tell her mother—she said "If I had told my mother I should have gone and jumped into the river directly; my in<lb></lb>tention was to take the baby and go and jump into the water with it"—she said she put the after-birth on the baby's face because it cried so loud she was afraid it would wake her mother and brother—it was a female child—it was about 9.45 when it was found—the prisoner did not say when it was born—I asked her if it was born when she called her mother—she said no, she called her mother about 6.20, and it was not born then, not till after her father had gone—I did not see any clothes prepared for the child, only what the neighbours brought in—I asked for some, and there were none to be found in the house—I went with the prisoner to the workhouse—the remained there a month—I gave the child to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Walham Green—on Saturday, 12th August, about 12 or I o'clock, I was requested by Weller to examine the body of a female child—I found it fairly formed, fully nourished, quite cold, very blanched; there was an abrasion and bruise over the left eye<lb></lb>brow, the navel string had been cut, and a piece of thread tied loosely</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187110230028"></xptr>
               <p>round it—by order of the Coroner I made an examination of the body on 13th August—on removing the scalp I found effusion of blood underneath, corresponding with the abrasion and bruise outside; the membranes of the brain very much congested with dark venous blood, but the substance of the brain blanched—the chest was fully filled by the lungs—I put the lungs and heart together into water, and the whole floated—I separated the heart from the lungs, and they floated separately—I divided the lungs into small pieces, and every piece floated—all the large vessels were drained of blood, the heart only containing a small quantity of fluid blood on the right side—from my examination I should say the child had certainly been born alive—there had been a separate circulation—the lungs had been fully inflated—if the after-birth had been placed over the mouth and pressed, the effect would be congestion of all the internal organs, of the brain especially—the effect of it would be to produce a certain amount of suffocation, but the body being drained at the same time there could not be that congestion of the internal organs—hemorrhage contributed to t*he death, bleeding from the cord—the cause of death was partly hemorrhage and partly suffo<lb></lb>cation—I believe both causes were in operation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bleeding was from the cord not being tied—I should say the lungs would not present the appearance they did if the child had not had a separate existence from the mother—a child may breathe thoroughly, without being separated from the mother—breathing would fill the lungs with air—if the cord was broken, or partly severed in the birth, hemorrhage would go on, and that would, of course, fearfully weaken the child—that would occur after the child was actually born—I have had a large experience, and I have never met with, or read of a case where it has been severed until it was out of the womb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. This cord was clean cut—the child had unquestionably been born alive, or the lungs could not have been so fully inflated—the child must be in the world for the cord to be cut—it is a medical man's first duty to tie the cord—until the cord is tied, the child has not a perfectly separate existence from the mother—the after-birth is the last matter that comes away in the act of parturition—if the after-birth has come away, the child must have been fully born.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I was left at home on the 3d of May when my husband went out. I went out at ten minutes after three. I locked the door, and the windows were all shut. I was out about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when you returned did you find the house locked and secure, or how - A. I found the back door on a jar; that door was shut on the latch when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any body open that latch from the street - A. No; they must have come through the other persons premises.</p>
               <p>Q. How could they come in from your neighbours premises - A. There is a passage that leads into the yard, from that yard they could open the latch. I missed the chest; it was gone. When I went out I tried the door; the latch was fast. I left no person in the house whatever.</p>

               <p>Q. What is he - A. He said he worked at the coal work. He asked me to do him a favour; to pledge a watch for him, for a sailor that was going to sea. I agreed to pledge it for him; he wished me either to pledge it or sell it. I asked him what he asked for it; he said two pounds. I afterwards pledge the watch for thirty shillings. I returned him the duplicate and the money. I pledged it at Mr. Dexter's. I bought the duplicate of him afterwards. I was to give him ten shillings; I gave him six shillings in part; I had no more at the time.

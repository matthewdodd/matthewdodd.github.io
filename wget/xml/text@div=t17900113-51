I said, to get some lime in Red-lion-street; I turned round and looked at him, and he asked me to carry that for him a little way; he said it hurt his shoulders; accordingly I took it from him, and he told me to follow him, and he would shew me where to take it; he went about half way down Leather-lane, and shewed me Mr. Dale's, and gave me a letter wafered up, with Mr. Dale written on the face of it, and told me I was to bring three guineas, and he would wait in that street till I returned; and if he did not send that, the price was in the letter; I went and knocked at the door, and staid half an hour, and a woman let me in, and asked me to call again; she sent me to look for him at a public-house; and his wife broke open the letter, and asked me my name; I told him where I lodged, and that I was to have three guineas; he said he should not give three guineas; he turned them out of the sack, and gave me a guinea, and put it in the letter, and his name underneath it; and he gave me the letter back, and the sack, and I came to the man in Hatton-street, and I told him; he read the letter, put it in his pocket, and gave me half a crown, and parted from me; and I went where I was going before, for the lime, and I went to work.</p>

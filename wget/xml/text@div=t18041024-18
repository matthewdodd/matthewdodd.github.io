               <p>Q. Did you find your watch? - A. Yes, I found it on Mrs. Brown; I went in pursuit of her to her lodgings, in Baldwin's gardens, Gray's Inn lane, and waited there till she came home, and the woman that I live with was with me; the prisoner came home to her lodgings a little after twelve o'clock, as we were waiting at her door; I told her I would secure her till I found the watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Behave decently. (The prosecutor appeared very much intoxicated.)</p>
               <p>Q.Who searched her? - A. She dropped the watch on the ground, after I had charged the watchman with her; I saw him take the watch up, but I did not see it fall.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman; on the 22d of September, about a quarter before one o'clock, this man came with the prisoner at the bar and insisted on my taking charge of her, and on her entering the watch-house door she dropped the watch; she said, she only took it out of a joke, that he should not see what o'clock in the night it was. (Produces the watch.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Look at that watch, and tell me whether that is your's? - A. It certainly is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the particular mark that you discover it by? (The prosecutor looks at the keys and the seal.) - A. There are two different keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the watch itself; how long have you had it? - A. About two years and a half; I will swear it is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know the watch by? - A. By the paper inside of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What do you know the paper by? - A. It is a paper very much worn; I put it in so fill the case up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it is a printed piece of paper, or a plain piece of paper? - A. I never examined it very much; I know it is torn at one corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the watch or the maker's name? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have known the prosecutor about two years, and he and the woman that he cohabits with are very much addicted to drinking; he gave me the watch for an improper connexion with me; I did not wish to have any concern with him; this man has very often tried to get the better of me, and he has taken half a guinea at a time out of my pocket, and has got very much in liquor with my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the watch? - A. As I was going through Clement's lane he was beating and turning the woman out that he lives with; she called me, and said, Betsey, come in, for God's sake, I shall be murdered; I had been out a charing to Mrs. Large, and I had half a crown and some victuals for my day's work; I gave her some supper, and spent the half-crown and 3 s. more with her; I drank more than I ought, the more to my shame be it spoken, and I begged to lie down, and the old man, the prosecutor, said to me, here, take this watch; he wanted to have connexion with me; I have an uncle, a man of property at South Lambeth, so he thought to make a property of me; I was not guilty of it; by all account, he does not care what he does for money.</p>

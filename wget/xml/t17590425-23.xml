            . I went to the Custom-house on the eleventh of this month to receive 3 l. I took it in three half guineas, one moidore, and eighteen pence. As I was coming home I call'd in at Mrs King's, at the Blackamore's head in Brooks-Market, there I saw the soldier at the bar, and had two or three pots of beer with him.

               <p>Q. What pocket was your money put into?</p>
               <p>Mayo. It was put into my right-hand breeches pocket. I had pull'd it out again to pay in Holbourn, and the man could not charge it; so I put it in my pocket again. He said be sure, and clapp'd his hand into my pocket, and pull'd it out (my Lord, he robb'd me as sure as ever you are there).</p>

               <p>Q. Where was you when he ran away from you ?</p>

            . The prosecutor is my uncle, he resides in the country; he came up to receive some money at the Custom-house, which he receives yearly. It is a donation left him. He had been there, and came home to my house about half an hour after seven at night, as nigh as I can well remember. I saw him a little in liquor; I said to him, I am sorry to see you in liquor, for you are hardly capable to take care of yourself in a dark night, when sober, your infirmity is such. (He had the palsey, and was lame on one side.) He said it is something worse than that, for I have been robb'd by a soldier that I met with at Mrs King's, at the Blackamore's Head in Brooks-Market. I went to her house, and ask'd her, where she saw the prosecutor? She said, he had been at her house with a soldier; and also told me where to find the soldier, and his name. She said, he had about him a moidore and three half guineas, which she desir'd he would leave with her, but he did not leave it. From thence I went to the Turk's-Head, Holbourn, and inquired, if a soldier and a lame old man had been there together? The people said there had. I asked them, if they knew whose regiment he belong'd to? they said to Colonel Thomas's company in the Tower. I went to the Tower, and ask'd if

             was there? they said no; he was out all night. I found where he work'd, which was in Trinity Minories; I made the best of my way there, and found he was drinking at the sign of the sieve, very fuddled. I took him before the justice, but he was so fuddled that he could not utter a word without a deal of blasphemy. The landlord said he came to his house in a hackney coach, and he paid the coachman 2 s. for carrying him. That justice being a good deal indisposed, he ordered me to carry the prisoner to justice Fielding, which I did; he was search'd, and only 4 s. and four pennyworth of half pence were found upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr Potter. Yesterday fortnight about ten o'clock the soldier came in with a coachman to my house, he ask'd the coachman to drink a little hot; he said, he had rather drink a pint of beer. He paid him some money for the coach-hire.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Potter. I live at the Sieve in the Little-Minories; the prisoner presently call'd for change for half a guinea; but I did not see the half-guinea. He came the next morning with two or three people with him, about nine or ten o'clock; they had four twelve-penny full-pots of hot; the prisoner paid for three of them; and at the drinking the last pot, this last evidence came in and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prosecutor say any thing ?</p>
               <p>Potter. Yes, I heard him say it was the prisoner that robb'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he robb'd him of?</p>
               <p>Potter. He said of three half-guineas and a moidore.</p>

The prosecutor produced his money; I took and told it over; there were three half-guineas and a moidore; then I wrapp'd it up in two papers, and saw him put it into his pocket.</p>

            . I keep the Turk's-Head, Holborne; the prosecutor and prisoner came together into my house, I believe about six o'clock in the evening; they wanted change for half a guinea; I did not see the money; the prisoner said to the other, You need not change your money, I'll pay for the pot of beer; I said I'll draw you no more liquor; the soldier gave me six-pence, and I gave him three-pence out of it; they were both in liquor.

               <p>Astrop. She came in along with the soldier; I think he call'd her aunt or cousin; as soon as she had drank she went away.</p>

               <p>I am a smith; I came to take a forge, and went to buy tools to set myself up; I went in at Mrs King's, where I have us'd for several years; I was a little elevated in liquor; I was singing a song, and the prosecutor would force himself into company; I said to him, Sir, you are a little in liquor, I don't want to drink with you. He set himself down, and then we drank together. Then seeing him in liquor, I said I would see him safe home. We went from there to the Turk's-head; it rain'd hard. There he went to pay for the beer, and my landlord would not change; so I paid for it. I said I would not dilly-dally for no body in the wet, if you'll have a coach I'll go with you; I went out to call a coach; in the mean time he went out; when I return'd I found he was gone; I went out to see after him, but saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did not you at the time he took your money tell any body of it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not; I told him of it several times, and he said he would see me safe home.</p>

            : Sometime previous to the 17th of November, I discovered at several times, sugar taken out of hogsheads; I had reason to suppose it must be done by some of the labourers employed in the warehouses; at half after four o'clock, on Thursday, the 17th of November, I had left off work in the coffee-warehouse, the Excise-officers were gone; it getting a little dark, I thought it a good opportunity to see if I could discover any body; I went up into the upper story of the warehouse, there is a hole into the lower stories of the warehouse, by which I might discover if any body was among the sugar, for nobody had any business there at that time; I waited ten minutes, at the expiration of that time, I heard somebody as if in the act of climbing up out of the lower warehouse, I waited, and after a minute, or thereabouts, I perceived it was the prisoner, who had been at work in the day among the coffee; when he came up to me, and I saw who it was, I asked him what he was doing there, knowing he had no business there, he said, he was looking for a few hoop sticks to take home to light his fire, and hoped there was no harm in it; I told him he could not think I could believe what he said was true, that he must be after something else; he said it was true, he was after nothing else, nor had he ever taken any thing out of the warehouse; I desired him to walk down stairs, I followed him close out of that warehouse into the next warehouse, on the same floor, and there I found some other of the men who had finished their work, and just shutting the door, I thought it a good opportunity to search him, I called him back, and asked him what he had got, he came back, and said, I was welcome to search him, for he had got nothing; I felt on each side, where I thought his pockets were, then I felt behind, and then before, and under his smock frock before, between his things; I found this bag of sugar under his frock, he then began to beg for mercy, and hoped I would pardon him, he never had done any thing before, and hoped I would excuse him; I told him I could not do it, and in consequence of it, had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there any sugar in the warehouse where you stopped me? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any sugar in the way leading to it? - A. The way he might come there was sugar scattered.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see me in the sugar-warehouse? - A. The sugar-warehouse was locked up.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are these persons answerable for the goods stowed in the warehouse? - A. Yes; if any are missing, they are obliged to pay for them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the sugar on this man? - A. Yes; I was going to leave work, it was nigh five o'clock; I went to the garret, this man passed me by the middling loop hole, I saw nothing upon him; Marshall came after him, and said, come back, let me search you, the prisoner came back, and said, you may search me, you are very welcome, for I have got nothing about me; Mr. Marshall searched his pockets and found nothing; he searched him in the front, and under his smock-frock he found a bag of sugar, fastened some how round his middle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been working that day in the warehouse, till three in the afternoon; Mr. Marshall then ordered me to go down to the wharf, where we landed some whale-bone, the master ordered us to the warehouse; going to the warehouse, I stopped to make water, and found this bag of sugar lying by the post where I stopped, I took it up and carried it to the warehouse, they were loading some rice, I asked if they wanted any assistance, they said, no; I went to get some hoop-sticks; as I found this sugar in the street, I was going to take it home, I thought I had a right to it; I saw Mr. Marshall in the warehouse; he asked me what I was doing, I said I was getting some hoop-sticks; he called me, and said he must search me, I said he was very welcome, as I had no property belonging to him, as I conceived the sugar I found was my own property.</p>

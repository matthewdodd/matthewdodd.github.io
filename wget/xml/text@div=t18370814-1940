                  </hi>. I live in the Wenlock-road, and am an assistant in the Baths. The prosecutor complained to me about losing his handkerchief—I went after the prisoner—he had been in the bath—he had got as far as the Eagle Tavern, when I came up and followed him till I saw a police man, and he took him—he found this handkerchief in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day? - A. As near as possible half past four; before I went into the house, there was a tall man, about five feet ten inches hight, just by the door; he went this way and that way, and would not let me get me past; the prisoner was behind me, and seemed to push me on; I observed them, but did not conceive they had any intention to do any thing at that time; I got into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you observed the prisoner at that time? - A. Yes, I did observe him and another; I went into the shop, and got a bank note for the country bank bill.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it? - A. Twenty pounds; I put it into a leather pocket-book in my waistcoat pocket, with my coat open.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any other bank notes? - A. One more, that I got at Mr. Hoare's, in Birchin-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did it belong to? - A. They were both the property of Mr. Stanton; I was going to pay money to another banker for Mr. Stanton, to take up a bill of his that was due; when I came out again, and was going towards Gracechurch-street, the same people that jostled me before came and shoved me against the wall, and they frightened me; I thought they had a design to rob me; I was going to cross Gracechurch-street, just close to the church.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do? - A. They shoved me against the wall; I said, "what, do you mean to rob me?" and in two minutes the book was taken out of my pocket; I caught hold of one of them, I believe it was the tall one, but I was so frightened then I could hardly tell; he got away from me; I cried out that they had robbed me, stop thief; they ran away and knocked down a woman, I followed them, and this man ran as fast as the other; I was nearst to the tall man, but being old and seeble could not catch him; the young gentleman in the banking-house laid hold of this one and caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that young gentleman's name? - A. Woodward.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; are you sure he was one of those that hustled you? - A. Yes, he was one of those that hustled me, and pushed me against the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he one of those that saw you go into the banker's? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was behind you when you went into the banker's? - A. He was; when I got to the door, that same young gentleman and I went in together; we took the prisoner into custody, and gave him to the patrole, who has since hung himself in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You speak very positively to the face of the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150072"></xptr>Q. This was half past four o'clock? - A. Near abouts.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not day-light? - A. It was not dark.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think it was, when the sun sets at five minutes before four? - A. It was not; I have no money to employ counsel.</p>
               <p>Court. That makes no difference.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. It is my duty to take care of the prisoner - I ask you whether it was not dusk at that time? - A. It was not dark, it is always dusk at that time of the year.</p>

               <p>Q. It is always dusk at that time of the year? - A. It is sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then was it dusk or not at that time? - A. No; I could see every face.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dusk or not, then? - A. It was not sun-shine, I don't know what you call dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as light as it is now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You wear spectacles? - A. Only when I read or write.</p>
               <p>Q. This person, which you took to be the prisoner at the Brown-bear, was behind you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you an opportunity of seeing this person before you went to the banker's? - A. Not a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first came out, where did you first see the person whom you thought to be the prisoner? - A. Near the church.</p>
               <p>Q. That is some way from the banker's? - A. It is two or three doors.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. It is about five doors.</p>
               <p>Q. The person, whoever he was, that was taken into custody, escaped from the patrol and constable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till the 28th of January that you saw the prisoner at the bar? - A. No; I saw him the first time after at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that you should not know the man if you were to see him again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the man before you got to Bow-street, and did not know him? - A. I was in at Carpmeal's, my back was towards the door, and Mr. Woodward, the gentleman who took the prisoner, was there, some people came to the door, and I never turned my back; as soon as they were gone, he said, "What business has that man at liberty?"</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not Woodward say, that man in the brown coat is the man? - A. He said, how came that man at liberty? I said, what man? he said, that is he; I did not see any one, my back was to him, there was no window in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether the prisoner did not say, that you held such a conversation with Woodward, and you denied it before the Magistrate? - A. No, I did not; because; as soon as he came into the Brown bear, I said, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. At Bow-street, did you not deny, that you had any such conversation with Woodward? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not told that you saw him, and did not know him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that he did not say to you, that was the man in the brown coat? - A. He said,"what business has that man at liberty."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you told Woodward you did not see him? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. That you will swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Woodward, when he said, that was the prisoner at Carpmeal's, that you did not see him? - A. I am not certain; this I am clear of, that I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say so to Woodward? - A. I am not sure that I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether you did not say at Bow-street, that you did not see him at the Brown Bear? - A. The Justice asked him what he had to say, he said,"I never saw the man in my life; he said directly, "you wear spectcles," how could he say so if he never saw me?</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who said so? - A. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I ask you, how near he was to you at Carpmeal's? - A. Just as much as he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he closer then he is now? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that he was half the distance from you he is now? - A. I cannot tell the distance from here to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. You can judge by your eye-do you mean to say he was a quarter of the distance from you that he is now? - A. I cannot tell whether he was half or quarter of that distance, or not; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether when I came into Carpmeal's, he was not sitting behind the door close up to the table; Woodward said, that is the man I had in charge; Mr. Hyatt never gave charge of me; I went into the house twenty days after he gave charge of me; I came into the room, and as soon as I saw Woodward, I knew him, because he was with me an hour, the same night of the robbery; he said, "that was the man in the brown coat, that is the man they call lkey Bull, how is it that man is at liberty?"</p>
               <p>Witness. I did not see you at Carpmeal's my back was towards the door.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Hyatt). You said the young gentleman went into the banking-house with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150073"></xptr>Q. Then you came out with him? - A. No; I came out first.</p>
               <p>Woodward. It was so, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Woodward). How long after Hyatt came out, did you come out? - A. About two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see Hyatt, after you came out? - A. The corner of Fenchurch-street, at the top, towards Gracechurch-street, in the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see of him then? - A. He appeared to be expostulating with two men; one was the prisoner at the bar, the same side of the way with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner at the bar was one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing to them? - A. I cannot he clear; in about half a minute, he said, stop thief, immediately both the men took to their heels; I stopped the prisoner at the bar, whom I secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the person you secured was the prisoner? - A. Yes; because I had him in my custody, with a candle, about half an hour, in Lombard-street, where hair-powder certificates are delivered out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man that was expostulating with Hyatt? - A. There were other people on the pavement; he ran away immediately, and cried out, for God's sake, stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with him after you took him to this house? - A. I waited with him for an hour; I was told it would be better to deliver him to the constable and patrole, which I did, who has been so unfortunate as to make away with himself since; I caught hold of him, and am positive it was the same man; he got away from the constable and patrole afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him afterwards at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after? - A. I am not positive, but I was so long with him that night by the light of the candle, that I am positive he is the same person I secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner at the bar was the man standing on the pavement with a number of other people? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor was in the middle of the street close by another by another man? - A. I observed him alone.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man was on the opposite side of the way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say at this time, you recollect his person, because he was in a shop with a candle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was it not dusk? - A. Yes; and to be more particular of that, I have enquired of Mr. Hankey's clerks since, and they said it was dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, unless you had seen him with candle, you would not have spoken so positively to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When this man was taken up, you went to Carpmeal's with Hyatt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner brought into Carpmeal's, while you were there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is Carpmeal's house? - A. The corner of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He was close to you? - A. As near as I am to these books.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between Hyatt and you when the prisoner was brought in? - A. I remarked to Hyatt, I was surprized the prisoner was at liberty.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the prisoner to you at the time of this remark? - A. As near as those books; I cannot swear, because I did not notice.</p>
               <p>Q. But as nigh as you can guess, he was as near as those books? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Hyatt's answer to that remark? - A. He enquired "Which?" ( I don't recollect whether he said, "which is the prisoner"? or"which?").</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any answer when he asked you that? - A. I don't remember that I made any answer.</p>
               <p>Q. But the prisoner was as near as you state? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing about the coloured coat the prisoner had on at Carpmeal's house? - A. I don't remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he could avoid seeing him at that time? - A. No, truly I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prosecutor stay there? - A. A good while; I think Hyatt was standing by the fire-place, with his arm upon the mantle-piece, exactly in this way; I believe I was standing as this may be, (describing it); and the prisoner as near as those books; but my face was near the chimney glass.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was Hyatt's face or back to him? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I don't know whether you heard, before the Magistrate, Hyatt deny having any such conversation with you? - A. I declare I think Hyatt denied having any such conversation.</p>

On the day that the robbery was committed, about five o'clock in the evening, I was sent for to the office where they take out licences for hair-powder, there was the prisoner, and the last witness, Woodward, and he gave me charge of the person he saw concerned in the robbery in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man he gave you charge of? - A. Yes, I am sure of that; I was conveying him from thence to the Poultry Compter, and as we came nere Walbrook, he broke from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150074"></xptr>my arm and ran away, and I never saw any thing of him till the 28th of January, at the Police-office, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. The person you searched, you did not find any thing upon, no Bank-notes? - A. I found eight duplicates, and returned them to him at the Police-office, at Bow-street; I searched him to his shirt.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am as innocent as the child unborn; I was coming up from Billingsgate, and going towards the corner of Fenchurch-street, I saw Hyatt quarrelling with some men in the road, I stood on the pavement, I saw them fighting; when the men run away, he cried stop thief; I said, stop him, stop him; a person caught hold of me; I said, you are wrong, I am not the man; he kept me for an hour, and waited for a man to take charge of me; I was searched and nothing found upon me; the patrol would not take charge, and let me go about my business, he said it was only suspicion, and he went home, and threatened several times to make away with himself; I heard this morning that the bill was thrown out, and I have no witnesses here now.</p>

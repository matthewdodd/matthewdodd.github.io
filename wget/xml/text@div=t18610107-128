                  </hi>. I am a district visitor, at 22, Kennington-place, Westminster—on the 12th December, about five o'clock in the evening, I was passing along Marsham-street, when I met the two prisoners and another boy, and another young woman—the boys were in front and the female prisoner was behind—the male prisoner struck me in the left chest, and the other boy pushed me and I fell down—I got up again and caught hold of the boy that had the books—I had a parcel of books under my arm, and the boy not in custody took the books from under my arm—I got them back again, when the female prisoner came and caught hold of my neck<lb></lb>tie, pulled it off, and struck me several times in the face, and the boy got away from me—the books fell out of the parcel, some I picked up myself, and a little child about six years old picked up the remainder and gave to me—I had a full opportunity of seeing the prisoners—I am quite positive of Fleet—all four of them ran away—I ran after them and caught Richardson in Bennett's-yard, Marsham-street—a struggle ensued, and Fleet and the other two came to her rescue—they caught hold of me but two men coming out of a gateway in the yard, they made off, and left Richardson with me—I detained her till a policeman came up and gave her in custody—I had a slight knowledge of Fleet and Richardson, by visiting round that district—I knew them by sight—the value of the books is 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Richardson. Q.</hi> Was I not coming along with another, young woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, behind Fleet and the other boy who is not in custody—you were not pushed at all by the two who were in front of you—as soon as you saw I had got hold of the boy not in custody, you came and caught hold of my collar and my throat—you would not have fallen down if you had not done so—I felt your blows very much next day.</p>

I took Richardson in custody on 12th December—about a quarter of an hour before the robbery, I saw four of them together, Richardson, and Fleet, and two more—when I took Richardson she said she knew nothing about it, it was "Ginger" that took the books from Mr. Wheatley—Fleet goes by that name.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 272). I saw Fleet on the evening of the 12th December, with another lad—he ran away and I took him on the following morning in his bed, at a lodging-house in St Ann' s-street; Westminster—I told him I wanted him for stealing some books—that was one charge—there were two charges against him—he said he knew nothing about the book affair.</p>

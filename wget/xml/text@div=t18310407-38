On the morning of the 21st of March, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner taking some dust from the back area into the street; he had to come up the kitchen stairs - there was another man with the prisoner; I saw the boots hanging on a nail on the top of the kitchen stairs while they were there - when the prisoner had got out the last basket or the last but one I missed them; I inquired of the servants about them, but could get no information - I then followed the prisoner and the other man to the top of Dover-street; I asked them about them - they said they had not seen them - the prisoner said, "when I described them, that he had seen them on the Monday before, but not that day, and if they were in his cart they had tumbled into his basket in coming up stairs; I saw the Policeman - he brought them and the cart back to our door; when we got there the prisoner took the tail-board out of the cart, and the boots laid there - both the soles were plainly to he seen; they were laying one upon the other, and the upper leather appeared to have been doubled underneath - they are my master's property.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 21st of March, in consequence of information, I went to the prosecutor's house - I saw these boots taken out of the cart, when the tail-board was taken down - they were folded up, and appeared as if they had been placed in between the dust and the tail-board, among some leaves.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were a great many sticks and rubbish in the basket, and the sticks might have taken them off the hook; I know not how they got in unless they did so.</p>

               <p>22nd March, about 7 p.m., a woman came into my shop and asked me to give her a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as her husband had returned from work too late for her to get a post-office order—I obliged her with a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in exchange for four sovereigns, as she wished to remit the money into the country—I thought she was a customer—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on Friday, 20th March, I received my pass-book, with cheques, from the bankers—the crossing on the cheque has been erased, and the "4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." altered into "40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "and "10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the prisoner is the woman—I gave a description of her to the police the same day—I was sent for on the 17th July to the police-station, and went there at about 11. 40 at night—I did not identify the woman at first; I told the sergeant I was not certain as to her—while I was speaking to him I recognised a peculiar expression of her countenance, as if she had been relieved from anxiety, and similar to that she had when in my shop; I was then certain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My daughter and the shopwoman were in the shop when the woman called—I do not know about their having an equal opportunity of seeing her—when I saw her at the station she was alone—she was called out of the room adjoining the hall and stood before me—I presume it was after I saw her that she was discharged from the police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—I remember the night when the woman came and had the cheque from my father; I saw her in the shop—she was there about ten minutes—she bought a loaf besides getting the cheque—on 17th July, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the Bethnal Green police-station with Mr. Bishop, a friend of ours—three women were shown to us; I looked at them and selected one, and the prisoner is the one I selected—she is the woman, to the best of my recollection, who was in the shop and got the cheque from my father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The same day, after I had seen the prisoner, I said I would rather not be certain about her until my father had seen her.</p>

I was present on 17th July when Ellen Pringle was at the station—the prisoner was placed with two other women before her—she looked at them and picked out the prisoner without any hesitation—she was taken before a Magistrate, when Miss Pringle became very nervous, and said she would rather not have anything further to do with it until her father returned—in consequence, the prisoner was kept at the station till the father came—I was not present then—I believe he failed to identify her, and she was discharged—she was re-apprehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I apprehended her the first time in her own house at Cold Harbour Lane—about a fortnight elapsed between her discharge and re-apprehension.</p>

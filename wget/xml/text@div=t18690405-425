                  </hi>. I am a miller, and live at Devonshire Street, Lisson Grove—about 1 o'clock in the morning, I was in Commercial Road, Lime-house, and two men came up to me—the prisoner is one of them; I swear to him—I was perfectly sober—one brushed on one side of me, and the other on the other—I said, "What are you at?"—they both laid hold of my collar—I walked five or six yards and asked them to desist, but they did not—they turned my face from Limehouse Church, held me about half a minute, and I heard something snap—I looked down, and saw my watch-guard hanging down, and saw both their hands working in front of me together—they loosed me directly, and one ran away—I caught hold of the prisoner, and called "Police!"—one of them could have handed it to the other—I gave the prisoner in charge without losing sight of him—he never was ten yards from me, and except for a moment I never loosed him till the constable came up—I have not seen my watch since.</p>

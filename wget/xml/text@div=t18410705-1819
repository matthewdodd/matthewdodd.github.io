                  </hi>. I am a foreman of the tobacco warehouse, London Docks. At a quarter before three o'clock, on the 17th of June, I was walking round the back gangway of the warehouse, which had about 12,000 hogsheads of tobacco in it—I saw a cask of tobacco lying on the ground, turned over, the head had been forced out—I saw a quantity of tobacco had been taken from it—on looking over a cask, I saw the prisoner stooping down—I went towards him—his trowsers were down, and some tobacco was sticking out of them—I was near enough to be certain of that, and there was tobacco lying by his side—I asked what he was doing there—he said, "I am taken very bad, I am come to ease myself"—there were privies two hundred yards off—I said he must come along with me—he pretended to be bad, and began to cry, like—I told him he must come along with me—I wanted to lay hold of him—he jumped over the cask, and ran down the gangway—I lost sight of him—I ordered the warehouse doors to be shut, which was done immediately—that would prevent any one going out—the prisoner had no right there at all.</p>

I have seen the tobacco cask mentioned—it had no right to be opened in the way it was—if it had been opened for a legal purpose it would have been done in a different manner—the top layer of tobacco was gone—it corresponded with the tobacco produced.</p>

I was taken ill, and had occasion to search for a place—the only place I could find was between some hogsheads—when I was coming from there, a person asked what I was doing—I said I was taken bad—he said that would not do, and tried to collar me—I ran, thinking he could indict me for a nuisance—I know nothing about the tobacco, and never handled any.</p>

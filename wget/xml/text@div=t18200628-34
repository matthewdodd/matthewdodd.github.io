On the 7th of August, 1818, I was washing in my own room, and saw the prisoner come down the yard - he appeared as if he wished to enter my room - a carriage stood near the door - there is no thoroughfare in the yard; he said,</p>
               <p>"Am I to go through the carriage?" I told him to go round it. In about two minutes I went out, drew some water, about three yards from the door, and on my return I saw him standing at the back of the carriage, covering something over with his coarse apron, which he had taken off. I said nothing to him. He went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280016"></xptr>up the yard, and in a few minutes the landlady of the public-house called to me - I then missed my time-piece off the chimney-piece of the room I was in - it stood there when I went for the water. I went out and met Brumwell.</p>

            . On the 7th of August, 1818, I saw the prisoner outside the Coach and Horses, public-house door, with a little boy; he said to the boy,</p>
               <p>"Stand there, and I will do it myself." He went right through the public-house, and in about three minutes he came through all in a bustle, with the time-piece in his hand; I saw the best part of it, and knew it was a time-piece, the feet were either brass or gold, and it appeared to be a mahogany case. The public-house leads into the yard where the prosecutrix's house is - her door rather faces the public-house back-door; he was wrapping the timepiece up in an old coarse apron. He came very near to me, ran as hard as he could, and turned up White Lion-street. Soon after that I went into the Coach and Horses, the landlady sent and alarmed Mrs. May, who missed her time-piece. He was not apprehended then - I knew him before. I and the constable went three days and three nights after him, but never could take him - we heard of him several times, and described him, but we did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you not apprehend me when you saw me before - A. I was with a man who was going to pay me some money, he had given me the slip twice, and I did not like to leave him. I told several people which way he went, but they took the wrong road. On the 24th of May I saw him at my door in Grosvenor-row - he came to ask the price of a pair of shoes. I told a man in my shop to keep an eye upon him while I fetched May, but immediately as I left the door he walked away.</p>

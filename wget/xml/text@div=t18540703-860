                  </hi>. I live in Lower Norwood, and am a labourer. On 13th May, about 12 o'clock at night, I was going home to my lodging from the Thurlow Arms—as I went home, I found a noise opposite the Oak Tavern—I saw three or four persons, who were quarrelsome—I did not go to see what was the matter then; I went about two or three minutes afterwards—when I went the prisoner came out from among the crowd—he was stripped</p>

               <p>to his shirt sleeves—he called himself by name, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hanley, I am the man for all the b—y English"—he then struck me a full-handed blow behind the left ear, on the back of the head—I could not see what he did it with—I could not discern whether it was a knife or not; it was some<lb></lb>thing sharp like a knife—it cut me—I felt the blood trickling down my neck—I was then knocked down, by a blow on my head, down to the ground, and I then found myself cut on the shoulder—I was then cut on the side of my head—when the first blow was given me I saw the man who did it—the prisoner is the man—I cannot tell who gave me the other two cuts—the prisoner did not say a word to me before he cut me—I had not offended him in any way before—he came out in this way to me—I did not know him—a great deal of blood came from me—I was afterwards taken to Guy's Hospital, and remained there sixteen days—I was not able to work for some time, and up to this day I feel the effects of it—I was obliged to go to work last week, and I was not able to do it, and I am under the hands of Mr. Sharp—I saw the prisoner about a month after this, at the police court.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the White Horse, Fetter Lane, and am a servant—on Tuesday, 21st May, about 11.30—I was in a public-house, in Dean Street, with the prisoner—we had some words about the French war—I said I did not want his company, and tried to get away from him many times—he wanted to fight me three times—he "went out of the house three times, and wanted me to go out and fight—I did not—at last when I went out he was waiting for me, and as soon as I got out he gave me a blow on</p>

               <p>the chest with his fist—it did not hurt me much—I returned the blow once—a policeman who was standing close by told us to go away—I did so, and the prisoner followed me to King Street, about 20 yards from the public-house, when he came behind me and gave me a back-handed blow with a knife in the chest—I did not see what he had in his hand, but I immediately saw some blood coming down, and found I was stabbed—I had not affronted or annoyed the prisoner at all, except by giving him a blow after he struck me—I went to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Golden Lion, in Dean Street—the prisoner and prosecutor were quarrelling there about 9 o'clock on this night—the prisoner went out several times—when they were both outside, talk<lb></lb>ing to the policeman, the prisoner struck at Jaccard (<hi rend="italic">the prosecutor</hi>) twice—the policeman told Jaccard to go away, which he did—he had not proceeded far before the prisoner followed him, and when in King Street, I saw him strike Jaccard, I can't say where, and he struck him in return with his hand—I could not see anything in the prisoner's hand—the prosecutor called out, "Murder! Police!"—I did not see any blood—the prisoner was very violent—when he was laid hold of he tried to get at Jaccard again, they were quarrelling in the public-house, but it was in a foreign language, and I could not understand them, they were excited.</p>

I was outside the Golden Lion, in Dean Street, on this evening—the prisoner came up to me and complained of somebody—I afterwards saw him come out with the prosecutor, and I saw him strike the prosecutor—I could not see where—about five minutes afterwards I saw him strike him again in King Street—the prosecutor did not return the blow then, I was between them, not till after two blows were given, one outside the public-house, and one in King Street—I got the prisoner away and he went into a restaurant—shortly afterwards the prose<lb></lb>cutor came up and said he was stabbed—I took him to the hospital and another constable took the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had nothing in my hand when I gave him the blow in the face. I did not stab him at all with a knife; he insulted me in the public-house, and said I was a man of no education, because I could not speak English, and because I am a Hollander. He said they were low fellows and were put out of Belgium. That vexed me, and I asked him to go out with me. He would not, and I struck him in the face, and he struck me again, and that was all. I did not strike him with a knife.</p>

On the 21st of March about half past nine in the evening, the prisoner came to the door and drawed a shawl off the line inside of the shop; I told her to walk in, as there was a variety inside; she laid the shawl on an iron bar from under this line, and withdrew from the door; I watched her very close; in about two minutes she came back. I had my back to the door and my head upon my shoulders, so that I could see her; she took the opportunity of taking the shawl away; I suppose she walked off; she had not got above two yards, a man stopped her; I brought her into the shop, she had the shawl under her arm, she wished to pay for it, I refused, She was searched; she had money enough to pay for it.</p>

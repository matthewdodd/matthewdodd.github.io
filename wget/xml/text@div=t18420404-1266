                  </hi>. I am a silk-manufacturer, and live in Princes-street Spitalfields. In 1838, the prisoner applied to me for work, and 31bs. 60z. of warp, 31bs. of shute, and 30 wooden bobbins were delivered to him at different periods—I delivered him the warp on the 14th of March 1838—he ought to have brought it back to me, worked up—he never did so—I never heard more of him, and he could not be found until March last.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday, the 16th of March, I met the prisoner, and took him into custody—I said, "You are wanted for stealing some silk"—he said, "Yes, I have done it, and I am very sorry I have laid myself under the lash of the law."</p>

A man named John Chisholm went to my residence, and by a written order he had received from the prosecutor's brother, William Gandy, who is partner with the prosecutor, obtained my harness, with as much warp through harness and reed, and on my cane-roll, as enabled him (Chisholm) to weave upwards of forty yards of silk, and at the same time he received several empty bobbins from my place, which he also returned to the wan-house; a man named Moles can prove that John Chisholm informed him, when he called upon him, that the work he was then weaving in what I had left in the loom."</p>

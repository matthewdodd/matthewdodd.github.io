            . On the 16th of June I went to the Half-moon and Crown public-house, Bacon-street - I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor, and some other persons - they went to play in the ground, and then returned to the house to dinner; I staid in the ground and saw the prisoner come and take the handkerchief from the coal pocket; I supposed Salmon had sent for it; they returned to the ground in about a quarter of an hour - Salmon said he should put on his handkerchief as it was rather cold; he went to his coat for it and it was gone; I told him what I had seen. The prisoner returned in about two hours, and I then told him I had seen him take it, which he denied. It was a brown handkerchief with blue bars, and a little edge of white.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor sent me to fetch a pot of half-and-half - I staid and dined with them, and then went away - when I returned he said he had lost his handkerchief, which I had not seen.</p>

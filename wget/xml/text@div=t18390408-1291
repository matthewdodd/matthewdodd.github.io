                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 198.) On the 26th of March I was in Tottenham Court-road, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner with another—I watched him, and followed him into University-street—I saw him go up to the door of No. 3, and open the door with something he had in his hand—I waited till he came out with something tied up in a handkerchief—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he threw it down on the pavement, and ran away—I followed, calling "Stop thief"—he was stop<lb></lb>ped by a gentleman in George-street without my losing sight of him—I took him back to the house, No. 3, University-street, which is in the parish of St. Pancras.</p>

I was passing down University-street on the 26th of March, and heard a cry of "Stop thief," and observed the prisoner run<lb></lb>ning away—I am quite sure he is the man—I did not follow him—I was on my way home, and had not got far before I picked up these candle-sticks, about ten yards from where the prisoner passed me.</p>

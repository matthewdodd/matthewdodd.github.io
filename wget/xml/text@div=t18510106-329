                  </hi>. I am a wholesale draper, in Aldersgate-street. I also keep a retail shop—the prisoner came into my employment in February last, as clerk and collector—he generally went out twice a week to collect—be generally made out his own list from the ledger, according to what district of the town he was going to—it was his duty, on his return, to account for all moneys he received from the various parties from whom he had collected it—I always attended to him as soon as he returned, unless I was about anything special—I keep a cash-book (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I generally entered here the sums which he told me he had received—he sometimes entered them himself, nobody else did—he always handed me over the money he had received—I always took the money, whether he or I made the entry—he made no entries in my absence—on 9th Aug. here is an entry of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Belton's account, in my writing—that was entered from the prisoner's report to me, and he handed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the entry is, "9th Aug., to £. Belton, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., posted at folio 162 in ledger"—the "Belton, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is in my writing—the figures "162" I believe are the prisoner's; I am not quite positive whether they are his or mine—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the ledger</hi>) the entry here at folio 162 is mine; "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the credit of Mr. Belton's account"—on the 16th he reported to me the receipt of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is a reference in the cash-book to folio 162 in the ledger; that reference is in the prisoner's writing—the entry in the ledger is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the prisoner's writing—on 19th Aug. there is an entry in the cash-book of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received of Mr. J. Wilson; that is my writing; there is a reference to folio 394 in the ledger, in the prisoner's writing—the entry in the ledger is, "19th Aug., posted folio 33; cash, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," by the prisoner—in Mr. Wilson's account in the ledger, on 25th May, I find an alteration; the original entry was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the "3" has been taken out, and the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left standing—there is an erasure in the pounds column,—this "B., folio 8," refers to the journal from which that entry was made—the journal is the book in which the sales are entered at the time—the greater part of the posting is in the prisoner's writing—this is the journal B (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—the amount of goods there invoiced on 25th May is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that entry is in the prisoner's writing—on 3rd July there is an entry in the ledger to Wilson's account of 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in the prisoner's writing—the original entry was 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; there is an erasure before the 9, where the I was—there is a reference to the journal 557. and in the journal I find "Wilson, 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," in my son Henry Wool<lb></lb>mer's</p>

I missed three three-shilling tokens from the till, on Friday last, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon; I had five, and I lost three; I had seen the till about five minutes previous to missing them. The prisoner was in the habit of coming into the bar, whenever he came; I had known him ever since I lived there, four or five months; he was no relation, a mere customer. I had occasion to leave the bar, and the till was unlocked, and the bar door not shut; he was against the tap-room door when I left the bar; I left it for a few minutes, when I returned, I did not find any body in the bar; I examined the till a few minutes after, and found three of the five tokens were gone; when I perceived the three tokens were gone, the prisoner was with me in the bar; he came in after I had returned to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, you had missed any three-shilling tokens - A. No; I sent for an officer without acquainting him; I had done so. The prisoner went from the bar to the tap-room; he was in the tap-room when the officer came; I mentioned my suspicions to the officer. The officer called the prisoner into the parlour, behind the kitchen, and told him, I suspected he had taken three tokens; he said, he had not. I missed money before, and therefore I put a mark on this money, that I might be able to identify it; I marked this money with a cross on the head, I marked them all in that way. The officer searched him. I had given him no change that day. I was by when he was searched; the officer found three three-shilling tokens.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they marked as you had marked your money in the till - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe them to be your's - A. Yes I did.</p>
               <p>

            Was the mark fresh on them - A. I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you marked yours that day - A. Yes, all on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any other money about him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say - A. He was very much intoxicated at the time, I don't think he hardly knew what he did or said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Is your husband here - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband goes to the till as well as you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was your husband serving in the bar at the time - 
               <persName id="t18150510-63-person642">A. </persName>
            No he was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The prisoner at the bar did not attempt to run away - A. He might have taken them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100040"></xptr>merely to alarm me, leaving my bar so carelessly.</p>
               <p>- HOLT. I was the officer sent for to take this man into custody. In the parlour I challenged him with robbing Mrs. Mitchell of three three-shilling pieces; he was intoxicated, but he knew what he was about; he denied it, I found four three shilling peices, three of which were described by Mrs. Mitchell; I found one shilling besides.</p>


               <p>Q. Mrs. Mitchell's shewed you two that were marked, in your judgment were these three found on the prisoner marked in the same way - A. They were.</p>
               <p>COURT. To Mrs. Mitchell. Do you know what way of business this man is in -

            He is an Excise officer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a currier, of 3, London Street, Dock Head, and work at Blackey and Mowbray's—there is a large number of men in their employ—the prisoner works there—on 27th January he was black<lb></lb>guarding me all day—I took no notice of it, but kept on at my work—when I was having my tea, I could not stand it any longer, and I said "James, what do you mean?" and I touched him—I immediately saw this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) falling down, and I recollect nothing else till I found myself in the hospital—I still feel weak all over, and suffer pain—I just shoved the prisoner against the wall, no further.</p>

               <p>words I heard were the prisoner palling Laming a <hi rend="italic">moocher</hi>—he rote form his seat, went to Scott, and asked him for an explanation, but none was given—Laming held up his fist, bat I do not think he struck him—he asked him why he called him a <hi rend="italic">moocher</hi>, and as Laming was coming away Scott <hi rend="italic">up with</hi> his knife and struck him a blow—he made an aim at him, and Laming held up his arm to protect himself—Scott did not pick up the knife, he had it in his hand—Laming was picked up and taken to the hospital—Scott came in at 6 o'clock, and it asked him if it was anything serious—he said it was only a little nick.</p>

I am in the same employ—they began by chaffing each other, and then they got to words, and the prisoner called him a <hi rend="italic">moocher</hi>—I don't know what that is—Laming rose from his chair and asked him what he meant, and shoved him against the wall—Scott rose the knife, Laming raised his arm, and it struck his arm—this is the knife—it struck him with this part; it was not done in the way to chop any one down, but Scott was intoxicated.

I am junior house surgeon at St. George's Hospital—on 27th January Laming was brought suffering from a cut oh his left fore-arm 3/4 of an inch deep—it divided two or more tendons and, probably, the large artery—there was a good deal of bleeding—in all probability there will be some permanent injury to some of the fingers—this knife would have caused it.</p>

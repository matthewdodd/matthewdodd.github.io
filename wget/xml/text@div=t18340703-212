            . I am an inspector of police. I was on duty - I saw the prosecutor asleep, and Mason was calling him to awake - I placed myself in a situation where I could see what transpired - I saw the seals hanging from the prosecutor's watch fob - I soon after saw Mason leave the prosecutor, and go some distance between the tables and join Jarvis, who was sitting alone smoking his pipe - Mason then went again and sat by the prosecutor - he did so a second time - he then went to him a third time - I then went up and collared him and Jarvis - I took them to the prosecutor, and awoke him up - his seals were gone then - I asked him if he had lost any thing - he said, "No," but he felt, and missed his seals and ribbon - I took the prisoners to the station-house, and in Jarvis's right hand pocket I found the ribbon and seals; and in his small-clothes I found the handkerchief - I went in the morning to the gardens, and under the seat I found the swivel of the watch - there was nothing found on Mason - Jarvis was sitting the length of this Court from the prosecutor - I saw Mason join him three times, and leave him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there other persons in the gardens? A. Yes, smoking their pipes; but not at that place - a person sitting where Janvis was, could see the prosecutor - it was in a straight line, and no one was between them - Jarvis did not attempt to interfere at all - Jarvis said he had been drawn into it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

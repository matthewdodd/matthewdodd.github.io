I have the lower part of the house, which is a separate apartment by itself, the upper part belongs to No. 2. My door only leads to my apartment. On the 22d of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went out, left nobody in the house, and double-locked the door; I returned about twenty minutes before twelve, and found the place broken open - the lock was picked. I lost the articles stated in the indictment, and 2 l. 15 s. in silver. I had left them all in the house when I went out. There was a picklock key left behind, with some pieces of candle and matches - they had all been lit. My own candle had been moved from where I had left it, lit, and put out again.</p>

            . On Monday morning, the 24th of May, I was standing near the turnpike-gate, Great Dover-road, Newington, and saw the prisoners together; Willis was carrying a bag and Leaver a bundle; I went after them; they refused to tell me what it was. I took hold of a bag in Willis's hand, he said it was harness, and he was going to Walworth for a saddle - it did contain harness. On examining the bundle which Leaver had in his hand, I found a blue coat, an apron and a piece of calico; he seemed very much confused, and not giving me a satisfactory answer I collared both, and took them to Union Hall. On Wednesday I apprehended a person named Bolt, who has been discharged. The same day I went to Plumtree-court and got the bundle, went to the prosecutor's house, and he claimed the property - he gave me the pieces of candle and matches which were left in the room.</p>

On Tuesday, the 10th of July, I first saw the prisoner about seven o'clock in the morning, I was looking out of window, and he asked if I would give him any thing to drink; we went and drank together, and remained together till night - we went to several public-houses, the last public-house was the Black Boy, St. Catherine's. I went out and he followed me - I had been drinking freely, but knew what I was about, and what passed; he made a rush at me, took hold of my right-hand pocket and knocked me down, he struck me on the breast and thrust his hand in my pocket - I am sure he is the man; the blow knocked me down. He took a sovereign, two half-crowns, and three shillings, out of my pocket, and ran away. I had taken all my money out just before, to pay for my beer, and put it in again - I do not know whether he saw me or not; he was a gunsmith when I first knew him - I do not know where he lived. I got up and gave an alarm at the public-house, and next night I told Simmons, the patrol, and on the Monday following, I found him in custody at Lambeth-street; he said, he did not think I should go so far in it, and that he meant to have written to his uncle, to get 2 l. or 3 l. to make it up with me. It was my pension money - I received it on the 9th of July, 4 l. 7 s. 4 3/4 d. I am sure he is the man who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not change a sovereign in the morning - A. Yes. I had another still left. I did not say I had only one.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Wednesday evening the prosecutor gave me information. I knew the prisoner, and looked out for him. On Sunday morning I took him, and on the Monday morning I heard him tell the prosecutor he did not think he would have gone so far with it, and he would have written to his uncle to get 2 l. or 3 l. to make it up. He said so directly he saw him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday evening I was sitting at the Black Boy, public-house, this man came and called for a pint of beer, and stopped there drinking till near one o'clock; then went home with a girl. I called him up in the morning, and went round to several public-houses till night. I left him in the house, and did not see him again.</p>

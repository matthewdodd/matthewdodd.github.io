                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Saturday the 8th of June, I was called in to attend Ann Dunn, about two o'clock in the afternoon, she complained of a pain in her head—I did not examine her head at that time—I found her tongue was foul, and the state of the bowels confined—I sent her some medicine, and at one o'clock on Sunday morning I was sent for again—I found her in a state of insensibi<lb></lb>lity, and I applied leeches to the temple—I saw her again about ten o'clock in the morning—she still remained insensible—she died on Thurs<lb></lb>day, the 13th of June—she was insensible till the Wednesday afternoon—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170283"></xptr>
               <p>she was only sensible at intervals that afternoon, when she was roused—after death I examined the body—on the back of the head there were marks of violence—there was a bruise on the whole of the back of the bead, the back of the ears, and the ears them selves—I removed the integu<lb></lb>ments, and found the covering of the skull exhibited the same dark ap<lb></lb>pearances, and there was a partial extravasation of blood—I removed the skull, and there was extravasation of blood at the base of the brain—that was the cause of death—I examined the rest of the body, and there was nothing else to account for death—I judge death arose from the bruise at the back of the head—it was a recent wound—on the Sunday I cut her hair off, and found the head tumified, which proved it was recent—I should judge a blow must have been given within about forty-eight hours of the Sunday morning—I mean the blow which caused death—the effusion of blood on the base of the brain would be caused by such a bruise.</p>

I know the prisoner and his wife Ann Dunn—I lived in the same house with them, No. 10, Charles-street, Horsleydown—they occupied the down-stairs room, and I the up-stairs chamber, immediately above—I have heard quarrels between them—the last quarrel I heard was on Thursday the 6th of June—I heard a scuffle, as if somebody was fighting very desperately, and then a fall, as if somebedy was pushed against a partition—they had no children, and lived alone—I never saw him strike her—this was at seven o'clock in the evening—I had seen her at three o'clock in the afternoon—she seemed very poorly then, and complained of pain in her head—I did not observe whether she complained of any par<lb></lb>ticular part of her head—I never saw her drunk—on the Friday she complained of dreadful pains in the head—I went for the surgeon on the Saturday—I met her about nine o'clock on Friday night—she had then been to the chemist to procure a powder, and she had her head tied up—she had not her head tied up before that—I did not hear any disturbance between her and her husband on the Friday or Saturday.</p>

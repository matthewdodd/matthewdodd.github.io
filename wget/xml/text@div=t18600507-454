                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an Interpreter</hi>), I am a German, and am in the employ of Mr. Goodhart, a sugar baker—On 9th April, I was in Lower Grove-street, between 5 and 6 o'clock in company with Ellen McCarthy—the prisoner and six others, and two girls, came after me—they reeled, and one of them, I don't know which, struck me violently on the breast—the prisoner was one amongst the five or six persons; he pushed up against me and my cap fell off—I stooped to pick up my cap and the prisoner struck me again—that is the man—I had a watch in my waistcoat-pocket and a chain to it, and a silver guard round my neck, and as I was standing up the prisoner snatched at my chain—he did not get the watch, that remained in my pocket—he got the whole chain and ran away—the other persons stopped awhile, and when they found I was running after the prisoner they ran off—I was about five paces from the prisoner while running—I saw him throw away the chain in the street, I picked it up, and he kicked me twice in the face as I was stooping—my chain is worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am certain that the prisoner is the person who snatched it—the others ran away as the policeman came up.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070110"></xptr>
               <p>other persons about besides the five or six who came up afterwards and before there were some persons looking out of windows—that was after the first blow—I asked the prisoner what he wanted with me—I spoke to him as I speak now—he gave me no answer, but snatched at my watch—he got the guard and ran away—at the time the prisoner snatched my watch the others had not done anything—I ran after him about two hundred paces, and he turned round and threw my guard on the ground—there was only myself running after him—as I was in the act of picking up the chain the policeman came up.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far was it before you picked up the chain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two hundred paces—we had had a pot of beer—before the prisoner came up to me I looked round and saw he was coming behind me—I can't say that I had ever seen the others; I don't know them—when the prisoner struck me the others were not then in front of me; they were about ten paces behind me—that was when I was struck the first time—at the time I stooped to pick up my cap, the others were far behind—I was not struck by any other person but the prisoner—at the time the prisoner struck me the other persons were a short distance behind—I was as perfectly sober as I am at present.</p>

On 9th April I was in Grove-street, in company with the last witness—I saw the prisoner and five men and two women in company with him—they had been following us about aquarter of an hour—the prisoner came up before us and staggered against us; another man staggered against us—I said to Jacob, "Cover over the watch"—the prisoner came behind him and hit him—his cap fell off, and he stooped for his cap, and the prisoner made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at the watch and ran away, and the prosecutor ran after him—at the time the prisoner came up and staggered against the prosecutor, the others were close behind—at the time Millner was stooping down, and the chain was seized, and before the prisoner ran away; another man hit him when he was stooping for his cap—the other man hit him, and the prisoner made a snatch at his watch—I have known the prisoner four or five years by sight; but not by name—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who seized the watch-chain—I knew him when he was a shoe-black—I knew the faces of several of the other five men.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you a pint of beer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not a drop—I had some the first thing in the morning in the house—the prosecutor came to my house at half-past 3 o'clock—we had no beer then—not a pot of beer to my knowledge in the house—I am not occasionally drunk without knowing it—I may have drank the beer without knowing it—I did not say anything to those two girls, nor to the prisoner—they had been following us a quarter of an hour—in that quarter of an hour we got over about a quarter of a mile—I knew the prisoner and most of them before—I did not turn to speak to them; we crossed to avoid them—I knew the prisoner was with bad charactera—I said nothing to him, I never opened my lips—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner come out aud strike Millner—I did not try to collar the prisoner because one of the women pulled my bonnet and shawl off just before—it was not the same bonnet that I have on now, it was a yellow one—I did nothing to the prisoner, I ran after him—I did not run as fast as Jacob—there was a general scuffle—one man stood before me to prevent my running after the prisoner.</p>

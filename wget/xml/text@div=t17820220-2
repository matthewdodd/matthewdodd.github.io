               <p>I had been in town for my master, Mr. Dawson, the wax chandler, Craven-hill; as I was going along, I saw these two men on horseback order the post boy to stop; about half way between Tyburn turnpike and Bayswater, about just dark then, they bid the post boy stop; the gentleman in the chaise bid him go on, and then they went close to him and stopt him, at the time of the robbery I heard somebody talk, I was on foot; I stopped a few minutes, I made a little way to the people talking, and told them there was a chaise stopt; before we got up to the chaise, the gentleman was robbed, these people were on foot; as soon as they had robbed the gentleman, they turned back, and went as swift as the horses could go towards Acton; when they passed by me, one said to the other, damn your eyes mind your fire. I was going home to my master's, just by Bayswater; it was not light enough, I could see partly the colour of the horses, they went so swift I could see nothing farther, I think they were of a bay colour; I was not five minutes before I got to Bayswater; when I came opposite the public house, I saw a light in the road, and the landlord and three or four people were standing round the horse that was thrown down, he was not quite dead, but he never got up any more, I could not see how the horse was hurt; they were talking of the force he came down with, I said that is the horse of one of the persons that robbed the gentleman on top of the hill; there was no other horse passed me at the time, I am sure of that; there is a house betwixt, but no other horse passed backward or forward; I mentioned it to the landlord of the public house, she said let us go and fetch him back, they had let him go off, I did not go up, but the landlord and Mr. Evans went up and fetched him back, I went with them to Mr. Morant's house.</p>

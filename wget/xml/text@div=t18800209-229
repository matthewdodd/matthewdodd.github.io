                  </hi>. I am a clothier, at 138, Salmon's Lane, Limehouse—on the 22nd January, about 1.30, the prisoner brought this bill to my shop: "January 22,1880. Sir,—Having just shipped the bearer, will you kindly supply him with a few articles of clothing, but not to exceed two pounds' worth.—Yours, Mr. James Collins, Captain of the Juan, of Exeter, lying in the Regent's Canal I send bill by the bearer, John Harris. I will call by 2 o'clock and settle it myself." I did not know the captain referred to nor the prisoner—I sorted goods out to the value of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner left the shop—I believed it to be <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>, signed by the captain of the Juan—a little after 6 p.m. the prisoner called again—he asked me if I had seen the captain—I replied "No"—he said he had seen him half an hour pre<lb></lb>viously, and he had given him half a crown and sent him down for the goods—I asked him where the captain was, and he said he had gone on board again, and he agreed to go with me down to see the captain—he went with me to the Regent's Canal Dock, Limehouse—he there pointed out a ship to me lying in the middle of the stream—I asked him why he did not try to make him hear—he said he had been humbugged quite enough, and then remained there in some silence—seeing that I could not get on board I returned home—the prisoner followed me—in the Commercial Road he said "It is no use carrying this on further; there is no such a ship, there is no such a captain; I have done this with the idea of getting a few togs, which I thought you would let me have," and I told him I thought I ought to give him into custody—he said he had written the bill himself—he fol<lb></lb>lowed me to my shop and stood outside—I told him I could not have him standing there—he said "If you won't give me the goods give me the half-crown which I paid you as a deposit"—he had not paid half a crown—as he would not go away I gave him into custody.</p>

I went to bed myself; I always go to bed at ten o'clock. When he found I went to bed, Macdonald went up himself, and brought his friend down to breakfast with my wife; they ordered a neck of mutton to be made into broth for dinner. I got up some time before dinner, and dined; the farmer complained again of his head, and begged to go to bed again till his head was better; he asked, whether it was one or two pair of stairs; my wife said to the girl, Go up, and shew the gentleman where he lay last night; she went up and put the bed to rights; she came down, and left him there; Macdonald was up and down very often with him; in that time they picked my door and my bureau, and took the money away; that was the fifteenth; I did not miss it till the day following; there was about 200 l. I can't swear to the exact sum; the bureau was in my bed chamber; I found the door and bureau locked as I left it; so it must have been picked and locked again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen your money the day they came there?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I saw it the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any body lodged in your house at the time?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, only my wife, a servant and child. I went to Sir

            , and had it advertised. In about a fortnight's time Sir John sent me word Macdonald was taken, and in Hertford gaol, and bade me go down. I went; he was committed for another fact there.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. You was tried last assize there I believe?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Hughes. When I came to him I said, Have you any money? he said, No, I have not a farthing. I said, What have you spent my two hundred pounds? he said, There was not quite two hundred of it. He said, Go over to the jailor, and I will satisfy you in every thing in writing; I went over; in the interim there were some friends came to him, and advised him to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you tell with certainty how long it was after the supposed robbery that you found yourself to be robbed?</p>
               <p>Hughes. The next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some company dined with you on the 16th?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No; I miss'd it in the forenoon before dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body dine with you on the 16th?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you see this money?</p>
               <p>Hughes. The 14th, I suppose; I opened my bureau every day; I saw it every day.</p>

               <p>Hughes. Because I did not see it: I go up to that bureau sometimes eight or ten times a day for change.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to miss it. Did you go up to give change?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What change?</p>
               <p>Hughes. For a twenty-seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure that was on the 16th?</p>

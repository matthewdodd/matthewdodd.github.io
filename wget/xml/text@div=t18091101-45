               <p>- WALKER. I am a watch cap maker, I live at 39, Noble-street. On last Tuesday week, between eight and nine in the evening I was in Drury Lane; Mr. Squirrel the prosecutor, the prisoner and I were standing hearing a song, and while the woman was singing, Squirrel asked me to go and have something to drink, he asked the prisoner at the same time. I had never seen Squirrel or the prisoner before; we all walked on to Fleet-street; Mr. Squirrel took us to a house up a court, near Fetter-Lane, I do not know the sign, we went in the tap-room, had two pots of beer, sixpenny worth of gin and water, and four pipes of tobacco; Mr. Squirrel paid the reckoning. We all went away from that public house about a quarter after eleven; then we went into another public house in Chancery Lane, we had two glasses of gin each of us at the bar; we then crossed Holborn, and went to the Lamb, in Lamb's Conduit-street; we had a pot of beer there and half a pint of gin between four of us, it was about 12 o'clock when we got to the Lamb, we staid about half an hour there, from there we went towards Russel-Square, the prisoner asked the watchman the way to Somerstown. I said in the first part of the evening, I would see Mr. Squirrel, whom I understood to be a doctor home, he said he lived in Somer's-town. We crossed <placeName id="t18091101-45-crimeloc263">Tavistock-Square</placeName>

Mr. Squirrel said you are joking, after treating you in the evening. I said do not rob him, I want to see you home father. The prisoner struck Squirrel with a stick, when he demanded his money, and he threw the stick into the Duke of Bedford's nursery; Squirrel put his hand into his pocket, and gave him two half crowns and a sixpence. I saw that it was moon light as bright as day; he had the change at the Lamb. After the prisoner had got the money, he ran away, and I was alarmed; I went away, I followed the prisoner, he ran away, and I ran away; Mr. Squirrel followed us both, the prisoner was stopped as he was running, and I stopped by another watchman on the other side of the road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. I believe you are under bail, and were charged as a party in that robbery. - A. Yes.</p>

I am a watchman to the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010030"></xptr>new buildings near where this happened; I has about thirty yards from them, I was at the Bedford nursery to the right and they were to the left; I saw two or three persons passing, I heard the prisoner say, your life or your money,</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner said these words. - A. I heard somebody say, your life or your money; I then drew near, the old gentleman said, no, no, as you have had the pleasure of drinking all the evening with me, you would hardly do so by me. I saw one of the men rush a stick out of his hand, and he struck him over his hat, he hauled out his money, and gave it to the man. I did not see what money he had in his hand when the money was given, both these young men turned back and ran away together as hard as they could, and the old gentleman ran after them, I said are you robbed, he said you, and he would follow them if they killed him; as soon as I could blow my pistol off, I blew it in the air, and shouted out, stop thief, the patrol stopped him in Russell-Square.</p>

            . I am a patrol, on this Tuesday night I was in Russell-Square, near half past twelve, it was very near the corner of Russell-Square, near Woburn Place, Hoskins came and asked me what Square that was, I told him Russell-Square. I said where do you want to go to, Squirrel answered to Somer's-town. I pointed down Woborn Place, I said, keep strait on there, that is the street road, the prisoner said, I know my way; in about twenty minutes after that, I heard the voice of a man say, follow them, stop them, and I heard the report of a pistol, it was very light, I could see the men run towards me, I saw the prisoner Hoskins. I stood in the middle of the road with my stick in my hand, Hoskins made a strong push to go by me, I catched him by the collar, I said if he offered to move I would cleave him to the ground, he answered, I have not a farthing of money about me, it is not me, the other lad crossed the road, another watchman was there, I said, lay hold of him, he did, Mr. Squirrel and the watchman came up, Squirrel pointed to the prisoner in his face while I held him, and said, that is the man that robbed me, I took him to the watch-house, they were searched, nothing was found on them. The prosecutor was called, and not appearing in Court, his recognizance was ordered to be estreated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday evening I was returning home from my work, when I came to Drury-Lane, I stopped to hear a song sung, Mr. Squirrel was talking with Walker. Squirrel asked me if I would go to Covent-Garden Theatre, he asked that young man at the same time; I declined going because his intention was to kick up a row in the house, he said if there should be an harm come of it he would give us bail, he insisted upon our going to have something to drink with him. We went into Fleet-Street, he called for gin and beer, he paid for it in Chancery-Lane, we had two glasses each of us, we went to the Lamb, in Lamb's Conduit-street, there we had more gin and beer; what happened afterwards I cannot tell, I was entirely intoxicated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

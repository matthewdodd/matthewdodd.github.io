About 10 o'clock on the evening of the 13th of June, Mr. Sims came to the station, and gave information of the robbery—I went out and made inquiry, and ascertained that two boys had been seen with canvass bags—I went to Ashby's house, knocked, and after some time they came down and opened the door—there was no light—I entered the room, and heard the window drawn back—I stepped back, and the prisoner Ashby was in the act of getting out of the first-floor window—I procured a light, went up stain, and found he had escaped—I went out into the street, and met Sutton in his trowsers and shirt—I took him into custody, and took him to the station—his father accompanied me there, and asked his son what he had been doing—he said, "It was not me, it was <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> took the things, and handed them over the wall to me, and I carried them to Ackerman's new beer shop"—I went there, and got a bag containing two petticoats—I saw Vincent there, who I took with me—he gave me information, and I went back again and found two more petticoats under a bench in Ackerman's shop—about four o'clock, I went to Maddox's house—a little after four o'clock in the morning I saw Ashby at the end of a passage—I went in pursuit of him, and found him concealed behind a water-butt there—I took him into custody, and told him the charge—he said distress made him do it, and that he had frequently been without food—I am not quite certain he</p>

             thus depos'd. On Sunday the 27th of Feb. about Noon, I came into George's-Coffee-House, in Devereux-Court, and saw Mr. Brograve standing by the Fire with his Cloak on, which I took Notice of to him, it being a remarkable warm Day; he told me that he had lately been very ill. We sat down at a Table together, and talked of indifferent Things When we had sat about half an Hour, the Deceas'd came in and said something at the Bar, upon which the Prisoner said Here! and presently steps to the Deceas'd, and they went out together. The Prisoner frequented that Coffee-House. I have seen him there often. - I did not perceive that he had any Pistol about him, nor that he sent any Body out upon a Message.

             thus depos'd. I am Servant at George's Coffee-House. A Gentleman whom I never (to my knowledge) saw before, came up to our Bar, in a Red Cloak, and asked for Mr. Brograve, who answer'd Here; and got up directly. And one of 'em (I think was the Stranger) said, I have got a Coach at the Door, and so they went into a Hackney Coach. - I saw no Coach at the Door, before the strange Gentleman came. The Prisoner did not send any Body out upon any Message. - He frequents our House.

Then each of 'em took off his Hat and Wig, and held out a Pistol. - Says the Prisoner, Fire. No (says the Deceas'd) do you fire first - You ought to do that, says the Prisoner. - Well then, say, the Deceas'd, let as fire both at once, and so they did, and both mist, then they drew their Swords. The Deceas'd run toward the Prisoner, who parry'd off his Sword, and pusht at him. They closed, struggled together, the Deceas'd fell backward, and the Prisoner upon him; the Prisoner then took away the Deceas'd's Sword, and they both got up, but the Deceas'd stagger'd, and fell down again. The Prisoner call'd me to him, and said to the Deceas'd. Speak, who was in the Fault? Will ye forgive me? - Pray forgive me. But the Deceas'd could make no Answer; the Prisoner desir'd me to call a Coach, but I was Weak, and could not run nor call aloud His Sword was bloody, and crooked. He wiped it on the Grass, and streighten'd it, and then waved his Hat for a Coach at Hyde-Park Corner. A Coach came, he put on his Cloak, his Wig. and Hat, and pray. says he, take care of the Gentleman, and I'll send a Surgeon immediately, and by this Time, another Gentleman's Servant was come to us.

             thus depos'd. I heard two Pistols go off, and looking about, I saw one Gentleman standing still, and the other making up to him. - The Prisoner beckon'd me to come up, which I did; he told me there was an unfortunate Gentleman, and desir'd me to take care of him. - But the Gentleman died immediately. Mr. Rand the Surgeon depos'd. That both Ventricles of the Heart were penetrated. The Entrance was made betwixt the Fourth and Fifth Rib, that the Wound was Mortal, and the Occasion of his Death. The Prisoner thus made his Defence. The Deceas'd call'd on me at the Coffee-House, and said he wanted to talk with me about a little Business, that he had receiv'd from a Person that I had some concern with. He said, he had got a Coach ready, and we both went in. When we came to Charing-Cross, he fell in a violent Passion, and told me, that I had acted like a Rascal and a Scoundrel; In what? Says I. Why, says he, in setting me to work about this pitiful business, in which there's nothing to be got, and employing another Gentleman in your Affairs of great Consequence; and beside you have injur'd my Character in another Affair and by G - I'll have satisfaction, and then shew'd me two Pistols which he had brought with him. - I endeavour'd in vain to pacify him, and he swore if I offer'd to stir from him, he'd shoot me. Some Notice has been taken of my wearing a Cloak on a warm Day, as if it was with a Design to conceal my Pistols, or to favour my Escape. But I only wore it to prevent catching Cold, for I had been ill for a Fortnight before. as I can prove. Nor was my being at the Coffee-House the Consequence of any Assignation . But, it being a House that I frequented, the Deceas'd might think it a likely Place to find me. Dr. Wasey, and an Apothecary depos'd. That the Prisoner confirm'd what the Prisoner said of his Illness.

The Deceas'd was my Master, and about Eleven a Clock in the Morning, of the Day that he was kill'd, he order'd me to carry this large pair of Pistols to his Chamber, which I did. These Pistols were proved to be the same which the Prisoner and the Deceas'd made Use of in the Park. Mr. Mallory thus depos'd. On the Evening of the same Day, in which the Deceas'd was kill'd, I went to search among his Papers, for a Challenge. - And there I found a Powder Horn, with a Charge lying by it.

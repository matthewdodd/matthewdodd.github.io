                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Pennington, the owners of Neckinger Mills. The Greenwich railway runs through their premises—on the 3rd of May, between four and five o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, my attention was drawn to a donkey-cart, standing not far from the gate, on the side of the arch, on the premises of the railway—I saw the prisoners, Maloney and Langham, in a hurried manner, throwing iron into the donkey cart—I stood some time and saw them loading it—Adams was standing at the top, watching to see if any body saw them—they looked at me at the time—I stood some minutes looking at them—when the cart was loaded, Adams came down and assisted in shoving the donkey off with the cart—all three gave a heave to shove the cart into the road—I followed them, and when I had got a little distance the cart stopped, and they appeared to be throwing something over the cart—an old basket and cloth was thrown over the iron—in consequence of this I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to Crook to follow and watch them—Langham returned after some time, and I gave him into custody.</p>

I do not live on the premises—there was not at that time any one belonging to me on the premises on Saturday and Sunday nights, there is now—I remember Saturday evening, 30th April—I left early, and between that and the Monday morning I found the premises had been broken open, and property to a frightful amount was lost—I made it known, and sent information to the offices—on the Friday I received a letter.</p>

Friday morning.—We have been out all night. <hi rend="italic">"Be quiet, or it will be blown.</hi>"—In consequence of this I put a paper in my window with "Yes" on it—it remained there about three hours—I put it in between 11 and 12 o'clock, and it remained there till between 2 and 3—between 4 and 5 o'clock I received this second letter by post (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)" Sir,—If the sum named (in gold or two notes) is made into a small parcel, and placed under a flagstone over a gutter in St. James's-park, at 9 to night, and I find all right, I will call upon you in half an hour at your shop to communicate; but, in doing so, all about me must remain a secret, or I shall be blown.

I should prefer seeing you personally, and meeting you fairly, if you write again.—Yours, truly, W. Burchett."—I deposited this letter myself in the place marked in the plan—I did so exactly at 9 o'clock, the time appointed—I then walked up towards Regent-street, and then returned—I saw the prisoner at the time I placed the letter there—he was sitting on the seat—I was about the neighbourhood for two or three hours—when I came back the prisoner was still there, sometimes sitting there, sometimes walking about—in fact, he spoke to the detective officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Royal William public-house, at Ball's Pond. The prisoner was my pot-boy three or four months—on the 23rd of July I marked some silver in my till—the prisoner was in the habit of coming behind the counter to clean it—after he had cleaned it, on the 23rd of July, I missed one marked shilling—on the 24th I marked some more shillings—there is a partition which separates the bar and the parlour—I looked through a hole in the partition, which 1 had made on the 24th, and saw the prisoner, when he was left alone, open the till, put his hand in</p>

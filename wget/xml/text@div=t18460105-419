I am the son of Richard Thompson Fur<lb></lb>ness, of No. 40, New Church-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone—it is my father's dwelling-house—he lives in it, and pays the rent—no other person lives in it—we keep a shop—I remember on the 29th of Dec. I left the house a little before two o'clock in the afternoon—when I left, the window was shut down, and all was safe—I came back in about half an hour and found one pane in the window was cut—I missed about eighteen cigars and cheroots which had been in a bundle in the window—I have seen some pieces of cigars produced—it is like those I lost.</p>

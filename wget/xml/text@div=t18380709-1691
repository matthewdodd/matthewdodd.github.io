                  </hi>. I am the wife of Cornelias Caquey, and live at No. 9, Bond's-place, in the parish of Marylebone. The landlord does not live in the house—we occupy the back parlour on the ground floor—the prisoner lodged with me in the same room—my husband has been in Ireland about two months—the prisoner has lodged with me since Christmas, and before that—he slept in the same room—there are two beds in the room—I and another woman, named Drewry, slept in one bed, and he in the other—I kept my money locked up in a box in the room—about eight o'clock in the morning of the 25th of June, I went out—the prisoner went out before me—Drewry went out with me—my box contained 21 shillings and nalf a sovereign in a purse—it belonged to Drewry, who gave it me to put into my box to take care of—we both returned at twelve o'clock to dinner—there was a catch on the window, which I had fastened—I had locked the door—I found it still locked, but the window opened, the catch turned back, and the money gone—the prisoner lodged with me before my husband went to</p>

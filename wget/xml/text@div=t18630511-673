                  </hi>. I am a superannuated officer of the Civil Service, and have a pension—I live at Southampton—on 15th April, about 5 o'clock, I went into the Silver Cross, Charing-cross, to have a glass of ale—I was tired, and a friend or two had promised to meet me there—I waited, and the pri<lb></lb>soner and four other soldiers were standing close to me—they said, "We are poor soldier <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>, and have not much money to spare; you do not mind giving us a treat," and I stood several treats—I do not mind treating soldiers, but I drank very little—I spent about a crown—they kept very close to me—I took out some sovereigns, and from my right-hand pocket, looking for some silver, and the prisoner turned round to the left side, threw his left arm round my neck, with his thumb in my throat, his head against me, and put his right hand in my trousers' pocket, where my money was—the other four closed up, so that I could not get away—he took his hand out, and passed it round to the hands of the others—I took him by the collar and said, "You ruffian, you have robbed me"—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—we had a scuffle, and he broke away and ran out immediately—I ran after him, kept him in sight, and caught him under the arches of the Horse Guards—he said, "Let me go, Sir, and I will give you all the money I have about me"—I said, "You have got the wrong man this time; you will go with me, but you will not go from me"—there was a struggle, and he broke away again through the archway into the parade-ground—I am sorry to say that I have lost an arm, or I would have kept him firm—I thought it was a duty not to allow a man to rob me with Her Majesty's uniform on.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in Court during the opening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am aware that I have thought of a good many things since I was before the Magistrate; I only wish the depositions were taken more clearly and perfectly, and then there would not be occasion for a second question—I have not been in a public-house to-day—my deposition was read over to me before I signed it—I went into the public-house close upon 5 o'clock, and not as early as half-past 3 or 4 o'clock—this is my signature to my deposition—I might have called at the public-house before I went into the pay office—I did not go in to have a glass of ale early, and then went to draw my money, and then went to the public-house again—that is a very different thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When I asked you what time you went into the public-house you said about 5 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I thought you meant when the robbery happened—the prisoner and the soldiers were not there at half-past 3; they did not appear till 6—I only had a glass of bitter ale, and then went over to the pay-office, and received 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then went back to</p>

               <p>the same public-house, and remained there three or four hours treating the soldiers—I did not take out the whole of the money, I took out 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in another pocket, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in another—the soldiers all saw the money when I was looking for a shilling to pay for the beer—the prisoner was there then—I paid for the first lot of beer about a quarter past 5—I did not say that the soldiers came in at 6; I said between 5 and 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whatever the time was, was the prisoner present when you pulled out the sovereigns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I only pulled them out several times—I paid as I went on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you pay the first time with a shilling, or get change for a half-sovereign? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I got change for a sovereign, and the next time I wanted to pay I took out the whole 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid three, four, or five times—I did not drink; I only tasted, and did not take above a wine-glass full at a time—the total that I drank might make a pint—I did not go from there to Nat Langham's, or any other public-house—I remained at the Silver Cross from 5 o'clock till the robbery took place, close upon half-past 9—I had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket then—I would not risk saying I had been robbed of too much; I thought it might invalidate my testimony, so I swear to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. only—I did not tell the soldiers that the corporal had robbed me—I accused no soldier before I accused the prisoner—I did not go in a cab to Nat Langham's or any public-house and treat soldiers and give them money—I did not ask the prisoner if he had leave of absence, and tell him he could go home with me—I live eighty miles away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 616). On 15th April, about a quarter to 10 o'clock, I was on duty in Trafalgar-square, near the fountains, and saw the prosecutor scuffling with some one—there was a large crowd round them—just as I got up the soldier broke away, and ran down to the Horse Guards, where the prosecutor caught him again, and had another scuffle—just as I got up the soldier broke away again, and bolted through the Horse Guards into the Parade—I spoke to the prosecutor, and the prisoner ran on for a yard or two, and then stopped, and was talking to another soldier of the same regiment—the prosecutor went up to him, and said, "This is the man who has robbed me"—both the soldiers said that they would give him a thrashing if he did not go back—the other soldier said, "Here, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, you had better be off to barracks before you get yourself into a bother"—I then took the prisoner to the station—I had not taken hold of him before that—he went quietly; but when he got there he got out of my arms, and struck the prosecutor a severe blow in the eye, which caused it to be black for a fortnight—the charge of robbing the prosecutor of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was read over to him; he made no reply—3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were found on him, and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—he did not hear him say anything about <hi rend="italic">Nat</hi> Langham's or a cab, or the prose<lb></lb>cutor's charging a corporal—the prosecutor was sober; the prisoner was rather the worse for drink.</p>

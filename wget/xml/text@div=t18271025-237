On the 24th of October, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came in, and asked to see some ribbons; Upton showed her some; I saw her take a piece out with her left hand, and put it under her shawl; she then said, "None of these will do;" he then showed her another drawer; she said none of them would do; she then said she had been there that afternoon, and laid out 15s., which I knew was false; she was going out, and when she had got about half a yard from the counter, I told her to leave the ribbon which she had got; it then dropped from her on the floor; she had a child with her; a man came in at that moment, and asked me for some stockings; I said, "I will show you some in a minute;" she said to the child, "We must look after your father, my boy;" and ran out of the shop; I was going out after her, and the man who had come in, gave me a knock on the head, and knocked me down; he then passed me, and ran up Plumbtree-court after her, and as he ran up there he struck a woman, and cut her lip.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you attend last Session? A. Yes, but I was too late. I do not know whether they were committed by the Magistrate, or admitted to bail. Patrick was in a court, but I do not know what he was doing; I did not push against him, nor did he complain that I had done so; I did not take out my book, and say I was an officer, and that was my charge book, and I would make an entry of their having attempted to rob me, and pull them up the next day. I told them I would give them in charge; I might say it was my inventory book: they did not take me by the collar for the purpose of giving me in charge, for assaulting them; it was I who first called Watch! I charged them with the assault, but not with an attempt to rob. I was not drunk. I swear I did not assault either of them till they took hold of my collar.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 20th of April, about one o'clock in the morning. I was going my rounds, and heard the call of Watch! I went to the spot with Cox, and found the prisoners in contact with the prosecutor; Patrick had his hand on him, and the prosecutor's hat was in the gutter; he said,</p>
               <p>"Watchmen, take these two men into custody;" we took them to the watch-house; they were not quite sober: when they got there they said that Winstandly had assaulted them, but they did not say how - he rebutted the charge.</p>
               <p>PATRICK'S Defence. We had been to a friend's, to see the process of pipe making - it was near one o'clock before we left there: my friend stopped in Grub-street; I was going on, and passed the prosecutor; he said,</p>
               <p>"Who are you? and what are you?" I replied,</p>
               <p>"Who are you" - I passed on, and when I got on the opposite side of the way, he followed, and called me a vagabond and scoundrel; I asked what he meant - he said he meant what he said, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is my charge book," and struck me with it in the month; he made my lip bleed: my friend then came up, and pushed him from me; the watchmen were called, and they came up; Cox, the watchman, said,</p>
               <p>"I will take that gentleman's charge in preference to your's." There were two gentlemen who saw the transaction, and I asked them to go to the watch-house, but the constable of the night would not admit them, and took the charge against us. I said the prosecutor was drunk - the watch-house-keeper said it was no matter whether he was drunk or sober, he had given the charge, and he must take it; we had then no recourse but to publish handbills; in consequence of which those gentlemen came forward to take our parts.</p>

            . I am a gold and silver wire-drawer. I was in Grub-street at the time of this disturbance. In consequence of seeing the hand-bills I came forward to state what I knew. I heard Patrick say,</p>
               <p>"Who are you, Sir," and the prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"I will let you know who I am" - he thrust his charge book (as he called it) into his face. I did not see any attempt made by either of the prisoners to take his book, till he pulled it out of his pocket; Dickenson then came up, took hold of the prosecutor, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by that?" at which time both parties called for the watch; there was nothing then said about any attempt to rob him: they were taken to the watch-house; I and another witness went there, but were refused admittance. The prisoners were strangers to me.</p>

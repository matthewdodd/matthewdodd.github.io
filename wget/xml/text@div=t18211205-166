I did not go to the vessel again till the 25th of October, and found him and the things gone. I found him at Soderberg's house, in New Gravel-lane; it is a lodging house for sailors; Anderson was living there with him. I asked Saunders where my chest was; he said it was in the house, but I could not have it, for the master of the house was at Gravesend. I said if he would be there next day I would come for them; he said he would. I went next day, and he was out; I saw Ander- who said my chest was safe, in the room, but the master and mistress were out, and I could not have it. I met Saunders in Ratcliff highway; he said the person of the house was out, and had got the key; I took him to the office, and went with Morant to search the house, and found Anderson, and asked her for the key; she said she had not got it; but we insisted on having it; and, after a good deal of hesitation; she produced it from her pocket; she was in the front room, ground floor; the key opened the back room. I found my trunk there, the locks forced, and the articles stated in the indictment, gone, and a quantity of other things. My night-cap and tooth-pick were found in Anderson's pocket, with a parcel of duplicates.</p>

I found a tooth-pick, and a night-cap on Anderson, with R. Manners at full length on it; also some duplicates. On the 29th, I apprehended Sodeberg and his wife at the office, where they came. In a cupboard, in the back parlour, I found a pair of sheets a pillow-case, nineteen waistcoats, three pair of drawers, ten pair and a half of hose, five pair of stockings, two shirts and a towel; and, on the front parlour floor, I found a pair of sheets, and two waistcoats, and four pair of stockings. I found a quantity of property at Mount's, the pawnbrokers, and four sheets at Kernall's. Anderson said she pawned part of them. I found the cot up stairs, between the sacking of a bed; and the blankets were in use on different beds.</p>

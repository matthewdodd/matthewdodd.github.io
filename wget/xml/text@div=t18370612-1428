                  </hi>. I live in Selby-street, Waterloo Town, and am a tailor. In February, I recollect giving my niece, Elizabeth Churchman, a blue bag, containing a black waistcoat, and jacket, to Mr. Freeman, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon—she returned about five o'clock without them, and her apron was gone—she was led home by a person, quite insensible—I gave information of the robbery—she gave me a description which corresponded with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, my father's name is John Churchman, he is a baker. The prosecutor gave me a bag to take to Mr. Freeman's—I was in Whitechapel, and the prisoner came up to me and said, "Little girl, what is your name?"—I said, "Elizabeth Churchman"—she said "I knew you when you were three or four years old," and said, "I am going to your mother's. I will take you with me to my sister's, and then I will take you home and go and see your mother"—she said, "Come along with me three doors from the butcher's, that is my aunt's, I will go home and get my mother's basket, and put your things into it, and put a doll on the top of it"—I said "I cannot go, my uncle's work is wanted"—she took it out of my hand and looked at it, and did not give it me again—she said, "Oh, it is four o'clock on it, and we shall be back before that a good deal"—she said, "Where those petticoats are hanging out is my house, if you will stay three doors</p>

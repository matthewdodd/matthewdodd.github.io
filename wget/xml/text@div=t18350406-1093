                  </hi>. I live at Montpelier-vale, Blackheath, and am in partnership with my father-in-law. The prisoner was in our employ—on the evening of the 13th of March, I marked some trusses of hay—I saw the same trusses safe on the morning of the 14th, which was Saturday—I concealed myself in the stable, and about seven o'clock the prisoner came into the stable, fed his horses, and then sat down on a truss of straw—some time afterwards, a man, whom I could not see, came to the door, and the prisoner said, "Come along, I just want one dram this morning"—he asked, the man if he had a handkerchief—he said he had, and he could have a little bit that morning—he went to the manger, but whether he took any thing or not I cannot say—the prisoner said he had not got much that morning, for his mistress had been peeping through that b—y hole—they then went away—I went for an officer, but could not find one—I went home, and the officer came some minutes after—I said nothing to the prisoner that morning, but he went through his work as usual—in the evening I went to the stable to see that every thing was safe, and missed two trusses of hay; but one of them I had ordered him to take to a cus<lb></lb>tomer—I went and got a search-warrant—we then went to Mrs. Loft's, where I found the truss of hay I had missed, with a stick in it, which I had put—I had directed him to take a truss to Mrs. Bevis', but not to Mrs. Loft's—it was his duty to sell hay; but when he did, he was to bring me the money for the hay so sold—he sold hay to different people—after he was in custody, he said he had trusted Mrs. Loft for four trusses of hay—I had not had the money.</p>

The pillow was in the house the beginning of June, when we went into the country; I know the bolster by a particular mark at the end, which I know was on one of our bolsters; it has been cut, and sewed up again; the pillow is like the bolster.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Barfoot. There was nobody left in the house, but the key was left with Mrs. Povis's servant, Goodwin, we got assistance, three servants of a gentleman just by, we went into the kitchen, and found the area door burst open, and the lock wrenched and double, every place was open in the house, then we came down again and fastened the door with holes, we went out of the street door and pulled it to, I could tell nothing of what was gone; I found it open when I came on my walk, about a quarter before nine; I never saw the house open before, only that night I found it open, I put my arm in between the door and door cheek.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of December, the watchman came to our house, Mr. Berkley's a quarter before eleven, and asked, if I had been to Mr. Bramstone's house, he (the watchman) told me it had been broke open; I had the key, I went in, not of the street door, there was no key-hole to the street door, but the area stairs door had been broke open.</p>
               <p>To M'Donald. Did that key open the door near the area gates? - No; but the street over, it opened it on the inside, not the outside.</p>
               <p>Cartwright. The middle part of the door was broke, so that a person might get through; I found up stairs, closets and presses, and drawers open, and some trifling things in it scattered about; I had been there ten days before Christmas, and nobody had been to inspect the house after that till the robbery; I missed a bed and several things; I know nothing to affect the prisoner, with breaking in, or taking any thing; this key that was produced opened the door.</p>

            , went to a house in Albemarle-street.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose house that was? - I don't recollect the name, I know it if I heard it; it is the upper end of Albemarle-street, the chain was round the iron area door, that was unlocked by Knowles, he had pick-lock keys, he unlocked it, there was a door he broke open, we were all employed in breaking open the door, there was another door belonging to the kitchen, they could not get in at that door, and they broke a middle part over the door, and lifted Best in, who opened the door within side, this was about seven in the evening, then we all went into the house; in the one pair of stairs, we took away window and bed curtains, and covers of chairs, I cannot tell the number; in the two pair of stairs back room, we took a bed, bolster, and pillows, nobody was in the house but us; Knowles took the bed, and he took this key which belonged to the street door, May took the bolster and pillows, we all came out of the street door; we went by one day in the day-time afterwards; I don't know the value, they were sold to one Mrs. Harris, that lives in Grub-street, for seven guineas, that money was divided amongst us all.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I was three years and seven months upon the hulks, it was the first time.</p>
               <p>How soon did you take to this course? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How many days might it be? - It might be November or December.</p>
               <p>Not begin directly? - No; I had two guineas and a half to spend, Mr. Campbell gave me; I worked at my business a little, at a glass maker's; I have not been tried here above once or twice.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell really? - Am I obliged to tell it.</p>
               <p>Tell the truth if you can? - I was never cast but once; I was tried upon another wrong affair; I was took up in Park-street for this robbery, in the middle of the street, I was seen coming out of a house, I thought it the best way to give evidence when I was taken up and my life in danger. May, Knowles, and Munday, and Best there, and myself.</p>
               <p>This was just three weeks after you came out? - It was a week after Christmas; none of the property was found upon me; about three weeks or a month after the robbery was committed I was taken up; I never gave no information before this, I cannot guess how many robberies I have been concerned in during the three weeks, I believe but three or four, which I am to appear to.</p>
               <p>You understand you cannot be tried for this? - If I make my evidence good I think I am safe.</p>
               <p>You understand by swearing against those men, your life is safe? - Yes, surely.</p>
               <p>You don't mean to begin again? - No; not to go any more.</p>
               <p>Jury to Hart. Was that bolster and pillow sold to Mrs. Hart? - No; May had them; I don't know what became of the coverlid, Knowles said he would take the bed to himself, which he did; May took the bolster and pillows, there was no money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200034"></xptr> or value distributed for them, they were carried to his lodgings by himself; Knowles took the key of the door with him, it was in the lock within side; as soon as the robbery was committed, we went to Harris's, I went the next morning to his lodgings, and saw them at May's.</p>
               <p>How came you not to have money for it? - We did not care for the trouble of carrying them, he said he would take them home, we said he might take them to himself if he would, I swear I did not carry them there.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of January I went with M'Donald to Knowles's lodgings; we took him out of bed, and searched the places round about, upon the cupboard on the stairs we found this key, with several others; Knowles said it was his cupboard and his keys; he owned it at the justice's; on the 12th of January, we went to May's lodgings, and found a bolster and a couple of pillows; we took him to the rotation office in Litchfield-street; Mr. Bramstone's servant came and owned them.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I am a runner at the office; he was not at home, as his wife said; I don't know how often Hart has been tried.</p>
               <p>KNOWLES's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, in regard of this key, it was taken out of the cupboard upon the staircase, at the lodging-house where I live, it was taken out a fortnight before Christmas; the landlord where I live kept an old iron shop, and sold old keys, and things of that sort, when I went to live with him, but he dying, there came a gentleman to live in the house, who turned it into a coal shed, and part of this man's property was then thrown about the house, and those keys thrown into the cupboard; as to this Hart that has said this, I know no more of him than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>MAY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am brought here to answer to a crime that man has alledged against me, which I know no more of than the child unborn; the bolster and pillows, taken from my house, were sent me after I was married, I have been married four years, and have two children; I have witnesses to satisfy you the bolster and pillows were sent out of Lincolnshire, with a bed from my father-in-law's, as a present, with several other things at the time; I have witnesses to prove the identity of them, and their coming out of the country, with regard to the property; I totally deny knowing any thing of the man who has swore this robbery to us to clear himself and his confederates, but I declare to you before the face of the Court and Almighty God in Heaven, I know no more of what I am accused of than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner May.</p>

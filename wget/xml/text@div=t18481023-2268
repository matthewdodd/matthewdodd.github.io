On Friday evening, 8th Sept., I was on board the <hi rend="italic">London Pride</hi>, just by the fore-sponson on the larboard side—I saw the woman, and saw her lift up the rail of the sponson—I cautioned her about lifting it up, and she made no reply—I had never seen her before—I do not know who she was—I shut the rail down—I afterwards found it open again, and the woman was standing before it, with the girl—I shut it down a second time, walked forward, and just as I got forward I heard a cry of "A man overboard!"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier. On the evening of 8th Sept. I was a passenger on board the <hi rend="italic">London Pride</hi>—I sat on the right-hand side, at the head of the boat—just as we got by Paul's Pier, I heard the captain call out that a woman had jumped overboard with a child in her arms—I jumped on board a barge that was alongside, and saw something floating on the water, but, being very nearly dark, I could not tell what it was at the time—a waterman made towards it, caught hold of it, and held it, until with assistance, it was got out of the water—I assisted in getting her on shore, and it turned out to be the prisoner—I assisted her towards the station-house—the first words she spoke were, "What has become of my child?"—I said I sup<lb></lb>posed the child was all right, but that I was unable to inform her—she said it was excessive grief that had caused her to do what she had done, she was in great trouble—she also asked for some drink, and said she was very thirsty—I did not take any particular notice of her on board the boat—there were about fifty people on board.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. How many times have you been examined on this subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only once—that was before the Magistrate—I believe what the prisoner said was that she was in very great trouble, or words to that effect, and sbe repeatedly inquired after her child—it was so dark at the time that I could not discern one person from another—she said, "I am in very great trouble; what has become of my child?"—I told her I supposed her child was all right, or would be—she repeated the same words several times on the way to the station, and said it was trouble had caused it—I believe those are very nearly the same words—I do not recollect the words she used any better now than I did when I was before the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>, "She clasped her hands and asked what had become of her child—I was not then aware whether the, child was found or not—she repeat<lb></lb>edly thanked me for what assistance I had rendered her, and said she was in great trouble, and inquired repeatedly about the child")—that is correct—I am quite confident she did not say anything more than what is put down there—what the captain cried out was that a woman was overboard—there is a trifling difference between that and "jumped overboard."</p>

               <p>a few minutes after—we waited there a minute or two, then left Hungerford, and went down the river for London-bridge—when we got opposite Mr. Lyon's granary, a little below Paul's Wharf, I was on the larboard paddle-box and my attention was directed towards the head of the boat—I saw a female with a child sitting on a chair close to the larboard fore-sponson—I thick the child was on her knee—I cannot say how old it was, but I should think about five years—I cannot say whether it was a boy or girl—I cannot say whether the prisoner is the woman—about a minute or two after I had observed them, I heard something go <hi rend="italic">flop</hi> into the water—it might have been more than two minutes after I had seen the woman and child that I missed them, and I heard some of the passengers say, "A female overboard!"—I saw something in the water outside the paddle-box, apparently a female—I stopped the boat as soon as I found out what it was, and had the engines reversed immediately—I saw a boat at a little distance ahead—I called out, "Sculler!" and Bryce came immediately—I did not see the woman taken out, it was too dark—we went on to Paul's Wharf Pier—the tide was running up, against us.</p>

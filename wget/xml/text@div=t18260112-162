            . I saw the prisoner on the 6th of January, in the bell-founder's in the Curtain-road, about four o'clock. I went there in consequence of some information - as my master has lost two or three bells lately - the prisoner had a bell in his hand, which was broken - I looked at it, and it was Mr. Trott's; I asked him where he had got it - he said he had been at work for Mr. Trott that day, and the first load of dust he loaded, his mate let it fall and broke it - and he came up there to make the best of it; he said Mr. Trott was going to stop him 12s. for it; he staid a few minutes, the woman weighed the bell, and said she would give him 6s. 6d. for it; he then put it under his arm and walked away; the bell had Mr. Trott's name on it.</p>

I ran down to the bell-founder's to see what I could do with it; the woman would not give me money enough for it and I took it away. <rs id="t18260112-162-verdict913" type="verdictDescription">

On the 7th of June I took it from the box and gave it to Brown, the officer - I saw the prisoner again, on Saturday, the 7th of June (both days were Saturday,) about seven or eight o'clock - I saw him in the tap-room again, he called for a pint of beer - my wife served him - he offered another shilling - as soon as he threw it on the table, I said it was a bad one. My wife took it up, and said it was a good one - I ordered her to give it to me, which she did - I knew the prisoner to be the man who had given me the bad one before, when he came in - I sent for a constable, who took him into custody, and I gave him both the shillings.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to his Majesty's Mint - I have been so a great number of years. I have examined the shillings; they are both counterfeit - they are alike in all respects, both cast from a mould which was made from a genuine shilling; there are marks about the shillings which show they have been made from the same mould - there is a particular defect in the figure 8.</p>

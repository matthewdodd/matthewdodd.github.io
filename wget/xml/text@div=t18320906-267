I cannot say that the prisoner was ever at my house; my wife who, is the principal witness, is confined to her bed; these things were missed from my parlour about four o'clock - I had seen them half an hour before.</p>
               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I am an officer. On Saturday afternoon, the 14th of July, about half-past four o'clock, I was in Princes-street, Bank, and saw the prisoner with a black bag on his shoulder; another young man, who was close to him, said "Here is Forrester;" the prisoner knew me to be a constable; I let them walk into Coleman-street; the prisoner turned into White Rose-court - I turned in after him - the other then turned back and ran away; I asked the prisoner what he had got there - he said a looking-glass and painting; I asked where he got them - he said a man hired him at Shadwell to carry them to Armstrong, No. 7, Wellington-street, Old-street, and was to give him 1s. 6d.; I found a person named Armstrong in Wellington-street, Goswell-street; he was detained and I afterwards found the prosecutor.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was by Shadwell church; a person was resting there with this property, and asked me where there was a coach-stand - he asked me to carry them, and by the Mansion-house he said, "Do you know the nearest way?" <rs id="t18320906-267-verdict1501" type="verdictDescription">

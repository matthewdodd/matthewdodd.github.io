                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, at Ilford—on the afternoon of 12th December, about 4 o'clock, there was a dispute between me and Charles Spall—the prisoner was present—I told Spall that if he did not leave off I would get up and set him down—I got up to set him down, and as I did so I felt something touch me in my side—I looked behind me and saw the prisoner going backwards to his seat, with a knife in his hand—I went back to sit down in my seat, and found the blood running down my leg—I went out into the garden, undid my clothes, and examined my leg, and found blood flowing from my right buttock—I went back to the shop where I had</p>

               <p>been working when this occurred, and showed the wound to Spall and the prisoner, and all of them in the shop—Spall advised me to go to the doctor, and he told the prisoner he would give him a good hiding—he said, "I saw him thrust the knife at your side, but I did not know that he had stabbed you"—I went over to Mr. Sullivan's, the doctor's—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife—I had had no quarrel with him on that day—I had some time back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy, in the service of Mr. Spall, the shoe-maker—I was in the shop on Thursday, 12th December, between 4 and 5 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and young Spall, and heard some words between Wigg and Spall—the prisoner stabbed Wigg with this knife—he was at work at the time, sitting on his seat—I afterwards saw the wound; there was blood flowing from it very fast.</p>

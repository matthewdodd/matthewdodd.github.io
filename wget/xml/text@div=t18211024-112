On the 24th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I went out and gave the key of the door to the prisoner, who lodged with me, and asked him to get the kettle boiled for tea; my watch was in a drawer - I had left the key in it by mistake. I returned between four and five o'clock, he was in the room, and had tea with me. I missed the watch about five o'clock next night, and told him of it next morning; he said he did not take it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of October I took him in charge, and found a crown piece and four shillings on him; I said I thought it was part of what he had sold or pawned the watch for; he said he knew nothing about it. When he got to the watch-house he said he wanted to speak to Mrs. May. I said I must hear what was said; he said he knew where the watch was. I asked where the duplicate was; he said it was where he worked. He took me to a pile of bricks at the end of Newland-street, Kensington, he moved the bricks and took it out.</p>

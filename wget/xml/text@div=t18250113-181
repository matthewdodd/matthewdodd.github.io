            . I superintend the watch of Kentish-town. On Tuesday, the 14th of December, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was standing at the watch-house gate, at Kentish-town, and saw the prisoner carrying a sack across his shoulder - I crossed over to him, and asked what he had in that sack; he said he had got meat - I asked where he brought it from; he said from his father, who lived at Hendon - I asked if his father kept sheep; he said Yes; he said he was taking it to Tower-street, Seven-dials - I asked where the skin was; he said at his father's - I asked why it had been killed; he said it had been had for two or three days - I let him go, went back, locked up the gates, and then met Davis, who followed him with me to Camden-town, in a chaise-cart, overtook him with the sack, and stopped him - took him into the Britania public-house, and had the meat laid on the table; it was a sheep cut up, and quite warm; it was cut into joints, in a mangled state, not cut as a butcher would cut it - I asked Davis (who is a butcher) in the prisoner's presence, if he thought that sheep was killed in good health, or not; he said he thought it was; it was fat; there was two legs, a saddle, and other joints, cut in a mangled way - I found a knife on him, with blood on it, and it has fat on it now - when I first stopped him, I asked if there was any mark on the skin; he said</p>
               <p>"Yes; a P.;" we got a chaise-cart, and took him to Hendon, to the Swan public-house - I enquired after his father, and found he had left there, about two months, but still there was a person in care of the house; a sheep-skin was produced, about half an hour after - part of the breast was left, on the skin, on the side, and tallied with the rest - the head was also left in the skin, and corresponded - I saw the meat fitted to the skin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I suppose you do not understand much about sheep's flesh? A. No;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130067"></xptr>there were the two fore and two hind legs found in the sack - the breast was to the skin; there were three parts of the carcase in the sack, part of the breast; the head and neck were left in the skin; they made the whole carcase complete.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper of Camden-town. Deykin brought the prisoner to me, about seven or eight o'clock, with the sack, containing meat - I produce the bones of the meat found in the sack, and what was found with the skin - I went to Hendon with the prisoner, to Oldershill, where he said his father lived; he said the sheep belonged to his father - we found his father had left there about two months - on looking about the father's cottage, I found some wool - the prisoner said he had been to his father's that night; we got information, and found the skin laying in a grass-field, near the house, open and wet, and the neck and head left in it - I fitted the meat in the sack, with the skin - it fitted when it was warm - I have no doubt of it being the carcase, belonging to that skin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see a skin fitted before? A. No; this was not a lamb; it was about three years old - I have not seen his father.</p>

            . I live at Hendon. I was coming from Finchley, and my dog found a sheep-skin in the water, in Mr. Eady's field, about half a mile from the prosecutor's farm, on the day the prisoner was taken - Shepherd, the postman, came by, and we pulled it out - the neck, part of the breast, and the head remained in it - it was marked P.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hendon. I know the prisoner, he has been living in London lately - he has not lived at Hendon to my knowledge for some time. I found the sheep skin in Mr. Eady's field - Mr. Parbery rented the after-grass of that field; the head, part of the neck, and breast were attached to the skin - I saw the rest fitted to it; it tallied in my judgment - the lights, liver, heart, and entrails, were found in the skin.</p>

            . I live at Finchley, which joins Hendon. I rented Mr. Eady's after-grass. I had seven sheep, marked P. grazing in his field - there is a brook in it. I received information from the Magistrate on the evening the prisoner was taken, and then missed this sheep. I had seen it safe about ten o'clock the morning before. I examined the skin which was found, it had my mark on it - I took my marking instrument with me, and have no doubt whatever of the skin - part of the breast, the neck, and head were attached to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do the names of any other farmers in the parish begin with the letter P? A. I know one Pope, nobody else. I have seen the prisoner's father here.</p>

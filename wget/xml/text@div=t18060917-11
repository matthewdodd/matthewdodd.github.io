               <p>Bibby. On Tuesday the 12th of August, I was coming along Fenchurch-street, leading into Grace-church-street, I asked the prisoner how he did, he told me very well, I told him I thought he did not look very well, and that he had been transported for seven years, he told me that he had been pardoned and had got a regular discharge, I told him I did not know of that, at any rate I should detain him and take him before the lord mayor, on Wednesday, and if he could satisfy the lord mayor I should be content; he made resistance and told the public that I wanted to press him, that I should be the means of breaking his mother's heart; he

             a knife from his pocket and opened it, he said, cut my bloody head off, I told him no, I should not use him ill, he used many blackguard expressions, in fact, he cut his own hand with the knife, and I believe he would have done me some injury, provided the knife had not been taken out of his hand; there were two gentlemen who assisted, and I procured an officer, and he was examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The words he mentioned I did not make use of; I had a conditional pardon to go on board a ship and serve his Majesty; there were three men that were on board the ship, who had been tried for capital offences, they asked me if I would desert, I told them no, they said they should not hesitate, if I did not go with them immediately they would throw me overboard; when I got on shore it was my determination to get them apprehended, they kept me in the field by day, and marched me by night.</p>

             GOUGH. I am twenty-one years of age. I was living in Cottage-place until about a month ago; I had lived there two years and a half. I know the prisoners; I had known Buttery for about a week before I was taken up; I only knew M'Namara by seeing him pass my door. I went to lodge in Buttery's house; I lived there with a woman named Kitty Humble, about a week before; I was taken up a day or two after I was in my room; I have two children, and was in great distress. Buttery asked me to carry a letter to an attorney, and said he would give me a few shillings for my trouble; I said I would take it - He said it would be doing him a great service; I asked him why Kitty could not go? he said on account of her being Irish; I said I would go - He went with me; I had a child in my arms, he carried it for me; I wished to leave it at home, he said if it was too heavy for me he would carry it: we went as far as the end of St. Paul's Church-yard, by Ludgate-hill, and there met M'Namara; Buttery spoke to him, I do not know what he said; I stood by the side of Buttery; I did not expect to meet M'Namara; he gave Buttery a paper which he took out of his pocket, and Buttery gave it to me; we all three walked on, they walked first; Buttery went to Mr. Maynard's with me, M'Namara waited outside; Buttery took the paper from me, and gave it to him. Mr. Maynard asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030031"></xptr>me if I knew what sum of money it was? I told him I had not seen the paper; I do not recollect his asking me where I lived; he asked me if I knew any thing of Mr. Mann; before I could answer, Buttery said, "I knew him very well, for I shipped him;" we were in the passage, Mr. Maynard went into a room; I do not remember any body telling Mr. Maynard where I lived, but they named the ship that he said he shipped him in, it was the Barkworth East Indiaman; we came out, Mr. Maynard told me to follow him; I turned round and asked Buttery where I was going? he told me to go on, and I should not be detained a moment; Mr. Maynard took me to another gentleman, and gave me a book; the gentleman said something, and told me to kiss the book, which I did; my child cried, so I did not hear what he said; I heard him call over the name of Mann. Buttery went with me as far as Newgate-street. When we came out, we found M'Namara standing across the road; they both went away together, and left me in Newgate-street; they talked together, I do not know what they said. I saw Buttery again about nine o'clock next morning, and asked him how he knew that the man belonging to the money was dead? he said he was sure of it, as M'Namara and him had both visited the India house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass about the money - A. When Mr. Maynard asked what the sum was, Buttery said it was under 20l. Next day we were sitting by the fire; I said"What was the sum? 120l. I understood Mr. Maynard;" he said no, it was about 16 or 17l. I asked him what he did with it? he said him and three more were to share it between them, and said he would give me something for my trouble. My father lived in Middle-row; I never went by the name of

            . I am a solicitor. I first saw the prisoner, M'Namara, on the 1st of November; I saw him again the beginning of the ensuing week at the Compter. In consequence of a message that was sent to me, I went to him, with Mr. Lawford; he said he wanted to speak to us; we agreed to see him at six o'clock that evening. At that time Mr. Lawford, Mr. Adams, Kerridge, and myself, went to him; before M'Namara was suffered to speak a word, I told him that nothing he could say would be of any use to him, that we had a very strong case against him, and it could not be of any possible service to him to disclose any thing to us; but if he wanted to say any thing we were there to hear it. Mr. Lawford told him that what he said would most probably be used in evidence against him; he said he knew that, but it was a duty that he owed, for that he was an honest man until these people drew him into it; I asked him what people? he began with Buttery, who was then in custody, but I do not think he knew it. He said that Buttery and another person were concerned, and gave me directions where to find them. Among other transactions that he mentioned, he said that Buttery had got a woman to go as Ann Wilson to get the wages of a person of the name of Mann, a seaman on board the Barkquit; I asked him if he meant the Barkworth, and he said he did. Two or three days after I took the original will, and some others, to the Compter; I neither threatended nor promissed him; I put the wills before him, and asked him whose hand-writing they were? as I laid them before him, he said the whole of the will of

I saw him again in two or three days; he then said the body of the will was his own hand-writing, but the signature was Buttery's, and that Buttery had given him 10s. to fill it up. I afterwards went and inspected the wills at the Commons, myself, and found reason to disbelieve what he had said. A few days after I received a note from Buttery, and went to him in consequence of it, with Mr. Kerridge. M'Namara was called out first; I told him I had received a note from Buttery, and was going to see him. I then repeated my cautions to M'Namara as I had done before, and asked him if he had any thing further to say? he then threw himself in a chair, and said, "Well, then, I did sign the will." He then left us. Buttery was called out; I read his note to him, and asked him if it was his, he said it was; I told him we had a very strong case against him, and that it was of no use his saying any thing; he said he knew that, but it would be a relief to his mind;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030032"></xptr>he gave me an account of several things; with regard to this will, he said that he had gone to M'Namara, and signed his name to it; that it was too dark to fill the will up, but it was agreed between them, him and M'Namara, that M'Namara should fill it up in the morning, and bring it to St. Paul's Church-yard, and that he and the woman that was called

               <p>EUPHRAM ROBINSON. I live in Chamber-street, Prescott-street. The prisoner M'Namara lodged with me, until he was taken up, for a year and a half; Buttery was often there.</p>
               <p>(The will was then put in and read.)</p>
               <p>In the early part of the cause, MR. ALLEY contended that after the probate of the will was produced under the seal of the Ecclesiastical Court, the Counsel for the Prosecution could not legally produce evidence to prove the will a forgery.</p>
               <p>The prisoners made no defence.</p>
               <p>BUTTERY - GUILTY. Aged 42.</p>
               <p>M'NAMARA - GUILTY. Aged 52.</p>

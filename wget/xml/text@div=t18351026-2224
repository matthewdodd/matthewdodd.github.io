                  </hi> I am a licensed victualler, and keep the King's Head, Crown-street, Soho, in the parish of St. Ann, Westminister. On the 6th of October my house was robbed—a fortnight before that time the prisoner called at my house, and cleaned a dial, a Dutch clock, and a watch, and after that he called in to see if they all went regularly—I informed him the watch had stopped—he said he would call again, and look at it—he called on the 6th, went up stairs, and looked at it in the same room where he had repaired it, and he went out at the side door with it without my leave—I merely sent him up to the room to look at it, and he went out at the side door with it—at about eight o'clock in the evening I missed him, and made inquiry—I found he was not there, an missed the watch he had lodged, but he was not there—I found him in Gee's-court, on the 11th, in bed, about ten or half-past ten o'clock in the morning—I asked him where the match was—he said it was in pawn, and gave me two duplicates, and delivered me two seals, and a ring.</p>

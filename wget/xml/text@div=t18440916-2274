                  </hi>. I am a contractor for lamps, and live in Derby-road, Kingsland-road. On Monday, the 19th of Aug., I supplied some lamps to White Conduit-house for an illumination—I employed the prisoner to hang them up and light them—they were to hang in the gardens there—I employed him afterwards to clear away the lamps—they were in trays—some of them were sent away on Tuesday, and I expected they were all cleared—the pri<lb></lb>soner was not employed by me on the Wednesday—I did not give him autho<lb></lb>rity to go there on the Wednesday, or to have anything to do with the lamps—I know these lamps and the tray—I have every reason to believe that they are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a constable employed at White Conduit-house. On Wednesday morning, the 21st of Aug., I saw the prisoner coming out of the passage with this tray of lamps in his hand—I followed him—he went across the Chalk-road to Maiden-lane by the gas factory—he turned down, and went into a beer-shop—I went in, and told him Mr. Duffell wanted him—he said, "Very well, I will come when I hare drank my beer"—I said, "Come di<lb></lb>rectly"—he got up, and came out with me—I said, "Bring the lamps with you"—he said, "The lamps?"—I said, "Yes"—he went back, and brought them out—I said I took him for stealing the lamps—he said he had not stolen them, he meant to take them to Mr. Duffell, and was to take them that evening to Vauxhall to Mr. Duffell, who would pay him for his labour.</p>

            . My brother the prosecutor came down stairs on the 20th of August in the morning, and said he had lost 60 l. out of his bureau; I asked him when he saw it last; he said on the 13th of the month; I said, my man James has been a sad fellow, I wish he has not had it; my brother said, I will accuse him with it; he did, and I heard him confess to my brother he had taken it; I said, where is the money; he said it was gone; I said, which way could you make away with it; he said he had paid the debts which he owed with it; I said, where is the bag; he said it was up stairs in his pocket; he went up, and I with him; he took it out of his mourning coat right hand pocket, and said, this is it that had the money in it; I said, where had you it; he said, from out of Mr. Michael's bureau; I took the bag, and we went down stairs; I showed my brother the bag, my brother said he would swear to the bag; I said to the prisoner, Jemmy, how did you open the bureau; he said, by the help of a key that lay there; I said, when did you take it; he said, that day that Mr. Michael and you went to the Marsh; I said, Jemmy, this will not do, I must charge an officer with you; he desired I would acquaint his mother; while he was writing to his mother the constable came in; I told the constable that was his man, he took him in charge; I asked him what he had wrote to his mother; the letter was, his acknowledging his taking the money, and begging money to make it up, or he must die<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070010"></xptr> according to law; I took the letter to her; she said she could do nothing for him; I came home, and told him what she said; I then said to him, you never could have made a hand of all this money, what have you done with it; he sat down in the presence of the officer where he had paid away and spent to the amount of 47 l. 1 s. 10 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the mother had raised the money, what then?</p>
               <p>Shirley. I would not have taken it, I'll assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or your brother agree to take the money?</p>
               <p>Shirley. No, we never did; after this I went to the prisoner in the Poultry Compter, and he gave me an account of 52 l. 7 s 5 1/2 d. which he had paid away of this money, and gave me the names of the persons to whom he had paid it to; I went to them, and found he had paid as he mentioned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>They offered to take the money if I could bring it.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor and his brother both said, if the money had been raised they never intended to take it.</p>

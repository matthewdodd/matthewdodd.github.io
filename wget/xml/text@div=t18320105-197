On the evening of the 9th of December the prisoner came to take two articles out of pawn - I gave her one, which she paid for, and waited for the other; she was looking at some handkerchiefs, and I saw her unpin a cotton shirt, and conceal it about her person - I sent for a Policeman, who found the shirt on the floor near her, and in going to the station-house this flannel shirt was picked up, which I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050099"></xptr>know to be my master's - it had hung near the other; I had seen it a few minutes before: I saw her with the cotton shirt in her hand - she was rolling it up under her gown.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I found the prisoner in the shop; this cotton shirt was at her feet - she denied all knowledge of it, but on her way to the station-house she said she had picked it up on the floor, and she thought it belonged to a customer; on our way through Lamb's-passage she said she wanted to stop, and when we got to the station Dosson brought in this flannel shirt - Bluett brought in a rule and a sixpence - I had seen the sixpence on the counter - she refused to take it, and insisted upon having her other article.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I saw the prisoner in Lamb's-passage - I saw her drop this flannel shirt - I am confident it fell from her; I took it up.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How far is that from the station? A. About a hundred yards; I took it up, and walked after them - the officer did not know I had it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was Mr. Matthews' brother, Bluett, and a boy in the shop, when I first went; I was the last person served - I put down the money for the other article, which he could not find, and said I would call in the morning; he returned me the money in the watch-house, and the ticket - I found the cotton shirt under my feet at the back door; I thought it belonged to a customer - I never saw the flannel shirt till I got to the watch-house; they did not see it fall from me - I had no apron on.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DOSSON. I saw it fall from her, and I took it up.</p>
               <p>COURT to BLUETT. Q. Did you see her unpin the shirt? A. Yes, I did; there were no customers in the shop but her - she had an apron on, and a red cotton gown; I did not charge her with it till I sent for the officer.</p>
               <p>JURY to AVERY. Q. Was her gown open in front? A. Certainly not - she had an apron on, I am certain, for I took it into the cell to her when she was locked up.</p>

I lost a piece of loin of pork on the 8th of January; I saw three persons come into my shop, and my man served one, who immediately ran out with the other two; I went into the shop, and my man was gone, but he soon returned with the one who had bought the article; he said he could tell the man who took the piece of pork; I detained him, and took him to Queen-square, and the next day Warren said he could find the prisoner, and he went and brought the prisoner and the pork - this is it - it was missing from my shop.</p>

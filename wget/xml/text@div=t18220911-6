On the 15th of August, there were some bed-curtains in a basket in the front parlour. I lost seventeen in all. About twelve o'clock in the morning, I had just left the room, and the window open - an iron railing covered the area, which enabled a person to get in. I saw the prisoner in the room tying the curtains up - he had moved them out of the basket on the floor, and was tying them up in a silk pocket handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110005"></xptr>of his own. I asked what he wanted? I did not wait for a reply, but ran out of the room, being frightened. I ran down the garden to call the gardener, and saw the prisoner running across the fields, near the house. I called Stop thief! but I did not see him taken. In five minutes Stone, the officer, brought him back - I am sure he is the man. He left the curtains in the room; he had only tied two corners of the handkerchief. They are worth 50 s. The window had been left open.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier. I was at work at Mr. Mortimer's, in the back parlour, and heard Mrs. Mortimer cry out a man was robbing the house; I immediately ran into the front parlour, and saw the prisoner run from the fire-place, and get out of the window - he got over the rails before I could take him; I cried Stop thief! and saw him turn across the fields - I ran down the garden, and pursued him; he was stopped, and brought back in about five minutes. I am certain he is the same man - I knew him instantly.</p>
               <p>MRS. MORTIMER. The curtains are the four post bed furniture - I found them still in the handkerchief. They were made by an upholsterer, and cost seven guineas nine months ago.</p>

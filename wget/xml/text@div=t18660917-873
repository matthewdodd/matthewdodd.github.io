                  </hi>. I am senior partnerof the Bow Nursery Company—the defendant called on me about the middle of May, and asked how I was off for bedding plants—I told him I had a large quantity—I knew him—he had purchased cuttings of me on one occasion—he said that a client of his masters, Messrs. Newbury and Starke, of Doctors' Commons, had called that day, and wanted to be recommended to A florist who could supply him with a large quantity of plants, and that it was Captain Goldsworthy, of the 91st Highlanders, 4, York-Street, St. James's (hand<lb></lb>ing me his card, which I have lost), who had taken a house at Wimbledon, but had no plants in the garden, and wanted to make a show at once, and had instruted him to get them, and to see that they were large and bloom<lb></lb>ing—he said that they would be paid for on delivery—I went with him to look the plants out, he selected 3600, there were 50 dozen verbenas, 50 dozen calceolarias, 100 dozen scarlet geraniums, 50 dozan variegated gera<lb></lb>niums, and 50 dozen large fuchsias—I took that order down in penoil in my pocket-book—no one was with him—he said, "What is the commis<lb></lb>sion on this order?"—I said, "The usual commission is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent., but if it is paid on delivery I will allow you the odd money, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—he said that he did not want all the money at once—he wanted 12 dozen bedding plants for his ground, and one dozen for his window, which I afterwards supplied him with—the prisoner kept writing letters, telling me not to send the plants to Captain Goldsworthy's, as he was out of town—I found out that the Captain was at Brighton, so there was some truth in it—I did not send the plants, as my suspicious were aroused—I sent the prisoner 13 dozen plants at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—I have lost the sale of the 3600 plants, they are of no use whatever—I refused taking customers for them—it was two months before I found out that it was a false order—the prisoner wanted his plants at once—he said that he had a week's holiday, and wanted to plant them out—I should not have parted with them had it not been for the representations he made.</p>

Q.</hi> When did you call on Captain Goldsworthy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—I communicated with him some six weeks afterwards—I sent the plants to you long before I received your letter, telling me not send Captain Goldsworthy's plants at present—I did not send your plants that week, and you wrote the week after, saying that you would send the order elsewhere, as I was so long—I then sent them—I took the order in pencil in this memorandum book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the clerk's place to book it—you have not been in the habit of having plants of me—you ordered 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of rooted cuttings three years ago, and I have lost sight of you ever since—I have some slight recollection now of sending you two or three flowers in pots four or five years ago, which you were to send postage stamps for, but never did—I have not produced the order book, which you gave me notice to do, because there is nothing entered there for you—I wrote to you on the 22nd June, and have a copy of the letter—this is my second letter, written on June 16—I called at your house five times, for you to ex<lb></lb>plain the matter, and saw your wife three times—I did not take proceedings from May till August, because when I called on Captain Goldsworthy's</p>

               <p>brother he told me that his brother <hi rend="italic">was</hi> in the country, and therefore I thought the order was genuine, but the captain afterwards wrote and said that he had not given the order—I did not tell your wife I had been at a loss of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and claim 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. compensation, or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not instruct Messrs.

I am a captain in the 91st Highlanders and a member of the British Service Club, Park Place, St. James's—I know the prisoner by sight—my mother formerly occupied apartments that belonged to his mother, and when I returned from India I visited my mother there—I never authorised him to order plants for me of Mr. McRae—Messrs. Newman and Starkie are not my solicitors—I was never a client of theirs—I believe I never gave the prisoner a card—I knew nothing about these flowers till my brother wrote to me and sent me Mr. McRae's card, which very much Surprised me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 65, Basinghall Street—my partner took the first instructions in this case to apply for a summons at the police-court, but before any instructions were given Mrs. Anthony called on me and explained the case—we received instructions about ten days before the date of the summons, August 25th or 26th—after your wife called I called to see you, but saw her—I asked if you were within—she said, "No"—I said that my instructions were, unless I obtained the money to apply at once for a summons or warrant—I called again, but no conversation took place, and then I said that I must go to the police-court—I did not leave word for you to come and see me, but I said that if you could give any explanation of the matter, I was very anxious to hear it—you did call at my office some little time before the summons was issued—you said that you should like to see Mr. McRae, as you could explain the matter, and I said that you had better see him—I did not offer to take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down from you and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two months—I had no instructions—I only remember you calling once—my books are not here—I only received my subpoena after I came into court to-day—I have never seen a letter from you; perhaps Mr.</p>

               <p>Kean received it when I was out of town.

You had every opportunity of explaining—I do not remember your calling—on the 22nd August I was not in town, I think, and I do not remember that letter—I do not know whether my clerk opened it—he is here—I do not think he did, as it is marked " Private." (<hi rend="italic">A letter from the prisoner to the witness, dated</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd August</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">was here put in, stating that he was going to Liver-pool, and requesting Mr. Ring to hold the matter over till Monday, when he would pay the money</hi>.) I never wrote to you in my life—no letter signed by my firm was sent to you by my instructions—I was out of town—our managing clerk would write letters in my absence. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner stated that he had lost the original letter and called for the copy in the witness's letter-book, which, being produced, contained the following letter</hi>:—"24th August. Sir. In McRae's Matter. Unless that matter is settled satisfac<lb></lb>torily we are instructed to take such proceedings as will be necessary under the particular features of the case. Yours obediently, Wood &amp; Ring.") I deny all knowledge of that letter—I knew nothing of it till I was subpoenaed at the Lambeth Police-court—I deny that there had been any negotiations for a settlement of the matter—I told my clerk not to take the summons out till my return—you had offered an explanation over and over again, and afterwards delayed it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. The letters clearly show that I was in negotiation for a settlement of the matter—if I had had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket I could have settled it over and over again—Mr. King says that he has never offered to compromise the matter, but there is his own letter, signed "Wood &amp; Ring"—the prosecutor has compromised the matter, if there has been any offence committed—Mr. McRae stated in his deposition that he would not part with any commission until he was paid by Captain Goldsworthy, and yet he sent me these plants, value only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the large order never being executed, and he never attempted to execute it—I think it is a very cruel thing that I should be charged here, as I have been in the habit of buying goods of him at three months' credit—I gave him notice to produce his order books for 1864, 1865, and 1866, but he does not do so, because they would tell against him, and show that I have been dealing with him for some years—I told him to make inquiries before he executed the order, and he said, "Undoubtedly I shall do so"—I met three gentlemen at a music-hall, and when we had had a little drop too much one of them, handed me the card which I gave to Mr. McRae—he said that he was Captain Goldsworthy, and I had no reason to disbelieve him, as I had not seen Captain Goldsworthy—the subject turned on plants and flowers, and he asked me "whether I could recommend him to a place to Obtain some plants—I mentioned Mr. McRae, and he said, "Well, there is my address; order me the plants, and the money will be paid down "—I went to Mr. McRae the next evening, and said that I wanted some plants for my garden—he said, "Well, Anthony, what do you want? how many will do?"—I said, "A few dozen"—he said, "I will find you 12 dozen, and a dozen window plants "—he picked them out, and I then said, "I think I have got an order for you, but you must take it for what it is worth; make</p>

               <p>your inquiries, and if you get paid you will allow me something on it"—he said, "Yes," and sent me my plants in the ordinary way—as the per<lb></lb>son representing himself as Captain Goldsworthy did not write to me I wrote to Mr. McRae, telling him not to execute the order, and it never has been executed—he sent my plants after I had written him that countermand, and, therefore there could have been no fraud—he very well knew that it was a separate transaction altogether—he called on my wife, knowing me to be away, and said that he had been at a loss of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the order, and yet he does not charge me with anything on the order—on five occasions lie threatened <hi rend="italic">my</hi> wife, and tried to get money from her—Mr. Ring says, in his letter," Unless this matter is settled forthwith, "showing that he understood it as a civil transaction, as if it had been a felony he could not compound it—he asked me to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down—I said that I could not—he said 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "No"—he said, "Then name your own time"—my object is to show that the prosecutor never believed that I in<lb></lb>tended any fraud.</p>

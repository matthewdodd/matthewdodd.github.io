                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 132). On the night of 1st September, about 12.30, I was on duty near Chiswick Gate, and saw the prisoner on top of a waggon, in uniform, as he is now—he laughed as he passed—I followed the waggon, stopped the horses, and asked him where he was going—he said that he was on furlough—I asked him for his pass—he said that he had got no purse—I asked him what business he had there—he said "All right; take no notice"—I said "I shall take you to the station, on suspicion of being a deserter from the Royal Artillery"—he came off the waggon very quietly—I took him by the left arm, by the coat—he said "Leave go; I will walk quietly"—I said "I shall not leave go"—he walked a few paces, and asked me again to loose him—I refused—he stopped, looked in my face, and said "You b——sod!" aimed at my throat, and struck this knife through my helmet; at the same time he took me by the collar, broke the buttons off my coat, and tore it—I was in uniform—we struggled, and fell—I felt something against my breast, and saw a knife in his hand—I was cut through the tunic and waistcoat, but it did not break the skin—I tried to release myself—he attempted to strike me again, more than once—I got on my legs as quick as I could, and the prisoner jumped up, and tried to cut me with the knife—I struck him on the head with my staff—he came up to me a second time, and I hit him again, and he fell—when he was on the ground I saw the knife in his right hand—I took his hand, and said "Loose the knife"—he refused, and I cut my fingers in trying to get it—I hit him with my staff, and he loosed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When I got off the waggon the knife was in my hand; I had been cutting some apples and pears. I was quite qualified to walk, and did not need assistance. You hit me three blows on the head before I made any resistance. I then got the knife in my right hand, and you staggered against the point of the blade, and punctured your helmet. You gave me a fourth blow on my knuckles, and I was forced to let go the knife.

                  </hi>. I live at Heath Road, Hammersmith—I saw the prisoner just past Chiswick Gate, with a van, with vegetables—when I got through the gate, I saw two men fighting—they had an up and down, and when they got nearer, they had another up and down, and the policeman got the better of the soldier—I stopped my horse, and said "Gently, mate"—he said "Hold on; can't you see that knife in his hand? he has tried to stab me with it"—the prisoner would not loose the knife, and the policeman hit him on the knuckles—he then loosed it—I saw the prisoner knock the policeman's helmet off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, of Catspaw Road, Ormsby—on Friday night, 1st September, I was in Chiswick Lane, and saw a struggle between the prisoner and a policeman on the ground—it was 12.30, or a little before—the public-houses were closed—I saw the glitter of what I thought was a knife in the prisoner's hand—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife he had—I assisted to take him to the station—he struggled a little at first—he was bleeding freely, and I washed his head—I have been in the Crimea, and the Indian Mutiny—this is the kind of knife served out to troops in the Artillery.</p>

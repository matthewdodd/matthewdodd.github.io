               <p>On the 27th of January, I lost a leaden pipe, about ten o'clock at night; I was told that a person was against my water-tub; I ran out immediately into the yard, and caught the prisoner in the entry, within about a yard of getting out into the street; I asked him what he wanted? he asked me what was that to me; I am certain it is the same man: with that, I laid hold of him, and put my hand behind his coat and waistcoat, and found a piece of pipe between his coat and waistcoat; I kept it till I gave it to the constable; I found it matched with the pipe that was fixed to my water-butt; there is the water-butt and pipe altogether; it was fixed along a wall that joins to the Nandos Coffee-house (I live next door) on the outside of his coffee-room, in my yard; I keep the Rainbow; it comes out from the ground, and goes up against the wall of the Nandos; my cistern is in my yard, adjoining to the outside of my house, and lays on the top of it, to drive the water in; it is fixed to part of another pipe that is fixed in the house; I paid four shillings and six-pence for it that very day; it was broken from the ground.</p>

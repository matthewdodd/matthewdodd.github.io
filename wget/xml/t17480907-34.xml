               <p>Q. Where did he say he hid it?</p>
               <p>Lambert. In a place called Love lane near Kensington , and I went with him with a candle and lantern, and he could not find it then, it was so dark; and we went the next day, and saw the mo ney as plain as if it stood upright.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there?</p>
               <p>Lambert. There was 9 l. 10 s. all in silver.</p>

               <p>Lambert. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he took it from?</p>
               <p>Lambert. He said he took it out of the drawers in Mr. Wood's room.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get it out?</p>
               <p>Lambert. As to this particular, I did not ask him .</p>

               <p>Wood. Almost all queen Anne's money, in silver.</p>

            , and got in at the window of Mr. Wood's bed-chamber; and he said he took a bag out of the house , and put the money in, and hid it in Love-lane by Kensington. I was at the taking him, and he told me he got in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he opened the drawers?</p>
               <p>Evans. He said it was a drawer with a spring: and after he had opened it, he clapped it too again, and that was the reason it was found fast as it was left.</p>

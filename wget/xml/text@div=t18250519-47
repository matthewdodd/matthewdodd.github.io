On the night of the 26th of April I lost a shovel - I had seen it in the stable two or three days before. On the 27th of April I found the stable had been broken open; I afterwards saw the shovel in the possession of the constable - it had my mark on it, but it has been cut out.</p>

            . I lodge with the prisoner's mother, near Hounslow-barracks. The prisoner was at home on Wednesday night by six o'clock, and on the Monday and Tuesday also - we slept together in the same bed, and got up about six o'clock on the Wednesday morning; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190020"></xptr>can swear he never got up all that night. I was once prosecuted for stealing hay, and went to prison for it, but I did not know anything about it.</p>

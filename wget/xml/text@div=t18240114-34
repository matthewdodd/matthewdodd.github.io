On the 9th of December, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for some hinges, which I shewed him; he said they were too large, and asked for nails - I went to fetch them, and on returning I found this paper of fender feet moved. He said the nails were too small; I went for more, and on returning the hinges were entirely gone. I went round the counter, collared him, and asked for the paper parcel; he said he knew nothing of it. I felt his left hand pocket, and told him they were there - he said they were not; I said I was positive of it; he then took them out, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you say these belong to you;" I said they did, and took him to the watch-house. He made a great struggle to escape.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a parcel of nails in my hand - he came and charged me with stealing them, and knocked me down in the mud. I had no pockets at all.</p>

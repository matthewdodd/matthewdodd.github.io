I am assistant to Mr. Parks, ironmonger, of 140, Fleet-street—I live at 11, Blackfriars-road—on 13th October, about a quarter past 4 in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a pair of hinges, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and when he was served, with them, he placed on the counter a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, which I found to be counterfeit—I asked him where he got it from—he said from his master, Mr. Mackness, a tailor, of Newgate-street—I gave him into custody—I had never seen him in the shop before, to my knowledge—I gave the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece to the officer.</p>

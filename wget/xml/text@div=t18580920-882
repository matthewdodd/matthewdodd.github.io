                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Hampden-street, Padding<lb></lb>ton—I am a cripple—on Saturday night, 11th September, at a little before 12 o'clock, I was in Edgeware-road—a young woman spoke to me—I walked some little way with her—we went into Praed-street—I saw the two prisoners; I passed them, and went on to Manor-place—I did not see the prisoners following me, but when I got to Manor-place I saw them—White asked me if there was a thoroughfare; I said, "I believe not"—he then got hold of my throat and nearly strangled me, and Johnson and the girl robbed me of my property—I heard White say, "He is done for"—they left, and I got up and followed them into Old Church-street, and there I got a policeman—I had had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 101/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket, a latch-key, and a comb—that was all gone, and the pocket also—I did not know either of the prisoners before—I saw them again in about 5 minutes, I am sure they are the persons.</p>

I will <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> you for this;"—I took him to the station—he was rather violent—I asked him what made him run if he was not guilty?—he said, "It would make you run, if any person stopped you and knocked you about as they have me"—I said, "I see no marks of violence about you"—I had seen Johnson pass, while White was being held by the person who stopped him. I found a great stone in White's pocket, and on Johnson four pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 124). I was on duty that night, about a quarter of a mile from where the prosecutor describes that he was robbed—a cry came from Paddington-green—I listened, and saw Johnson come running from Paddington-green—I stopped him, and asked him what he was running for—he said that he had done nothing, he was running from a friend—I said that I was not satisfied, he must go back with me—he said that he would see me b—d first—he threw me on my back on some bricks—I took him again, and he threw me on my back a second time—I took him to the station—I had seen him throw something away, I went back and found this pocket, with one farthing in it, this comb, and this key—this pocket corresponds with these trowsers of the prosecutor's, which it was torn from.</p>

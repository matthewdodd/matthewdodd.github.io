            . On Thursday morning, the 22d of May, a few minutes before seven o'clock, the prisoner came to our house, No. 2, Winchelsea-court, Monkwell-street, and asked if he might leave his coat there; he lodged at No. 9, in the court; we knew that he worked at Boswood's, and gave him leave, and about twelve o'clock he came and said he wanted something out of his coat pocket; he took his coat off the chair and pulled something out of his pocket, but what I do not know; he threw his coat down in the passage and went away, and in the course of the day I was sweeping the passage, and under the mat I found three duplicates wrapped in paper close to where he stood to take something out of his pocket; I could not make out what they were for, but saw something was pawned for 25 s., and took them to Boswood, having then heard that the watch was stolen.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for on the 22d, and took the prisoner at Boswood's - he was accused of this robbery, and made great resistance. I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250008"></xptr>obliged to handcuff him - he tried to throw me down as we went along. I found the property at the pawnbroker's; then went to the Compter, and asked him what he had robbed Boswood of; he declared his innocence. I shewed him the duplicate of the handkerchief - he immediately put his hand to his forehead, and said, "I am a guilty man;" he called God to witness that he knew nothing about the watch, except being told at Stepney fair that it was lost. I produced the duplicate of it, he then said he was a guilty man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Two people slept in the room the watch was stolen from, and many had access to the room. I was in the house at the time it was lost. Legg says she saw me drop the duplicates. The reason of my leaving my coat there was, I came home early, and my landlord being a watchman, I did not like to disturb him. It is not likely that I should put duplicates in an open pocket, or pawn them where I am known.</p>

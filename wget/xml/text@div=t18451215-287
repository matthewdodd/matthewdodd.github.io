                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, William Reeve, as pawnbrokers, in Gray's Inn-lane. The prisoner was in our service six weeks on liking, as an apprentice—this handkerchief now produced I saw in the warehouse last Saturday night—it is the property of my brother and myself—I missed it on the Sunday, between twelve and one o'clock in the day—the prisoner had had leave to go home to his parents for that day—I directly went after him to his parents'—he opened the door to me—I expected to find him there—I asked him for the shawl-patterned handkerchief which he had—he said, "Master, I have got it, it is on the drawers in the room"—I found it there—I asked if he had got anything else—he denied it at first—I told him to turn out his pockets, and said I should give him into custody—he said, "Master, pray, don't; I will give you all I have"—he took this white handker<lb></lb>chief from his pocket, and gave it to me—it is my own property—I then took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father—I am a wheelwright, and live at No. 2, Wellesley-street, Euston-square. The prosecutor came to my house last Sunday—I heard him say to my son, "I have caught you in the trap I have laid for you;" and as for the boy denying to give up what he had in his pocket, it is false—he did not deny it at all—the prosecutor said those words in the presence of myself and my wife and children.</p>

Why says he, it is my brother do it, not me; do not make any piece of work about it, says he, here is seventy ponds, take it and pay the banker: but, Gentlemen, you know the payment of the money will not alter the crime: upon enquiry, the bankers were not sure that Jaques w the actual man that had offered this drat, they could not therefore for something follow up the prison; but upon applying to Sir

             sworn on the Voire Dire.</p>

               <p>Mr. Griffin, you gave this draught to Mr. Jaques, dated the 25th of November, as you say? - Yes.</p>

               <p>It was paid by your banker? - It was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jaques afterwards gave you the money, which was so paid by your banker, did not he? - Yes, Sir, he did, he advanced me money, but it was upon condition that I would bring, from my bankers, bills that were there, that were not yet due, one of which I can remember.</p>

               <p>Did he or did he not give you money to repay your banker for this draught? - He did not give me money, he lent me money.</p>

               <p>Have you ever repaid him that sum of money? - Yes, Sir, I have.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, Sir, I paid him by the notes he brought back.</p>

               <p>Then if I understand you right, the money which was so given on that day, was not given for this draught? - I do not understand you.</p>

               <p>I want to know this, whether you mean to say, that Mr. Jaques did give you money to reimburse your banker for the money that was drawn out of your bankers n, or on any other account? - He gave it me conditionally, that I would bring back all the notes and bills that were then laying at my bankers, that were not yet due, which I have evidence in Court to prove.</p>

               <p>Then he did not give it you in consideration of this draught? - No.</p>

               <p>Has not an action of trespass been brought against you by a Mr. Williams? - Not that I know off.</p>

               <p>Has not a notice been sent you that it will? - No.</p>

               <p>Are not you promised that in case you succeed in this trial, no action should be brought.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Does that go to his competency.</p>

               <p>Court. Certainly it does.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. If that is to be objected to witnesses, every third person may deprive the King of his witnesses.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. A man who is brought here as an accomplice, comes with a firm hope and expectation, that he will have the greatest benefit that a man can have, the King's mercy, here some third person a friend to Mr. Griffin, says, why, if you do not hang Mr. Jaques, we will bring an action against you; how is that to affect the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Court. It must arise from the transaction itself.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. It seems to me it is impossible that this question or any answer to it, can go to the competency of Mr. Griffin, it is not for any dread of the answer, because I know what it will be, but for the sake of justice, I take it now in the strongest way against myself; suppose he says a person of the name of Williams has threatened to bring an action against him and has promised him that if Jaques I convicted, that action shall be put an ed to, let us see a little how that goes to the competency of Mr. Griffin; that it go to his credit, I am perfectly free to anit; but surely we have not forgot what passed here yesterday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110148"></xptr> morning, when we were talking of Underwood, he stood under circumstances of the most gross discredit, and yet the King had a right to call him; would not it go to the cutting up of the public administration of the justice of the country, if my learned friend's objection should prevail; I am intitled to assume this is a fair prosecution, and in any other fair prosecution, a friend of the defendant shall go to the prosecutor, and shall superadd an inducement, he shall tell him if you will do it, I will give you ten guineas, I will give you five guineas, I will give you five halfpence, it is an interest, it would go to his competency; would it be suffered; that such a sort of negociation should go to the competency of a witness, and so destroy the full effect of the prosecution?</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. I really think it is my duty to take every objection which I can when I stand as counsel for any man that is upon trial for his life, therefore I answer thus, Mr. Garrow has stated a case which must be in all our memories; but I do not put this case as a similar one to Underwood's by any means, but what dropped from your Lordship appears to me to be an authority to found my objection upon; you there determined that the question as to competency, is not whether a man may be believed after he has told a story, but whether there is any legal bar to his being heard: Mr. Garrow has said where any man goes to a witness, and deprives the King of his witness; not in every case, but I do think, I should have got from Mr. Griffin's mouth, if the materiality of his answer had not been suggested to him by the objection, that he has an expectation, and if the witness states on his oath that he expects something will be done, it is an interest: in the case of Mrs. Rudd, I have heard that when Mrs. Perreau came to the bar, to be examined as a witness, she was asked on the Voire Dire, whether she did not expect that if Mrs. Rudd was convicted, her husband would be pardoned; I will put another case, which appears to me to be in point on this occasion, soon after the act of parliament was passed, which gave reward to thieftakers, objections were taken to those men so intitled to rewards being witnesses, the only answer of the Court was that that act of parliament did not mean to exclude their testimony; I am sure I recollect that the Court said, that was meant to further the conviction of offenders, and it was the case in which persons interested were the only persons who could convict the offenders: Mr. Griffin if he had answered my question, and told your Lordship that Mr. Williams or anybody else had told him if he convicted Mr. Jaques, they would forbear to bring an action against him, which he had in contemplation, I do submit that would have given him a direct interest, arising in consequence of this case, which would have destroyed his competency: I think it is laid down in Serjeant Hawkins, that an interest whether mediate or immediate, if to arise in consequence of the event of a trial, in such as to disqualify a witness, and the only exception that I believe has been held to that rule, is the case of men intitled under an act of parliament to rewards; and then the Court gave a further reason for it, that these rewards were intended for the conviction of offenders; I submit if he answers in that way, that would be an objection to his evidence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Mrs. Perreau was withdrawn.</p>

               <p>Mr. M'Nally. I recollect it perfectly; the Court did give an opinion that the objection went to her competency.</p>

               <p>Court. I shall permit you to put the question to Mr. Griffin, and decide on his competence when I know the circumstances under which he stands.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. An execution went into Mr. William's house, have you never been told, and has not Williams or his attorney told you that an action of trespass would be brought against you, for bringing that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110149"></xptr> execution into his house? - I hope your Lordship will allow me to make an answer, and he will not stop me.</p>

               <p>Your answer must go to the question? - No, Sir, to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Did they never tell you so? - It was not told me by the Jansons, but it was suggested to me.</p>

               <p>You have been told you say to the contrary? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now, I ask you upon your oath, whether when you was told to the contrary, you was not told that the action should not be brought if you convicted Mr. Jaques? - No, Sir, they did not, nor any thing to that effect.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Jaques? - About ten months.</p>

               <p>You have had money transactions with him? - I never had any other money transactions with him than giving him my draught.</p>

               <p>Did you in the month of September give him any draught on your banker? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What day? - On the 10th of September, I think it was on a Saturday, for thirty pounds, payable to - Maddocks, Esq; or bearer.</p>

               <p>Look at it and shew it us? - This is the draught.</p>

               <p>What date did this draught bear at the time you gave it to Mr. Jaques? - The 25th of November 1785.</p>

               <p>How soon after did you see that draught again? - I did not see it till the 20th of September, at my banker's, Sir James Esdaile and Co. I found it there, as a draught that had been paid.</p>

               <p>What date did it hear then? - It bore then, September the 15th.</p>

               <p>Was it in the state in which you now pe? - It was exactly.</p>

               <p>Has it been in your custody ever since? - It has.</p>

               <p>How soon after this did you communicate to Mr. Jaques, that you had seen it? - As soon as a coach could carry me, when I found out that the draught had been paid and altered, I repaired to Mr. Jaques's house in East-street, Red-Lion-square; he was not at home; at a quarter or half an hour after three, I found him at home.</p>

               <p>Now tell us the conversation that passed as nearly as you can? - I mentioned the circumstance with a great deal of uneasiness; I told him by giving him a draught dated forwards the 25th of November, that that very draught had been paid into my bankers, with the date and month altered to the 15th of September, I told him also that I thought it was a very cruel thing, I had been taking every step to serve him, and he was going to ruin me; that my banker was then over drawn, looked black, and expected his money should be paid by sunset; I told him I felt myself exceedingly hurt, and that I was very uneasy, for that my bankers, unless the money was paid in by sun-set, seemed as if they would fix me with it; Mr. Jaques said, it was impossible, good God! this is a forgery, I thought this had been at Bury, in Suffolk, for I tell you in confidence, I paid this draught to my brother.</p>

               <p>Court to Caesar, who was now brought in by an officer. You are protected by the Court, nobody can presume to molest you, and if you depart the Court without leave, you will be liable not only to be called upon your subpoena, but also so such other punishment as the Court may think proper to inflict.</p>

               <p>J. Griffin. He then asked me if he could assist me respecting the money at my bankers, and I said, I was so much distressed, I had a great deal of business that day, and I could not apply to any other friend to reimburse it on that day, he then told me he would give me the money to reimburse my banker, provided I would bring him the notes and bills that were then laying at my bankers, and not due.</p>

               <p>Did you do so? - I did.</p>

               <p>To what amount were these securities? - The bills that I brought back, Sir,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110150"></xptr> was one of fifty pounds, and there was another for sixty-four pounds, the bills that I gave him amounted to one hundred and fourteen pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>What money did he advance to you? - Seventy pounds.</p>

               <p>Had you any further conversation with him at this time? - I do not remember any thing particular, only he desired me to keep in confidence, for that it would ruin his brother.</p>

               <p>Had you any subsequent conversation with him upon the subject? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Upon what occasion was it that afterwards you had this conversation with him, where was it, and who was present, and what passed? - I had some conversation with the prisoner in the presence of Caesar, I think so.</p>

               <p>Whet her at any time after this 20th of September, you had any conversation with Mr. Jaques relative to this alteration of the draught? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was Mr. Caesar present? - Yes, he was,</p>

               <p>What passed? - Nothing particular passed, only I mentioned the circumstance.</p>

               <p>What circumstance was that? - I mentioned to him how very extraordinary it was, that the draught should be altered, he made no answer, but waved the conversation; I afterwards had some conversation with him in the presence of Mr.

               <p>Mr. Jaques. I have unfortunately not subpoened Messrs. Hankey's the bankers, and they will be very material witnesses, will your Lordship permit me to send for them, they sent me word they could not come.</p>

               <p>Court. Then send a subpoenea.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. We are situated here without a solicitor.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am afraid we must object to Mr. Hescot being in Court, but he has a partner.</p>

               <p>Mr. Griffin. Jaques had some words with me and my partner, in my partner's house, and Mr. Andre came in, and I told Mr. Andre in his presence, that Mr. Jaques was angry because I had mentioned this forgery to some person.</p>

               <p>In point of fact, had he been angry and expressed some anger? - He was so loud that it was the occasion of Mr. Andre's coming in.</p>

               <p>What had passed? - He said that he would go to Sir Sampson Wright's with me; and made a very great noise indeed.</p>

               <p>State what he said to you? - He had a large stick which he lifted up, and said, you take me up for a forgery, says he, I will go with you directly, says he, I defy you.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you at that time threatened to take him up for a forgery? - No, Sir, I had not.</p>

               <p>Then what was this in reply to? - It was in reply to our quarrel, what I had communicated to some friends had come to Mr. Jaques's knowledge.</p>

               <p>Had you threatened to take him up for forgery? - No, Sir, I had not at that time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You having communicated the secret, it had come round to him? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>Court. But had you threatened to any body that your would take him up? - No, Sir, I had not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then the purpose of his coming to you was your having communicated it to some person? - Yes, then Mr. Andre came in, and I told him that the reason of Mr. Jaques's hectoring and bellowing at me, was because I had mentioned the alteration of that draught that I had communicated to him, Mr. Andre said, he might soften his tone, for if he was taken before a Magistrate, he would not be in his situation for ten thousand guineas; Mr. Jaques in reply to that, said, he was very sorry that I had been hurt at my bankers, and that he hoped as he had paid me the money directly, no ill consequences would happen there, and that Mr. Andre would not think much of the draught.</p>

               <p>Did he at that time deny that such an alteration had been made? - No, he did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110151"></xptr> not, he said, that admitting the draught had been altered, as I had had the money to pay into my bankers, he hoped my credit would not be hurt there; Mr. Andre my partner seemed satisfied with this, and the conversation dropped, but on his going out, he desired Mr. Andre would not say any thing about the business.</p>

               <p>Have you had any other conversation with Mr. Jaques about this at any other time? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Court. I wish you to be a little more particular, he said admitting the draught had been altered, do you mean by that, to say that he admitted the draught had been altered? - I only mention what he said, and I wish to put the best constructions upon it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have told us on the 20th of September, you found you had over drawn your banker? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had other draughts been prematurely presented? - They had.</p>

               <p>Look at them.</p>

               <p>Court. That may make an impression, and cause a suspicion.</p>



               <p>Court to Jury. The inspection of the draught itself when you come hereafter to consider the evidence, will be very material for you.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Griffin. When you parted with that draught, out of your hands, had you at all erased the date or written the draught on any erasure? - No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Were any other persons in company when you wrote that draught? - Yes, Mr. Caesar was in company.</p>

               <p>Jury. When did you write that draught? - On the 10th of September.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was the reason of your giving the draught in that manner? - I could not be certain I could have money at my bankers earlier than that time.</p>

               <p>If you had been desired to give it, dated the 15th of September, would you have given it dated that day, so as it might have been carried in then? - No, Sir, I could not, because I could not be sure of money at my bankers.</p>

               <p>Did you explain that reason to the prisoner at the time you gave it? - Yes, I did so the prisoner knows very well.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, may I be permitted to look at the draught? - Certainly; officer hold the draught in your hand, and shew it to Mr. Jaques.</p>

               <p>(Looks at it.)</p>

               <p>Court to Griffin. Was that your only reason for dating the draught so far forward, and did you communicate it to Mr. Jaques? - That was my only reason, I assure you.</p>

               <p>Was it your intention it should have been paid at the time it bore date? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Do you recollect, or do you know from your own recollection, what date this draught originally bore, or from the relation of some other person? - I know it from myself.</p>

               <p>Then you mean now to swear, that you recollect this draught to have been dated on the 25th day of November, from you own recollection? - From my own recollection, that is the only reason I have to recollect it.</p>

               <p>Did you make any memorandum at the time you gave it? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

               <p>Have you never said that the only reason you had to think it was dated on the 25th of November, was because somebody told you so? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Have you never said so? - I do not remember saying so.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that you did not swear that was the reason when you was before the Magistrate? - I do not remember swearing so.</p>

               <p>Did you never swear before the Magistrate, or say that the reason why you recollected it to be the 25th of November,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110152"></xptr> was because Mr. Reeves told you so? - I do not remember saying so.</p>

               <p>When you gave this note, was not the consideration of it for a bill Mr. Jaques lent you? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Did not he lend you a bill drawn on Mr. Planner, for which you gave him as a counter security this draught? - I do not remember he did.</p>

               <p>Why if your memory can recollect the date of this note, you can recollect the transaction at the time? - I do not remember I did.</p>

               <p>You mean to swear that he did not? - I mean to swear that I do not remember, I swear to the best of my memory, I will not swear that he gave me a bill on Mr. Planner.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath was it not the same time that draught was given to you? - No, Sir, it was not.</p>

               <p>Did you give him no other draught at that time, nor a bill on Mr. Addis? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

               <p>Did you never give him a bill on Mr. Addis? - Yes, Sir, I did, but that bill of Mr. Addis's I drew out of my own bankers, at the same time I found out this erasement to the best of my remembrance, this thirty pound draught was not for payment or a security for that bill.</p>

               <p>When you come to Mr. Jaques's, you say you told him, you had no other friend you could apply to, in respect to money at that time? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jaques. When did he receive that bill on Mr. Planner? - Upon my word, I cannot tell exactly, I believe it was ten days, or some days before, I cannot swear positively.</p>

               <p>How came you then to recollect so accurately the date of this draught? - I not only remember that I gave it for the 25th of November, but when I came to look at the draught, my eyes told me so by seeing the erasure, and another thing that refreshed my memory likewise, a day or two, or three, or four, I cannot say exactly, I went to Mr. Reeves.</p>

               <p>Mr. Reeves told you what day it had been dated? - He told me a draught had been offered to him.</p>

               <p>Your memory was refreshed as to the date, by something which somebody told you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. You must not ask what that something was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Then I do not put the question.</p>

               <p>You say that when you came to see the draught, that something made you recollect what date it originally was? - It did.</p>

               <p>Look at that draught, and tell me how any thing appearing upon that draught makes you recollect what was originally on that draught? - I remember giving this draught.</p>

               <p>Court. You have been asked why you could swear so exactly to the very day of the date of this draught, your answer was this, I not only remember it as I gave it for the 25th of November, but when I came to look at the draught my eyes told me so by seeing the erasure? - Remembering myself by this, that I had given a draught for the 25th of November, and this being altered I can remember this was the draught.</p>

               <p>Court. What is there then in your eye sight that leads you to ascertain the day, the day on which it was originally dated? - The first stroke of my N in November is in this manner, the next stroke of the N the top is scratched off, the bottom of that is left to make the E for September, the R is made out of O.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to say, that that appears upon the inspection of that draught? - It does.</p>

               <p>(The draught handed to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Upon this discovery of your being over drawn, you went to Mr. Jaques's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I believe previous to that you had a bill of Mr. Jaques's for sixty-four pounds, drawn by him or upon him? - I had a bill at my bankers that was not due, for which I gave him the money.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110153"></xptr>That bill you had carried to your bankers? - I did.</p>

               <p>Your banker entered it short? - He did.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, was not it because your banker entered it short, was not that the reason you was over drawn at that time? - No, it was not.</p>

               <p>When you carried that to your bankers, did not you desire them to discount it? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Did not you carry it there to be entered as cash in your book? - No, I did not, I carried it as security, to be carried to the place where it was due, and then it would be entered as cash when paid.</p>

               <p>You mean to swear that? - I do.</p>

               <p>Do you swear that was not one of the reasons why you was over drawn? - I do.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did he not declare to Mr. Esdaile, at the time he went there, that the reason of his being over drawn was because that bill was entered short? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Did you never say that to any body? - I never said it to any body in my life.</p>

               <p>Will you venture to swear you never said so? - Yes, I will.</p>

               <p>When you came to Mr. Jaques's and told him of this alteration, you say he lent you some money to reimburse you? - He did.</p>

               <p>He lent you money to take up these bills that were at the bankers? - No, upon condition that I would bring them back in order that the prisoner might get them discounted.</p>

               <p>It was not then on account of this bill that he gave you the seventy pounds? - That was one reason why it was given to help to pay that bill at my bankers.</p>

               <p>Why you positively swore on the Voire Dire that money was given that you might bring back this bill, and that this was not any part of the condition of his giving you any part of this money? - No, more it was.</p>

               <p>You said that he lent you this money on condition that you would bring back these bills that were lodged at the bankers? - That was the reason, and to make up the deficiency at the bankers.</p>

               <p>Now, what do you mean by saying that Mr. Jaques said, as you had been paid that money, it would be of no consequence? - He said, as the money had been paid in at my bankers I should suffer no discredit; what I have to pay now will amount to three or four hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>To what amount have you had money transactions with Mr. Jaques, exchanging bills since the discovery of what you are pleased now to call a forgery? - I cannot tell exactly.</p>

               <p>How much do you think since that transaction? - I believe that our money transactions have been to the amount of three hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>Since the discovery of this forgery? - Not since the full discovery, but since I shewed it to Mr. Jaques, I have had transactions with him since that time for several hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>A little time before Mr. Jaques was first charged with this, did not you apply to him for money to take up some bills? - No.</p>

               <p>Did not you apply to him for money on any account? - No.</p>

               <p>Then you never applied to Mr. Jaques either to lend you money or to take up any bill before he was taken up himself for this forgery? - I do not remember I did.</p>

               <p>Will you swear you did not after the trial of the action in the Common Pleas, did you not after that time, and before he was taken up, apply to him? - I applied to Mr. Jaques for thirty pounds.</p>

               <p>Now that was refused? It was.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, did not you say, if he did not give you that you would charge him with the forgery? - No, I did not that I know off.</p>

               <p>(The question repeated.) - Never, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect an indictment being drawn against Mr. Williams for perjury? - I do not.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect applying to Mr. Jaques to desire he would not go on with the prosecution<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110154"></xptr> against Mr. Williams for perjury? - No.</p>

               <p>You do not recollect that indictment being drawn? - I cannot recollect a thing I never saw; the prisoner met me, and told me there was a prosecution.</p>

               <p>You do remember that prosecution being on foot? - I remember having heard say so.</p>

               <p>Now, then did you not say if that prosecution was carried on, you yourself should be indicted for perjury, and therefore desired Mr. Jaques to drop it? - I do not remember any such thing, it does not occur to me, and I cannot positively say that I did not.</p>

               <p>Was you never threatened by Williams or his attorneys, or by some persons for him, was you never threatened with an indictment for perjury? - I never was.</p>

               <p>Do you remember that trial in the Common Pleas? - I do.</p>

               <p>Do you remember being examined as to the existence of any note? - I do.</p>

               <p>Do you remember positively swearing that you had not a note existing between you and Mr. Jaques? - Where did I swear it?</p>

               <p>Did you say it? - I said to my Lord Loughborough, he sent for me up and asked me if I had these notes for the warrant of attorney, I told him I had not, and he thought it was very strange that I should not have preserved these notes.</p>

               <p>Do you remember being sent home by Lord Loughborough to find the notes? - I do.</p>

               <p>Did not you say when you came back again in the hearing of Lord Loughborough and the Jury that you had destroyed the notes? - I do not remember saying any such thing, because it is impossible I should.</p>

               <p>Did not you say that you had destroyed the checques as well as the notes? - I did not, my Lord Loughborough asked me if I had any notes or checques, alluding to the warrant of attorney, and I told him I had destroyed them.</p>

               <p>Did he make use of any expression as alluding to the warrant of attorney, or did he ask it generally? - I understood it so.</p>

               <p>Do you remember producing some scraps of paper? - I do.</p>

               <p>Did not you say these were all the papers relative to the transaction between you and Mr. Jaques? - No, I did not, I said they were all I could find.</p>

               <p>Did not you say it was customary with you to burn every one of your checques? - I never said so concerning my checques, I only said so with respect to my notes.</p>

               <p>Were not you called upon for checques as well as notes? - I only looked upon it that I was called upon for notes.</p>

               <p>Have you never since seen, or had in your possession, any of the checques that were given as consideration for that warrant of attorney? - I have, I have seen one of them, I produced papers after I came back, but not to my Lord Loughborough, I produced all I could find.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear that you never had any notice of an action of trespass being brought against you? - Never.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. I'anson never give you any notice? - Never to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Did he or his clerk never give you notice of an action of trespass being brought against you for that execution? - Never; that I mean to swear.</p>

               <p>I think you say you know Mr. Reeves? - I do.</p>

               <p>Did you never declare to that same Mr. Reeves, that if Mr. Jaques did not pay a draught of fifteen pounds that Reeves had, you would take Jaques up for forgery? - I do not remember saying any such thing.</p>

               <p>Do you remember an action that was brought, I think the name of it was Caesar against Spencer? - I do.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect you went down to Maidstone as a witness? - I do, I was subpoened.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect having any conversation with Reeves on that action? - I never did it, I do not know that I ever mentioned a syllable.</p>

               <p>Did not you say that you went down to Maidstone to prove a man's writing whom<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110155"></xptr> you knew nothing off? - No, as God is in heaven, I never said so, nor as I am upon my oath I never said so; to my remembrance I never said, that if Jaques did not take up a draught for fifteen pounds, that he would be indicted for forgery.</p>

               <p>Was not your reason for making this charge because Jaques would not accommodate you with money? - No, it was not. I might not approve of the prisoner's conduct, but I do not remember ever saying so.</p>

               <p>Was not you threatened with a prosecution for perjury by Williams or I'anson? - I do not remember that I said so.</p>

               <p>Is not one of the inducements for making this charge, that you should not be prosecuted for perjury by them? - No, it is not, I never said so, I never was told so to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Was you ever told that you should be prosecuted if you did not make the charge? - No.</p>

               <p>Did not I'anson tell you that that action of trespass should not be brought if you would go on with this charge? - He never told me so, nor any body for him that I know off, I never conversed with Williams since that action.</p>

               <p>Was not you at the London Coffee-house with Mr. Williams within these three days? - I have never met them at the London Coffee-house or any other place that I know of, not to my knowledge ever since, and I can swear it.</p>

               <p>You mean still to have the Jury understand you, that it is from perceiving that same altered note that you recollected it to be the same that was dated on the 25th of November? - From recollecting giving the note, and seeing this, I verily believe that to be the note.</p>

               <p>Is it upon the face of that note that you collect what the thing originally was? - Most certainly the memory and the eyesight help one another, it does so in this instance.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did I understand you right, that from recol lecting the manner in which you wrote the date on the 25th of November, 1785, and observing the strokes of the date you knew it was altered? - Yes.</p>

               <p>That is not obvious to other people? - No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever make an affidavit in a cause against Caesar, to set aside an execution? - I did.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect the purpose of it? - Not exactly.</p>

               <p>Court. You cannot impeach the witness's character by specific facts, unconnected with this business.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was subpoened to go down to Maidstone to prove a hand-writing? - Mr. Jaques and Mr. Caesar both took me up to the Blue Boar inn, Holborn, and a man was there whom they told me was 
               <persName id="t17860111-62-person937">

            , I went there in consequence of what I heard, and there was no such person; Mr. Jaques seemed much hurt, and told me in a day or two I should be brought into company with him who would shew me his hand-writing, and tell me it was his hand-writing; I saw a man there who was introduced by Jaques.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask Mr. Griffin if he has received these draughts from me since the 20th of September, and for what; they are draughts from my bankers, and all since that transaction, he will see his name upon the backs of some of them.</p>

               <p>Court. Is your name on the back?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You need not hesitate about them, Mr. Griffin.</p>

               <p>Here are only three that my name appears on, two have not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The draught of sixty pounds that has not your name, did you receive that from me, and for what? - I remember receiving a draught for sixty pounds, but whether this is the draught or not I cannot say, I think I can tell by looking at my bankers book.</p>

               <p>Court. Look at it? - I remember very well going to the prisoner's bankers, and receiving this sixty pounds myself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. And that fifty pounds made payable to yourself, I believe it is? - Yes, that likewise.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110156"></xptr>What did you receive that for? - Here is one I do not remember any thing about, I do not remember any thing of that, I do not remember this, there are four that I do remember that have been through my hands, and two that have not.</p>

               <p>Court. Now with respect to these two, do you mean to say that they were not positively given to you by Mr. Jaques? - By not going through my bankers hands, I cannot say positively one way or the other.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Those two which he says he did not receive, are both marked by his banker.</p>

               <p>Court to Griffin. Look at the draughts again? - I cannot tell my bankers mark, it is impossible for me to tell by the draught itself, (looks at them again) I do not remember these two draughts upon my word.</p>

               <p>Court. Look in your bankers book at the first of December? - I do not see any.</p>

               <p>Court. Now these four draughts that you admit you have received, for what purpose did you receive them? - Upon my word I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>One of them is the draught you received on the 20th of September? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then the three others were all dated in the month of November? - I believe I can recollect the sixty pounds draught, I received it myself in Bond-street in lieu of a note of my own acceptance.</p>

               <p>When was that? - I cannot say, the note became due about ten days ago, that is the note I was arrested upon on the Saturday morning, and for which that draught was given.</p>

               <p>At whose suit was you arrested? - I cannot recollect, I never was arrested before, and when the officer came I took his word, I made no doubt but I was arrested, he shewed me a piece of paper; I had my brother-in-law with me, who was bail for me, and he let me go directly.</p>

               <p>The sixty pounds, I think you say, which bears date on the 4th of November, was given you in exchange for a note of equal value of your own? - Yes.</p>



               <p>Which note was due a few days ago, and on which you was arrested? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you remember for what the draught of the 18th of November, for eighteen guineas, was given? - Upon my word I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect for what purpose that on the 22d of November, for twenty guineas was given? - No.</p>

               <p>The two other draughts you say you do not know any thing about?</p>

               <p>Court. September the 26th, thirty pounds payable to Mr. Griffin, and December the 1st, twenty pounds, are the dates of the two notes that the witness does not remember.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. I beg to ask the witness how this draught in question came to be made payable to Maddocks? - Upon my word I cannot recollect justly how it could be; I should rather suppose that it was at my own desire, and for that reason because I did not like to put in Mr. Jaques's name.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not you declare before the magistrate that the reason was, that the forgery was found out at your bankers, and you did not like to make it payable to me? - It might be so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. You say your reason was because you did not like Mr. Jaques's name should be put in? - Yes.</p>

               <p>But the other draughts are in Mr. Jaques's name? - Yes, he drew them himself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know of him whether he did not disclose before the magistrate that the reason the draughts were made payable to another person was, because that forgery was found out at his bankers; I wish to ask whether I am debtor to Mr. Griffin or he to me? - I look upon Mr. Jaques to be the debtor.</p>

               <p>In what way, and to what amount? - I cannot positively say to the whole amount altogether, but I should suppose Mr. Jaques is considerably indebted to me.</p>

               <p>Can you say all near what amount? - Above a hundred pounds, that I can swear to.</p>

               <p>Since this transaction I believe you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110157"></xptr> sworn to a debt of a hundred pounds, have you not? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You have attempted likewise to make me a bankrupt I believe? - I have.</p>

               <p>Since I have been in prison? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He has sealed a commission, but they did not think proper to proceed upon it.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you a positive recollection with respect to the date of the draught on which the forgery is assigned, as connected with the name of Maddocks? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>What then you have a distinct recollection, at this time, that the draught which you gave, payable to Maddocks or bearer, was dated originally on the 15th of September? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you ever give Mr. Jaques any draught whatever, bearing date the 25th of November? - I believe I did.</p>

               <p>For what sum? - For the sum of thirty pounds.</p>

               <p>Do you remember who that was payable to? - That was payable, I think, in the name of Clement.</p>

               <p>How can you be positive in two draughts for thirty pounds, one in the name of Maddocks and one in the name of Clement, which of them was dated the 15th of September, and which the 25th of November, what serves to guide your remembrance? - That the draught dated forward to the 25th of November was carried to Mr. Reeves, of Holborn-bridge, to get cash for.</p>

               <p>Your recollection leads you to believe that the other draught dated the 15th of September, was in the name of Clement? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Is your recollection equally clear with respect to one draught as the other? - It is.</p>

               <p>Do you think you are as liable to be mistaken in one as in the other? - No, I do not think so.</p>

               <p>Why not? - Because I remember the name of Clement being down in my bankers book.</p>

               <p>Then your recollection is more certain as to that than the other, suppose you are mistaken as to that draught to Clement? - I do not think I am.</p>

               <p>If you are not now you were before, for you swore before the magistrate that the draught dated the 15th of September was payable to

               <p>How comes that, when I asked you whether there was any draught dated on the 15th of September, you told me there was one, and that one was payable in the name of Clement; now you tell me it was another draught, why did not you tell me at first there were two; I ask you the general question, whether there was any draught given on the 15th of September, to which that paper in November answers, it now appears to be that there were two? - I cannot say that there were two, because one of them which I gave for the 15th has since been altered to the 13th.</p>

               <p>But were there two originally given, bearing date the 15th? - It is more than I can trust my memory to; as to the dates, I remember giving a draught to

            .</p>

               <p>Court. There is no think - or believe there: When was Mr. Jaques first taken up on this charge? - I do not recollect the time.</p>

               <p>Was it about the 22d of December? - I believe that was the day of the first examination.</p>

               <p>Down to what time, how near to that time was Jaques and you upon a footing of confidence and intimacy? - I think till the trial of the cause in the Common Pleas.</p>

               <p>When was that cause tried? - I do not exactly remember the day of the month.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. It was the 6th of December.</p>

               <p>You and Mr. Jaques at the time of that cause were in the same interest, endeavouring to charge Mr. Williams with payment of two hundred pounds? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How soon after the unsuccessful event of that cause did you take up Mr. Jaques? - The day after.</p>

               <p>Then between the trial of that cause and the day after, or upon the trial of that cause, did any thing happen to you to induce you to change your opinion of Mr. Jaques? - My opinion of Mr. Jaques was changed long before that.</p>

               <p>Have you made any new discovery since the trial of that cause? - My bankers have informed me that the bank note which they delivered for that draught which was paid on the 15th of September, that that note had come into the bank.</p>

               <p>When did you hear that from your bankers? - I have heard it from my banker within these three days.</p>

               <p>Did you hear it before the 22d of December? - No, but they informed me of the number, and that it might take place, and by and by that they should see the bank note come into the bank.</p>

               <p>Now I will ask you this question, between the 6th of December, the day of the trial in which Mr. Jaques and you were joint plaintiffs, and the 26th of December, when he was taken up, was any new discovery<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110160"></xptr> very made by you whatever respecting this fact? - The discovery of the number of the bank note was made to me.</p>

               <p>But how did that apply to Mr. Jaques? - I thought some time or other it would come out.</p>

               <p>Upon what did you take him up, because something would come out in future? - I thought my suspicions were very strong at the time I took him up.</p>

               <p>Were they not equally strong on the 6th of December? - I think they were.</p>

               <p>Then, Sir, upon your oath, should you ever have commenced this prosecution against Mr. Jaques, if that action had been successful? - Upon my oath I should.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, it was his motion, and he called upon me to join with him in an affidavit, which was the 10th or 12th of November, he called upon me to make an affidavit in support of his cause.</p>

               <p>Whether the witness was not intimate with me till within a day of his apprehending me? whether he has not declared, during the dependance of that motion in the presence of Mr. Reeves, that he would swear to any thing to convict Mr. I'anson of perjury? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Whether he has not often declared that he looked upon an oath as a matter of form, and would swear to any thing to answer his purpose, I have witnesses, my Lord, to prove it? - Never, my Lord, never.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect his bringing you any note to cash? - No, it was Mr. Griffin's note for thirty pounds.</p>

               <p>To whom was it payable? - Upon my word I did not examine, I do not know.</p>

               <p>Should you know the note if you was to see it? - I should not.</p>

               <p>(Shews him the draught.) - Upon my word, till this time I neither knew whether it was a checque or note.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the gentlemen on the part of the prosecution very fairly say, they can carry this no further: if you have any doubt we must proceed to further investigation; if not, we cannot carry it any further.</p>

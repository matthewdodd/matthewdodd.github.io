            . I am patrol of St. Dunstan's in the West. On the evening of the 10th of February, I saw the prisoner in <placeName id="t18340220-206-crimeloc1177">Fleet-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What time was it? A. A quarter before nine in the evening - I am quite sure I saw him take it - I was close, following him with my toes to his heels - I know him perfectly well before, by having followed him in the street - when I first saw him I was on the opposite side of the way, and I directly ran across and followed him - the handkerchief was not out of the pocket when I crossed over - several persons came up and said,"Let him go;" and he screamed and brought several people, and caught hold of a post - there might be other persons passing at the time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LEWIS. I am the brother of Benjamin Lewis- I was walking with him in Fleet-street - he is too ill to attend here - our attention was called by Sparks - my brother returned with me - he immediately saw his handkerchief in the witness's hands, and claimed it as his property - I did not lose mine - the prisoner was near enough to hear him claim it - he attended before the magistrate next morning - he lives with me, and I know he had such a handkerchief as that.(John Blankly, hair-dresser, No. 5, Ritchbell-place, Lambs-conduit-street; and

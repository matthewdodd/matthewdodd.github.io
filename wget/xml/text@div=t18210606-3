At the lower part of the house there is a taproom in front, a bar behind, and then a parlour; a person can see from the taproom into the bar and parlour. My bed-room is over the parlour, it has a window looking into Noble-street, ten feet from the ground - there are three small bars to prevent children falling out, but there is room enough for a person to get in. I keep my money in a bureau in the bed-room. I had been ill sometime before, and had never seen the prisoners in my house till I recovered, I then saw them two or three times every day, up to the 25th, except one day, which was the 24th - they were always talking together, generally about horse dealing. My attention was called to them by something that was said to me. I am sure of their persons. On Sunday the 25th, I saw my bed-room between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the window was then shut down - the door was open. About eleven o'clock at night I was sitting in the parlour, and heard a bag of silver fall on the pavement in Noble-street - my wife had heard something before. About an hour before dark I saw the prisoners pass my door in conversation together.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard a bag of silver fall - A. Yes; I went round into Noble-street, but did not see anybody - my wife was in the passage. In consequence of what we heard we went up to the bed-room door, and found it fastened inside. I called the watchman, who broke the door open. I found the window sash forced open, and the drop which secured it, wrenched off, and thrown on the floor. I went to my bureau, and missed a bag, containing 40 l. in silver, and 190 l. in notes, and a cash-box gone; they were mostly 1 l. Bank notes - some 5 l. and some 10 l. I gave information next morning at Hatton Garden, and had placards posted about. I do not know the numbers of the notes. I did not see the prisoners again till the 17th of April, when I saw Saxton in Goswell-street, with another person, I ran down stairs, and followed him to the end of Wilderness-row, he saw me, and ran down Wilderness-row - I lost him in an instant, and upon turning round, I saw Redding, apparently, looking after him; I collared him immediately, and said I detained him on a charge of felony. He said,</p>
               <p>"What have I been doing?" I said</p>
               <p>"Have you not been in Goswell-street lately?" He denied having been there for three months. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why the last time I saw you you had a snuff-coloured coat on, a black handkerchief, and very large whiskers," He said he never had a black handkerchief round his neck in his life. Walters came up, and took him to Old-street watch-house. Upon searching his pockets two skeleton keys, and another key were found. I returned home for an hour and a half, when Saunders fetched me; we went, and saw Redding at the end of Brick-lane, Old-street, with another person. I have since discovered who that person was - they were taken to Old-street watch-house. Redding said,</p>
               <p>"This is a do, for the purpose of defrauding your creditors." I had not told him what he was taken for: he was rather obstinate about being secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Redding was taken very near your house, and very near his own - A. It is not far off. I had circulated bills about the robbery; the bills, by mistake, stated it to be the 24th, instead of the 25th. The names of Tunnicliffe and Barlow are over my door - I took the house of them, it has been in that name for years, and I let it remain, as I married Mrs. Tunnicliff's daughter. I have no regular time for paying my distiller.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Redding's sister-in-law - A. I know her since this affair, she occasionally dealt with me; I had received a 5 l. note from her shortly before I was robbed. I understood from her that the prisoner lived with her at No. 41, Compton-street. I have been and searched there. I have no recollection of his sister's coming to our house the day after the robbery. The servant was sent up stairs before the bag fell, and when it fell my wife, myself, and servant, all went up together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you know that Saxton lived in the neighbourhood - A. I do not. I had had the money about a fortnight. I keep the house now.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At the time of the robbery, were you in any difficulty - A. Not the least, I could pay 10 l. for every 1 l. I owe. I take about 20 l. a day. Redding's brother was with him when he was apprehended. I did not know the woman was his sister-in-law till after the robbery - she had repeatedly given me the name of Holmes.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Sunday night, the 25th of March, I was standing in the back room, about ten o'clock, and heard a crush in the room above, as if something was broken - I sent the servant, named

            , to ascertain what it was: she has left my service, and is not here. I saw the prisoner Saxton come in about the time I sent her up - I knew him before for about three weeks, while my husband was ill, I first saw him the day my husband was confined, he came every day, and Redding was along with him - I was perfectly acquainted with their persons. When the servant came down and spoke to me, my eye was still directed to the door, and I saw Saxton walk out; he had called for a glass of rum, which he sipped two or three times before he went - he paid for it. I went into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060006"></xptr>passage, near the parlour, for a bason, and as I waited by the table I heard a bag of silver drop on the ground, apparently, under the window - the stones are rough there. I heard Saxton cry</p>
               <p>"Stop!" I knew his voice. I stood still, and heard the shutters unfastening from the wall - they are kept in Noble-street, against the wall; they go upon hinges, and fasten back. I called out to know if any one was putting the shutters to, and was told they were not. I saw through the passage window the prisoner Redding descend by the aid of the iron bars at the window and the shutter, I could not see the iron bars, but I saw him on the shutter, the lappel of his coat caught on the top of the shutter, his side face was towards me, and he appeared holding something. I saw sufficient of him to be certain of his face, his back was towards the shutter. My husband was then dosing in an arm chair, with the infant in his arms. I said I was robbed, took a candle, ran up stairs, and found the door fastened within, that I could not enter; I came down again, and

            , who now lives with me, went up with me; I do not know when my husband came up, as we were in confusion; the watchman broke the door open, when we found the window up, and the property gone. While the prisoners frequented our house I never knew their names or residence. Saxton was going to say something at the office, but Redding said - Hush!</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you go out of the house - A. Yes; the nearest light in Noble-street, is about twenty or thirty yards from the house - they are common lamps, and very dull - it was a very dark night. I was in the passage when I heard the voice, and was looking at the window, which was shut; my husband was in the parlour, which does not look into Noble-street. I saw the cash-box about eleven o'clock in the morning, he sometimes keeps the key, and sometimes I do. When I saw Redding's sister, after his apprehension, I recollected her well; I had known her for years by the name of Cresley, and have changed her notes repeatedly. I did not know she was his sister till after the robbery. I have no doubt of Saxton being the man who came out of the window - I saw his face. He had a blue great coat on, and a white handkerchief. I did not know his name - we called him the horse-dealer. I described them to the officers next morning, and we published a bill with a description of their persons. The cash-box and bag were found empty in the City-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What sort of a passage is this - A. A narrow one; two candles stood on the table, opposite the window, the outside of the window was dark. I did not suspect any robbery at first, but thought a drunken man might have fallen down; I was a yard or two from the window. My late servant now lives in the neighbourhood, and I could have had her here if I liked. On the Thursday before there was upwards of 500 l. there; we take from 25 l. to 50 l. a day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you such a sight, as to be sure it was Redding - A. Quite certain. The other prisoner originally wore a snuff-coloured coat, and sometimes a black handkerchief. I did not bring my servant, being dissatisfied with her, as she was dishonest. We were not behind hand - we pay ready money for every thing.</p>

I am cousin to Mrs. Barlow, I live with her; I remember the prisoners, they came to the house regularly every day for about three weeks, once or twice a day; Saxton was generally drest in a snuff-coloured coat, and black silk handkerchief; the other wore a dark long coat. I was serving in the bar, I heard nothing, but about five minutes before the robbery, Saxton came in and had a glass of rum - I served him, he drank it at the bar, and was there four or five minutes. Mrs. Barlow called out from the passage, to know if the girl was shutting the shutters, I said No! and the girl said so too. Mrs. Barlow and I went up and tried the door - it was fast, and we came down. Mr. Barlow was in the parlour, and

I answered my cousin first, as I knew she was not shutting that shutter in the bar window. Mrs. Barlow asked if she was shutting the passage shutter. Parker remained in the house for a week after - we found the room rifled on entering it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was she shutting the shutter under the bed-room window, or lower down - A. Lower down, she was shutting the nearest window to Goswell-street. She was examined by the Magistrate once; I think it was at the third examination. She was five yards or more from the passage window.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did your cousin say that night, that she had seen any one at the window - A. Yes, and that she knew him.</p>

I said he was at Barlow's house drinking, he said he believed he was once or twice - I went to search him; Mr. Barlow was present, and said, you have been in my house several times; he said he did not recollect being there more than once or twice. He took off his coat and threw it down, in the pocket I found three keys; I asked what the middle key was, he said it belonged to his room door. I asked where he lived, he paused some time, then said he could not tell the street - I also found a knife in the same pocket. I was present when Redding was brought in by Saunders, and I took his brother who was with him; the prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"That is him," pointing to Redding; Redding said in reply,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I am a gentleman, I will make you remember this, I will bring an action against you;" he gave his name as Richards, his brother gave his as Jones, they would not tell where they lived. I asked Redding if he knew Saxton, who was locked up behind - he did not see him, he said he did not, and had not been at Barlow's with him. I sent them to the office in a coach, and took Saxton myself, and asked if he knew Jones or Richards (he had not seen them) he said, No. The Magistrate was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060007"></xptr>not sitting, and I took them all to another watch-house; they appeared strange to each other, and still gave their names as Jones, Richards, and Saxton.

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 26th of March, I was informed of this robbery, the prosecutor and his wife described the persons they suspected; the prisoner's height answers the description, but not their dress. I examined the premises, and went in search with the prosecutor several nights and days to look for them; he said he should know them if he saw them; his wife said she saw one of them drinking in the house, and the other descend from the window. On the 17th of April, in consequence of what the prosecutor said, I went to St. Luke's watch-house, and saw Saxton; he asked for pen and ink, and paper, which was given him; the bellman came by for the letters, he gave the paper through the hole, saying, it was too late to send it by post - it was written upon, I produce it (reads)</p>
               <p>"Dear James, I am taken on suspicion of the robbery, come to me at Worship-street office." I afterwards went with Barlow and Walters to the corner of Brick-lane, Old-street, Barlow pointed Redding out, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man." I collared him, and Walters took the other man who was in company with him; I searched him, and found a watch, a handkerchief, and knife; he refused to give his name, and asked what he was charged with, I said with felony; when he got to the watch-house, I told him the charge, he said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose the brewer or distiller is bad," Barlow said he owed no one a shilling; he gave the name of

             at the office; the other said his name was Jones - I afterwards discovered they were both brothers; he said he knew no such person as Saxton. They all three told the Magistrate they had no residence, they were asked where they slept the night before, Saxton said, at No. 27, King-street, Soho; Jones said, in Carey-street, Deptford, and Richards said, at Shadwell; I enquired at No. 27, King-street, Soho, they knew no such person - it is a respectable house. I examined the premises the morning after the robbery; the bed-room window is about ten feet five inches from the ground, the bars would be an assistance to them, the top of the shutter is three feet from the window, they could stand on it and easily get in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Cowes, Isle of Wight, and am a solicitor—I have an office in London, at 22, Ely Place—Machin was in my service for seven months—she disappeared on 23rd June—I go down from London always on Friday night, and arrive there by the last boat, and return to London on Monday morning—I found she had left on 23rd June, shortly before I got there—I missed account books, a bag containing about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also missed some receipts for money, a jar of gin which I had from Smith and Co., about 4 gallons; and nearly a <hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi> of groceries, and all the pork—I had a great number of pigs—I missed all my provisions, two silver forks, and a great quantity of sugar; I should think a cwt. altogether—I missed account books—I have seen nothing since, except the account books and a box which had been sent to George Clarke—it was found on his premises, and I identified it—it was a peculiar box, with curious nails—I received this letter from Machin on the Wednesday after she left on the Friday—"Tuesday. Dear sir. I was so ill yesterday I could not go for you, but, with your kind permission, I will be at 22, Ely Place, at 7 o'clock precisely to-night. I trust you will not be too angry with me. I have suffered enough for my imprudence. Your lost Lizzy. I am staying with a young woman I used to work with in Oxford Street"—I wrote this letter, dated 27th June, in reply, telling her to come to Ely Place at once—I also received this letter from her on Tuesday, 26th June—"I am quite ashamed to write to you after my bad conduct, and I suppose you don't care to see me, do you? I am very ill, my back is so bad I can scarcely move. That woman next door nearly drove me mad when she came; she said I was</p>

On Saturday morning I would have given worlds to have been back with you. I came across by the 8 o'clock boat, and stopped at the Temperance Hotel. I am miserable. Will you write to me at New North Street, and I will call for the letter. I will be sure to come on Tuesday next and settle accounts; if you will allow me, I will come and make up my accounts with you. I am sorry I made myself so wickedly foolish. I had no idea of it at 4 o'clock p.m. "She came to the office on Wednesday, at 7 o'clock—I asked her where she had been living—she said at a coffee-shop—I asked what she had done with the boxes she had taken away—she said they were at 29, New North Street—I gave her in custody—the detective told her what it was for, in my presence—I don't think she made any reply—we went down; the detective and the prisoner got' into a cab, and I got on the box to go with them to make the charge—the detective, who is employed in Ely Place, communicated some<lb></lb>thing to me—Clarke came up as the detective spoke—I, riding outside the cab, saw that he followed to the station-house—the inspector was not there to take the charge, and I went with Detective Wakefield to 29, New North Street; to try to find the boxes; we found that they had been taken away in a truck by a person answering the description of Clarke—we then went back to the station, and saw him still outside—he was called in and asked his name, and he said "George Clarke"—he refused to say where he lived, where he worked, what he had been doing for the last six months, and most positively denied that he had touched the boxes, or moved them away in a truck—he was also asked whether he lived at 7, Holy well Lane, Shoreditch, and he most positively said he did net—he afterwards admitted that he had taken the boxes and moved them away in a truck from New North Street, where she told me they were taken to, and he refused to state where he had taken them to—the female prisoner wished to give up the boxes, and he said "Recollect, if you do they will find the letters"—she did not do so, and we have not been able to discover the letters—I learnt afterwards that the boxes had been sent to 7, Holy well Lane, and I went there and found this box only, and a letter to a Mrs. Spranklin, signed "Lizzie"—nothing was found on the female prisoner but the two account books, and the letters that I had written to her—the books were account books of fruit sold, and the other is an account of milk—she was housekeeper in my service—I keep a great many gardeners—I have a cottage residence, and a very considerable quantity of land—she had no right to take those account books.</p>

I was on duty in Lambeth Walk about 11 o'clock—I was called into a house—I found the prisoner lying on a bed in a back parlour, evidently in much pain—a little child was in the same room, vomiting into a pail—the name of the child was Rose Alice Catherall, about six years of age—I took them both to the workhouse, where they were treated by the resident surgeon—I was told to be at the work-house about 1 o'clock on the same day, and then I took the prisoner into custody—on her way to the Police Court she made a statement—she said "I left my apartments this morning, what things I had I sold, and the rest I gave away, and I fully intended doing this"—I had told her that she would be charged at the station with attempting to murder the child and with attempting to commit suicide—she said "I bought oxalic acid for myself, and precipitate powder for the child"—she said "The child's father has ruined me, and this is my revenge"—I took her to the station—I searched the room—I found this cup and spoon and two packets—the precipitate powder was all used, but there was a little oxalic acid in the blue paper—I also found her rent-book—she had left her apartments that morning, and paid her rent.</p>

Wilfully, "What for?"—"I have my reasons for saying so"—she said she had her reasons and took it for revenge—when I saw her on the bed the child was standing in the front parlour—she was sick—I saw signs of that down her face.</p>

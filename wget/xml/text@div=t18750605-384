On the morning of the 11th May I was on duty in Newport Street, near Newport Market, and saw Hinds in company with another man, not Horton—they crossed from Earl's Court up Newport Street and turned to the right—as soon as I detected them Hinds ran down Market Street towards the Refuge; I followed—the other man ran away towards Lichfield Street—I saw Hinds drop a quantity of dress skirts from under his coat—he ran into No. 6, Market Street; I followed him shortly afterwards, as soon as I got assistance—I found him lying on the top of the attic stairs, apparently asleep—I asked—what he wanted there; he said "Only having a <hi rend="italic">dos</hi>," meaning a sleep—I took him to the station and charged him with having these things in his possession; he said he was innocent and denied all knowledge of it—when I first saw him he was about two minutes' walk from the prosecutor's house and was coming in a direction from it—these are the things I saw him drop.</p>

On the morning of 11th May I saw Horton coming through a court called the Hop Gardens, leading from St. Martin's Court into Bedfordbury, with four or five others—when they saw me they turned and ran away—I followed and caught Horton; I asked him why they were running away—he said he was running home to Great Earl Street, Seven Dials—they were coming in an opposite direction when I first saw them—I saw that he was carrying something under his coat and asked him what he had there, and he produced this dress and jacket—he said they had been given to him by a prostitute—I took him to the station and charged him with the unlawful possession—the prosecutor afterwards identified the property—Horton then said he was passing by the shop and saw the shutters down and things lying on the pavement, and he picked them up—he after<lb></lb>wards said he saw some young men pulling the shutters down and taking these things; that they dropped them, and he picked them up and thought would take them home.</p>

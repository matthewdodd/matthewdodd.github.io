               <p>Q. Did you know her before. - A. I have seen her before, but I never spoke to her; she says, I wish you would be so good as to give me a glass of gin, I says the price of a glass of gin is no object to me, I put my hand into my pocket and took out about twopence halfpenny, and gave it to her; she kept intruding and followed me, I said, my girl, I do not want any thing to do with you, my wife and family lives about here; I live at about the middle of Sun Alley in Christopher's Court, I went by there to go to Red Lion market, as I had the care of some old houses there; I most times go there to see the things are safe of a night; this girl came after, and says, Sir, I with you would be so good as to give me something for a bit of supper, I have only a few halfpence; she came very close to me, I told her to get off, she says pray give me a few halfpence for my supper, and while I was putting my hand into my waistcoat pocket, she pulled my watch out and ran off where there were two or three people standing at the Red Lion passage, I never saw the watch again; on the next morning I went out in the market, thinking very likely I might see the person; she came out of Whitecross-street with: child in her arms, I passed her on her left side, I looked over my shoulder, I saw her look over her left shoulder and smile, I watched her into the house at the corner of the market where I had seen the people standing, and there I challenged her with it; she denied it, she said that if she had my watch she would have a better pair of shoes to her feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been so late, were you drunk or sober. - A. I was not drunk nor sober, I was what you may call a little lively, I had a little revived myself; I followed her then into the house, I told my boy to go to Philips the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the man, nor was I out so late at night.</p>

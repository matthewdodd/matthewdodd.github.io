I saw the prisoner take an eighteen gallon cask of beer off Messrs. Charrington's dray and place it on his own - another man assisted him The dray was standing still at the time. He drove towards home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. - Q. Have you never said that it was dark - A. It was towards dusk. I was thirty or forty yards from the dray - the letter T was chalked on the cask; I said nothing to him, but informed Mr. Basset, the cask inspectors, eleven or twelve days after, a bill was posted up, offering a reward of 5 l., that lead me to him.</p>
               <p>Q. That induced you to go him - A. That lead me to him; but it was not particularly for the money. I only know the prisoner by sight. I have called at his house. He is a brewer. I have been at work nearly all the winter. When I have no work on my own account, I do journey-work.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was the reward offered for this theft in particular - A. No; for any person stealing casks. I was attending a Captain, who I expected to go abroad with, which prevented my giving information, for if I had gone abroad I could not have given evidence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to the drayman and tell him the cask was stolen - A. No; I do not know whether it was the draymen who assisted him, I thought he was aware of it, so I did not tell him.</p>

            . I am an Excise officer. I was at the prisoner's premises, in York-street, Pentonville, on the 14th of 15th of February, and saw an eighteen gallon cask of Charrington's there, full of beer - their name was on it. I asked him how he came by it. He said he had it from Swain, a brewer, in Somers Town; I put a chalk mark on it. There was the letter T on it besides; I saw it again the next day empty, and placed it in a corner; Messrs. Charington's name was still on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does it not frequently happen that casks get mixed - Q. Yes. I survey his premises every day.</p>

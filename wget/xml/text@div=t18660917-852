                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Ince's Terrace, 'Angel Place, Strat<lb></lb>ford—I was in the service of, Mr. Courteney—on Saturday, 18th August, in the middle of the day, I took out a perambulator, with the deceased child in it—I went into a house to leave a parcel—I left the perambulator on the stones close to the kerb in the carriage road—I thought it would be more dangerous on the pavement, as the pavement gose on a slant, and if any one had touched it, it might have gone down into the middle of the road—the road is macadamised, and there are stones on each side—when I came out of the house from leaving the parcel I found the perambulator and the child gone—I made inquiries, and afterwards went with the child to the doctor's in a cab.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bailiff of the Bow County Court, and live in Esmond Road, North Bow—on Saturday afternoon, 18th August, I was coming down Water Lane, Stratford, into the Romford Road—I heard somebody call out, "Hoy!" or, "Look out!" or something of that kind, which attracted my attention—I looked round, and saw a waggon drawn by four horses approaching the perambulator, which was standing close to the kerb—I should say the waggon was coming between four and five miles an hour—there is six or eight feet of paving on each side of the road there, and the centre is macadamised—I Saw the waggon go up against the perambulator—the forewheel struck it and turned it over—I went and turned the perambulator up, and found the dead body of a child—I believe the waggon had diverged a trifle from the course in which it was originally coming, about a foot towards the centre of the road, as if it had turned out of the way—that was either with the intention of clearing it, or after the collision, I could not tell—I did not see who had command of the horses</p>

               <p>of the waggon—it was pulled up as soon as possible after the accident, and the prisoner waited till a constable came up—he was perfectly sober, and greatly excited—he seemed to feel his position very acutely—he seemed to be suffering very acutely indeed from the results of the accident.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He showed all the sorrow that a man would show under the circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—I asked him his name, and he gave it at once—it was a very heavy waggon indeed, used for the cartage of animal manure—I should think it would hold six or eight tons—I believe the driver's seat is very high up, and the driving seat would reach nearly up to his hips, if he was sitting—they were very strong horses—my attention was not drawn to the prisoner at all until I saw him on the pave<lb></lb>ment after the accident—the horses were two and two, and the reins reached to the four horses' heads—when I first looked I should think the waggon was five or six yards from the perambulator—I could not see whether there was time for the driver to get out of the way at the distance I was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, at No. 3, South Place, Finsbury—on Saturday afternoon, 18th August, I was in the Romford Road—I saw a perambulator standing in the road near the kerb, and a waggon drawn by four horses coming towards it—when I first saw it I fancy it must have been twenty yards from the perambulator—it was going at a very slow pace, not exceeding two and a half miles an hour—I did not observe the driver—I did not see the waggon strike the peram<lb></lb>bulator—shortly after I had passed it I heard a shout, and looked round, and saw the second near wheel of the waggon catching up the peram<lb></lb>bulator, and giving it a rotatory motion—I ran back, with my son, who was with me, and saw the perambulator upset, and the body of a child, with its blood and brains on the stones—the child was fastened in the perambulator—the last witness rushed up and unfastened it, and it was taken away in a cab—I saw the prisoner—he was perfectly sober, and deeply affected.</p>

I live at No. 52, Cross Street, Borough—on this Saturday afternoon I saw the waggon, drawn by four horses, coming along the Romford Road—the prisoner was in it, and a little boy with him, about ten years old—he was on the seat of the waggon—the boy had hold of the reins—I saw the perambulator in the road—the front horse of the waggon had just cleared it, when I first saw it—I called out to the prisoner—he caught the reins out of the boy's hands, and tried to stop the horses, but it was too late, and the perambulator was turned over.</p>

Mr. Grew's Servant deposed, that he saw the Door safe at 11 at Night, and that the former Evidence called him up at 3 in the Morning, when the Padlock was gone, and that the Prisoner being ask'd for it, said, the Person who was with him in the Lane had it. The Prisoner denied the Fact, and said that he has a Wife in St. Thomas's Hospital, and a Child at Nurse in Southwark, and that going along they seized him, and ask'd him for the Lock, and what was become of the Man that was with him; to which he reply'd he had no Body with him, nor knew nothing of the Lock; and that if they had lost one, the Man whom they talkt of might have it.

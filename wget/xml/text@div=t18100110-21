About five weeks ago, I cannot tell the day of the month; it was by the coffee house in Covent Garden; she had something in her lap, what it was I did not know at the time. She asked me if I could recommend her to a lodging; I told her I did not know any. I took her home to where I lodged; when she went home with me, she asked my landlady if she could lend her two shillings, she told her, no; I went and pledged a handkerchief for her that evening for eightpence; I left it at a public-house for her; I got no money, she wanted something to drink. In the morning I pledged the lace for a pound at Mr. Flemmings, in Fetter-lane, and there were three gowns, a petticoat, a shift, and handkerchiefs; she went with me when I pledged them at Mr. Flemmings; I got one pound fourteen shillings upon them. There were two pair of stockings, and two handkerchiefs, I pledged for seven shillings at the same place; and one pair of stockings, and three handkerchiefs, for five shillings, at Turner's, in Brydges-street.

             and the prisoner, confessed to me what they had done with the property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Have you seen all them articles that Mr. Lumley has produced. - A. Yes; all is my property but this cotton gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good to mention what things there are there. - A. There are three pair of silk stockings, one cotton gown, a muslin gown, two shifts, eight handkerchiefs, a black lace cloak, and a shawl. The black lace cloak cost me eighteen pounds at first, I have had it two years; I cannot say what it is worth now; my shifts cost me sixteen shillings each. The black lace cloak was in my apartment, the handkerchiefs and shawl were in the wash, I know they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated when I took these things. Mrs. Priestly persuaded me to leave my home, and live with her upon the town, and she would take a lodging for her and me: she has got a girl now in the hospital that lived with her. That woman that took me to her place, she took a shawl and brought in some gin and victuals; she pledged all the things herself, and when the money was gone she turned me out. I was in the watch-house two nights. She went to this woman and sold the tickets; she said, if the tickets were found I should be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

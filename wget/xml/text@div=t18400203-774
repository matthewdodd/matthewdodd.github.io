                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. James Towers, of Jamaica-level, Bermondsey. The prisoner was employed there—on the evening of the 21st of January he was on the premises—my master stopped him, and de<lb></lb>sired me to search him—I took this bundle from his pocket, which con<lb></lb>tained three pairs of upper leathers for shoes—I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodging, at No. 2, Cherry Garden-street, where I found some pieces of leather, which are my master's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. These uppers you gave me in the morning—they were not marked—I asked if you wished to have them back, and you said, "No, never mind"—I put them on a shelf, and when I went home to dinner my wife said, "Give me more binding"—I put these into my pocket to take home—I never intended to steal them. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. It is not so—my master has every thing entered previous to leaving the premises—the prisoner's wife had eight pairs by her at that time—this property found at his lodging he had no right to have—I remember any master buying twenty dozen of these skins—they were given to me, and I gave them out, as they were wanted to be cut up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. They never belonged to Mr. Towers—I bought them of a manufacturer who was, going to Wales. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I can swear they be<lb></lb>long to Mr. Towers—I found this sole in his lodging, which has our mark on it, and here is the stamp it was marked with.</p>

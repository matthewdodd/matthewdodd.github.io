                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Littlewood, and live at Feltham. On the morning of the 12th of March I was at my own door, and saw the prisoners playing before our house—Collins came up and asked me for a nail for his spin-top—I said I had not got one, my master was not at home—he turned the corner of my house—I shut my door, and went out to my neighbours—in a few minutes I came back, and missed my money from the drawer—there had been thirty-three fourpenny-pieces, and some sixpences and shillings—they were safe not five minutes before—the money was wrapped up in these boxes.</p>

I was called by Mrs. Little<lb></lb>wood—I received information, took Collins, and locked him up—Scott had made his escape from Little wood—he showed me some marks in the garden—I went to the cage again, and found Collins wiping his feet—I made him go to the garden and put his foot down by the side of the marks that had been made, and they corresponded exactly—they were marks of bare feet, and his toes were open—the garden leads to the house by a back door, and there were some bricks broken off the wall where they got over—it was about three o'clock in the afternoon—the marks appeared recently made—there had been a heavy rain the night before, but it was very dry that morning.</p>

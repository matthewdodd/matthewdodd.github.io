I had promised him two more to clean; I paid him for the one and gave him the other two to clean; this was about the 12th of May, I never saw him again till he was in custody I had no suspicion for three months, but being in the neighbourhood one day, I saw the shop altered for another business, and him gone. I never gave him leave to pawn them; if I supposed he would have pawned them, he should not have had them; one was a gold repeater, worth twenty guineas, and the other was a gilt watch.</p>

            . I did not find the duplicate on him, but received it from Mr. Richards, of Bridgewater-square; he said that the duplicate of Perkins' watch was at Richards's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley rose the same objection as Mr. Brodrick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Richards persuaded me to take a shop in the City; my friends promised me money to commence business, but did not fulfil that promise. I was obliged to have goods on credit, and sold them on credit; sea captains frequented the shop, I took their bills, which were dishonoured. I was arrested for 22 l. and pawned the watch to give the officers money to leave the house till the afternoon, when I should have the money. I could not redeem it, and next day had an execution in my house, I gave Richards the duplicates, hoping to redeem them, but never had it in my power.</p>

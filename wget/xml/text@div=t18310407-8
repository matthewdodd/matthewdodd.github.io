            . I live in the same house with the prosecutor; it is kept by Fallshaw. OR the 18th of February I was at home in my own room, which is under Castle's room; I heard somebody up stairs in his room - I heard his door open, which is the next door to Brown's room; there is a latch to Castle's room, but none to Brown's - I heard Castle's latch go; I had heard the key fall, by which I was satisfied that it was Castle's door - the prisoners at that time were both together in Brown's room; I had heard them go up stairs together about a quarter of an hour before - I am sure two persons went up; I did not see them, but after hearing this I saw them both come down stairs - Bird came down first and went out, and in about ten minutes Brown came down and went out; I did not observe whether either of them carried any thing out - they were both in liquor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you speak to either of them? A. No; I followed them down stairs - I came down after Brown and after Bird; I merely saw their backs, and did not observe their faces - they were very tipsy in the evening, and they were tipsy at that time; I saw Bird afterwards in the evening, about six o'clock, and then saw her face; it was between three and four o'clock that I saw her going down stairs.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you or the other officer asked Bird for her keys? A. I was the only officer employed; Bird's drawers and places were all opened - she gave me one key; her drawers were not locked -Mrs. Fallshaw searched them, and 6s. were found in them.</p>

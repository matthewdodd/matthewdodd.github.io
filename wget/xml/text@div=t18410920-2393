                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Andrew Caldecott, as Manchester warehousemen, in Cheapside. The prisoner was our head-porter, and had been in our service from twelve to fourteen years—he was entrusted with money for booking goods which were sent out—he had what is called a parcel-book, which is here—I always gave him money myself, beforehand, for the purpose of disbursing in that way—we occa<lb></lb>sionally settled accounts—when we did so the parcel-book was always brought to me, and he balanced his account to me as well as he could—we could not do so exactly, but we always came to within 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I looked down the sums paid, and saw that the total amount was right—here is an entry in this book on the 26th of June, in the prisoner's hand-writing—"26th June. Collins, of Chelsea, by cart, 284 pieces as three trusses," for which he would pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has entered here 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as paid—I set<lb></lb>tled that account on the footing of his having paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is the custom for each carrier to receive 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with each truss—this is signed by Rendell's carrier—the custom is when goods are delivered and payment made, for the party who receives the goods to put his signature in the last column, and when I see that signature, I take it for granted that he has</p>

               <p>actually received the money it is signed for—I know goods were dis<lb></lb>patched that day to Collins, of Chelsea—I know from the entering book that such packages went—I cannot say that I saw them go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> That is not my figure in the book—there are four porters besides me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> We have four other porters, but they never account to me in the same manner—I looked to no one but the prisoner for any settlement, nor have I for twelve years past, except perhaps once a year when he has been out for a holiday—the settlement of the amount in ques<lb></lb>tion would not be made, perhaps, for a week afterwards—I can undertake to swear it was with him personally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William and Thomas Ren<lb></lb>dell, Chelsea carriers, and have been so for two years—I have been in the habit of calling at the prosecutor's for parcels—I called there on the 26th of June, took three trusses, and signed the book—here is my signature, "Rendell"—the name of my employer—the prisoner paid me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., when I signed that book—I am quite sure of that—it was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for each truss—I entered the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. myself in the book, and then signed it—there was no 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the column when I signed it—I always sign my employer's name—I have signed the book before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> There are four porters, and the books go out with the carts occasionally—sometimes they go out at three or four o'clock in the afternoon, and I receive them the next morning about nine o'clock—they go through various persons' hands, and the till where I keep my money is as open to any one else as for me—the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. might have been put down, and the parties who did it might help themselves, as the till was never shut.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> No one but the prisoner had to make dis<lb></lb>bursements—he kept the money in a drawer, to which he could have had a lock if he chose—I did not know till lately that there was not one—I understand him to say, that some of the porters might have taken 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of his till, and entered 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his book, so as to make the money square with his disbursements—he keeps the books—the entry in question is his hand<lb></lb>writing, all but the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the carrier's signature—the total amount at the bottom of the page is by a clerk—I cannot swear to the handwriting of the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner paid the money for all the bookings—the prisoner would have the benefit of the introduction this 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into the book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Some time since one of Davis's lads was caught, by one of my fellow-servants, taking something out of my till—he was taxed with it, and said he had only taken 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two or three months back I lost a sovereign out of the till—I never knew how it went, and I had to make it good. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I recollect, in one settlement with the prisoner, he could not account, by a sovereign, for his balance—I said of course he must expect to make it good, and I suppose he did so, as his balance came right another time—but it is longer ago than he states—all the other porters could go to the books.</p>

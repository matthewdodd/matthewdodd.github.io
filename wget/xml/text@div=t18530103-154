                  </hi>. A short time ago I was living at the Golden Horse public house—I took that house through an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi>—in consequence of the advertisement I called on the defendant Wynn—I told him I had seen and advertisement in the paper of a public house called the Red Lion, in Great Wild-street, and it stated that the man was going to Australia or something of that sort—he gave me a ticket to go and view it—I went and saw it—he also gave me a ticket to see the Golden Horse at the same time—I saw the Red Lion first—I went over it, but did not like the character of the house, and declined to take it—I then called at the Golden Horse, in Theobald's-road—I have not got the ticket he gave me to view it—I destroyed it—I destroyed it—the ticket was to the effect that the Golden Horse was to be let, rent and taxes included, at 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; lease, ten years and a half; premium, 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and doing 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month—Mrs. Paxton showed me over the house; I liked the appearance of it—I saw Mr. Wynn again the following morning, at his office, 7, Sidney-street, City-road; it is a small broker's office, like the generality of brokers' office—I agreed to take possession on the following Thursday—I think it must have been the 29th Aug. that I saw him again at his office; it was either the 28th or 29th, I am not certain which—I told him that I preferred the Golden Horse of the two; he said it was a very nice little house, and he had no doubt a man could do very well there—he accompanied me down, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Paxton—Mr. Wynn introduced me, saying he thought he had brought a purchaser, and accordingly I went in—Paxton said there was a lease—I do not know exactly what passed between Paxton and myself on that occasion, but it was very trifling; he did not seem to be the person that looked to the business; his wife seemed</p>

               <p>to be the business part altogether—I did not go over the house again, I was satisfied—in going down, Wynn told me that if I liked he could get me the house for 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was asked 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the first place, and I thought it was very cheap, and was going to give that sum for it—I made no deposit at Paxton's house; that was at my own apartment, on the same day—we agreed there, and I agreed to take possession on the following Thursday—Wynn was with me when I paid the deposit—my wife was also present—Wynn acted as my broker, and as Paxton's too—when I paid him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit I told him I would prefer my own broker—he said there was no occasion for employing another broker, as it was purchased by the lump—he made out that he could do the business for both of us, and that would make the thing more reasonable—therefore as I thought he was a respectable man I <hi rend="italic">gave in</hi> directly that he was to do it—the purchase was to be settled on 2nd Sept., the Thursday, at the Golden Horse, when I took possession—I went there on the Thursday, took my goods, and took possession—Mr. Young, a collector at Messrs. Gardner's brewery, and Mr. Shand, a collector at Messrs. Curtis' distillery, were present—Mr. Wynn and Mr. Paxton were there, and the gauger to gauge the spirits, whose name I forget—he was to gauge the spirits for both of us—Mr. Young was there gauging the beer, and Mr. Shand, the distiller's clerk, was there seeing to the stock, because they took to the stock; it was to remain on the premises for me; it was what is termed a transfer—all the goods on the premises belong to the brewer or the distiller, and they transfer it from one person to the other; that is the custom of the trade—this is the account that was made out by Wynn—(<hi rend="italic">this being read stated the items of the purchase, and the deduction for the stock, making the balance payable by the prosecutor to Paxton of</hi> 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—there is an item of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, which I paid to Wynn for the brokerage—I got this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Paxton, at the Golden Horse—it was given me along with that which is called the lease—it was to certify that the lease was all right, and that Paxton had paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it is a receipt—when Wynn gave it me he said, "This is the receipt for the making up of the lease"—he said Paxton had paid for it, and that was the receipt (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Received this 15th March, 1852, of Mr. John Paxton, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., being charges in respect of the lease of the Golden Horse public house, Theobald's-road, Bloomsbury, granted by the executors of the late Mr. Howe to Mr. Rosson. <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">J. W. ILIFF</hi>, for <hi rend="smallCaps">H. DREW</hi>")—I think Mrs. Paxton took the lease out of a drawer, and said, "This is the lease," and Wynn said, "Oh, yes, sir, this is the lease, shall I read it for you? or you can read it yourself if you like"—I am not a very clever reader of writing, so I told Mr. Wynn I should trust entirely to his honour and respectability to read it for me, and he read it, but I find there is a clause in it that he never read to me—I attended to it as he read it over; he read it aloud, part of it very loud—here is a proviso at the bottom of this page, "Provided also, and it is hereby agreed and declared, that it shall be lawful for either of the parties hereto, or his or their representatives, to determine the term hereby granted at Christmas-day, 1852, or upon Christmas-day in any subsequent year thereof, by giving to the other party a notice of his or their intention, such notice to be given on or before the Midsummer-day next preceding the intended determination, to be given to the said executors, or left for them at their respective usual or last known places of abode"—a part of that was read over to me, but not all—I remember that part about notice to be given on or before the Midsummer-day next preceding the day of the intended determination, but that part about giving up possession at Christmas, 1852, was not mentioned; nothing whatever was read about</p>

               <p>Christmas—I was not told by either of them that any notice had been given to determine the tenancy at Christmas, 1852, or else of course I should not have taken it—I was not told by either of them, at any time, that notice to quit at Christmas had been given—I paid the balance according to their statement, and took possession of the premises—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given me by Wynn, as an inventory of the goods there—about two months after this two gentlemen called on me respecting my quitting the premises—I do not know who they were—they came respecting the house and yard; it appears that the place was put up by auction—they told me they were in treaty for the house—in consequence of what they said I went to Wynn, and told him that there had been a party from him looking at the house, and one was a lawyer's clerk, who came to see his friend righted—I told Wynn it appeared the lease was a complete failure, and that I was liable to be turned out at a moment's notice; that the lawyer's clerk who read it told me I had no more right behind the bar than he had, and that I was to quit at Christmas—he said I had no right to have shown the lease till I had got a deposit—Wynn was negotiating for me—I told him the business did not suit me, I wanted to sell it—I showed the parties who came for the lease, and they found out the clause that was in the lease, and told me of it—one week I took 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the house, and I have taken as low as 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I wanted to dispose of it, because I should have soon been in the workhouse; it did not produce 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, it did not produce more than 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—about a month before Christmas Mr. Linder, the executor, called and asked me if I was ready to quit at Christmas—I do not think I saw Wynn after that—I saw Paxton two or three days after Mr. Linder called on me—I found him at a public house at the comer of Robert-street, Little James-street; he was smoking his pipe: it was at night, after he had done work (I had called the evening before that, and seen him at his own house)—I asked him to come out, and to come to the door, that I wanted to speak to him, and I told him that Mr. Linder said I must leave at Christmas, and that a person of the name of Holmer, a wheelwright, had bought the property, and paid a deposit of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, and he had taken possession of the yard, but of course he could not take possession of the house till I was out of it—I asked him if he would come to any arrangement, that it was hard for me to lose all—he told me he had no money—I asked him what had become of all the money I had paid him—he said he had paid it away, that he had borrowed 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he went into the house, and during the time he was in it, he had managed to pay it back, out of the profits, I understood him; and about two or three minutes after he told me he had lost 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it—I told him if he did not come to some arrangement I should take proceedings against him—he told me that he was taken in; he was sorry to see me there, of course, but he would not come to any terms with me, and when I said I should take proceedings against him he smiled, and said, "Well, I might do the best I could," or something of that sort—I think he said he had borrowed the money of his mother—I told him he had had notice to quit in June, and he ought to have told me that—he said he did not take any notice of the notice—he mentioned something about the lease after I had spoken to him about the notice that he had had—he said, "What a rascally thing that lease was"—that was all he said—I have had two brokers to value the things in the inventory.</p>

               <p>he said he had paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for the place than I did—I was a publican before I took these premises, and had been so three or four years—the part of the clause of the lease that I remember Wynn's reading to me, was about the notice to be given on or before the Midsummer day preceding the day of the intended determination of the term, and the notice to be left at the executor's last known place of abode—nothing was read about Christmas day, that was left out entirely—that I swear—after the lease was read by Wynn it was put down on the table—I had signed an agreement which Wynn made out before that, which my lawyer has—I forget exactly whether it was signed before or after the lease was read—it was given to Paxton—I believe Paxton paid for it—it was signed the same evening, 28th August, I think—as far as I remember, it was after Wynn had read the lease out—I have had the paper called the lease ever since—I do not know whether Mr. Knight is here to-day, I have not brought him—I heard from Paxton that Knight had told him he was to take no notice of the notice, and I went to Mr. Knight, and asked him—he lives in Carnaby-market—Mr. Holmer told me he gave 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the premises, for the lease of the lot, and that he paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on it—I am not able to say how much of the stock I had consumed from 28th August to 2nd December—I went to my lawyer about this as soon as I found I was in <hi rend="italic">fix</hi>—that was about three weeks ago—the lawyer went to a Magistrate—I have not been before a Magistrate; I come here to tell my story for the first time, to-day—I was not generally in the habit of getting drunk in this house—publicans are liable to it, now and then—I did not get so every day; I do not suppose I was drunk above three or four times while I was there—I have been a little inebriated, but not to say drunk—that was not every day—I really cannot say how often I have been drunk or inebriated since I have had these premises—I did not take any notice of it, I do not put down day and date for such a thing as that—I have seen Mr. Knight on this subject—I saw him last about eight or ten days ago, and I saw him about three weeks ago, and spoke to him about Paxton's notice—I have not seen him very often, I dare say I have seen him four or five times during the time I was in the house, not more—Paxton <hi rend="italic">showed</hi> nothing in the business; he did not tell me he had been a carpenter at Cubitt's—I have since learned that he was for years a carpenter at Cubitt's—I have not had to say a right offer made to me for the house when the lawyer's clerk came; I had an offer of 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, after I found out that I was to quit at Christmas, and I told the man I could not let it—I did not tell him I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not, I told him I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> not let it; I could not, it was out of my power—he made me an offer of 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through his broker—I told him I could not take it; he came the following day himself, and I mentioned the transaction to him, and said, "Why, I have been taken in in this house, and it won't do, and I shan't, or can't, let it"—I swear that was all I told him—that conversation was since Mr. Linder the executor called on me—I found out in less than a fortnight that the business did not answer—I advertised it about three months ago, but not since—the broker advertised it in November, I do not remember its being advertised in December—I do not remember authorizing the broker to advertise it in December, I might have done so, but I do not think it was in December—I certainly did not advertise it after I had seen Mr. Linder; I swear that—I did not give anybody else authority to advertise it—I spoke to Paxton about the lease soon after I was there; I spoke to him about the trade and about the lease; not to complain of the notice in the lease, but to complain of the trade—I said what a pity it was that with such a good lease to the house the trade was so bad; the lease was then in my cupboard</p>

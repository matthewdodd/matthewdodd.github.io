In the night, as I lay in bed, about two in the morning, there was a light in the pantry; I looked and saw one man in the pantry; afterwards I saw two more come into the pantry; they had all, at last, lights in their hand. Presently after one came into my room, and then another; he that came into my room first, presented a pistol to me, as I lay in my bed, and said, D - n you, you dog, if you stir you are a dead man. Immediately after he came in, the three other came into the room; one cried out when they came into the room, Cock your pistols; and they pointed some of their pistols at me, and said if I stirr'd they would shoot me. I rose up in my bed, and begg'd for my life. One of them said to me, Hold your tongue, and if you will tell every thing we will not hurt you. I said I would tell them every thing they wanted to know. Then they asked me what plate my mistress had; I told them, a pair of candlesticks. They asked, where; I said, I believed in my mistress's room. They asked where that was; I said, two pair of stairs backwards. They then asked if there was any man in the house; I said, None but myself. Then they went about my hall where I laid, and rummaged about. Presently, in a minute or two, I saw Isaacs, the prisoner, take my hat in the pantry; but I look'd through the sash, and saw Isaacs take up my hat in the pantry. Then I saw him come afterwards into the hall, where I was in bed, with my hat upon his head; and his own hat, as I suppose, in his hand. There was a light in my hall where I lay. One of the people, Price, one of the robbers, asked Isaacs why he took the hat; for he said as there are no other men in the house, you ought not to take any thing belonging to this servant, that is here; thereupon Isaacs laid my hat down again; they consulted together; at last agreed among one another, who should stay below stairs. It was agreed that Price should stay below; and immediately the other three of the four that were there went up stairs. Price staid behind, and kept walking backwards and forwards with a pistol in his hand by my bed side. It was three quarters of an hour before I heard any thing after this; then I heard a noise above stairs in the house; first I thought it was a breaking open something or other, presently after I heard the street door bell ring, and a knocking at the door; then I found this pounding was at the door of the house. At this alarm, the three that were up stairs came down again. They came into the room where I was in bed, and swore to me, that if I did not shew them the best way to escape they would shoot me. I said as the people were in the front of the house, I thought the best way to escape was backwards, up the area and over the back wall. They had brought bundles of things down with them, but left them at the hall door when I directed them the way to escape. They went to the door which opened from the hall where I lay into the area; that door was locked; I saw them unlock it, in order to get out of the area and make their escape: immediately I heard them go up the steps of the area; and, as soon as they were gone, I got up, went to the street door, and let in the watchmen; there were three at the door: I directed them to go round to the back of the house, and they might find some getting over the wall. I went up stairs to my mistress; I did not stay long there; I came down again,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100016"></xptr> and then observed the watchmen were pursuing one man, but none were taken at that time. I saw none of the robbers till about half an hour afterwards; then I saw Isaacs in custody at the watch house. I am very sure that Isaacs is the same man that had my hat on his head in the hall when I was in bed. As to the other men, I would not be so positive to Butcher and Haines, but verily believe they were in the house with Isaacs. Presently after they were gone, I happened to go up into the breakfast room, (a room forwards, up one pair of stairs,) the sash of which was open, whether shut down over night I cannot take upon me to say; it was open presently after the prisoners were gone out of the house. What was taken, particularly, out of the pantry, I cannot say; some silver, and the punch ladle, were taken out of the pantry; and the top of the pepper box out of the hall where I was asleep. Some things were never found again: two tablespoons, a pair of tea-tongs, some tea spoons, my mistress's ear-rings, and a small bottle. All the rest were found; some in the area of Captain

            . I am a maid servant; I live in the house. I remember, particularly, this sash in the back room being shut down; and, in the afternoon, the lower shutters were shut to and the curtains of the room let down likewise. I was in the room again between seven and eight in the evening; at that time I did not look particularly at the sash, but the curtains were still hanging down in the same situation as when I saw it at three in the afternoon. I lie in the fore garret of that house. I was waked, about two in the morning, with a noise upon the stairs. I got up, looked down the bannisters, saw a light, and heard strange voices, but saw nobody; then withdrew into my own room, and locked the door; drew up the sash of my own window, and looked out for the watchmen. As I saw a watchman coming, I called to him, and gave him an alarm of thieves being in the house. Soon after, three more watchmen came to the door: I bid them knock and ring at the door as hard as they could. I kept looking out at the window till the man-servant came out of the house door into the street: he assured me I was safe. Then I came down stairs out of my room. I went first into my mistress's room, presently afterwards into the breakfast room. I saw at that time the sash up, and the shutters put back which were shut-to at three in the afternoon. In my mistress's room I observed the drawers had been all pulled out, and the things were thrown about the room out of the drawers. I saw some bundles tied up in the man's bed room below: there was standing a pair of candlesticks and a soup ladle; I know the candlesticks were, over night, in my mistress's room: also a pair of ear-rings of my mistress's, lost out of a drawer in a wash stand up two pair of stairs and two pair of paste buckles in some other drawer: as to the bundle that was found in the man's room in the morning, it was tied up in a particular handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being in the room you call the breakfast room, the day before you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Yes; they took me out of bed about twelve, to make it: I was there till about three. They let the curtains down to keep the light out of my eyes. The window-curtains were drawn, and the window was shut to. I went to bed again. I was first awaked by a great light and noise in my room. Mrs. Bellamy was in bed with me. I asked who they were; they said, if I spoke a word, they would murder me. I repeated it; they gave me the same answer. They began to rifle my drawers; and that man, Isaacs, (I mistook him next morning, but recollect him perfectly now) he came to my bed-side with a pistol: I asked him if he meant to murder me; he hesitated a minute before he said, No. I then requested that they would not murder any of my servants. He said No, immediately, to that. He stood by me about seven minutes after we both ceased to speak, with his pistol in his hand. I sat up in my bed, looking at him all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. I always burn a lamp: there was a great deal of light in the room. I saw through the curtains, which were linen, a great deal of light. Then he

               <p>Q. Did they sign any thing?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any promise made to any of them? Did they want to be admitted evidences?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. No, Butcher wanted to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100017"></xptr> admitted an evidence, but the justice told him he could not be admitted without farther discoveries.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any promise made?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor no threats?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said Butcher wanted to be admitted an evidence?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Yes; the justice said he could not without he made other discoveries; and no other discoveries were made.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said to them? and what answer did they make?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Another man was brought in with him the next morning; Isaacs was so changed with fear, I suppose, he was so pale that I did not know him then; I thought the other man was the man; Butcher said at Mr. Welch's that the other man was innocent; they are the three men that confessed they were there; Butcher said that Isaacs was the man that was at my bedside with the pistol, and not the man that I had at first suspected; they all agreed that the dyer was innocent; and said they left him in the house in Little Suffolk-street, at a green shop; they were taken there; the woman is here I believe; they all said the dyer was innocent; Haines said, that handkerchief which was sealed up was his; it was given to Butcher; Butcher said it was Haines's, and gave it him; Haines said it was his; this handkerchief had a bundle of my things tied up in it.</p>

            . You said some bundles were tied up when you came down?</p>
               <p>Read. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in a handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Read. Yes; in that silk handkerchief just produced there was some gowns and some linen in it; this gown was one: it was over night in the two pair of stairs room; I found it tied up in the ptman's bed room below; I gave the handkerchief to Haines; he said it was his; I asked him if it was his; he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Lady, Did you go into this bedroom?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Not for some time; I was very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. A silver punch ladle, &amp;c. (repeating the things mentioned in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. from Isaacs. Did you not say you never saw me?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. No. About ten in the morning the constable brought them to my house, as he was taking them to the justice. He had the three prisoners and the dyer in custody. Butcher and Haines were first brought in; I said I had never seen them: then this dyer and others, and Isaacs (there is a resemblance between the Jew and this dyer) and the Jew was so frightened and altered, that I did not at first remember him. I said that the dyer was the man that held the pistol, but I recollect the Jew, Isaacs, perfectly well since.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them afterwards?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. The Thursday following I saw them all there; before I saw the prisoners, Mr. Welch told me that the other three had accused Isaacs, and that he had acknowledged it, and that the dyer was innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say before the justice?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. I recollected when I came to trace the features of Isaacs, I was sure he was the man; he had two rows of white metal buttons on.</p>
               <p>Q. His life is now at stake, are you sure he is the man?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Mr. Welch had not apprized you that you had fixed on a wrong man, should you have had such a certain knowledge of this man that you should have corrected what you had said?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. I verily believe I should.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. About Ten all the prisoners were brought to your house?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Together with the dyer?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Yes; he is very much like that man, but he had but one row of white buttons upon his coat, the other had two.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Welch told you that you was mistaken?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not before the justice declare that the dyer was not the man?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. They all said so; Butcher said he was as innocent as a child. Isaacs looked so horrid that he frightened me; and I turned my eyes from him.</p>

            . I am a servant to Capt. Sloper; I live next door to Mrs. Moore's; there was an alarm on the seventeenth of March between two and three o'clock in the morning; I came down and looked out at the fore window; I heard one of the watchmen say, they were got out at the back door and over the wall. I let the watchmen into our house to search our garden; they could find nothing, and went out again. I went into the kitchen; about half an hour after I heard a noise from the back area, I went there; I tried to open the door; I hollowed out, Who are you? a person said, open the door and I will tell you. I did not venture to open the door; I suspected they were the thieves; I sent for the constable and watchmen; they opened the door; and Isaacs was in the area; he said I give myself prisoner; one of the watchmen searched his pocket, and found a little silver salt spoon. They took him away; I shut the doors. About half an hour after that I went into the area, and saw some silver spoons lay under the bottle rack; there was a soup ladle, four silver table spoons, and three cases like buckle cases, with buckles and rings in them: my fellow servant delivered them to Mrs. Moore's servant. I ask'd Isaacs if he left these things in our area; he said, Yes; and said he brought them out of Mrs. Moore's house: I did not hear Butcher or Haines say any thing.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday 17th of March I was the constable of the night. Between two and three there was an alarm of a robbery in South Audley street; I went to Mrs. Moore's house; I saw the one pair of stairs sash open, the footman opened the door; we went through the back parlour into the yard, there we found this pistol loaded, and this chissel lay by it upon the stones (producing them.) An information was brought of a man's being upon the stables; I saw him there, and heard him speak. The watchman fired at him; he was not found. As soon as we got out of the stables, a watchman told me that they had taken one; that was Isaacs. I asked who were his accomplices; he would not confess. I told him it might be better for him to confess; he said, there was him, Haines, Butcher, and Price. I saw him searched; he told me who his confederates were, and said they were to take the things to one

            's lodgings, in Little Suffolk street, at a green shop. Isaacs said Haines got in first at the window over the door, he followed next; he said he got up the palisadoes, up the lamp iron, and so over the door to the window. We went to Ann Bedford's directly; there was one Maynard the constable and myself. We did not know rightly where the house was; we waited expecting to see them come in. We enquired at a house where the green shop was; he said, next door. I went and got more assistance, and returned again about six o'clock: we went into the one pair of stairs; there was a bedstead, but no bed. In the next room higher were Haines and Butcher with their clothes on. In another room we found Hesket and this dyer, along with Bedford and one Murphey. Another woman was laid down upon the hearth near the fire. I said, These are the men (meaning Haines and Butcher) that we want; you must go with us. They said, they would. When they came to the watch-house, we searched them; there was nothing found upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justices?</p>
               <p>Wingrove. Yes, I heard Butcher acknowledge that he was there, and that Haines, Price, and this Jew, were with him. Butcher said, if he was by himself, he would tell more; he was by himself at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them when they came in?</p>
               <p>Wingrove. There was the handkerchief produced; Haines acknowledged it to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you advised Butcher to confess; did you say any thing to him about being an evidence?</p>
               <p>Wingrove. I don't know but I might; I can't say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Moore. How many windows are there to this dressing-room?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other window fast?</p>

I saw part of the wall broke down, and there were two pistols found just by: we went over that wall to the adjoining yard; they said one of the men was upon the stable; the man fired a pistol at them.

I searched him, and found this spoon upon him (producing it). We took him to the watch-house; there we asked him where the rest of his accomplices might be found; he said at a Green stall in Little Suffolk-street; we went and found Butcher and Haines there. We asked Isaacs if any of these people were concerned in the robbery; he said that Butcher and Haines were, and that Hesket was innocent.</p>

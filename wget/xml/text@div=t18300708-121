I lost this property from a furnished room which the prisoner occupied from the 29th of May, 1829, till the 5th of June last - it was let with the lodging, for which he paid 4s. a week; I had given him notice to go, because I could get no money - he left on Saturday, and on the Monday I went into his room, and missed the property.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KING. I am a pawnbroker. I have two sheets, a looking-glass, and a pillow; I took the sheets in from the prisoner at the bar.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. This is my father's property - I put it into the room; there was a pillow and a flat-iron, and the window curtains the prisoner's wife brought back last Monday; they have paid some rent, but they owe 51s. now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He has a great many things of mine, which were in the room when he broke the door open - I was gone to a friend's to get some money; my wife did not go there on the Saturday, and when I returned I heard they had broken the door open - I have paid him 9l. 10s. since; they have known I have wanted bread, and never offered me a loaf.</p>

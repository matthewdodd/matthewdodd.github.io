Yes, at the gate; I saw the prisoner coming out of the gate, I observed his pockets look bulky, I asked him what he had got; he gave no answer; I followed him out of the gate, I took hold of him by the coat and brought him into the dock again; I searched him and found a bladder of port wine in his inside pocket; there was a large bladder in his right hand pocket, and a small bladder in the left; the bladders contained port wine; I asked him if he was an officer, he said he was not - there was above a gallon of port wine.</p>

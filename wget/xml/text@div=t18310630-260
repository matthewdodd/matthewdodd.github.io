               <p>WILLIAM ANCHOR. On the 6th of June I was in <placeName id="t18310630-260-crimeloc1357">Oxford-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your money had been taken before Lattan came up? A. Yes, she saw the other one scuffling with me; the money that was in Lattan's hand had not been counted before I stated what I had lost - I was sober; I had been out with a cub - I am a groom.</p>
               <p>Williams. I met him and three more gentlemen's servants - he came up to me, and I said "Let me alone;" he took hold of me in a very rude way - I fell down, he fell upon me, and the servants laughed at us; Lattan then came up, and said "Is there no one to take this young woman's part?" I called out Police! and the Policeman came up; the prosecutor then said he had been robbed - Lattan said, "I don't think you are robbed;" he said,"There is something chinks;" and she said, "I dare say it is what is in my handkerchief;" the officer took us to the watch-house, and asked him what he had lost - he said he could not say; Lattan said there was a half-crown, three shillings, and two sixpences in her handkerchief. Witness. There were three gentlemen's servants just behind me; I did not take hold of Williams, she took hold of me - I was down on one knee when I was scuffling to take the money from her.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I saw the two prisoners and the prosecutor; he said he had been robbed - I asked of what; he said he had had his pocket picked of 6s. 6d. - he had hold of Williams at the time; another constable came up, and I took Lattan - I found 6s. tied in the corner of her handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe she claimed it as her own? A. Yes; the prosecutor at first said he had been robbed of all he had got; I asked him what pieces of money they were, and he said he did not know, except one half crown; I found one half-crown, two shillings, and three sixpences<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300121"></xptr>- I looked at the money in the street, but I did not tell him what there was; he might be two yards from me - he could not see it; Lattan all the time claimed it - Anchor did not say whether he had shillings or sixpences; he was standing when I came up to him, but he had the appearance of having been down; he said he fell in struggling to get the money from her hand - I did not observe any dirt on him; I knew Williams had been down by her hands being dirty- Lattan was asked what money she had, and she said 6s. 6d. in her handkerchief: that was after the prosecutor had said what he had lost - the inspector asked what coins they were, but he is not here; she could not tell him, but she said 6s. 6d. - there were four, five, or six persons present; Lattan had time, no doubt, to tie up the money in her handkerchief; it was full ten minutes before I went up - she must have had time to have seen what was in it.</p>
               <p>Williams. Q. Did not she say, "You will find a halfcrown piece, three shillings, and two sixpences in it," when she gave you the handkerchief? A. Yes: but there was a half-crown, two shillings, and three sixpences.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she ask you that question? A. She did not specify the money exactly, not to my knowledge- I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Williams' Defence. This young woman desired him to go to a house to ask what was in the handkerchief; she said she had it from a friend in that house.</p>

            . Yes she did, but I did not go.</p>
               <p>Lattan's Defence. I had the money from a gentleman before; I then heard the cries of a female, saw Williams laying down, and the prosecutor on her - I said, "Is there no one to take the female's part?" the Policeman then came up, and the prosecutor said he had been robbed, but he did not know of what - he then said he heard something fall; I said, "Very likely you heard this;" I gave up the handkerchief, and told what money I had in it; I begged of him to go to a house which I had been to.</p>

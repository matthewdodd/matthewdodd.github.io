I am a labourer, and live at No. 6, Black Jack<lb></lb>alley, East Smithfield—I knew the two Burchells—on the night of 25th Oct I went to Richard Burchell's house about half past 7 o'clock in the evening—my brother John was with me—I had been drinking—I think I had had about a pot of beer—when I got to Richard Burchell's house the door was shut—I had seen Richard Burchell once, and Abraham Burchell a good many times—I had never seen Ryan—I had no dispute or quarrel with the Burchells—I asked if <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> Burchell was at home—no answer was given—I said it was a great shame to use a little boy as he had used my brother—I said that out loud—I got no answer—I went to a beer shop, and stopped away a quarter of an hour—I came back, and asked if he was within—I got no answer—I went down to where my brother lodges—we came back, and my brother turned down a small gate into the front yard of Burchell's house—he went up and got hold of the latch of the door and gave the door a kick with his foot—I went up to try to get my brother away from the door, and then I received a blow on the eye—it appeared to me to be with a brick or a ham<lb></lb>mer—the door was not opened, but <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> Burchell did it—I saw it in his hand—I fell down to the ground, and was a good bit down before I came to my senses—I cannot tell whether there were persons standing round me—I had not my senses—I was lying on my back—after the blow which brought me to the ground, somebody, I cannot say who, kicked me in the bowels, and in the side—I put my hand out and round a person's legs, and then felt a blow with a knife in my left side; I heard the knife spring shut—I got a second stab further down on the same side—I hallooed out "Police!" once or twice—I got no assistance—I could not see the wound—the man's face was turned from me—I saw his hand and arm—I could not tell whether it was the arm of the man whose legs I had got hold of—I found myself in the hospital, and was there five weeks and three days—I did not do anything to either of the Burchells—I did not kick at his door—I cannot tell where Abraham Bur<lb></lb>cliell was at the time I was stabbed; I did not see him—I cannot tell whether there was more than one person standing round me, the only person that I saw was the one who struck me with the brick or hammer.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, M</hi> 19). I produce this large clasp knife, which I found on the first floor at No. 5, Thomas's-place, Bermondsey, where Richard Burchell lives—I found it about half past 10 o'clock at night, on 25th Oct.—there was a spot of blood on the handle of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you on the beat where that house is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know that several persons lodge in that house—I found two or three females there, and one young man—they were strangers to me—I believe Richard Burchell has a wife—the spot of blood on the knife appeared to be dry; it had dried on—it did not appear to have been wiped—the blade appeared clean—there were two or three other knives in the house, but they were table knives.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at that time house surgeon of Guy's Hospital. On 25th Oct. Patrick Griffin was brought to the hospital, between half past 10 and 11 o'clock at night—he appeared to be insensible—on removing his clothes, I found a wound on the left side, between the eighth and ninth ribs—I did not probe it—it was about an inch in length—there was no doubt it had penetrated the stomach, as there was food around the flannel which he wore, next to the wound, and he vomited a little fluid about 4 o'clock in the morning, which was another symptom that the wound had penetrated the stomach—he lay in a very dangerous state for some time, but he is now apparently well—he had but one wound, but was in great danger for some time—it was doubtful whether he would recover—this knife was shown to me on the Sunday morning—it is just such a knife as might produce the wound—the wound was perhaps a little wider than the knife—I saw a cut in his coat, which appeared to correspond with the knife.</p>

I took the charge—when the prisoners were brought in they gave their address, at Thomas's place, Grange-road, Bermondsey—that is the place where the knife was found—they all gave the same address—they were told what they were charged with—Abraham Burchell said, "I struck him."</p>

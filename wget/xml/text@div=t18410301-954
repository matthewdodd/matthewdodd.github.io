                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Robert Udall, of Edmonton. On the 2nd of February, the prisoner came to his shop between one and two o'clock, and asked for some things, but did not buy any—he went away—I recollect showing him a drawer which had some silk handkerchiefs in it, and there was a box of lace on the counter—the next day he was brought past the shop handcuffed—I inquired what he had been doing—I then looked and missed five handkerchiefs and some lace—this now pro<lb></lb>duced is one of the handkerchiefs—I am sure it is my master's, and it had not been sold—I had sold one of them the day previous—this lace we can swear we had the same day, and the same pattern—the quantity I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is this handkerchief worth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know it as it had been creased with another, which was sold the day previous—here is the one that was sold, and the creases, which are accidental, exactly correspond—I never said there was a cut in it—I said there probably might be a cut—I did not point out any cut—I looked to see if there was one, and there was not—I have been in a pub<lb></lb>lic-house near this Court, with the policeman—I asked him, when we were there on Saturday, to let me see the handkerchief, and to compare them, in case of any request from the Judge—I then inquired for a knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say that as there appeared to be a place in the corner of one of the handkerchiefs cut, you would cut the other to correspond? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184103010161"></xptr>
               <p>No, I wanted the knife in case I should be flurried in speaking before the jury—I never cut the four corners of the two handkerchiefs that I might easily put them together—nor that they might be more like each other, but that I might put one corner to match the other—1 swear I did not cut a hole in one of them—I was in company with the policeman—he did not leave' the room at all—there was a gentleman there making out a brief, and I think there were two or three other persons there.</p>

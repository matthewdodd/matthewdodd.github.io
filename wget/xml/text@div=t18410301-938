                  </hi>. I am a widow. I was working for Mrs. Field, who formerly kept this house, for about a fortnight or ten days—the pot-boy was in the house at the time, sleeping there with the prosecutor—he saw me every day—he has heard my name mentioned, and has called me by my name, Mrs. Fitzgerald—I was called Mrs. Fitzgerald in the house—about seven o'clock on the evening in question, I saw the prosecutor—when he came in, I called to him, to ask him to ask Mrs. Field, the former landlady, to come up to tea—he came into the room where I was, the front room second floor—this was between seven and eight o'clock—I remarked to him that he was rather intoxicated—he said that he was for</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Union-street, South<lb></lb>wark. I was in the tap-room of this house on the night in question, and saw the Days there—they left the house between seven and eight o'clock, and returned between eight and nine—Mrs. Isaac Day was the first person I saw—the prisoner asked how she got into the house, and what she wanted—she made answer that she did not want any thing herself, but she under<lb></lb>stood the prisoner had something to say to her—the prisoner immediately replied that she had not, and the sooner she left the house the better, she took the candlestick off the mantel-piece with the intent, as I suppose, to light her to the door—I looked out at the tap-room door into the bar, and the two Days were there it the bar-door—the prisoner's husband I believe was below in the cellar, because I saw him come up the cellar stairs—he asked what was the matter—all the three Days were standing there at the time—the prisoner said, "Here are these rogues and thieves, they have broken into the house, and want to rob us"—the prosecutor im<lb></lb>mediately made a rush towards the prisoner—her husband immediately prevented him, and then a general scuffle ensued between Mrs. Day, the two brothers, and the prisoner's husband—the prisoner was not exactly in the scuffles, she was in the bar—the prosecutor did not reach her when he made the rush at her, the bar-door was between them—the prisoner's hus<lb></lb>band</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer. I was in the tap-room on the evening in question, about four o'clock—I saw the Days when they left the house—they came back again, but I do not know the hour, perhaps about half-past eight or nine o'clock—I first saw Mrs. Day standing before the bar—the prisoner said to her, "How came you here?"—she said, "I un<lb></lb>derstand you have got something to say to me"—she said, "No, I have not got any thing to say, you had better be off out of the place"—the two Days then came forward—Mr. Hedditch was coming out of the cellar at the same time, and they began with him—I could see from the tap-room into the bar, and hear too—there is a door leading out of the bar into the tap-room as well as the side door—I was nearest the glass door leading from the tap-room to the bar—when Mr. Hedditch came up he said, "What is the matter? is any thing the matter? if there is, for God's sake come to-morrow, and we will settle it"—the prisoner said something about their coming there to rob the house—upon which Isaac Day knocked Mr. Hed<lb></lb>ditch's hat off—I did not see this from the tap-room—I came out when the scuffle began—I think it was Thomas Day knocked Mr. Hedditch's hat off—he turned up his sleeves, and wanted Mr. Hedditch to go and fight with him, and somehow or other Mr. Hedditch's hat got knocked off—he wanted to have nothing to do with them, and Mrs. Day got into the bar to go to the prisoner—Mr. Hedditch jumped over the bar to keep them back, and he said to Blake, "You go and fetch a policeman"—then they came so very strong, (Isaac and Thomas Day,) and began to beat Mr. Hed<lb></lb>ditch and fight him, and a square of glass was broken in the bar-door as he fell back—they were both at Mr. Hedditch at that time—he was be<lb></lb>tween the two Days and the door, to keep his wife back, and the glass was broken at the time he felt himself stabbed—I did not see any instrument in the prisoner's hand—I did not see any knife—I never went out of the place till the policeman came.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear the prosecutor complain that he was stabbed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—directly after the glass was broken he fell back—he fell right away from the prisoner—both the brothers were together, all in a scuffle together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to suggest it was done with the glass? <hi rend="italic">A.

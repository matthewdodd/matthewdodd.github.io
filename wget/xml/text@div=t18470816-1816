                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Thomas Buckthorpe, a coffee-merchant, of No. 1, Mincing-lane. I have known the prisoner for about twelve months. On the 4th of June last, he was indebted to Mr. Buckthorpe in the sum of about 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—previous to that, we had received the warrants for some coffee that had arrived by the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>—these warrants (<hi rend="italic">looking at some pro<lb></lb>duced by Mr. Mullens</hi>) are them—the prisoner was aware that we had them—previously to the 4th of June he had had the loan of them for he purpose of sampling and inspecting the coffee at the docks, and he returned them—he was merely a customer of Mr. Buckthorpe's—he bought of him—he is a com<lb></lb>mission agent for some parties, and does business on his own account as a merchant—on the 4th of June he came to Mr. Buckthorpe's office, and said he had a friend in town from Newcastle whom he thought was a purchaser of that description of coffee, that he was a very particular sort of man in the mode in which he conducted his business, and he wished to inspect the goods himself before he would make a purchase—he said, "Will you let me have the warrants, I and my friend will go down directly, and they shall be returned in about an hour?"—I said that he had previously drawn samples, and I did not see the necessity for his doing so again—Mr. Buckthorpe was in the next</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160105"></xptr>
               <p>office, and I just mentioned to him that he wanted them—after that I agreed to give him the warrants—I delivered them to him, and he went away with them—I did not see him again till he was in custody—on the following day we received this noted from him—(<hi rend="italic">read, marked "A," signed Thomas Smith, dated June</hi> 5, 1847—"Gentlemen, I told you on Thursday I should pay you 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-day. I then felt certain of receiving that amount from the country this morning, but owing to my journey being due in the north next week, the party has written me saying, he will pay me when there. I very much regret that it has occurred so, but if you will call at the Bank of England on Thurs<lb></lb>day, you will receive the full amount of what I owe you, as I shall pay it on Wednesday to your credit through the branch at Newcastle. The <hi rend="italic">Morning Star's</hi> I have sold this morning, and the party will pay me for them on Tuesday, as he leaves town to-night, and has not quite enough with him. The amount I will remit with the other on Wednesday, if you will have the kindness to forward me the invoice, deducting rent, &amp;c., to the Post-office, Newcastle. I presume you will charge me 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the transaction being a cash one.")—I received this other letter from him the same evening—I had written an answer to the first letter in the interval, directed to his office in St. Swithin's-lane—(<hi rend="italic">read, from Mr. Smith to Mr. Oliver</hi>—"Sir, I feel exceedingly surprised at your note just received, and the conduct you have pursued towards me with<lb></lb>out any cause. I would have met you this morning, but it is now needless, as you seem determined if you can to ruin me. All I need say is, that although it was my intention to have left for Newcastle to-night, I shall not now do so until Monday; and if you will then call on me, at ten o'clock in the morning, with the invoice of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star's</hi> I will pay you for them; and during the week you shall have the balance of your account, as before stated.")—I received no other letter from him myself, and did not see him till he was taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What day of the week was the 4th of June? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Friday—I cannot say how many transactions my principal has had with the prisoner—he has had several, both in coffee and tea, principally in coffee—he was agent to a tea-merchant, and also did business on his own account—he was not agent to my employer—the transaction between them were those of purchase and sale—he had not had transactions with us to the amount of 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the month before—it is impossible for me to tell how long the transactions with him have been going on—I have not looked to the books—I should think it is about twelve months, but I cannot say exactly—the books are not here—he has purchased coffee of us before, I should think to the amount of about 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he is now indebted to my master 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I under<lb></lb>stand the sampling of coffee, but it is not my province to sample it—I do not know that there would be no great difficulty in sampling the coffee without the warrants, I believe it is not so—these were inferior coffee—I am not aware that my employer had any communication with him on the subject of these coffees—I had myself offered them to him at 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—the market price of coffee at that time was from 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these were Ceylon coffees, which are of various qualities—these coffees were not damaged, they were returned by the Dock Company, which is the only rule we have to go by, as being sound and in good order, I did not inspect them—I know they were sold as sound at public sale—I saw the samples of them; they appeared to be sound, and not in any degree damaged—my employer had not received money from the prisoner in the course of that week—I have not the books with me, and cannot positively say when the last payment was made on his</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you offer to take a bill for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I once said, that if he met with a customer for them whom we approved of, and drew upon him, and handed us that party's acceptance, that then we would sell him the coffees, and take such a bill in payment—I offered to sell him the coffees, if he met with a customer whose bill we approved of—he had had possession of the warrants three or four weeks before—I think he had them one day, and returned them on the following morning—I shall swear he did not hold them two or three days—we did not make any great effort to get rid of the coffees—I asked 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. for them on the last occasion; we were losing money on them I did not state to him, on the 4th of June, that if he did not take them I should expect the warrants back again in an hour—the usual credit on coffee is one month, and on tea we expect the cash on the Saturday following the delivery—the cash transaction were confined to the teas—he had inquired of me before I give him the warrants, what price I would take for cash for them—I said, to clear them up I would take 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, cash—I would have sold them to him for 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt., if he had brought me the cash—if he had returned with the cash, I should have been content to have made a contract with him under the circumstances—I should have asked for the warrants, to have the account made out—we had an entry of them in the book—we could have made out the account from that entry, but we should not have done so, because it is not the practice in the trade—we should have had nothing to do with his selling them—we had nothing to do with that; we had not sold them, and I would not have sold them, unless he had brought the warrants back, because it would not have been regular—I should have felt myself at liberty, during the time he was gone to the docks, to sample them for this party, to have sold them to any other party—I had not engaged to hold them for his answer—we could have sold them by our samples, and delivered the warrants when applied for—we should have been at liberty to do so, according to the custom of the trade—if he had returned with the 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt., we could have made out an invoice from our books and closed the transaction—we had had other transaction with him in credit, but the warrants were not delivered to him at the time he made the purchases on any former occasions that I recollect—I will undertake to swear that they were not principally delivered to him at the time of making the purchase—that is not the ordinary course of business—the ordinary course of business in the market is for a credit to be given of one month prompt, from the date of the sale; it does not follow that the warrants are to be delivered till the prompt ends, unless they are applied for; and then it would be at the option of the party selling, whether he would deliver the warrants with-out the cash or not—I might not hesitate to deliver the warrants, although the prompt had not expired, but I should require the cash for them, and that is the custom in the trade—I am not aware that in our</p>

                  </hi> I am a dealer in tea and coffee, and live at Nos. 1 and 2, Mincing-lane—I knew of the coffees coming by the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>—on the 4th of June I was in the adjoining counting-house tasting the coffee, and heard a conversation between Mr. Oliver and the prisoner; but I did not enter into it, because it was Mr. Oliver's business to sell—Mr. Oliver came to me and said, "Smith has asked for the warrants, to examine them down at the docks with a friend, is there any objection to his having them?"—I said, "No, but he must return them within one hour"—and I believe I said to the prisoner, "Why, Smith, it is not necessary for you to have the warrants to go down to see these coffees, because they have been sampled, and the coffees are here"—he said he had a friend up from Newcastle, who wanted to purchase that description of coffee, and that he being a particular man would not purchase unless he examined the coffee himself—the prisoner then received the warrants from Oliver—I do not think I said anything to him at the time he received them—I think I felt the counting-house, and went into Fenchurch-street—I saw the prisoner again, I should think ten minutes or a quarter if an hour afterwards—I met him very near the corner of Rood-lane, as I was returning—he was not going towards the docks—we ran against each other—I said, "Smith, you are not going to the docks"—he said, "No, Sir, I am going to Gracechurch-street to meet my friend; I have the warrants here," holding up the warrants in his hand; which I knew were the warrants by the marks on them, by which I could distinguish them—I said, "Now mind, if going with your friend to the docks that you return them as you pass, or send them immediately you return from the docks, as we may want them"—he said, "Sir, rest assured I will do so"—we had further conversation, not connected with the business, it was about his getting married—he could not very well come from the docks without coming past Mincing-lane—Mr. Oliver had power to sell or do anything in my business, as much power as myself, I do not interface with these things—after receiving the second letter from the prisoner, I applied with Mr. Oliver at the Mansion-house—on that Saturday evening, as we could not find Smith the whole of the day, we sent on to his counting-house at ten o'clock—the clerk's answer was, that he was not at home—we sent there two or three times, and then applied at the Mansion-house; after which I received this letter, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), on the Monday morning; it was brought by a person</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160108"></xptr>
               <p>who is in Court, it is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Buck thorpe, —Sir, —I consider the course you have acted towards me is most shameful and uncalled-for; had I wished to have acted dishonourably towards you, I should hardly have taken up Dixon's bill and offered you a 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill as good as a bank, one only a few days ago; I have paid you a great deal of money, and paid you very punctually too; in the present instance nearly all I owe you has become due at once, but in a very few days you would have been paid, as my prospects are too good for me to throw them away; in regard to the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>, Mr. Oliver had repeatedly pressed me to buy them; I have had the warrants before, as long as I have now had them. On Friday, I thought I had a customer for them for the purpose of sampling; the party could not pay me until I got to Newcastle, and being particularly in want of some money to meet a pressing engagement, I borrowed an amount on them; but this I would not have done if I did not consider them as bought by me, as they really were; as the understanding was, that if I did not sell them I would bring them back again to you; Mr. Oliver even went so far as to say, that if I drew a bill upon the party to whom they were sold, that he was willing to take it—was not this making me the purchaser? I had fully intended to have taken the warrants up again on Monday morning, or paid for them, as I pro<lb></lb>mised in my note of Saturday evening; but finding I am rather short I have left town, as I originally intended, or at least shall do so by the train this evening; and it now only rests for you to say, whether you will have money for the coffees or the warrants returned; at the same time I candidly tell you that, although I shall now leave town, I will not go home until I receive the invoice of the coffees, as rather than I would run the risk of being placed in the position you threaten, I would put a pistol to my head, or leave the country: my cousin, Mr. Robinson, will give you this; and he only knows where I shall be. If you give him the invoice, and show the confidence which you never had cause to lose, you will not find that confidence misplaced. I do not owe 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the world—to you I owe more than half of that; and I ask, is it your policy to ruin me?")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was it after receiving that letter that the prisoner was taken into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think ten or twelve days—we sent out in every direc<lb></lb>tion to find him—we sent, I think, 1400 miles after him.</p>

               <p>warrants, I knew them—they did not turn out sound, and I returned them—they were warrants for the coffee by the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>—I did buy them of him on the 4th—I said perhaps I could do something with them, I would see—he asked me to buy them—I cannot now say how much he wanted for them—he said something like 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said I might have them much lower than he had offered them to me previously—I cannot now call to mind the price he had offered them to me at, previously—it might have been 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I bought them before, but this time they were not bought—he did not go with me to Mr. Harrod—he gave them to me, and he was to call on me at my shop in the morning—he said he had a large sum of money to pay away, and asked me if I could buy them—I told him I could not them—I never was at Newcastle—he came on the morning of the 5th, and said that he wanted money very badly indeed—I forget now what I said—we had a good deal of conversation—he asked me if I could lend him some money on them—he did not at the time say exactly how much—he talked about having a customer, and that he could realize more money by them—he said, if I would let him have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them till the party from Newcastle who was going to buy them had had the samples, then he would take the coffee out of my hands and give me the money, by paying me for the use of them—I gave him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them, and they were to be forfeited if he did not redeem them in the course of two or three days—I had not the money at the time by me, and I borrowed a portion of it from Mr. Harrod, leaving the warrants as security for the money—I think he lent me 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which I gave him a memorandum, and left the warrants with him—I did not introduce Harrod to Smith—I do not know that Mr. Harrod ever saw Smith—I gave the warrants to Harrod on the evening of the 4th of June, the same day that Smith gave them to me—Harrod lent me 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them—that is a very usual thing with warrants—we went to sample them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any doubt that you may sample coffees, or any other thing, by order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends upon whether warrants are specially endorsed, so that you have a power of getting a written order for the sampling—it would then be an authority, but they are generally sampled by the warrants—sometimes merchants have power from the holder of the warrants to give an order, as many circumstances may occur to prevent your getting the warrants for a week or ten days after you have purchased the coffee—it must be an order from the broker, specially endorsed by the merchant who has imported the coffee, because he is in possession—I may buy coffee to-day and not apply for the warrants until my months has expired—I am not in possession of the warrants until the Satur<lb></lb>day following; they then present the warrants to me, and I give the money—it is not every day's practice to sample coffee from an order in the name of any person whose name is in the dock-books—it is not constantly or frequently done—it is done sometimes, under peculiar circumstances.</p>

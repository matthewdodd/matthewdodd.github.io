                  </hi>. I am a chemist at Crossby-row, Walworth. On 25th Jan., Lewis came to my shop and asked for something for a swollen throat—I made him up a liniment and put it in a phial—it came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half crown in payment, which I placed in a bowl in the till where there was one other half crown—that was a Geo. <hi rend="largeCaps">III</hi>—the one he gave me was a new Victoria—I gave the prisoner the change, and immediately after he had gone out a constable came in—I looked in the till immediately, took out the half crown I had received from the prisoner, put it in the detector, and it was a bad one—I gave it to the constable—in about a quarter of an hour both the prisoners were brought to my shop, and I recognised Lewis—the constable has since shown me the phial of medicine.</p>

On Tuesday evening; I was on duty in plain clothes, in Walworth-road, and from information I went to Mr. Caffyn's shop—he produced a half crown which I marked and gave him back—I went after the prisoners and found them in Manor-place, about 120 yards from Mr. Caffyn's shop—I followed them, took them into custody, and told them it was for passing a counterfeit half crown at the chemist's shop—Lewis said, "I have not"—there was a struggle, Evans fell down, got away, and was secured by a potman—in the struggle I saw a half crown fall down just by my feet, I cannot say who dropped it—it was picked up immediately by a female, and given to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoners were close together at the time—I took the prisoners back to Mr. Caffyn's, and on the way I saw Evans place his left hand to the waistband of his trowsers, and saw a white parcel drop—I spoke to a gentleman close by, named Shepperd, and asked him to pick it up and give it me—he did so—I opened it, and found it contained four counterfeit half crowns wrapped up in very fine tissue paper, each coin separated by a piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took the prisoners to Mr. Caffyn's, and he recognised Lewis—I took them to the station, and on Lewis I found this phial (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and on Evans one shilling, two sixpences, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his coat pocket, and one shilling, one sixpence, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in another pocket—I received this half crown from Mr. Caffyn (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>).</p>

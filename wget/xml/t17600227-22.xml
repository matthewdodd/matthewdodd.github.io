               <p>Pollard. I am clerk to the Clothworkers company. When I was examining Chambers, the prisoner came down in a great fury, and said she would discover every thing. She began and told me Chambers had carried out things herself, and that she had carried things to two or three pawnbrokers for her out of my house, and told me where the pawnbrokers lived. She said she brought all the money to Chambers, and Chambers never gave her but one six-pence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Henry Isaacs, of 5, Shrews<lb></lb>bury-court, Whitecross-street, a fruiterer. About a fortnight before 21st May I had had some words with the prisoner, and that afternoon, between three and four o'clock, I saw her in Shrewsbury-court, where she lives, near one of the three water-taps—I went into the court to call a boy, who worked for me, to his tea—the prisoner said to me, "Hold your tongue you w—e"—I said I would strike her if she repeated it again, and then I hit her—she had an open knife in her hand, with which she was unpicking something—she struck at me with it, and I received a wound across my fingers; then she cut me on my wrist, and then on the thumb of my right hand—all the wounds bled very much—I went to a doctor and had them dressed—I struck her but once—they healed in about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She struck me three times, and knocked me under the pump; I caught up the knife; she snatched it out of my hand, and it cut her fingers; I told her I was not strong enough to fight her; I ran in-doors, and her brother followed me and thumped me; she took a flower-pot and broke my glass, and swore she would have my life; she swore two days before that she would have my life, or I should have hers. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am sure she struck me with the knife—I was not struggling to get it away when I struck at her—I did not hit her, only one side of her hair fell down—I have spoken the candid truth.</p>

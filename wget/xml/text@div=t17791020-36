She threw a key down on the pavement to deceive me, that while I was looking for it, she might get away; I took her up into the court again, and said she had part of my property, and desired her to give it up to me; she said I have not, for you must have heard it jump out of your pocket on the pavement; I told her there was no such thing, and if she did not deliver my property immediately, I would call the watch; she said no, do not call the watch, I will give it you; I said then do not hesitate about it, for if you do I will call him immediately; she then said how can you think I have any of your property, I have none of it; I then called the watch, and desired him to go for Mr. Proctor, the constable, whom I knew; he went, but could not find him, he brought Mardell, and gave him charge of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177910200061"></xptr> the prisoner; we took her into a house in Stationer's-alley, there Mardell searched her, and found the money in her mouth; he took out two guineas, six half guineas, and one shilling, and one half guinea dropped on the floor as he took it out of her mouth. I had in the whole in my pocket three guineas, fifteen half guineas, and a shilling; I had counted the money about fifteen minutes before; I was in no one's company but her's; I missed exactly the money found upon her.</p>

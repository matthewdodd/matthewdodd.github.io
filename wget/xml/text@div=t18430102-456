                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Snowley, who keeps the King and Queen public-house, in Hare-street, Bethnal-green. There is a bar in the house, and at the back of it is what we call a company parlour—there is a cupboard in the bar, the back of which forms a partition of the company parlour—it is also lined with sheet iron—we are in the habit of keeping our cash there in a cash-box—on Thursday, the 22nd of Dec., I was in the bar, and while there all the prisoners came in together, and appeared to be companions—they merely ordered what they wanted—they did not speak as they passed through—they went into the company parlour—that was the first time I saw them—before they went into the parlour they ordered a pot of half-and-half, and remained there nearly an hour—I did not see them go away—next day, about a quarter after ten o'clock in the morning, they came again, and ordered a pot of half-and-half, and went into the company parlour—it was very unusual to have any body in that parlour so early, and there was nobody but them there that morning—they remained there about two hours and a half, and then we heard, apparently, a scratching in the cup<lb></lb>board—I and my sister were sitting together in the bar—we thought at first it was a cat—we looked more than once, but found no cat—we heard the same noise the second time, and again looked for the cat, and felt for her, but there was no cat—after that we heard a crash of wood splitting—my sister opened the cupboard, and I took out the cash-box, and I saw a light through the back of the cupboard—if it had been as usual no light would have been observable—I took the cash-box away, and put it on the sofa—I then saw the prisoner Jones hurrying out of the parlour to the front of the bar—he brought a pipe, and asked me to fill it—he looked towards the cupboard— after I had filled his pipe he went back into the parlour—I communicated to my husband what I had heard—when Jones looked towards the cupboard it was shut—I had shut it after taking out the cash-box—Jones had frequently been to the bar before, and had asked for change for half-a-sovereign, which I took out of the cash-box in the cupboard, and put the half-sovereign into the cash-box—he saw me put it into the cupboard.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When a person is standing in front of the bar, can they avoid seeing the cupboard? A. Not very well, if the bar-door is open, which it was—I went into the company parlour very soon after I heard the scratching and saw the light—I should say in six or seven minutes after—in the position Jones was he could see me go to the cash-box and take the silver bag and the gold bag out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What persons were in the house at this time? A. An old gentleman, standing in front of the bar, the servant in the kitchen, and a man lodger whom I have known six months—he is lodge-man at the workhuose—there are two staircases in the house—there were people in the tap-room, but that is quite away from the company parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of last witness. On Wednes<lb></lb>day morning, the 21st of Dec, James came to the house, called for a glass of ale, and gave me a sovereign in payment—he was going into the parlour, but finding the shutters shut he went into the tap-room—I went up stairs for the change, and gave it him in the tap-room—the ale came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—next morn<lb></lb>ing (Thursday) I saw Jones and James—they went into the company parlour, and called for a pot of half-and-half, which I sent to them—there was no<lb></lb>body else in the parlour—I was in the bar, and saw the prisoners frequently—the half-and-half was paid for on delivery, but I did not take it in—the servant took the money for it—the cash-box was in the cupboard—I went to that cupboard that day, while the prisoners were there, to change a sovereign—I cannot say to a certainty who brought the sovereign, but it was one of the prisoners—I am quite sure it was one of them, either Jones or James, I do not know which—I opened the cash-box, and took the change out—that cupboard could be seen by the person where he stood—he could see me take the cash-box from there—he went back into the parlour again—next day (Friday) I was in the bar when the three prisoners came in, about a quarter after ten o'clock in the morning—they went into the parlour, and as they passed the bar one of them called out for a pot of half-and-half—I served them—I took it into the room—there was nobody in the room except the three prisoners—I went back to the bar—my sister was there, and as we sat there I heard a noise, which sounded like a cat in the cupboard, a scratching in the cupboard where the cash-box was kept—I looked in the cupboard—I heard the noise again, and looked again, and felt, but the cat was not there—I shut the cupboard, and after that heard a noise again like a crash of wood—I thought the prisoners were breaking into the cupboard for the cash-box—it was like that—my sister opened the cupboard in my presence—I opened the cupboard, and could see a light coming through where the wood and iron-work was—Jones directly presented himself at the bar, and called for his pipe to be filled—it was filled, and he went back again into the parlour—my brother-in-law came down, and the police were sent for directly—before the policeman came, the parlour bell rang—I answered it—they wanted to know what their reckoning was for their lunch—I told them, and they paid me—when I went into the room they were all three sitting together, close to this cupboard—one had his back to it, and the back of one was to the door, and another to the cupboard—they sat very near each other—I could not observe the crack in the cupboard as they sat, it was so dark—it was not a foggy day but the room was very dark—it was about one o'clock—one of the prisoners was between me and the cupboard—they had rung the bell more than once—I cannot say how many times—I do not think more than twice—I went into the room on one occasion particularly on the bell being rung—on an<lb></lb>other occasion I went when the bell was not rung, and Jones came up quickly</p>

               <p>to the door, and called for a pipe of tobacco, and I did not go in—that only happened once—on one occasion, while they were there, I went into the kitchen, which is opposite the parlour, and as I went I found Jones in the passage—he obstructed me in the passage by standing right in front of me—he did not say any thing, but stood and stopped me from passing—we both stood there for a moment, then he moved and went into the parlour—he did not give me any order—I went into the kitchen—it was before I got to the kitchen door—he was between me and the kitchen door—I was coming from the bar, which is between the kitchen and parlour doors.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you go in at the door of the house where is the bar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You turn to the left—you go straight past the bar to get to the parlour, keeping to the left—the company parlour is about two yards from the bar I should think—the kitchen is on the right of the passage, and the company parlour on the left—the cupboard is in the bar—the company parlour is beyond the bar, and more to the left along the passage—there is no bar-parlour besides the bar—the company parlour is a large room with a table in the middle—persons are not obliged to sit near together in the parlour—the table takes up the principal part of the room—the parlour is about three times as large as the bar—it is a very large room—there is room for persons to sit between the door and the wainscot against the cupboard, but not without being in the way—they would be rather squeezed up—the door opens towards that part of the wainscot where the cupboard is—that would prevent people sitting against that part, but one of them sat close to it, where the place was cut—there is a projection—the cupboard is about a yard square—there is iron plating over the whole of the back—I could see a light through the cracks.</p>

On Tuesday, the 25th of January, I was in the harness cupboard, and hid myself there for the purpose of watching while the men were gone to dinner - between one and two o'clock I heard some persons come up a ladder which was there; they were coming up towards the harness cupboard; there was a hole in the cupboard; and when the person came up, I saw it was the prisoner - he called out loud "Mr. Hall! Mr. Hall!" twice, and said, "I suppose you are gone to dinner, "three times - Mr. George Hall had a bench there, and he had left his jacket, apron, and cap on it; the prisoner went up towards the bench, and looked on the other side the loft - he took up the jacket, rolled it up, and went down the ladder half way; I came out rather too early - he saw me, and directly up with the jacket, and threw it down; then he asked me for Mr. Hall, and ran down stairs; I hallooed out "Mr. Gee, is it you? I know you;" I went down, and he was gone - he looked up after I hallooed out his name, but did not say any thing - I had seen him several times with Mr. Hall in the factory.</p>

            . I was employed in the factory of Messrs. Powell, in Bond-street. On the 25th of January I received information from Valler - I know the cupboard; there was a hole bored in the side, to enable any one to see a person coming up the ladder, or in the loft - on the 26th of January I saw the prisoner in High-street; I followed him, and gave him in charge - he denied the charge, and said I was mistaken, I could not mean him; he said he had been over the water - the apprentice was with me; the prisoner had been an acquaintance of mine for five years, but not for the last two - he was in the habit of visiting me at the factory while I knew him; this is the jacket - it is mine; Valler gave it me.</p>

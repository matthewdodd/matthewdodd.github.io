Yes; I was in the shop - when any body goes out of the door the spring forces it to - if a hand held the door, just at the point where it touched the spring, the second spring would force it open, I am certain - the spring which holds the door to, projects five or six inches - I live in the house and occupy it myself - I pay the rent.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Hewitson, of Kingsland-road. I have a ring pawned by Mrs. Pickard.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTENBOROUGH. I can identify all these rings, they having private marks on them - this is copper wire - the one left behind was iron.</p>
               <p>Drew's Defence. I was not in the shop at all that night.</p>
               <p>Martha Pickard's Defence. I received the rings from Ware, and certainly pawned them, but did not know they were stolen.</p>

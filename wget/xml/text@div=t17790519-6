               <p>On last Thursday at about five o'clock I was sent after a place to Highgate. When I returned between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner Mathews met me in <placeName id="t17790519-6-crimeloc33">Long-lane Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Did you know her before? - No; I never saw her in my life before. I said I would not give her any, and I went away. She came after me and swore bitterly that she would have something, and snatched my hat off my head. I pursued her and called the watchman to my assistance; the watchman secured her; she delivered the hat to another person who got off. I never got my hat again.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person who took it? - Yes; she was never out of my sight.</p>

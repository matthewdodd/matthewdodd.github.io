I missed from the barge-house a pail, horse-cloth, bradawl, hammer, and nails—I said to the prisoner, "It is very strange that every time I come here I miss something; do you know anything about these things?"——he said, "No"—I said, "I hope I shall detect the thief—he said, "I hope we shall"—on the ninth I asked him if he had lent the things to anybody—he said, "No"—I said, "I discharged a man last week for robbing me of rase: white had, and if I find the person who has taken these I will punish him; I fancy you have been robbing me"—I went to his lodging with him—the door was shut—he said he had not got the key—I told him to push it open—I went in and saw these nails (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) they are mine—he said he bought them on the 'Dials'—I then found the pail, the horse-cloth, and other things—he said, "Forgive me this time"—I said, "I will not; I have discharged people through you; I will give you in charge"—I went down stairs, and he made his escape.</p>

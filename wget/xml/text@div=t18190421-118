            . I live with my father. The prisoner came into the shop to know the price of a handkerchief, which I showed him. While he was looking at it, a sweep came and said he was desired to sweep the chimney - he went into the parlour, and took the kettle off the fire. I opened the parlour door to call my father down; while I was outside the parlour door, the prisoner took the flannel. I saw him turning the corner of East-row, with the flannel in his hand; I ran after him, and saw him drop it - it was picked up by Mr. Lowe, and given to me; he pursued and took the prisoner - I am certain he is the man. I did not see him take it.</p>

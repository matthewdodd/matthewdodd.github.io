               <p>Was the husband present when the wife took the oath? - Undoubtedly he was; she was sworn and took the affidavit.</p>
               <p>After that you and the husband entered into a bond? - I did; I was one of the sureties, not imagining the least imposition.</p>
               <p>Was it at the husband's desire you entered into the bond? - I believe it was both their desires; I cannot say the prisoner desired me; it is the form in that court; I might voluntarily enter into it. Then I went along with them to the Borough, and through the recommendation of a house-keeper an acquaintance of their's, they got the minister and one or two of the overseers of the parish to sign a certificate of their good behaviour while they were in that parish. From thence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220059"></xptr> I went with them to the Navy-office; there was not a return of the man's name at that time, and I gave up the administration.</p>

               <p>Who is Kelly? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What was you paid for the trouble you had in this business? - I was paid a guinea, and as I estimate my time I deserved more.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of this man and his wife? - No.</p>
               <p>How happened you to enter into a bond for a person you knew nothing about by the recommendation of a woman you have never seen from that day to this? - I looked upon it as a matter of form in the court.</p>
               <p>What was the penalty of that bond? - I do not know; I will speak the fact and nothing else for all your father and grandfather were worth.</p>
               <p>What had you for signing the bond? - Not a meg; you may ask me what I had for supper last night.</p>
               <p>I ask you what did you get for signing the bond? - I got a guinea from him for going about the business.</p>
               <p>From him? - From him and his wife.</p>
               <p>You looked upon this woman really to be the sister of the deceased? - At that time I really did.</p>
               <p>The husband looked upon her the same? - I don't know but he did.</p>
               <p>She fairly imposed upon you both? - I declare I take it so, I don't look upon it otherwise; I don't know what conversation might pass between her and her husband; it was an imposition of her's.</p>
               <p>From what you observed, she had represented herself as the sister of Wallather? - - Yes; and they both joined in it.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say, that in your hearing she represented herself as the sister of Wallather and told her husband so? - No, no; she told me so, and he also told me.</p>

               <p>The woman came to you first? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you look upon it as a mere matter of form? - No; I did not consider it as such.</p>
               <p>How came you then to enter into a bond of such a penalty for strangers you know nothing about? - I could have nothing more than the oath of the person, and I thought soul security sufficient.</p>

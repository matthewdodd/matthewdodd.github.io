                  </hi>. I am nine years old—I live with my father and mother, at 12, Harp-alley, Farringdon-street—my father is a French polisher, and also keeps a clothes shop. On the day after Christmas-day, at half past 8 o'clock in the evening, I was at home—the prisoner rang the bell, knocked at the door, and asked for the person in the shop; I said they were not at home; she knocked me down, the candle was on the stairs, and she ran up with it in her hand—a policeman knocked at the door, and when I was going to open it, the prisoner fell down stairs, with a coat under her apron, which tumbled out; it was my coat—I picked it up, and gave it to the policeman who took the prisoner—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—the prisoner had no shawl or bonnet on—she had not the candle when she came down; she put it on the table.</p>

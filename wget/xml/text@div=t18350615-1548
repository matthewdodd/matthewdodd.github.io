On Wednesday, the 10th of June, Gleson and Rachel Downs came to my house, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon—I live about a quarter of a mile from the Bee-hive—they both came in together, talking to each other, and asked for half-a-pint of porter—I served them—Gleson handed me a bad sixpence—I discovered it the moment it was given to me, and said it was bad—I accused them of having been in my house the night before, and tendering one to my daughter—they both said it was not them—I kept the bad sixpence, and have it now—I kept it apart from all other money—Gleson gave me a good sixpence after that—both drank the beer, and I sent my waiter to look for a policeman—he could not find one, and I allowed them to go.</p>

About nice o'clock on Sunday evening, the 10th of June, Gleson came in, and asked for half-a-pint of beer, which I drew—she tendered me a sixpence, which I immediately discovered it to be counterfeit—before I had time to make any observation to her, an officer immediately appeared, and took her in custody—I marked the sixpence, and gave it to Murphy.</p>

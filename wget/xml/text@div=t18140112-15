He said, there was the person that had brought them; he pointed to the prisoner; the prisoner begged me to forgive her.</p>
               <p>MARGARET LEARY. I live in the same house as Mr. Herbert does. On the 8th of December, I saw the prisoner in Mr. Herbert's chamber, she asked me for an old lady in the garret that wound the engine; I said, there was an old lady that wound the engine. She went up two or three stairs, and came down again; I told Mr. Herbert directly.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Perkins, pawnbroker, Widegate-street. On the 8th of December, the prisoner came to our shop, she offered the articles to pledge; Mr. Herbert came, and asked if we had taken such articles; I said, look at these, and see if they are yours, I have had them just offered to me by this woman in the box, there is the woman, do as you like with the things, and Sapwell, the officer was sent for.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to Herbert's room in order to examine the room - A. I did; I have not a doubt but this chisel forced the door open; there were marks on the door and the post that just fitted this chisel. This is the chisel I found in the prisoner's pocket; the prisoner and me had a struggle before I could get the chisel from her.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the articles - A. They are all mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming through Widegate-street, a gentlewoman asked me to take them in, and she would give me some halfpence, and when I went in my prosecutor came in, and took me.</p>

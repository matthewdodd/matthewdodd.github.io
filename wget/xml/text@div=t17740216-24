            . I live in Queen-street , Cheapside. On Friday the 11th of February some neighbours that live opposite an uninhabited house of mine in <placeName id="t17740216-24-crimeloc135">Thomas Apostle</placeName>

Having a scaffold up at the house , some of the workmen had entered by the garret window, and were then in search for the person; in a few minutes one of the men came down, and brought the prisoner from the top of the house. There was a great quantity of lead cut away, part of two stacks, the gutter and eve lead; the prisoner said he was standing on the threshold of the door, that two men came and said they had a job for him, and bid him wait there till they came back again ; there was nothing found upon him but the padlock and staple of the door.</p>

            . I was working in the next house; my master discerned the leaden pipes were gone, and set me to watch; between five and six in the morning the prisoner came, went in, and bolted the door on the inside, that we could not follow, went up to the top of the adjoining house, and got in at the garret window; we searched the house, and at last found him in a cock lost; I searched him and found the padlock in his pocket. I found two pieces of lead in the kitchen, his tools and a bag. Before I went up into the garret I knocked two or three times at the door.</p>

On Saturday night, the 4th of December last, I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock; I was awoke at half-past two, on the Sunday morning, by a noise over head, as of some person jumping. I slept in a room opposite a passage leading into Saville-row: I saw a light, and heard something knocked down; I heard a voice say "D - n it, it is only the mens' beer!" I heard something like silver being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170016"></xptr>tossed up, and falling to the ground; I heard the fuse of a match taking fire. I then heard some one say, "Look to the door." I got out of bed, and went through the kitchen, which leads towards Burlington-street; I went and called my master; he, his brother, and myself went on the leads over the shop; there are two sky-lights there: one pane of glass was broken in one of them. My master showed me some blood on it next morning. The shop is near the room where I sleep; there are two doors to that room - one leads from the shop into a passage, which leads to Saville-row. I heard a door move while I was in bed - the door which leads into Saville-row was fastened with the spring lock after master got up, but it had been fastened with two bolts before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is your masters' house in Burlington-street? A. Yes; the warehouse is in Saville-row: there is a communication between them without going into the street; my master goes that way from time to time, to give orders, and do business. I heard a person jump, and a person speak, but I heard no answer. I do not know that there was more than one person there. By the fuse of a match, I mean the match taking light from the box; I have seen such things in the street; and heard the noise - it is the breathing of a flame. I did not see the pane of glass with the blood on it till the next morning. My master got up when I called him. I do not know that any other person was up at the time.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. You have been asked whether there were more than one person, and you say you heard a voice more than once - did they appear to be different voices? A. Yes. I distinctly heard the lighting of the fuse. There is a trap door from the room where the thieves were to my room - that door was open. I went out upon the leads - it did not rain then, but when I got up in the morning it appeared as if it had rained in the night. When I saw the blood it was on the inside.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How lately had you seen the window before? A. I do not know. The blood was a small smear - it might have been there a month before. I had not been on the leads for some time; I know that the skylight was whole in the course of the day before. When the glass was broken any person could have cut the string which fastened the sky-light.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and am the prosecutor's brother; his name is James Lane: the house is in the parish of St. James, Westminster; my brother is the sole owner of it. On the 4th of December I was sleeping there, and was awoke by my brother and Jones. The room in which I sleep joins the work-shop, and communicates with the leads, by means of a passage. I got out of bed - I went into my dressing-room, and got a pistol. We got on the leads - as I passed the sky-light I thought I saw a person, and discharged the pistol at him; when we got to the end of the leads, leading to Saville-row, we saw a man within two yards of our door; that was Durham, who was tried last Session; I searched the premises, and found behind the door leading to Saville-row, a dark lantern, with a small wax candle in it. I examined the post of the door next morning, and saw some smears of blood on the right hand door post, in going out, about a yard from the bottom. On the night in question I went to the watch-house, and while I was giving charge of Durham the prisoner was brought in, and searched in my presence - I saw two whole wax candles and a piece of one taken from his person; I think from his breeches pocket. I went home immediately, and fetched the lantern which I had found on the premises; I compared the candle in the lantern with those found on they prisoner; they corresponded exactly. He said he lived somewhere in Whitechapel; I did not observe his hand. I think he said he was a commission broker, but had only been a short time in town. I attended at Marlborough-street the following morning. I examined the sky-light about nine or ten o'clock; I observed part of one of the panes had been cut out, and a part of it was lying by the side; we then went into the shop, into which that sky-light looks - I saw several marks of blood, which had run down on the inside of the sky-light; they appeared to be fresh - they were hardly dry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That blood is the same as the boy saw? A. Yes. I think there were five marks.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many tailors there at work, and some awkward fellow might have cut his finger? A. Yes. The blood on the door post was outside, and could have been made by a person going by the house. Durham was near that very door, and he was the only man I saw near the house. He had on a black coat. I saw Durham's hands at the watch-house, and there was no appearance of any blood on them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the candles appear to be cut, or where they whole short candles? A. They were whole candles.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. George, Hanover-square. On the morning of the 5th of December I saw the prisoner while I was calling half-past two o'clock - he was coming from Mr. Lane's back premises, into Clifford-street, opposite Saville-row; I pursued him, but did not take him. When he was taken I saw some blood on one of his hands, but I cannot say which - it was more particularly examined by another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far from Saville-row was he when you first saw him? A. He might have turned the corner, about one hundred yards towards Bond-street; he was upon the run. I crossed over, and cried Stop thief! I had seen Durham at the watch-house before, and knew of the robbery. I went to the watch-house, and stopped there till another watchman brought the prisoner in.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Was there any alarm given to the watchmen about the robbery? A. Yes, and we had directions to look out.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat is in Berkley-square. I was induced to follow the prisoner on the morning of the 5th of December - at the corner of Hay-hill I heard the footsteps of two persons running; I saw the prisoner, and the last witness running after him; the prisoner thought to get into Landsdown-passage, but I stopped him there, and he turned back into Bruton-mews; I followed after him, and desired him to stop several times, but he made no answer. I made a prisoner of him just as he got to Bruton-street; I thought he would faint every minute, as he was blowing so - he asked me to let him rest a minute; he appeared very warm, like a person who had just been running. I let him stop some time, and he put his hand into his pocket to take his handkerchief to wipe some blood off his hand; another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170017"></xptr>watchman came to my assistance a few minutes before; while the prisoner was taking out his handkerchief something fell out of his pocket, which sounded like a key, or a piece of iron; I said, "Something dropped from you" - he said, "It must be from yourself, not from me." I told my companion to take notice of the place. I did not hurt his hand so as to make the blood come, nor did Wilkinson. There was no scuffle between us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What parish do you belong to? A. St. George's; Addison and Wilkinson belong to the same parish. There was no watchmen of St. James's there. The prisoner was taken to St. James's watch-house - he had a cut on his hand - I did not notice it particularly, but I think it was cut with glass; I think it was cut with the glass of a sky-light. I do not know which hand was cut, but I think the left - it was a small cut.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. George's, Hanover-square. I took the prisoner on the morning of the 5th of December. I heard something fall from him, which sounded like a key. We took him to Berkley-square, and delivered him to some watchmen of St. James's. I went back to the spot where I had heard something fall, and found two centre bits, which I delivered to Skinner, the patrol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know whether they laid upon the ground before, or fell from the prisoner? A. No. I was on his right side, and had hold of his right arm, I am not sure that he could not put that hand into his pocket. I saw the prisoner pull out his handkerchief, but I cannot tell whether it was at that time I heard the iron fall; I believe he had his hand in his pocket two or three times in going down the mews. I do not think what I heard drop was when he pulled out his handkerchief; it might be about ten minutes afterwards before I picked up the centre bits. I had not seen any persons walking there shortly before they fell.</p>

            . I was night constable. On the morning of the 5th of December the prisoner was brought to St. James's watch-house, and given in charge for attempting to commit a burglary in the house of Mr. Lane. When I requested him to account for his running, he could give no distinct reason, but said he was on his way home, and the watchmen had pursued him, and used him in a very rough manner; but he denied any knowledge of the transaction of which he was accused. I asked where he had been - I think he said he had been spending the evening near Knightsbridge; I then asked his name, and where he lived - he said he would reserve that for a future opportunity. On pressing him further on the point, he said he lived in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel - that he had lately come from Manchester, and his name was John Thompson. He was then searched, and a purse, with 3 s. or 4 s. was found on him. I kept the purse, and gave him the silver for his own use. I found a small knife, a glass, and three pieces of wax candles on his person. His hands were very dirty, and the right one bleeding very much - I desired him to shew it to me, which he did with great reluctance, and said it was in consequence of the struggle with the watchmen who took him captive - that it had been bruised against a wall - I looked at it, and though not a judge of wounds I am certain it could not have been from a bruise against a wall - it appeared to be cut with something sharp. The dark lantern was brought afterwards, by some of Mr. Lane's people; here is the lantern and the candle that was in it. The candle in his pocket exactly corresponds with that in the lantern. Durham was brought up the same evening, on the same charge - they did not appear to know each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On what part of the hand was the wound? A. It was about the middle of the back of the hand. I cannot undertake to say it might not have been made by some sharp nail in a wall, but I think not. I do not know whether the candles were particular ones or no.</p>

I am a watchman of St. James's. - On the 5th of December I apprehended Durham, near Burligton Arcade, in Cork-street; he dropped a chisel, which I delivered to the constable of the night. Durham was running towards me, and crying Stop thief; but there was no one in the street but himself. I took him back to the other watchmen, who said that was the man; I saw nothing of the prisoner till he was at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Stoker - he is a partner with Mr. Lane. I was at work at Mr. Lane's on the 4th of December - I shut the sky-light myself, and no pane of glass was broken then - the light is fastened by a cord which was cut the next morning. Cutting that cord would not enable a person to raise the sky-light higher - I think those who cut it did not understand it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the sky-light was shut as you left it, does it want any thing more than for a man to put his hand in to pull it up? A. No. It was not fastened by a bolt or latch, or any other fastening whatever. I had seen it on the Saturday evening, about six o'clock; it could not have been left a little way open - its own weight would have shut it.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES LANE. On the morning after the burglary I observed the sky-light open; it was propped up by this chisel, which I marked at the top - no person could have got in by any other means, but at this sky-light. My father, Mr. Richard Lane, and Mr. Peter Stoker are in partnership with me. At the time the alarm was given I went to that part of the premises leading to Saville-row; I found the door only on the spring, which had been double bolted and locked. Whoever opened that door must have done it to get out, not to get in.</p>

            . I was landlord of the Fox and Goose, public-house, on the 5th of December. Durham had lodged with me for a week or ten days; he left a box behind him in my room - some person, who was a stranger, called afterwards for a shirt belonging to him; I gave him a shirt and a pair of stockings. I have seen the prisoner in my house two or three times, but I never recollect seeing him in conversation with Durham. I delivered three keys to Cousins, and one of them fitted the box.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Black Horse-court, Fleet-street. About the 5th of December the prisoner lodged at my house, by the name of Lintott - he had a two pair of stairs room; he lived there five months, till he was taken up. Cousins, the officer, came and searched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170018"></xptr>his apartment - I believe he took something out of his room. I saw a bundle, but I do not know what was in it. I did not know a person of the name of Durham. - I do not know how the prisoner got his living - he behaved very well in my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not Black Horse-court nearly opposite Whitefriars? A. It is two doors from Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a person have misunderstood Whitefriars for Whitechapel? A. I do not know.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I went to the Fox and Goose on the 10th of December - I enquired if a person of the name of Durham lived there; the landlord said he had, and showed me his room. I took two large skeleton keys from a drawer that day, and Mr. Newman gave me three keys - one of which opened a box, and I found some duplicates in it; I took them, and gave the keys back to Mr. Newman. I went again next day, and took a pair of worsted stockings and a shirt from the box: they were marked H. D. I afterwards went to Catherine Winwood's, No. 11, Black Horse-court, Fleet-street; I went to Lintott's room, on the second pair of stairs; I found in a drawer three files, a picklock key, and a phosphorus box, with no phosphorus in it - there were some matches in a piece of paper, and two small bits of wax candle, one of them appears to be cut at the end, to fit some small nozzle - in a second drawer I found a shirt, marked H. D., and a pair of speckled stockings, marked H. D., with ink: they appear to be marked in the same manner, and I think by the same hand as those found at Newman's. The shirt at Lintott's was marked H. D., and the shirt at Newmen's was marked H. D., No. 5 - they appear to be marked with the same sort of marking thread. On a chair in the room I found a dirty shirt, marked J. L. I then went into the cellar, and in a hole, behind some bricks, I found two bundles of skeleton keys. I have been in the habit of comparing property of different kinds, and I believe the shirts are made of the same sort of cloth; the stockings appear to be the same. I have seen the prisoner before he was in custody; I received a chisel from the night constable, which I marked, and gave to him again. I took the chisel, and compared it with the marks on the sky-light; it corresponded with them exactly; the other chisel was supporting the sky-light, but that did not correspond with the marks at all. I received the stock of a centre bit from a person of the name of Carter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did the sky-light shut? A. It appeared to require something to hold it up, but when down it did not appear to have any fastening but its own weight; one of the chisels was used to keep it up. A man could have got in when it was raised up. I am not a linen-draper. I have not marked much linen, but my own linen is marked. The prisoner had been in custody some days before I went to his lodgings - he could have sent to his lodgings if he had been so disposed. I knew where he had lived for some time before he was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. WM. LANE re-examined. I saw Cousins compare the chisel with the marks on the sky-light - they appeared to fit it exactly.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 28th of November I saw the prisoner and Durham together in company with Abrahams; it was about half-past eleven, or a little before twelve o'clock at night; they appeared to me to be in company together; there were other persons there. I have known the prisoner five or six months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you in the room? A. They might be together five or six, or seven minutes, and then Linlott went out. It is not uncommon for persons sitting in such a room as that to talk together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury, considering the situation in which I stand, I find it a most arduous task to address you - in a case like this, involving my life and liberty, but, relying on my innocence, I shall await your judgment with confidence. I had been to supper at the West end of the town - in returning I heard an alarm of Stop thief! a man ran past me - I pursued him: he turned up a mews; I stood still, and the watchman came and laid hold of me; I told them I was not the person - they said I was, and took me down the mews. I heard something strike against the stones, but I dropped nothing. They looked some time, and then went on to the bottom of the mews, where several watchmen were; it was two watchmen belonging to St. George's, who had me in custody - there were several watchmen, and they were contending about where I should he taken. I complained of my hand being hurt when I was up at Marlborough-street; the Magistrate desired one of the officers to look at my hand, and the officers gave it as their opinion that it was not a cut, but torn or rent. There is no evidence that I had been on the premises, and it must strike you as evident that if the sky-light would not lift up more than nine inches, it would not be possible for me to get through so small a crevice as that. The witnesses state there was blood on the sky-light, and on the door - but there is no evidence to prove I was near either. They state they came and looked over the leads, and saw the young man not included in the indictment, near the door. The nearest that any of them states I was, is one hundred yards at least, and it must have been very difficult for him to identify me; if any one had seen me near the premises it would have been evidence on the subject. The watchmen admit each of them having hold of an arm in the mews, and therefore it was not possible for me to let the bits fall from my person. You will, Gentlemen, have the goodness to look at these articles, and in a mews, which has always rough stones, it would be very easy for any person walking to have kicked them against the stones. As to the things which are stated to have been found at my lodgings, there is no proof that they were ever there, but an attempt has been made to crimluate me, and it is entirely out of malice that these things are brought here. The young man tried with me last Session was an entire stranger to me. I have now been nearly three months in custody; I was brought up last Session, but through some mistake in the indictment I was then sent back, and have had the greatest difficulty in providing myself with evidence to clear myself; while my prosecutors have had every advantage. I beg, Gentleman, you will consider the nature of the evidence is entirely circumstantial, and the very deceptive nature of such evidence, and I conjure you to divest your minds of every prejudice that may have arisen during this examinaation. One of the witnesses, of the name of Purton, who has this day come forward against me, was wanted as much at Marlborough-street, but then he was not brought forward.</p>

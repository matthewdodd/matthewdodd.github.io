On the 13th of August I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock at night, and bolted both the doors. The shutters were left wide open, but the sash was closed I am certain - it would open by sliding it outside; it has no fastening. My lodgers were all at home, and in their rooms - I went to bed last. The articles stated in the indictment were sent me to wash. I got up first next morning, about half-past five, went into the back-room, and found the window wide open - somebody must have pushed it aside; these things were gone. My house is five miles from Lee-bridge.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 14th of August, between half-past three and four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming over Lee-bridge, from the Essex side, with a bundle, it was then just getting light. I stopped him, and asked what he had got? he said he had got clothes, was going to town, and had brought them from his sister's. I asked where she lived? he said he did not know, then said she lived with a farmer named Perkins, about a mile and a half lower down (pointing to the Essex side). I said it was odd he did not know where it was, or the name of the place - he said he did not, for he had only been there two days with her. I took him to Hackney watch-house; he carried the bundle himself all the way. He gave the constable of the night the same account. The pantaloons and waistcoat were in the crown of his hat. The rest of the property was in the bundle. The prosecutrix's house is about five miles from Lee-bridge.</p>

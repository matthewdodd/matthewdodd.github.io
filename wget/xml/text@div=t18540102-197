               <p>Thames-bank. On 12th Dec., about 10 o'clock at night, the prisoner and another man came to my house—they had a pint of half-and-half—I received a bad florin from one of them, I cannot tell which—they drank together and left together—I put the florin into the till where there was no other florin, only smaller coin—after they had gone, I took out the till to see what we had done in the course of the evening, and found that the florin was bad—I followed them, and saw them in the next street; they sepa<lb></lb>rated, then joined again, and I watched them down Lucas-street, and missed one of them—I looked into a public house, but could not see him—I went further on, and saw the taller man leaning against the wall of Messrs. Cubitt's works—he crossed the road, and I informed the police—I gave the florin to the policeman; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

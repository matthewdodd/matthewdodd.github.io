            . I am a clerk in the bank; I am in the drawing office; that is the office where the running cash of the merchants is kept; this draught was presented for payment on the 21st of October, 1765; I believe in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the person who presented it; should you know the man if you saw him?</p>
               <p>Gething. He was a middle sized man; I cannot be positive to his person; I gave a ticket to the person for particular bank notes, according to his request, to the amount of the bill; I have here a memorandum of the bills.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. What did you take the memorandum from?</p>
               <p>Gething. From another memorandum taken by another clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the ticket put that you gave for the particular notes?</p>

            . I am a cashier in the bank, and was so in the year 1765.</p>
               <p>Q. What way is the account kept between gentlemen who keep cash at the bank?</p>
               <p>Gething. There is an office called the drawing office; every gentleman that keeps cash at the bank, has a book of debtor and creditor, when he pays any money, it is of course entered by a proper officer. It is common to draw drafts upon printed checks which we give them.</p>
               <p>Q. How are the checks delivered out?</p>
               <p>Gething. We have them in books, a thousand in a book, which runs alphabetically; when one book is out, of course we begin the next letter; the checks are so cut out, that they tally with what is left; when any person wants checks they send their book to the discount office, and the proper officer delivers the checks, as they have occasion for them.</p>

            . I am a teller at the Bank; (I paid these six bank-notes, producing them,) one for 1000 l. I paid, I think, on the 29th, four for 500 l. each, and one for 600 l. that I paid on the 30th; it was before one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. To what sort of a person?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. He seemed to be an outlandish man. He did not seem to be very quick at telling money, he told one parcel of it which he took away, and said he should come again for the other; I told him we had a porter that could take it home for him; he said I am only going to the compting-house, and shall be back before you go to dinner; he came back again in about a quarter of an hour for the other money, which he took up without telling. I said, do not you tell it? he said, no; it is right enough, you are generally right.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had he the first time?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. Sixteen hundred, and came again for the thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know the man again that you paid the money to?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. It is a long time ago; he wore his own hair, and spoke broken English.</p>

            . I am in the discount office at the Bank - that is the office in which checks are delivered out; (takes the forged draught in his hand) this check, upon which this is drawn, was, with 29 more, delivered by me, on the 5th of October 1765, the numbers I delivered out were 6920 to 6950, both numbers inclusive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bank-book produced at that time?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any part of the inside of it?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the Book? (shewing the witness a Bank book.)</p>
               <p>Jones. I believe that to be the book.</p>

               <p>Jones. A tall gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the account you gave in the year 1765.</p>
               <p>Jones. That as the person went out of the office, I said, there goes a genteel clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go so far as to say you knew who the person was?</p>
               <p>Jones. I said, at that time, that I thought it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think so now?</p>
               <p>Jones. I have no satisfactory reason to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Jones. He was so.</p>

             and Co. I do the out door business. I was with them in the year 1765. I fetched the checks from the bank, I always had 50.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you do with them, when you receive them?</p>
               <p>Russia. I separate them with scissars, and then put them in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any person in the compting-house access to them then?</p>
               <p>Russia. Yes;</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the company's book kept?</p>
               <p>Russia. In a desk, and sometimes in the store-room, but still the clerks might have access to it; that I believe is the book that belonged to the house, I always took it with me when I went to receive any checks.</p>
               <p>Council. Look at that draught, does the signature imitate Mr. Olivier's hand-writing, is it his hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Russia. I rather think not, because the draught is filled up with another hand-writing; I took that account at the bank and a note for 500 l. the ballance they gave me in a note, that there was but 500 l. when I came back with this draught in the box, I said it was not Mr. Olivier's writing. Mr. Walpole being abroad at that time, I am certain he came back soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been abroad before, a month or more?</p>
               <p>Russia. Yes, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell when you left the book to be ballanced?</p>
               <p>Russia. I think about the beginning of November.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Your only reason for not supposing it to be Mr. Olivier's hand-writing is, the body of it was filled up by a stranger, and not by any body in the house?</p>
               <p>Russia. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Is it like his?</p>
               <p>Russia. Mr. Olivier generally writes larger.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion on the signature without the body?</p>
               <p>Russia. I could not take on me to swear; it really represents it very much.</p>
               <p>Q. But what is your opinion, whether it is or is not, in truth, merely by looking at the signature?</p>
               <p>Russia. It imitates it so much that I could not take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Then you had no other reason, but only it's being filled up with another hand, then nor now?</p>
               <p>Russia. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the suspicions you entertained of this draught, take any account of the checks, drawn or undrawn, and compare them with the checks you had fetched from the bank?</p>
               <p>Russia. I saw several checks in the drawer not used, and compared them with this, and this is a different letter and number from any I fetched; we looked immediately in the drawer they corresponded letter and number, but this was quite a different number.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Was it not customary to leave this bank-book at the Bank for a considerable time together?</p>
               <p>Russia. Two or three days, perhaps, only to be balanced.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecutor. But it was never left when you went for checks?</p>
               <p>Russia. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. You said, you delivered the checks to a genteel man; is this witness the man?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this man Russia?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes; I have delivered to him checks. I have seen him there for checks.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the money was replaced, the Bank took it on themselves.</p>

            . I was a waiter last January at the Antigallican coffee house, behind the 'Change. On Wednesday, the 15th of January last, about half past eight in the morning, one Mr. Wood came to the coffee house; he sent me to Mr. Walpole's, the banker in Lombard Street, for some checks, in the name of Mr. Oliver; the clerks said Mr. Oliver never sent for checks without a written order, unless he sent the book; and they refused to let me have any. I went back to Mr. Wood, and informed him of what the clerks had said, and desired he would send his name in writing: I gave him a slip of paper, and he wrote upon it - Oliver.</p>
               <p>Council. You must not relate any thing that passed respecting Mr. Wood, but come immediately to what you know respecting the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Perryman. Upon Wood's being detected in the forgery, Mr. Bourne, Mr. Walpole's partner, sent me to inform Sir 
               <persName id="t17720429-78-person695">

             of it. A thought came into my head, that if I went to Mr. Wood's friends, it might be a means of saving his life, as well as what might happen here; accordingly I went to Mr. Vestenburgh; the servant told me he was not stiring; I told him, I must see Mr. Vestenburgh upon business of the utmost importance; the servant carried the message up to his master, and brought word down, that I must go up; I went into his bed chamber; he jumped up in his bed and rested upon his arm, and said, waiter, what is the matter! I said, Sir I am afraid Mr. Wood has committed a forgery; Mr. Vestenburgh said, it is impossible! my God, it cannot be! I said it appeared too plain; I said if you will come and give him an item in Dutch to destroy the draught, it may prevent the consequences; then I went to Sir Joshua's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Vestenburg go to the coffee house?</p>
               <p>Perryman. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him at the coffee house afterwards?</p>
               <p>Perryman. I cannot say I have, though he might come in and out.</p>
               <p>Q. He came very often before I believe.</p>
               <p>Perryman. Yes; sometimes two or three times a day.</p>
               <p>Rev. Melchor Justus Vanhessen. The same day that Mr. Wood was taken up, Mr. Vestenburgh came to me at my apartments, No. 51, Threadneedle Street. I said what is the matter with you, you are so pale? he said he was frightned out of his wits, by a message from a waiter at the Antigallican coffee house; who told him that Wood had done a bad action, and that he was frightened for Wood; he said he had been at the coffee house; I asked him what he did there; did he speak to him? he said no; he asked me to interest myself in it; I said I would have nothing to do with such an affair, so begged to be excused; I told him I did not like Wood, and I wished he had never been acquainted with him; I said why do not you apply to his friends; he said he is your countryman, and you have a tender heart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear under any extraordinary agitation?</p>
               <p>Vanhessen. No; he appeared pale. On the next day (Thursday) I was invited to dine at a certain Tavern in St. James's Street; I went in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290044"></xptr> the afternoon; the prisoner was there; the conversation fell upon Wood; Vestenburg appeared to be very uneasy, and wished he could lend him any assistance; and then he proposed writing a letter to his father; then he said the mail might be retarded, and proposed going over himself. I thought that the greatest friendship he could shew him, and the company present approved of it, was that he should write a letter to Wood, to acquaint him of his intention of going and doing him all possible friendship; and he wrote a note for a post chaise. I did not see him any more.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have known Mr. Vestenburg some years.</p>
               <p>Vanhessen. About eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not Wood and he townsmen abroad?</p>
               <p>Vanhessen. I believe so: I have heard them talk so long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What character does Mr. Vestenburg bear?</p>
               <p>Vanhessen. As far as I know he is honest, and very charitably disposed.</p>

            . Mr. Vestenburg called upon me at Mess. Muilman's compting house on the 15th of January, between nine and ten in the morning, and desired me to come to his house; I went the same day, when he told me, that Mr. Wood had forged a draught; I said I hoped it would turn out to be not true; I believe I said it was likely that this might revive the affair in 1765.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing strike you at that time?</p>
               <p>Tenbrooke. No; not till he was called for, and was missing, then, upon recollection. I thought I did observe a confusion; I thought he was not in his usual manner of behaviour; he seemed to be disturbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any letter from him?</p>
               <p>Tenbrooke. Yes, and there was a letter enclosed to Mr. Wood. I threw them both into the fire, after Mr. Muller and I had read them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any particular reasons for throwin them into the fire?</p>

            . On the 15th of January Mr. Vestenburg sent me a letter, desiring me to meet him at the Standard Tavern, which I did; he immediately spoke about Wood, how improperly he had acted; he seemed disappointed that my other brother and Mr. Vanbeffen were not presents from thence we went to the St. Alban's Tavern; we bespoke dinner there for the next day. Mr. Vestenburg went with us to our house at Islington, and staid there all night, as he had often done; we went to the St. Alban's the next day; the prisoner and my brother Nathaniel came together, and my brother Joseph and I went from the Change; and Mr. Vanheffen was there; the prisoner proposed going to Holland to Wood's father; we went from the tavern, to Mr. Vestenburgh's house in Austin Friars. I think a message was sent to order a post chaise in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was to be his correspondent while he was abroad.</p>

I am acquainted, that some of the Old Bailey solicitors are the most proper persons to be consulted in this matter, if 8 or 10. guineas should be wanting in that manner, I shall be accountable to you for that sum.</p>
               <p>I shall see you as soon as possible, as I shall stay but a very short, time at Helvost.</p>

               <p>I am hardly recovered of my surprize of last Wednesday; unluckily I came a little too late to immediately assist you, however, I went directly to proper friends for advice, I did not meet with that success I expected; but, in the mean time, have neglected nothing for your good: my now pecunary circumstances exclude my being so forcibly your friend as I could wish, but I am determined to use the last effort of an old acquaintance and townsman. I have found from later information, that your case is far from being desperate, and though criminal, admits of many advantageous objections provided that you will take proper advice, which I hope you will by no means neglect: now as my affairs will not admit of my giving you any direct assistance with money, I acquaint you that I am gone over to your father to acquaint him verbally with your unfortunate circumstances, and persuade him to do all in his power to save you from this predicament, which I would have done by letter, did I not know what little attention he would have paid to it; this letter is under cover of Mr. Tenbrooke he was one of the first friends I spoke to about you, I make no doubt but he will be of service to you, at least, in recommending a capable person to assist you; I myself have frequently profited in my last troubles of his, and am persuaded his intentions are good. As soon as I see your father you shall hear from me, in the mean time, I hope my personal appearance for the good of his son, will have the desired effect on the heart of the father.

               <p>I arrived at Dover at 2 o'clock I had a most terrible cold night and a great snow if I had set out from London at 4 in the afternoon it's likely thro' the darkness I should have been burryed under it on this side Canterburry The Boat cannot possibly set of to night but are in hopes of tomorrow morning if the weather is in Flanders as here I make a doubt if I can get a cross the country in 8 days if at all for in same places no stages can go at least by way of Dunkirk with this snow that one is obliged to go amasing way about or walk a dozen or 2 miles You cannot write to me but by next Tuesday's post I write the direction at bottom it will be very difficult to make your letters meet us with any regularity as it is impossible for me to calculate the time I shall be at any particular places however this first Letter from you I shall take care to receive I shall write you further by the first opportunity the Boat is waiting for my Letter Adieu my Dear friend and remember me to all friends - God bless you.</p>

               <p>Dear Friend,</p>
               <p>Just a little before 3 oClock I wrote you a few lines since I recollect the P. S. was forgot however it happens not to be of any material consequence as this will reach you a Monday and in course time enough for Tuesday Evening to prevent nevertheless a second neglect it's as follows</p>
               <p>To Mr. Jan Vander Voght in Swinshoosd at Dordreght Holland</p>
               <p>in Case my Arrival should anticipate your Letter care shall be taken that it reaches me as soon as time and place will admit of. It's a pity we did not determine this point more exactly for in crossing the water and traversing the country it is impossible to six within three or four days my receiving any of your favours besides in France and Flanders and the Garrison'd Town of Holland names are punctually registered in and out in commerciall and large Towns I am too well known by somebody or another and consequently is resquing some disagreeable trouble therefore it will be necessary for me to endeavor to six upon another more convenient place mean time I am in great expectation of a circumstantial account till Tuesday 21 next</p>
               <p>I am amazingly tired and am going to bed immediately we propose to go to morrow by times should any thing occur shall add it to the P.

               <p>Hernpeck. To the best of my remembrance I carried them to Moorfields, to a certain tavern, called the Globe, to Mr. Wood and Vestenburgh, and delivered them the notes; which according to my remembrance was the whole sum. I went for it but once; but I fetched the money at two times. I did not meet Mr. Wood, and not knowing where to carry the money, I carried it to his lodgings, at an inn in Bishopsgate street. I went back again to the Bank, and on the second time of coming from the Bank I met Mr. Wood; and he conducted me to the Globe tavern, where I delivered the money; Mr. Vestenburgh was not present. I was desired to dine with them the same day, at the Queen's Arms, St. Paul's Church Yard. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290048"></xptr> went there and Mr. Vestenburgh was there; the affair was talked over, that it was a forgery, and Mr. Wood told me when I brought him the money the second time at the Globe Tavern, that it was a forgery: and that it was necessary that I should go off, because I should be known; and if I would, they would give me 4 or 500 l. the same transaction at the Bank was talked over again; Vestenburgh agreed to every thing that Wood said, that it was a forgery; Wood repeated what he had said to me, and Vestenburgh agreed to the same point, that it was necessary that I should go abroad. Mr. Wood and the prisoner agreed to give me 4 or 500 l. to go abroad; which I agreed to; 130 l. was paid me two or three days before I went abroad; Wood paid me 80 l. in cash, and Vestenburgh gave me a bill on Mr. Muilman and sons, in Amsterdam for fifty pounds; (a bill shewn the witness) this is the bill to the best of my remembrance; the indorsement according to my opinion is Vestenburgh's.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hodges. Do you know the handwriting of that indorsement?</p>
               <p>Hodges. I believe it is Mr. Vestenburgh's; I don't know the writing to the second indorsement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the draft of Miulman and sons?</p>
               <p>Hodges. In the course of four or five months, I received the remainder of the money, that was promised me to make up the 500 l. I was then in Holland, from

               <p>Q. Did you settle any place on going over in Holland?</p>
               <p>Hernpeck. No; I was there almost a year and a half before I settled in Holland. Wood and Vestenburgh desired that I should not settle; they said it was not yet time to settle, but that I should move about.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said before, there was an intimacy between Wood, you, and Vestenburgh.</p>
               <p>Hernpeck. Yes, I came acquinted with the prisoner when Wood and I lodged in the same house, through the means of Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in company with Vestenburgh and Wood after receiving the money in London?</p>
               <p>Hernpeck. Two or three times we have been at the Globe Tavern. I went to Holland about the 5th or 6th of Nov. 1765. I received the money the day I left England.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went over to Holland, you say you moved several times?</p>
               <p>Hernpeck. Yes; Wood desired me not to keep long in one place. I have been in England since that time, about 24 or 25 months ago. I had been once before, about three or four years ago. I came over with a gentleman as a companion, and staid about three or four weeks; but I was only two days in London, the rest in the country.</p>

               <p>Q. to Tenbrooke. Do you remember the prisoner's applying to your house for a bill?</p>
               <p>Tenbrooke. I don't remember any thing in particular of that bill; he had credit for 300 at our house at Amsterdam on an uncle of his.</p>
               <p>- Shields. Hernpeck was an assistant with me; he left me on the 6th Nov. 1765, without any notice; I did not know of his going two or three days before he went; he said he had an estate left him, by a father or an uncle in Holland.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Wood and Hernpeck lodged at my house. I have seen the prisoner come to Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Hernpeck and Wood intimate?</p>
               <p>Moore. Yes, very intimate; they said they were of the same country.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have only to say that I declare myself innocent of the crimes alledged against me. As to what is advanced, in regard to the respect I paid to Mr. Wood, in going over to Holland, it proceeded from friendship; we were born next door to each other, in a country town in Holland; you have heard what Mr. Hodges has said of what passed between us.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. My Lord, it may be proper to explain what is meant, where he desires no notice should be taken of his going to Holland for fear some disagreeable consequences should ensue.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hodges. Can you give the court a reason for Mr. Vestenburgh's conduct in that particular?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodges. He had had connections in the way of trade, with one Groneveil in Holland; and there is a dispute between them, so that if Vestenburgh had gone publickly to Holland, he would have been arrested; and if Groneveil had come over here, doubtless he would have been arrested.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muilman. I believe he was perfectly right in not letting them know he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hodges. Was not Mr. Vestenburgh in good business at that time.</p>
               <p>Hodges. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a man of extravagence or expence?</p>
               <p>Hodges. No, far from it, and he was very well respected.</p>

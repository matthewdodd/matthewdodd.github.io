On 19th April, from information I received, I watched Davis—I saw him about 6.45 in the evening, in Crutched Friars, with a hogshead of sugar in his van, which he had received from the Great Northern Railway Company's place—the van belonged to Matthew Orchard, a carman—I followed the van to the comer of Gray's Inn Road—he stopped there, and went into a public-house—he came out with two other men, and they all three got into the van, and went up Gray's Inn Road, and up Euston Road, till they got to Chapel Street, Paddington—on their way through Gray's Inn Road, Davis and one of the others got up on each side of the van, and looked round occasionally—the third man was under the tarpaulin, which was raised up, as if he was working under<lb></lb>neath—the tarpaulin covered a cask of sugar—when they got to Chapel Street, they met Broom, with a trolley belonging to Peter Priestley—it is used for carrying hogsheads of sugar—Broom drew his trolley round behind the van, and Davis brought a bag out of the van, and put it on Broom's trolley, and Broom covered it up with a tarpaulin—after the bag was transferred, they went on to Praed Street, about 100 yards, with the van and the trolley—they went into a public-house there—Davis came out with one of the other men, and drove off—I followed Broom and the other man in the trolley, to the corner of Three Colts Lane, Cambridge Heath Road, Bethnal Green, where they stopped at a public-house—the other man went away—I went up to Broom, and said I should take him, for being concerned with others, in stealing a bag of sugar—he was not in sight of the trolley at that time—he said he knew nothing about it—I said "There is a bag of sugar on the trolley"—he said he knew nothing about it—I then drove the trolley to the Seething Lane police-station, and sent Broom in a cab, with two other constables—I took possession of the sugar—it weighed 1 cwt. 19lbs.—I afterwards went with another officer to Mr. Orchard, the carman's place, in George Yard, Whitechapel—Davis came there about 11.30 at night, and I took him in custody—I found this piece of tin in his van, and spoke to him about it—I have a sample of the sugar here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I am a carman at 8, Sparrow Corner, near the Minories—on 19th April, about 7 o'clock in the evening, Davis was there with one of my vans—a tierce of sugar was put into it, which he was to take to Mr. Bell, a grocer, of Kensal Road—it was sound at that time—I had previously set Hutt to watch Davis—Hutt came back, and at 11 o'clock Davis came in—I saw the officer take that piece of tin out of the cart—it is what usually covers the bungholes of a cask of sugar.</p>

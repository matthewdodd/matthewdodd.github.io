                  </hi>. I live at 35, Litchfield Grove, Finchley, and am a brickmaker—on Tuesday, 11th August, I was standing at the gate of a field opening into the Finchley Road, about 5.30 in the afternoon—it would be about 100 yards from the Queen's Head public-house—I heard the sound of horse's feet coming down the road and I shot out into the middle of the road, and saw a vehicle coming with a horse at full gallop in the direction of Einchley—I should think if was going 13 miles an hour on the off side of the road, the wrong side—it was a two-wheeled cart—it was about 200 yards from me, as near as I can guess, when I first saw it—I saw the old man Gregory coming out of a garden close by before I saw the horse at all—he had a barrow of potatoes and was going towards Finchley, in. the same direction as the vehicle—he was on the off side of the road when he first come out of the garden and crossed the road—there was a piece of matting laid in the road about 5 or 6 feet from the off side—he put his barrow down, picked the matting up and chucked it in hedge, then he went back to his barrow and proceeded along the road—that was before I saw the horse—I was behind Gregory all the time—he was going towards the Queen's Head—the horse and vehicle passed me, and from what I could see of it the man never changed his course in the least—I could not say that he checked his speed</p>

               <p>at all—I was behind him when he ran against the man with the barrow he dragged the man and barrow before him 52 feet—I ran and picked the old man up and we took him over to the public house—I pulled my rule out of my pocket and measured the distance at the time—the cart struck with the near wheel on the off side of the barrow—he was between the barrow and the path—I have measured the road where it took place—it is 21 feet wide—the barrow was 14 feet from the near side, that was from where the barrow struck the ground, and on the off side between the barrow and the path it was about 5 feet 6 inches—there was a clear space between the be arrow and the near side of 14 feet—I picked up the old man and found him bleeding from the leg—I can't say which leg it was—the driver of the cart was brought back again—the prisoner was the man who was driving the cart—I said to him when he came back "Are you drunk?"—he said "I have had nothing to drink"—he was detained and a constable was sent for and he was given in custody, but a doctor was sent for first—the prisoner pulled up the horse about 40 or 50 yards beyond the place where he had dragged the barrow—the road was straight where the old man was and there were no other vehicles passing along the road at the time—I did not hear him shout or call in any way for him to get out of the way he sat very quietly in the cart with the reins in his hands when he passed me—there would have been ample room for him to have gone clear on the left side—I believe the prisoner had had something to drink by his appearance—I did not smell him at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 7, Stanley Terrance, Church End, Finchley—on Tuesday, 11th August, I saw the old man Gregory coming along the Finchley Road with a barrow load of potatoes he was on the off side of the road about 5 feet 6 inches from the footpath—I was coming towards him—I saw the prisoner coming up the road with a horse and cart going about 12 or 14 miles an hour—the horse was galloping and was on the off side of the road—he never altered his course or tried to pull up or slacken his speed, and he smashed into the poor old man—the off wheel was on the off side and the near wheel caught the man and the barrow—there was not room between the footpath and the barrow for him to pass—he dragged the man and the barrow 52 feet—I called out to the prisoner to stop and ran after the horse and brought it kick to where the injured man was lying—the prisoner pulled the horse up about 30 or 40 yards from where the barrow was left—he appeared to me to be the worse for drink by the way he behaved himself—a sober man would never have done it—he laughed at it, and if he had been sober he never would have done that—I did not see any other vehicles to prevent him passing on the near side—the old man's name was John Gregory—I had known him for years.</p>

I am House Surgeon at the University Hospital—John Gregory was brought there on 11th August—I did not see him at that time—I took charge of the wards on the 17th—he had a contused wound on the outer side of the left knee, and a great deal of brusing, with profuse suppuration of the leg; and I had to make two incisions to allow the escape of pus—he had congestion of both bases of his lungs, and we found upon a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination that he had fatty degeneration of the heart and gangrene—I think the cause of death was some injury he had received to the left leg—I think a younger man, with a sounder constitution, would have recovered.</p>

She was only a four year old mare, and gets hold of the bit; she was in the habit of stopping at a place, and has not been properly broken in. After I left my master at Saint John's Wood I had no drink. I lived with the Marquis of Anglesea for three and a half years; his coachman would speak for me."</p>

I pulled her up as soon as ever I could; she was only a four-year old mare.</p>

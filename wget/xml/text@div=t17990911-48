On the 5th of August, I had seen the property mentioned in the indictment running about the yard; I saw them again about three o'clock in the day; I was sent for, and told that two women had been stopped with them; I went to Mr. King's a farmer, about half a mile from me; I saw the duck, four chickens, and the hen; I had had the hen these five years, the hen I am very sure of, the duck and the chickens I cannot be sure of; the hen was dead when I found it, but quite warm; the duck and the chickens were alive, they were taken to the Magistrate's, and from there I took them home; the two prisoners had been employed about me as hay-makers; the weather had been bad, and I believe they were very much distrest; they lodged in a rick-yard close by me.</p>

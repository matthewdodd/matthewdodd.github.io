                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Jubilee-place, Chelsea. I have some bars over the door of my shop to admit the air—on the morning of the 10th of Jan., a little before six o'clock, I was aroused by the policeman—I found a piece of mutton had been removed from a hook, and was partly through the bars—it weighed 41bs.—there was the mark of the person's foot outside, where he had got up to get it.</p>

A little before six o'clock in the morning, on the 10th of Jan., I saw the prisoner standing in the pro<lb></lb>secutor's door-way, reaching his hand up and pulling something—he saw or heard me, and walked away—I went to the door and saw a piece of meat projecting through the bars—I then followed the prisoner and took him—he said, "What do you want with me, I have done nothing"—his hands were greasy—I took him to the door—he tried to shove the meat back, and said, "I did not intend to steal it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He tried to put his hand through, and he knows a man's hand could not go through the bars. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I got my hand and arm through very easily—he had both his hands up, and was pulling very hard—it was very nearly through—if I had not come up it would have own through—the hook was sixteen or eighteen inches inside.</p>

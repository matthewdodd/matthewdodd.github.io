            , I live in London-wall. On the 21st of February, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I accompanied the prisoner's wife, 
               <persName id="t18230409-40-person407">

            , to where her husband (the prisoner) worked, in St. Mary-axe - she had been separated from him; I had known her two or three years, but I never saw him before this happened; she and I waited together a few minutes, (it was then a little past eight o'clock,) and I saw the prisoner come out, she said,</p>
               <p>"Marshall, is that you," and caught hold of his coat. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't be in a passion," (she did not appear in a passion;) he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, what do you want;" she said she came for 3 s., her weekly sum, and that it was a great deal too little. He said if she was not satisfied with that, she should have no more, and he would sooner leave the country - there was a great deal of talk. She said,</p>
               <p>"It's a hard winter, and I am in debt for rent,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090021"></xptr>give me a shilling or two more" - he gave her the three shillings, and said he had no more for her. She tried to persuade him to give her more; he said he had had good advice from four or five Magistrates, and he would fix her - she said if he would not hear her in the street, she would go home to his house - they then parted; she lived at No. 4, Moor-lane. I told him he must pardon my interfering, but the poor old lady had been very ill, and was in arrears for rent and 3 s. was very little; he asked if I lived in the same house as her, I said No; we parted, she went home, and about quarter before ten o'clock I accompanied her to his house; I went in with her and was told he was a bed - I sat down and got into conversation with the woman of the house for a short time, and he came out of the bed room on the same floor; no message had been sent to him; I suppose he heard our voices - I think he was dressed, but his night cap was on - he came out with a sword in his hand, and brandished it about, and said</p>
               <p>"d - n your eyes I'll kill you both." The people of the house ran round the table; his wife got up and run. I was struck to the ground by the fright; I tried to go up stairs, but not knowing the house, I got into a corner; he struck at me with the sword; not a word had passed between us before; the clock had struck; and his wife said</p>
               <p>"That is my clock," I worked hard for it; I was the first person he struck at; the first blow I received was on the head. He looked more like a madman than a man in his senses. I received a blow on my shoulder also. I got in the corner as I was afraid of my life; he called out</p>
               <p>"Come out d - n you, or I will kill you or murder you." I said "I will come out, but do not strike me;" his wife had got to the door and got out; but she was wounded on her arm. I had got the poker and shielded it off; his wife opened the door and cried murder, and the watchman came up. I believe I received four or five blows; the people of the house had run up stairs crying murder. I had one wound in the shoulder, one in my hand, and one in my head. They are nothing to mention. I was bruised in my arm; he struck with the sword, but I suppose it must be with the left side of it; his wife had been separated from him two or three years. I never saw him before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you first saw him in the street, did not the wife take hold of him by the collar - A. No; she took hold of his waiscoat by the breast. I told her not to be in a passion. I went to make peace between them. I went to accompany her.</p>
               <p>Q. Thinking her not a match for him - A. I do not think she was; one son lives with her; another is married, and lives with him. I was sober and believe she was; I never saw her in liquor. I did not threaten to break the windows, nor did she - she went there to fetch her son, and persuaded me to go with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the supper table spread, and seated yourselves - A. I did not sit down till I was asked; we were laughing when he came into the room. I took and held the poker up, but never flourished it; but by God's providence it saved my life.</p>

            . I am assistant to a surgeon. I was called up, by the prosecutrix, about one o'clock. I examined her wounds - she had one on the back of her head, a very slight one, and a slight cut on each shoulder - the blow on one shoulder must have been done with the same stroke as that on the head. There was also a slight cut on her thumb; they appeared to be done by a sharp instrument - none of them were at all dangerous. I dressed them three or four times - they were perfectly healed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If you were not a surgeon you would not call them wounds - A. I should call them slight wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it more like striking at her; or flourishing about - A. I should think striking at her.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 21st of February, between half-past ten and eleven o'clock, my attention was drawn to the house, by hearing female voices calling murder, and watch, repeatedly. I got within the threshold of the street door, and saw the shadow of a man, with a cutlass in his hand. He shut the door in my face. The prosecutrix and the wife were then outside the door. The wife lifted up her arm, and shewed me where she was struck; Harding had a cut on her head, the blood was running down on her neck. I persuaded them to go to the watch-house. I heard no more of it. Marshall's wife knocked at the door. I heard a man's voice, saying,</p>
               <p>"If you don't go about your business, I'll blow your brains out." She seemed in a violent passion to get in, and said it was her house. I took both the women to the watch-house, and on the following day they got a warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I dare say they talked loudly - A. They had not much power to speak - they were too much confused. The wife knocked at the door, in a great passion, and said it was her house. I think she had had a drop - the prosecutrix appeared sober.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, stated that his wife had been in the habit of getting intoxicated for the last twenty years, pawning his property, running him in debt, and cohabiting with other men; in consequence of which, he was resolved to live no longer with her, and allowed her three shillings a week; but on the day in question, he met the prosecutrix and her, who abused him much in the street; and as he was going to bed, he was greasing his sword, to prevent its rusting, and, unfortunately having it in his hand, he went out with it, hearing them abuse him, and not intending to injure them, he said,</p>
               <p>"Go out of the house." The prosecutrix caught up the poker, and brandished it at him; he lifted up the sword to ward of the blows, and she might have received a cut, but not intentionally; for had he intended it, one blow must have been mortal.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my service for four years, and was by no means quarrelsome, but behaved well. Understand his wife has been very obnoxious to him. I saw the prosecutrix on the 23d; her wounds were very trifling. The prisoner has been an old soldier; and, if he had intended to give her a blow, he would have destroyed her instantly.</p>

            . They were married at St Ann's Church near Aldersgate,4 Years ago, come December next.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was you at the Wedding?</p>
               <p>Lake. I was asked to go, by her, and her Spouse Campbell .</p>
               <p>Couns. Who was the Clergyman that married them?</p>
               <p>Lake . I can't say who he was, but they were married according to the Ceremonies of the Church of England.</p>
               <p>Couns. There was another Ceremony to be performed after that: where did they go afterward?</p>
               <p>Lake. To their own Home: We went from the Church to the Tavern,- to the Mourning Bush; but the Dinner was provided at my own House, which was very near her's: We were Neighbours together. I live at the Butcher's Arms in Chick-Lane , and she and I had been Neighbours together,3 or 4 Years, or more.</p>
               <p>Couns. So they dined at your House in Chick-Lane?</p>
               <p>Lake. Yes; and they continued there all Day, and then they went to their own Home; or to her Aunt's.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did they live together afterwards?</p>
               <p>Lake. I know of their living together a Week, or thereabouts; but I know nothing of the Husband now, nor whether he is living.</p>
               <p>Couns. You say she lived with her Aunt.</p>
               <p>Lake. No; I said she lay at her own House, or at her Aunt's; she and her Aunt lived next Door to one another.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you know the Man she was married to?</p>
               <p>Lake. She was married to one Campbell , I never saw him till about a Fortnight before the Marriage .</p>
               <p>Couns. What Hand had you in the Marriage?</p>
               <p>Lake . No Hand ,- any farther than they asked me .</p>
               <p>Couns . What Business was he of?( Campbell )</p>
               <p>Lake. A Gentleman , I think; he appeared as such, and his Name was Campbell.</p>
               <p>Couns . How soon after the Marriage was he taken up?</p>
               <p>Lake . About a Fortnight after. I heard he was taken up for Felony, but I don't know where he was carried .</p>
               <p>Couns . Was it not reported that he was carried to Scotland ?</p>
               <p>Lake . Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Couns. What Age was she of, when she was married?</p>
               <p>Lake. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Couns . Was she registered in the Church?</p>
               <p>Lake . Yes; and you'll find the Register-Book in the Court.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did they afterwards live together?</p>
               <p>Lake. I cannot tell ; they moved out of the Place where they were, in about a Week's Time. but I do not know where they took a House afterwards. It was said, they went to live in Salisbury-Court , but I do not know it myself.</p>
               <p>Couns. When did you see him (Campbell) last?</p>
               <p>Lake. I saw him about three Years ago. I have not seen him since; nor do I know any thing of him, any more than you do.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live now?</p>
               <p>Lake. At the Butchers-Arms in Chick-Lane, where I did then.</p>
               <p>Couns. How came you acquainted with his Woman?</p>
               <p>Lake. Her Father and Mother and she, lived in the Neighbourhood (in Chick-Lane .) Her Father was a Shoemaker; but he and she were both dead before she was married.</p>

               <p>Mrs Crosier. Not to my Knowledge: but I can swear to her Face, because I took such a particular deal of Notice of her.</p>
               <p>Couns. How long ago was this?</p>
               <p>Mrs Crosier. I think it was in February was Twelvemonth.- I cannot tell how long ago it is, since the Lady was married: but it is very seldom that such agreeable Faces come to us, and that made me remark her Face.</p>
               <p>Couns. You have a great many Wedding, in a Day at your House, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Mrs Crosier. Yes, we have had many a Score, in a Year.</p>
               <p>Couns. And many a Hundred,-</p>
               <p>Mrs Crosier. Yes,- I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Couns. Have not you a Wedding a Day, all the Year through?</p>
               <p>Mrs Crosier. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Couns. I suppose she was not in the same Dress, when she was married at your House, that she is in now?</p>
               <p>Mrs Crosier. No; she was then in a green Gown, and her Head was not dressed as it is now. Indeed I am positive to her, and am certain she is the Lady, for I never remarked any Person more,- the Agreeableness of the Lady made me remark her, though to be sure we have many agreeable Persons married at our House.</p>

               <p>Couns. Can you swear it was the same Lady your Wife saw?</p>
               <p>Mr Crosier. I cannot say that. I knew Mr Woolfe before; and I know he was married to a Woman by that Name, the 17th of July was Twelvemonth. I can't be positive it was last July was Twelvemonth, or last July, but here is the Book; the Minister put it down.</p>
               <p>Couns. Whose Hand-writing was it?</p>
               <p>Mr Crosier.'Tis not my own,(The Count would not allow the Book to be read, it being a Fleet Register.) To the best of my Remembrance, it was about this time 2 Years.</p>
               <p>Couns. Why your wife said it was in February .</p>
               <p>Mr Crosier. She said, she believed it was in February.'Tis as it was set down in the Book , by the Man; and on my Oath, there has been no Alteration in the Book, I knew Mr Woolfe before; he came with a Lady, and was married to her, according to the Ceremonies of the Church of England. I saw him married; and Mr Woolfe asked me to give her away; I gave her away; and one Mr Dave married them .</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you ever see the Woman before?</p>
               <p>Mr Crosier. Not as I know of .</p>

               <p>Duck worth . I knew one Campbell ; he was a Widower, as far as I know .</p>
               <p>Couns. Is he living or dead?</p>
               <p>Duck worth. I can't tell . I have not seen him upwards of a Year . About a Year ago, I saw him in Fleet-street . I knew him, when he was married to this Gentlewoman. I was at the Marriage .</p>
               <p>Couns. The Gentleman that you say you saw married to that Gentlewoman , when did you see him last?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174007090024"></xptr>Duckworth . About a Twelvemonth ago, as nigh as I can guess; I was with him in Fleet-street; and drank 2 Pints of Beer with him there, at the Magpye and Horse-shoe.</p>
               <p>Couns. I think you lived in Wych-Street. What Time did you leave your House there?</p>
               <p>Duckworth Last Michaelmas . It was before that Time, I saw him, but I won't say how long.- It was about a Twelvemonth ago. I had known him about a fortnight before .</p>
               <p>Couns. Are not you a Relation to him?</p>
               <p>Duckworth . No; I am to the Gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did not you make up this worshipful Match?</p>
               <p>Duckworth. No. I did not, though I might be at the Marriage .</p>
               <p>Couns. Pray what was this Campbell?</p>
               <p>Duckworth. He was a Man: I don't know what he was.</p>
               <p>Couns. How old was she when she married him?</p>
               <p>Duckworth. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was she a Dozen or 13 Years old?</p>
               <p>Duckworth. You talk wide. She does not look like a Person of that Age - I know nothing of her Age. I married her Aunt, and was her next Neighbour: We both lived under one Roof.</p>
               <p>Couns. How long did Campbell live with her?</p>
               <p>Duckworth. About a Week, or 8 Days. What became of him afterwards I don't know.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did not he go to Scotland?</p>
               <p>Duckworth. I can't tell. They were parted, as she said; but I know not where he went. She would not live with him, the Reason I don't know.</p>
               <p>Couns. What Business was he?</p>
               <p>Duckworth. I don't know: He appear'd seemingly, a Gentleman. He was a Scotchman.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did not you hear he was sent into his own Country for a Misdemeanour?</p>
               <p>Duckworth. No, never in my Life. The last Time I saw him, was about Twelvemonth ago. I can't tell exactly the Day;- when I meet a Person upon the Road, I don't take particular Notice of the Time I meet him; nor did I take particular Notice of the Time I met Him. I am sure it was in the last Summer Season. I have not seen her, upwards of 2 Years, nor do I know any thing of her marrying Mr Woolfe .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was with him but 3 Days, and never saw him since. I heard he was dead. I heard he died in Scotland. He was taken from me, and I heard that he died there.</p>
               <p>Couns. to Mrs Crosier . Have you ever had any Discourse with the Lady, about this Marriage with Mr Woolfe?</p>
               <p>Mrs Crosier. No. I never had.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you know Mr Woolfe?</p>

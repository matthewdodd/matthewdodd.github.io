                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Horseferry<lb></lb>branch-road—I am in my 82nd year—I am a messenger in the employ of Ricketts, Smith and Co., coal merchants—they have places in the Horseferry-road, in Mile End and in the Commercial-road—on Wednesday evening, 21st December, about six o'clock I was carrying a leather-bag containing 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I left Mile End about ten minutes to six to bring the money to the Commercial-road—a lad named Stevens went with me and saw me safe as far as the corner of the Horse<lb></lb>ferrry-banch-road—I walked as straight as I could come from Mile End to that place—it is about a mile and a quarter I should think—I was in the habit of taking money every evening—I have been accustomed to go the same route at times for the last three or four years—when I got about thirty yards from the Horseferry-road, within twenty yards of the counting-house, I heard some persons behind me—they put something wet over my face, pulled me back, threw me down and then kicked me—the bag was torn from me—I had got my umbrella through the handle of it—they tore that away when I was on the ground, and I saw one of them run across the Commer<lb></lb>cial-road with it—I called, 'Murder!' and "Stop thief!' and followed him as close as I could—when I got within a few yards of him, he got in amongst a mob of people who were singing—just before he got on to the kerb I was within ten yards of him—the string of the bag hung at his leg and I caught his side face, and I believe it to be the prisoner Coster—I am quite certain of it—I had known him before—he has worked for the firm as coal-porter—I have no doubt at all about his being the man—I saw the girl Smith standing amongst the people and 1 asked her which way the man went with the leather-bag—she said, "That way"—pointing in the contrary way to which the man ran—I do not recognise either of the other prisoners—there</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 105). I took Hurley about half-past 7 on the morning of 13th February—I said, "Bill, I want you for being concerned with Coster and the two girls in robbing a man in the Horseferry-road"—I also said, "Mind what you say, as it will be given in evidence against you"—he said, "Well, I was there, but so help me God I had nothing to do with it, and I don't believe the other man had"—the other prisoners had been committed at that time—I had been looking for Hurley previously—I commenced a day or two after the robbery in consequence of information—I had not been to his house—I did not know where he lived—I had been to other places where I thought I should find him, and was not able to do so till 15th February.</p>

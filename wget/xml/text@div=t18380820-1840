                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in the parish of Isleworth. On the 11th of July I was at Zion House, the Duke of Northumberland's—there was a fete there—the company commenced arriving between three and four o'clock-about seven o'clock in the afternoon I was in tbeentrance hall the public were not allowed to come there-lam house-carpenter—I saw the prisoner in tbeentrance hall, also my wife and mother-in-law-no one else—I observed this shawl in the prisoner's parasol, but so much secreted that I could scarcely see one corner of it—her parasol was closely shot up, and close under the arm—I said I would call the police—she begged of me not to call the police, and seemed very much irritated indeed—I called the police in, and she readily gave me the shawl out of the parasol, and started across the hall towards the vestibule door, she ran up five or six steps, crossed</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I was at this fete-about seven or eight o'clock in the evening I saw Mrs. Hay pick up the shawl—it was at tbeentrance hall, between the door and the vestibule steps—the steps are in tbeentrance hall, and led up into the vestibule—I saw her place it in her parasol in a very hurried manner, and then go towards the hall door, to go out—she was in the act of going out—my husband was at tbeentrance hall door—he turned round to come back to me, and she said, "Can I go out this way, Sir?"—he said, "I dare say you can, Ma'am"—I told him the woman had got a shawl in her parasol.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable A</hi> 85.) I was sent for. I saw Mr. Evans with this shawl in his hand—I saw the prisoner running away, and be said, "Take that woman in charge, she has stolen the shawl"—I ran after her across the vestibule, and down a flight of stairs—I asked what she was running away for—she said "I meant to give it to some policeman"—I said there was no policeman in the hall—she said, "I should give it to some servant."</p>

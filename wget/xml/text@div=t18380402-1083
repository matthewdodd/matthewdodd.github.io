                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Robert Davis Rea, wholesale cheesemonger, in Upper Thames-street. On the 10th of March the prisoner came to our shop, and inquired if we had any fine butter—I said we had—he said Mr. Swainson had sent him down for a cask, as he had not a pound of that description to go on with—I showed him some, which be did not approve of—I showed him some more, and he said that would do—it weighed from 50<hi rend="italic">lb</hi>. to 60 lb., and I think it came to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—before he took it away I required him to sign his name to a receipt for it—this is it—he signed "C. Dix" in my presence—he said Mr. Swainson was very ill with the headach, that he was subject to it, and unfortunately it occurred almost every Saturday—that was his day, and he was in his employment every Saturday regularly, and in consequence of his having a headach, he was obliged to have a person of the name of Temple in the shop, to assist him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Swainson.

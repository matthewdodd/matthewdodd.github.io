            . I have known the prisoner some time; on Sunday, the 25th of August, she came and asked me to take care of some money for her till her husband came out of prison - I did not know till then that her husband was in prison, but as she was rather tipsy, I consented to take the money; she gave me 3l. 10s. all in silver, in crowns, half-crowns, and shillings, in a purse of the same sort as this, and I believe it was this purse - she came again in a quarter of an hour, brought two more half-crowns, and told me to put them with the rest, which made 3l. 15s.; the next morning she came and asked for some money - I gave her 15s. of it, and she wished me to keep the remainder till Tuesday night; I locked it up again, but she came again at five o'clock the same day and wanted 5s. more - I then gave her the purse and all that was in it.</p>

             (police-constable E 54). I heard of the robbery, and went to the prosecutor's house - the prisoner saw me and went in at the side-door; the prosecutor gave her in charge, and I took her to the station-house - she was searched, but nothing found on her but some duplicates; this bundle of new clothes were in her possession when I took her - I went back to the prosecutor's, and found this purse on the tiles of a little house in the yard, under the window of the prisoner's lodging - I asked the prisoner about the money; she denied having had it, and either she or her mother said that money could not be sworn to.</p>

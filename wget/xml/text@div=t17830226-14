               <p>Court. Had they any weapons? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Court. Never saw him before, I have a more perfect knowledge of him than the other, by taking a chew of tobacco out of his box.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it moonlight? - No, it was a starlight evening.</p>
               <p>Court. How long after was it that you saw the prisoner again? - On the Wednesday week following.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you see him? - At the George after he was taken, he was taken up by the patrol on suspicion; about half an hour after seven, I saw him that night.</p>
               <p>How did you happen to see him? - The patrol came after me, and I went to see him.</p>
               <p>Court. Then they shewed you this man? There was this man and two others.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them then? - Yes, I knew this man, I told him he was the man that stopped me, he said I was mistaken in the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you have known him if you had seen him any where else, or did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260034"></xptr> you only think it was him, because he was taken up on suspicion by the patrol? - If I had seen him amongst an hundred men I should have known him.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you see a person by starlight, at eight in the evening, on the 28th of January, so as to know him again? - Yes, because I had my eye on him during the time I was taking the chew of tobacco, I had a full view of his face all the time he was with me.</p>
               <p>Did you know the other two men? - I was almost as positive to the other men, as I am to him, one was behind the hedge.</p>
               <p>And are you as positive to the man that was behind the hedge? - Yes; by his dress, by his red jacket.</p>
               <p>Could you undertake to know the man that was behind the hedge? - I will not swear to either of the other, but I think I should know him.</p>

               <p>Can you under the circumstances, under which you saw him, and by that light undertake to swear that this is one of the men that robbed you? - Yes, my Lord, that is the man that stopped me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether he gave information of the robbery, or a discription of the man? I did not.</p>
               <p>How came the patrol to come to you? They heard of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were there any lamps on that part of the road? - No.</p>

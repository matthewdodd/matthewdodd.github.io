               <p>May the prisoner came between nine and ten o'clock in the evening for a halt-quartern stale loaf, and gave me a shilling—I gave him change, and put the shilling in the till; there was no other there—I took it out directly after he was gone, and tried it with my teeth—I marked it and put it in a little tin box by itself at the back of the till—on 1st June the prisoner came again for a half-quartern stale loaf—I recognised him directly—I gave him the loaf, and he pulled three or four shillings out of his pocket—he gave me one shil<lb></lb>ling and a farthing—he said, "Here is a farthing"—I tried the shilling with a file, and said it was bad—he said it was not—I said, "It is, and this is not the first time you have been here"—he left his shilling and ran off, and I ran after him—he ran against a woman and dropped the loaf—he escaped—I put that shilling in the tin box with the other, and gave them both to Church, the officer, the same day—Church brought the prisoner to my house, and he called me on one side and muttered something, I believe it was to forgive him, but I did not hear distinctly what be said.</p>

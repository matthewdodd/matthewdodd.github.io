               <p>Q. When did you go to work with him?</p>
               <p>Peak. About six weeks ago I believe; the first house we worked at was in New Court; that was Cooper's house; we were to have twenty seven shillings a week and our board.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Patten and Rogers to have?</p>
               <p>Peak. The same. We used to cut them out and press them with a great press; we used to buy the copper and so finish them: we bought the copper on Snow-hill, in large sheets, about three-quarters of a yard long, and about the thickness of a common counterfeit halfpenny, and about fourteen or fifteen inches wide. We cut them out, scowered, pressed, stamped, and finished them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who used to cut them out?</p>
               <p>Peak. Rogers mostly; Cooper used to lay them in the press.</p>
               <p>Q. Who struck the dye?</p>
               <p>Peak. Cooper used to make his own dyes himself. I have stood by him an hour at a time while he has made them; he had but one pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180032"></xptr> made at first, whether he made any more after that I cannot say. Patten and I were at the fly.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house were these implements kept?</p>
               <p>Peak. In the cellar; we used to work at the heavy work.</p>

            . I went to New-court, St. John's-street, on the Saturday, I believe the 30th of last month; I am not certain to the day; a woman who calls herself Cooper let me in; I saw her and a little boy about ten years of age; I saw neither of the prisoners there at that time. I found in the house these four pieces of copper in a corner cupboard in the parlour; I found nothing else. Mr. Clark and Mr. Phillips went with me; they made a further search both up stairs and below; Cooper came in about three quarters of an hour after we had been in the house; we secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other prisoners come in?</p>
               <p>Heley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing?</p>
               <p>Heley. He was confused at being charged with that crime; he did not say any thing. We left the press and things standing as they were and locked up the house. On the Monday following I went again and took down the press, and in the bottom of the press I found thirteen halfpence; at the cutting out press I found these three blanks.</p>

            . I was employed in making this search on Saturday the 30th of April. The witness (Peak) was sent from Coventry with an information made before a magistrate there; in consequence of that we went to the house of Mr. Cooper; when I knocked at the door his wife opened it; she was a little troublesome; I took her to New Prison; we waited till the husband came home; he was taken into custody, and in the cellar I found a large press to coin, and a cutting out press, both of them fixed.</p>
               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>Clark. Halfpence I believe, by what I found, the reverse of the dye of a halfpenny, fixed in the press; the other stood on the window, and the halfpence found in the house appear to have been struck from this dye; there is a crack upon the head side, which is upon the counterfeit halfpence. Upon the stairs I found some copper (produces several slips of copper); here is some cessil of the same sort. I found this dye fixed in some cement; here are the impressions struck; these halfpence do not correspond with the dye; they were stamped before the dye was cracked.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they counterfeit halfpence?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes; the blanks are smaller than the halfpenny, because the stamping of the impression of course spreads it something.</p>
               <p>Cooper's Defence.</p>
               <p>As this evidence is so strong against me, I leave myself entirely to the mercy of the Court; I have a large family. I beg for a merciful sentence.</p>
               <p>Rogers's Defence.</p>
               <p>This Peak and I were in partnership in the buckle business; he said he had worked at the cock-making business; I did not know what he was gone to; he left the business to me; I was to have one third of the profit of the buckle business; he used to come now and then to see how the business went on; there is a person in court worked with me till the 23d of April; his name is Woodhouse. I never worked for Cooper in my life, except I worked with him at one Bailey's a good many years ago; this Peak took an opportunity on the 21st of April, when I was gone to my breakfast; I live at the Wheatsheaf, in Oxford-road; he came to my shop; he knew where the key was; he took the key, and locked up my door; I went to his lodgings; I saw the woman he kept; she said he had turned me out of the shop; he said no work should be done because I owed him some money. I gave myself no great concern to look after him for fear of being arrested; the next news I heard was, that he had sold the tools. From thence I went to live at Islington, at the Boot; the Sunday following they came and took me out of the room, searched my pockets, and my wife's, and the drawers; they could not find any thing; they took me with them, but this evidence's sister used to come to me to the shop, to persuade him not to keep company with this woman he lived with; I endeavoured to persuade him off but could not.</p>
               <p>Patten's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of the fact; I know nothing at all of Peak; I had about six or seven weeks acquaintance with him, doing buckles for Peak and Rogers. The house I live in is in White-cross-street, where I was taken from.</p>

            . I saw Rogers the 21st of last month; he complained he could not get in to work, at his apartments in St. Ann's-court, Soho; I have been in his company several times before; I have seen him at his daily labour; I have been at his shop several times; I always saw him; I know no further but that he is an honest man; I have seen him daily several days; I have breakfasted, dined, and supped, and kept company with him till nine, ten, or eleven o'clock at night; I never saw him out of his business.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to be with him all day long?</p>
               <p>Cogens. From eight in the morning till ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you work with him?</p>
               <p>Cogens. No. I was troubled with the stone; he advised me to go to Dr. Chadwick. I have been out of employment a vast long time, and have had nothing to do. I stood in the shop and saw them at their plate-buckle-making: I was obliged to stay till between twelve and one before I could see Dr. Chadwick. They had beer at different times: I was out of employment and not capable of carrying on the peruke-making business: I served my time in the Temple.</p>

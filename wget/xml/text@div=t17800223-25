               <p>I am a constable of St. Paul's, Covent-Garden. The prosecutor sent for me and informed me he had been robbed; and suspected the prisoner. I went up stairs into her apartment, and found a window-curtain between the bed and the sacking.</p>
               <p>Was her master present when you found it? - Yes. I found three chair covers in Mrs. Harvey's lodging.</p>
               <p>Harvey. I had the chair covers from the prisoner to pawn, but had not pawned them.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. You was present when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230045"></xptr>Halliburton found the window curtain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What room was it in? - The prisoner's room; it belonged to the opposite room.</p>
               <p>Was it up? - No; lying in the room.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My master promised to pardon me if I restored the things, upon my word, and not to prosecute me.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Was it the confession the prisoner made that led you to the discovery of the things pawned with Whitlock, and the things you found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you found any of the things before the promise? - Not any.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of the things but in consequence of that promise? - No; except the curtain.</p>
               <p>Did you make the promise before you sent for the constable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you where the curtain was? - She lifted up the bed to show us where the curtain was, but said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Do you think it is likely that the curtain would have been found if she had not so done? - No.</p>

               <p>I am under butler to the Speaker, this window was fastened the night before it was broke open, with two cross iron bars, a piece of the window shutter was taken off, and set up an end against the wall in the garden; the bars were unhooked, and the window curtain down.</p>
               <p>In what state was the room? - Dirty with people having been in, nothing was taken out of that room, but out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>- MANN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the Speaker's train bearer, one of the footmen came to my house on Saturday morning about seven, and desired I would come immediately to the Speaker's; accordingly I went to the library, there the Speaker was; I saw the bars broke open, and in a very different state to what it was in the evening, when I went away, and his clothes thrown about, some taken away, and some remaining; I put the gold gown the day before into the box, the bag was thrown down at the bottom of the stairs, and the gown taken out; I found the Speaker had lost several articles, a brown coat and waistcoat, a scarlet waistcoat, velvet breeches, black silk breeches, six pair of silk stockings, a servant's great coat, and two hats, the property of the Speaker; and a great coat, and a shirt that belonged to one of the servants; I went to a public house at Lambeth, on Monday about one, and there I found the things, I found a brown coat and waistcoat, a pair of velvet breeches, black silk stocking breeches, a pair of doc skin breeches, and three shirts, all the Speaker's; a livery hat, six pair of stockings, two hats, a servant's great coat, a scarlet waistcoat, all together in one bag; the Speaker's gown was never found; I then went to Sir Sampson Wright's, and from Sir Sampson's I went to the prisoner's house, on Monday after church, which was the 31st of January; the 30th of January<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230076"></xptr> was kept; we searched the prisoner's house and found nothing but a pair of boots which they brought away with them.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation on these boots? - Those boots were taken to the Speaker's house, I saw them, and I saw they tallied exactly with the marks in the Speaker's garden, I further observed to the Speaker, that I thought that one of the persons that broke in, had nails in his shoes, I compared the foot with the boots, and they exactly tallied; I compared the pegs on the right foot.</p>
               <p>(A piece of the heel piece being off, the pegs stood up, handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Had you observed before you saw the boots, which foot it was that had these marks, whether the right or the left? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Had you observed before what number of holes were made by the pegs? - No, but afterwards, when I had the boot, I saw the boot put upon the ground, and it exactly tallied.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation on the boot being compared with them? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. You have seen something, that looked like the impression of nails? - The boot appeared as if the person that wore them, had trod a good deal in mud.</p>
               <p>Whether it was town or country mud, you do not swear, I am sure? - No.</p>
               <p>What weather was it Saturday, Sunday, and Monday? - Very dirty weather, the Sunday and Monday was very dirty.</p>
               <p>You did not cover the impression after you first observed it? - No.</p>
               <p>The appearance to you, was like that of a man with nails regularly put into his shoes? - Not very regular, but I did not count them.</p>
               <p>- HAMMOND sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a public house at Lambeth, it is I suppose about two hundred yards from my door to that Gentleman's house, he has lived there about six months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where were these things found? - Down in an old cellar, which my landlord keeps for the use of buildings.</p>
               <p>How near is that cellar to the prisoner's house? - I suppose it is about twenty yards, not further.</p>
               <p>When did you find these things? - Last Sunday was three weeks, I was repairing my tap room, and I asked my landlord to let me have a little lime and hair: he told me the door was nailed up, and I might force it open, and the next day me and one Nicholls went to the cellar, and Nicholls saw a great coat, then I saw two hats, then we proceeded to the dark corner, and I kicked my foot against something, I thought it had been a man; these were the same things Mr. Mann had from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Whose cellar is this? - It belongs to Mr.

               <p>I went into the cellar, and I measured the pair of boots which were found in the prisoner's house, that were in my possession, there is a window, and there is a hill of dirt, and three steps made in the dirt, not stone steps.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is the window of the cellar from the prisoner's house? - As far as from me to your Lordship, not a great way, there is some paling that parts it from his house, and there is a little bit of a wicket-gate, that comes out of his house.</p>
               <p>Did the other man make any observation? - No, he was only with me, and one of the Justices was with me.</p>

               <p>I belong to Bow-street, I found this boot in the prisoner's closet in his lodgings, there was nothing found belonging to the Speaker, I know nothing of the foot-steps in the cellar; when I came to the Speaker's, Mr. Mann and I went into the Speaker's garden, and we measured in particular this boot, and all the way on the water-side in regular steps; this boot fitted exactly, and all the way the peg marks; the marks were not so regular as that, but there were visible holes; all on the right hand side, the side next the wall, I took notice of it, because Mr. Man said, the person had nails in their shoes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the holes were in the earth before the boot was put on the earth? - Yes, there were some places that appeared three, and some four; there were marks upon them all.</p>

               <p>Did it tally in length and breadth? - Yes, as nigh as any thing could do in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is to say, that in all the impressions there were marks of something: be so good to look at these pegs, and tell me upon your oath, whether you think that boot has been worn since the heel tap as it is called came off? - I do not know whether it has or no.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The pegs appear to be perfectly fresh; with permission of the Court, I will take off the heel of this other boot.</p>

               <p>Had any been lighted? - No, Sir, there was a whole candle dropped in the garden, that had not been lighted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager and traveller to the firm of Schewppe and Co., in Berners-street—the proprietors are John Kemp Welch and William Egan—I live in Grafton-street East. At twenty minutes past eight o'clock on Friday night, the 2nd of July, I was returning home—I met Tibb with a hamper of bottles on his head—he and Dimmock</p>

               <p>were both in the service—they were chiefly employed in stamping the labels and putting them on—I said to Tibb, "Where are you going?" he said he lived about there—I said, "What have you got?"—he said he did not know—I said, "Don't you know where you are going to?"—he said "Not exactly"—I said, "Who gave you this?"—he said some words, and then said a man in Francis-street gave it him—I said, "Don't you know what you have got?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Let me see"—I took the hamper down, and desired him to open it—he did so—I saw they were bottles—my suspicions were excited—I again asked him where he was going to—he said, "To 34, Grafton-street"—I doubted it, and said I would go with him—he began to cry, and said, "No, it is not so, if you won't hurt me, I will tell you all about it"—I did not make him any reply—he said the truth was, Dimmock had given them to him, and told him to make what be could of them, and he again said if I would let him go or promise not to hurt him, he would tell me all about it—I said I could make no promise, his master must know about it—he then again said Dimmock gave them to him from the warehouse—he said Dimmock let him into the warehouse, and had given him the bottles, and he was to make what he could of them—in consequence of that I sent my servant for a po<lb></lb>liceman.</p>

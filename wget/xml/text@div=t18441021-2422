                  </hi>. I am a brass-finisher, and live in Wilsted-street, So<lb></lb>mers-town, I am married. About seven months after my marriage the prisoner came to my place, and asked me, as a friend, if I would allow him to do a job of work there—I believe he had to fit up a shop for a man in Exmouth-street, and he wanted to prepare the work in my place—I had known him about seven months—he came, and remained some time there—my wife afterwards left me—I</p>

               <p>observed nothing particular between her and the prisoner before she left me—I had had a man named Parker in my employ a short time before—he wished me to give him a character, but I refused, as he left me in a very un<lb></lb>manly sort of manner—on the 24th of Sept. a person named Helus called on me, to ask where Parker was, and in consequence of a message he brought I went to Parker's house, in Rawstorne-street, St. John-street, to tell him of a situation, understanding he was out of one—Moore went with me—as I was going up the staircase of Parker's house, I heard the prisoner's voice—I did not expect to find him there—the voice seemed to proceed from Parker's room—I walked up stairs very slowly, looked over the window, and there I saw the prisoner and my wife together, near the door, in the first floor room, as if going out together—she had her bonnet on and he his hat—I immediately came down stairs again, and said something to Moore—I was determined to watch them, and did watch them upwards of two hours—I went up Parker's staircase during that time, and saw them there still—the last time I went up, they ap<lb></lb>peared to be making a move, and in coming down again I stumbled and made a noise—Parker opened the door, and saw me—he came out, and walked up and down the street several times, but he could not see us, as we concealed our<lb></lb>selves in a doorway—he went in, and then two females came out, and walked up and down for ten minutes—then they went in—and soon after I saw the prisoner come out of Parker's house, and stand at the street-door—I said, "Here he is," and he ran away, with his hands in his pocket—I ran after him, caught him by the collar, and said, "You vagabond, you have been with my wife"—he drew a burnisher out of his pocket, and said, "O Lord!" and made an attitude, as if he was going to run it through my body—I struck him—he made several attempts to run it through my body—I warded it off as well as I could, but he stabbed me in the hind part of the thigh—it was a wound an inch deep—we both called "Police"—the policeman came up—I gave the prisoner in charge, and he gave me in charge—the policeman, seeing the prisoner bleeding from the nose and mouth, took his charge in preference to mine, as I did not appear to be hurt, and I was taken in charge—I had struck the prisoner, on seeing him draw the burnisher out of his pocket, with intent to stab me—I took hold of him first, and then struck him with my fist, and he fought with me with the burnisher and his fists too—I parried it off, and then he put his hand behind me, and stabbed me in the thigh—I believe he knew I was there, for Parker and the women came out to watch whether I was gone—this is the burnisher—it is an in<lb></lb>strument strument used in our business—the prisoner has burnishing to do occa<lb></lb>sionally in his business.</p>

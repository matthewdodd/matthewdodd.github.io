On the 8th of June, I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130038"></xptr>occasion to go to the stable yard to get some straw, to pack up some goods for a friend at the West Indies; on coming into my house I saw the prisoner in the parlour standing by the side of a small dresser, where we put things in; I asked him what he wanted, or if he had any business there; I could get no answer from him; he passed me and went out into the street, I followed him; in about five yards from my house I took him by the coat; I perceived a table cloth between his coat and waistcoat, I perceived mine and my wife's name upon it; I took him into my house; when he came in he begged my pardon, and said it was distress that had occasioned him to take it; I asked him what he was, and his name; he would not tell me; I asked him to have the goodness to turn out his pockets; he did; there was a pocket handkerchief, a pair of gloves, half a horse shoe, and a small note; I looked at the note, the directions were torn off; he snatched the note out of my hand, he said he would be d - d if I should expose his note, or any man else; he threw the note into the fire and burnt it; he told me he had not a sixpenny piece; when the officer searched him, he found eleven shillings upon him.</p>

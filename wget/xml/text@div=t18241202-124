            . The prisoner gave me this letter on the 6th of November, to take to No. 27, King-street, Cheapside. I asked him what his name was, and where he lived: he said that was of no consequence, he would meet me at my house. I had seen him once before, when I was in service. I delivered the letter to Mr. Grey, who delivered me the goods; the officer was sent for, and Mr. Grey came to my house; the prisoner was not there, but he came in about an hour: the officer and Mr. Gray were then gone. I told him to wait, and sent my wife for a constable: he could not be found, but the prisoner went with me and another man to Mr. Pritchard's, where he was given in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Having been in a respectable way of business, but reduced to work as a porter, I was employed by a person to go into the City, and deliver this note, and he back by eleven o'clock. I did not like to take the note, as the people knew me; but of any knowledge of its being a false order I am innocent. In the interval I had a job to go to the George and Blue Boar, which was the reason I did not get there sooner: when I heard that they wanted me, I went there readily; the person told me he lived with Mr. Lewis, in Oxford-street, but he had to go to Somers-town.</p>

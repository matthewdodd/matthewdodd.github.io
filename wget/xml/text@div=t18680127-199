                  </hi>. I am an insurance broker and under<lb></lb>writer, in partnership with Mr. Dixey-the firm is Morice and Dixey-the prisoner has been in our service about seven years, up to September last—he was chief counting-house clerk and book-keeper, and had a salary of 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—we placed full confidence in him up to the time of his discharge-the clerk who was first at the office would open the letters from our customers-this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the banker's cash-book; it was the prisoner's duty when I was out of town to enter in it all money received, but I keep it when I am in town—I was out of town in August, 1866-this promissory note for 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is indorsed by my firm-this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is written by the prisoner, and addressed " P.

Messrs.

A. Van Es and Co., Alliance Bank, 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," is in the prisoner's writing—it was his duty to pay in this promissory note to our account at the Union Bank of London, with other money received on that day—he had no authority to take that note to be cashed over the counter, either to cash it himself or to get it cashed—it should have been paid in to my credit for the Union Bank to collect-this entry, "Insurance Ledger, Captain Welch, 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>," is in the prisoner's writing-Captain Welch remitted that sum in notes, in a</p>

               <p>letter from Newcastle-whoever opened the letter would hand it to the prisoner, with the contents, and he would enter it in the cash-book-the addition of that day, including the 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Captain Welch, and the 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. draft on the Alliance Bank, makes 834<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was the prisoner's duty to pay that sum into the bank, and before doing so he ought to make out a slip to hand to the bankers, containing the particulars, the same entries as are in this book-this credit slip (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the prisoner's writing-the total is 834<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I found no entry of the 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—it corresponds in everything except those two items—here is an entry of "Cheque 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."-this entry in the cash-book, "6th September, 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," is in the prisoner's writing; he ought to have paid that into the bank-this slip of 6th September is in the prisoner's writing; it ought to correspond with the entry in the cash-book-these items added together make 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-the slip contains cheque 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., cheque 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and notes 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but there is a deduction of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the slip says "Out," reducing it to 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated December 31st, 1866, for 218<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to J. and E. Vanner and Co., is drawn by my firm on the Union Bank; it is in the prisoner's writing, and signed by Mr. Dixey—we received money for Messrs Vanner and Co., and paid them once a month-this sum was owing to them at that date, and it was the prisoner's duty to pay that cheque to them—he had no right whatever to cash it at our banker's, or cause it to be cashed—it was his duty to cross it, but it is not crossed-in August, 1866, I said to the prisoner that the books were very much behind, and in such a confused state that I had been talking the matter over with my partner, and we were talking of employing an accountant to look thoroughly into them—he afterwards came into my private room, and said that he had been talking the matter over with another clerk, and thought it was an unnecessary expense to employ an accountant, and if I would give him time he would be there late, and another early, and would soon, get the books all square—I said that it was useless, we bad quite made up our minds to employ an ac<lb></lb>countant to look into matters, and he had better go on regularly with his own work, and the lee way would be gone into by the accountant—we dismissed the prisoner in August, or early in September, 1867, I have not got the exact date, and a day or two afterwards I obtained his address, Marion Villas, Dalston, and addressed a letter to him, which I gave to the junior clerk, Mr. Glynde, to stamp and post—it is his duty to enter the letters in a book and account for the postage.</p>

               <p>then with the police; and on the Monday following the day the letter was written I went with an officer to Marion Villa, Dalston, No. 6, I believe, to find the prisoner—I was able to find the house to which I addressed the letter, but could not find the prisoner there-the letter has not come back—I went more than once, and on 11th September I obtained a warrant for his apprehension—we had bills printed and circulated at the police stations offering a reward—I next saw the prisoner at the Mansion House four or five weeks ago.</p>

H. Porter in the ledger, he would sometimes ask us to exchange a cheque for him, which we did-his salary when he first came was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether it was 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was the salary he asked for, and he got it-there were no arrears when Mr. Dixey kept the underwriting account, he is here—an underwriting account ought be kept right, and if it is wrong we check it and put it right-there are trifling errors sometimes in the accounts ren<lb></lb>dered to us, and we put it right—in the panic of 1866 we gave directions to the prisoner to get rid of all cheques as soon as possible, and not to trust any one more than was necessary-the 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was somebody else's promissory note remitted to us by Van Es—we received no portion of that on that day—I can say that the proceeds of that promissory note were not paid in to our account at the bank, but I do not know about any portion of it, as he mystified the accounts—I know that a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note received for this very bill by the Alliance Bank, was paid into our bank-there would not be a hurry to make up the account to 31st August—I must have been absent that day-when I was absent the prisoner had to dis<lb></lb>charge part of my duties as well as his own.</p>

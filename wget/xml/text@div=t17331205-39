Deliver your Rings then, says he. I told him I had no Rings neither. Why then give me your Watch, says he; I toggled at that. Be quick, says he, or you are a dead Man. I gave it him; they bid me good Night, and rode off. It was so dark that I could not see their Faces so plain as to know them again, so that I cannot swear to the Prisoner. I since found my Watch (but without the Seal) at Mr. Knot's a Pawn-broker in New-street.</p>

            . I was just come out of Place, and wanting a Lodging I was recommended to Kit Henley's, at the Ship in Peter-street, in St. James's. The Prisoner and Will. Ryland us'd to lye in the Stable, and ride out between eight and nine at Night, and come in again about one in the Morning. On Thursday Morning they took the Blanket off my Bed; I got up to see what they did with it; I saw the Prisoner there with his Hat ty'd under his Chin; their Horses sweated, and Kit Henley tore the Blanket in two, and laid one Piece on each Horse. They came in to drink, and Henley told them he wanted Money to pay his Landlord; the Prisoner said he had no Money, but he had Money's worth, and gave him something, but I did not see what it was. The Landlord went out in the Morning and came in again, and brought them some Money, and they paid him 24 s. and I gave an Account of this before Justice Lambert.</p>

             ( Davis's ) Information, I went to Henley's, and seiz'd him, and Ryland, and the Prisoner, but Ryland made his Escape. I ask'd Henley where the Mare was, that was there about half an Hour ago? He said, he did not know, for a Gentleman had taken her out. Henley was sent to Bridewell, and the Prisoner to the Gatehouse. I advised the Prisoner to discover what he knew, for I told him, if he would not, Henley would. He refus'd for a pretty while, but at last confess'd he had robb'd a Gentleman on a Hackney Coach-box, going to Kensington, of a Watch, and about half a Crown in Money. I found out the Coachman, by enquiring what Coach had been robb'd, and he told me Mr. Lee was his Fare: I went to Mr. Lee, and he describ'd the Watch to me, and particularly, that in the inside Case, there was the Picture of a Friar killing a Nun.</p>

            . I am Ryland's Sister, by Marriage, and Ryland's Wife is the Prisoner's Sister. On the 22d of November, the Prisoner was ill of an Ague and Fever, at my Mother's House, which is hard by the Ship. He had it three Weeks before he came there, and lay there constantly except one Night.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it was the 22d of November?</p>
               <p>Tomson. It was Yesterday (Thursday) was a Fortnight. I came home, and saw him a-Bed between one and two in the Afternoon, and he was violent bad indeed, and he got up between two and three, and between three and four he went out with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Tho' he was so violent bad?</p>
               <p>Tomson. Yes; we went to Apothecaries-Hall, to get a Medicine Mr. Henley had given me a Receipt of. They would not sell so small a Quantity there, but directed me to a Chimist's in the Hay-Market, and the Prisoner was so bad then, that he could not go back for he said, his Ague was very strong upon him. So we took a Boat and went to Mr. Godfrey the Chimist's, and in the Way home, we met Ryland. Ryland did not go with us then, but came some time after. The Prisoner's Wife had got some Water-gruel, and Turnips, and Sage-tea ready. Ryland Supp'd with us, and stay'd all Night, for he had had some words with his Wife, and would have kill'd her, but I got between, and parted them, and so he swore he would not go home with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You saw me find the Watch.</p>
               <p>Tomson. Next Morning, being Friday, he lay a-Bed 'till nine a Clock, and about ten he got up, and went with me to Tottenham-Court about some Business.</p>
               <p>Court. What Business?</p>
               <p>Tomson. To take the Air.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you call that Business ?</p>
               <p>Tomson. Besides I went to see an Acquaintance.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050022"></xptr> And going over the Field, just by the Windmill, he stoop'd, and pick'd up something.</p>
               <p>Court. And what was it?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I don't know, for I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Court. But did not he tell you?</p>
               <p>Tomson. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Nor you ask him?</p>
               <p>Tomson. No; he said nothing to me, nor I to him.</p>
               <p>Court. That was strange indeed!</p>
               <p>Tomson. But he was taken up on the Sunday following, and he told me on the Monday, that what he found in the Field, when I was with him, was the Watch that Mr. Henly was in Trouble about.</p>

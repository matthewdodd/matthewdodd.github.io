                  </hi> I am a grocer, in Oxford-street—the prisoner was in my service for nine months—she was discharged on Saturday, the 11th of Sept.—when she went away she left her box—I missed a key, seal, and ring, veil, also another veil, and some jewellery—I examined her box and bundle—they were not locked—she was not present—Mrs. Mardlin, who had for<lb></lb>merly lived with me, came and said she has been where the girl was lodging, and had found a quantity of silk—we examined her box together—we did not sent for a policeman—we found some ribbon—I afterwards met the pri<lb></lb>soner in the North-road—she gave me a bundle of ribbons, a veil of my wife's, and a variety of odd thing, and said it was all she had of mine.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 63, South Molton-street. About a month before I was before the Magistrate, I was lodging at Mr. Davies's—the pri<lb></lb>soner was a servant there—I missed some black silk—after the prisoner left I went after her to her lodgings, at 10, George-street, and told her I was very sorry, but I had lost a great many things out my box—she at first said she had not taken anything, she was sorry I has lost them—she afterwards gave me up the silk and veil—I said I must go to Mr. Davies, and ask him to let me look at her box—she let me go afterwards, saying they were in her box—I found these articles, and several other (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were worth be<lb></lb>tween 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and are my property, what she delivered up to me, and what were in her box.</p>

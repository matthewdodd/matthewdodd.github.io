I did not know the prisoners before the 26th of March, when I lost my property; they came to my house between ten and eleven; I shewed them into a little parlour; they had a pot of beer; I asked them up stairs, wanting the room; there they had six-pennyworth of gin and water, and three or four Welch rabbits; at twelve o'clock I wanted to shut up my house, and desired them to go. On the Monday following, a person came and asked me if I had lost something? I said I would go up stairs and look; I saw the box in the dining-room was wrenched open; it is a Shakesperian society; and I found several of the medals were gone, and a picture: I was informed it was at Bow-street; the picture was my property: I went to Bow-street with Morant, and saw these things; they are here; I saw the medals on the Wednesday before; I do not recollect when I saw the picture: I will not swear to the prisoner.</p>

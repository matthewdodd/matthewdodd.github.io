                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live at Kennington. On 21st Aug. I saw the prisoner at Mr. Nesbitt's, and after I got home he Came to me, and said, "I have just come from Mr. Nesbitt's; I might as well have walked over with you; I want an electrifying machine, and some other things, for a friend at the Cape of Good Hope, and Mr. Nesbitt sent me to you"—I sold him an electrical galvanic coil machine, for five guineas, and this electrifying machine—they were ordered to be put up, and sent on the Wednesday, as they were wanted for shipment on the Thursday—he said he thought his friend knew as little as he himself did of what the things were—he directed me to pack them, so that they would go without damage—he said, "If you send them on Wednesday, before twelve o'clock, I shall be at home, and will send back the money"—I was to send a receipt, and he engaged to send back the money—I sent Butt on the Wednesday, and told him to bring back either the goods or the money, and not to deliver them without being paid—I sent, an invoice with them, and a blank stamped receipt—this is the invoice, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the discount of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. having been allowed, as they were required for exportation—Butt returned without the goods or the money—I went on the Thursday morning, but did not see the prisoner—I saw him about half-past eleven o'clock—he apologized first for not sending the money back, and not meeting me at Mr. Nesbitt's—he said, "I have a German bill here, can you give me the difference out?"—I objected—he said he would meet me at his agent's, at No. 14, London-street, at half-past four o'clock, and he went away—I went there—he did not come—I went to his house—he was not In—I waited, and he came—he appeared surprised, but said if I would walk out with him he would explain it—I objected to walking out, and walked into the parlour, having previously seen the empty case of the instruments, and this ivory plate, having my name on it, having been reversed, the wrong side turned out and polished—I said to him, "Have you pawned those things?"—he said, "No, I have taken them to a private friend, to show me how to use them"—I said, "But you said they were to be shipped to-day"—he said he had been disappointed in shipping—I then asked him to tell me who his friend was where the things were; and, after some hesitation, he said he lived in Holborn, but he did not know the exact address; he was in apartments—I said, "Is it too late, can we see him to-night?"—he said, "I am afraid it is too late"—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was obtained, we got into it; and when we got to Holborn-bridge, I said to him, "If these things are pawned, it is no use playing the fool with me to take me further"—he said, "They are, this is the duplicate"—this is the electrifying machine—the ivory plate has been taken out and turned—I never intended to part with these things without the money—those were my express directions, and that was my bargain with the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> There was no bargain made. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He said, "Send the goods, and I will send back the morney"—I am sure he used those words.</p>

                  </hi>. I took these two articles on 23rd Aug. to the prisoner—my directions were, not to leave the goods without the money—I saw them packed in packing-cases, and the name was on the plate—when I the to the prisoner's house, he asked me if I had brought the things from Mr. Simpson's, and if I had brought the bill and receipt—I said, "Yes"—he said he had a German bill, could I give him the change out—I said, I could not say anything about that, he had better speak to Mr. Simpson—I said, I was to take back the money or the goods—he said he should see Mr. Simpson at Mr. Nesbitt's—he said he should want some more things, and he would speak to Mr. Simpson—he asked me what time Mr. Simpson would go to Mr. Nesbitt's—I said, "About nine o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner—he was formerly a teacher of German in my school. On 21st Aug. Mr. Simpson called to see me, and while he was there the prisoner called—I had not seen him for perhaps four years—I requested him to sit down while I spoke to Mr. Simpson, and during that time I asked Mr. Simpson to come to supper on the Wednesday evening—I did not invite the prisoner—after he was gone, the prisoner said lie was a merchant in Hamburgh, and be wanted some electrical apparatus to send to a friend at Malta; would I be so good as to tell him where he could get them—I said at several places, and amongst others, Mr. Simpson's.

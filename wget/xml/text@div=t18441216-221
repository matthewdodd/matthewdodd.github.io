                  </hi>. I live in Goswell-street, and am a coachmaker; the prisoner was a labourer in my service for nearly two years. On Satur<lb></lb>day, the 30th of Nov., I had four axletrees, and boxes complete, in my loft, tied together in sets—I went away that day, and left the prisoner there—I returned on Monday morning, the 2nd of Dec., between nine and ten o'clock—I went to my loft, and missed the axletrees and boxes—I asked the prisoner whether he had moved them, as he had the cleaning of the loft—he said "No," he had not seen them—in consequence of some<lb></lb>thing I heard I gave him into custody—I had left nobody but him on my premises, and found nobody but him there when I came back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time did you leave him on Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About seven o'clock in the evening—he does not reside there, he lives in Crown-court, Fleet-street—he has a family of children, and very sorry I am to suspect him—up to this time I thought I could trust him with any<lb></lb>thing—I missed these articles on Monday, after I had been back two or three hours—if the prisoner left my premises, it was his duty to make my son acquainted with it—my son lives on the premises, and he would have the charge—the prisoner was not the only man in my employ, but was the only one I left there on Saturday night, and found there on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, and the only man who then had access to the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-keeper, and live in Glasshouse-yard. On the 2nd of Dec., about six o'clock in the morning, I heard a knock at my street-door—I looked out of the window—I could not see who it was, but I heard a voice, which I thought was the prisoner's—I have known him about ten years—he asked if I was coming down, and said he wanted me—I said, "Presently," and I went to bed again—about seven, the witness Bellingham came and called me—I got a light, and went down stairs—I</p>

               <p>found four axletrees in my passage—I asked Bellingham to remove them under the gateway—the prisoner came and asked me if I would take care of them for him—he said there would be a person call for them—I told him I would not have them remain on my premises, and I advised him to take them back to where he brought them from, because I thought they would be missed, and I would not have them on my premises—he said they had been lying by a long time, and would not be missed—I said I would put them into the street if he did not take them away—he came in again in a minute, and asked me if I would lend him a truck to take them—I said, "No"—he then asked Bellingham if he would take them in his cart—he refused—the prisoner went out, and returned immediately, and said they would go immediately—I know no more of them, for I went to work, and never saw them afterwards—I was away about five minutes, and when I came back they were gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How near is your place to the prosecutor's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As much as three or four times round this Court—I knew the prosecutor's business, and knew the prisoner was in his employ, but I did not know where the axletrees came from, nor did I know that the prisoner brought them—I had not the least idea where they came from—I knew the pri<lb></lb>soner's master worked in such things—I said they would be missed, and yet I did not know where they came from, and had no suspicion—I got up when Bellingham came for dung—what he takes away is my perqui<lb></lb>site—he comes in a morning, sometimes once a week, sometimes twice, and sometimes not for a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Somerset-place, Bermondsey—about a quarter before seven o'clock on Monday morning, the 2nd of Dec., I went with my cart to Mr. Lawrence's—I saw the prisoner standing at his door—I asked him if Lawrence was up—he said, "No"—I called Law<lb></lb>rence, and he got a light and came down—the prisoner was not there then—the four axletrees were in the passage—I helped Lawrence to remove them under the gateway—the prisoner came back in about five minutes, and went and spoke to Lawrence—I did not bear what they said—the prisoner then came to me, and asked me if I would take the axletrees to Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell—I said I would have nothing to do with them—he came back afterwards with another young man—the prisoner took two of the axletrees, and the other man took two, and they went away with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—I knew Lawrence by having the dung from him about twice a-week—the man who came with the prisoner was a young man, with a blue frock-coat and a white apron—he had a black beaver hat on—I did not notice whether anything was on it, as it was no business of mine—I do not know where these things were sold, nor yet which way they went—I am carman to a market-gardener—my master allows me a certain price for the dung I buy—I paid half-a-crown for it that Monday morning, and went straight home to my master's place in Bermondsey.</p>

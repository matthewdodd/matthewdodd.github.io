On the 24th of March the prisoners came in together, and were talking about going to a running match—Harman said to Nicholson, "If you are fool enough to spend your money in betting, I am not"—Harman then said, "Two three half-pennyworth's of gin, change for a sovereign, quick, and half-a-sovereign"—he laid down a good sovereign on the counter—I removed it, and placed it on the board—I gave in change a good half-sovereign and the rest in silver—Harman took up the half-sovereign—Nicholson went to the door, came back and said, "What do you want to change for, I have halfpence sufficient to pay for the gin"—he produced threepence—I had seen Harman take up the good half-sovereign, which I put down, and I saw him put one down—on Nicholson paying me the halfpence, I returned the sovereign, and I swept the half-sovereign that Harman had put down and the silver into my hand—I put the half-sovereign into a glass—there was no other half-sovereign there—I put the glass with the half-sovereign into a box, which I locked, and kept the key of it myself—next morning I went to the box to book with my husband, and give my account—I then looked at the half-sovereign—it was not the same that I had given to Harman, but it was the one he put down, and it was a very bad one—I gave it to my husband—I am quite sure it was not the tame—it was a good one I gave him—I am almost positive it was on Easter Monday the prisoner came to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Rochester Arms, Rochester-row, Westmin<lb></lb>ster. On Friday evening, the 11th of April, the prisoners came to my house about a quarter before eight, for a glass of ale, which came to 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Harman tendered a sovereign in payment—I gave him a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, two shillings, and 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the half-sovereign I gave him was a good one—while I turned to get the copper, I saw Harman take up the good half-sovereign and replace it with a bad one—Nicholson called him a <hi rend="italic">fool</hi>, and put down a sixpence, and said he could pay for the ale without changing—I went round the counter and took them both into custody—I saw Harman swallow a half-sovereign—I held him, and Ni<lb></lb>cholson collared me by the throat, but I kept them both, and gave them into custody.</p>

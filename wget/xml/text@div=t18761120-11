                  </hi>. I live at 85, Queen's Head Street, Essex Road, about 12.30 in the morning of 2nd November, I was going out to get some supper, as I went along I opened my purse to get a shilling ready to pay for it, a piece of money fell to the ground, and while looking for it the prisoner came up and said "What have you lost governor "—I said "Nothing "—he asked me a second time and I said the same—two or three parties round asked the same question and the prisoner answered "Oh, it is only a penny," that took me off my guard; I still kept looking about till the few persons that were round disappeared, there was only the prisoner there and another man who I could not swear to—the prisoner said "Are you sure it is only a penny "—I pulled out my purse, I said I did not know whether it was a sovereign or a shilling—in doing so the interior of my purse was open and showed four sovereigns in gold—the prisoner was near enough to see it, the lamp was reflecting on the purse as I opened it—the prisoner made a snatch at it and threw me down at the same time—I did not leave go of the purse, I was struggling, holding it in the struggle—he tore my hands, the scratches are there now—I shouted police as loudly as I could, the prisoner said to the other man "hold his mouth," and the other man placed his hand over my mouth—they bumped by head on the ground two or three times, I was very near losing my senses, the prisoner let go, and the police came up and ran after him 500 or 600 yards before they caught him—I went after them; I lost sight of him, and then saw him in the. policeman's hands—he is the person that took hold of my purse.</p>

               <p>and two men on the top of him; the prisoner is one—on seeing me they left the prosecutor—I followed him 300 or 400 yards—I, only lost sight of him in turning two corners—he turned and came towards me as if nothing had occurred—I took hold of him and said I should detain him for an assault on the prosecutor—he was out of breath and could not speak for some few seconds, when he did speak he said he was not the man, he had done nothing—the prosecutor came up and identified him.</p>

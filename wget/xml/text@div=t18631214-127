I am a shoe manufacturer, of 20, New Norfolk-street, Shoreditch—on Saturday evening, 31st October, about 9 o'clock, I locked up my house, and went to market with my wife, leaving some boots, coats, trousers, and ear-rings safe—we returned in about an hour, and found the front door open, and the drawers pulled out and ransacked—I missed these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my property (I have the corresponding por<lb></lb>tions of the work)—I next saw them in the hands of the police, next evening, Sunday, all except the ear-rings.</p>

I am a detective officer—on Saturday, 31st October, about half-past 9 o'clock, I was with Kenwood in Boundary-street, Bethnal-green, and saw Bass carrying this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Grant was with him—Bass turned round, saw me following them; Bass threw the bag down, and Grant picked it up—they ran up Nelson-street, where Grant threw the bag into a house—I still pursued the prisoners, but lost them—Ken<lb></lb>wood went into the house and got the property—on 6th November, I took Bass in Tyson-street, Bethnal-green—I searched him at the station, but found nothing—I told him I should apprehend him for stealing some boot uppers and different things from Norfolk-gardens—he said, "If you wanted me, you knew where I lived; you could have found me before"—I knew where he lived two years ago, but not then—I had been looking for him—I have known him five years.</p>

If I had been guilty I should not have stopped in that house or neighbourhood, well-knowing that these men knew me, and could have taken me if they liked; I stopped in the neighbourhood, and was taken one month afterwards in bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an elastic web manufacturer, of 26, Baroness Road, Hackney—on 7th July, about 11.15 p.m., I was in Baroness Road between Columbia Market and the houses on the other side—I had to go through a gate, and as soon as I got through I was set upon by three men; they gave me <hi rend="italic">the leg</hi> and threw me down; one knelt on my head—they tore all the buttons off my coat and waistcoat and took my watch and chain—they tried to get my purse and ring, but I was struggling and they could not—I clearly saw one man, not the prisoner, and ran after him, but could not catch him—I described one man to the police, and they fetched me about 3.30 a.m.—I was in bed—I went to the station and identified James Fitzgerald, who was tried last session and found guilty. (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 464)—I afterwards saw the prisoner with a number of other men, and said "I do not know any one there, unless it is that man; he looks like one of the men, but I can't swear to him because he seems to have more hair about his face: I am not sure he is the man"—nobody had suggested him to me—I saw three men when I was robbed, but I can only swear to Fitzgerald—I cannot swear to the prisoner being one of them—no third man was arrested.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant H</hi>). On 8th July I was in Flower and Dean Street, Spitalfields, about a quarter to 1 o'clock, and saw the prisoner with Fitzgerald, who is convicted, and <hi rend="italic">Little George</hi>, who has not been brought here—Fitzgerald and <hi rend="italic">Little George</hi> were quarrelling with the prisoner, who had no whiskers at that time—Fitzgerald said "If I don't have my <hi rend="italic">corner</hi> I shall <hi rend="italic">chevy</hi> you"—"corner" means share of the booty, and "Chevy" means stab—the prisoner said "You have not got the heart to rob a man; you have done nothing: <hi rend="italic">Little George</hi> and I did it"—I was standing in a doorway, and they did not see me—Fitzgerald then said "Did not I hold the man down while you took his watch and <hi rend="italic">slang</hi> away and try to pull the <hi rend="italic">fawny</hi> off his finger?"—"fawny" is a ring—I then went to the station and heard that a robbery had been committed—I took Fitzgerald the same morning, and he was convicted here last session—the prisoner was somewhere where I could not get him; but I took him on 17th August and charged him—he said "How is it you have not taken <hi rend="italic">Little George</hi>? he was there, and had as much to do with it as I had"—I took him to the station; he was placed among six other men and identified by Hales.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I told you that Hales could not identify <hi rend="italic">Little George</hi>, or I should have apprehended him—if you want me to state why I could not take you before, I will do so—I had heard you speak before, and I saw you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I went home to take my father and mother a trifle of money, and Fitzgerald ran across to meet me and my wife. He was too big a man for me, but other people interfered on my behalf. I never said, "Me and <hi rend="italic">Little George</hi> has got it," nor did I say when I was taken, "Why don't you take <hi rend="italic">Little George</hi>?" for I do not know him The policeman has seen me day after day and night after night, and I have passed him in the street, and he never took me.</p>

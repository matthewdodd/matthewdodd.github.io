                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an Interpreter</hi>). I have only been here three or four weeks—I am a merchant, and on 19th January was living in Newman-street, Oxford-street—at half-past 12 that night I was in Oxford-street, and the prisoner engaged me to go to a coffee shop—that was done in English—I went with her to a room underneath, like a kitchen, in Chapel-street, near Oxford-street—I took off my two coats and my waistcoat, in which was my watch and chain, and put them on a chair near the bed—we laid down on the bed together about four minutes, but the prisoner was not undressed—she then wanted to go to the closet, and took her bonnet, saying that she would come back directly—I had not given her anything—she did not come back, and some minutes afterwards I found that my watch was gone—I asked the proprietress of the coffee shop where the girl had gone to; she said, "She will be back directly"—this room was at the coffee-shop—the prisoner did not come, and I asked again, and the proprietress said, "She is gone"—I told her that it was very wrong on her part, and went away, and spoke to several policemen—I met the prisoner about 10 o'clock the same night, "Wednesday, in Oxford-street, by the Pantheon—I told her she had stolen my watch—she said, "I do not know you, I never saw you before"—I am sure she is the same woman—I was with her altogether about an hour—I was quite sober—my watch was worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw it in my waistcoat a short time before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant, at No. 1, Chapel-street—the prisoner had come there once before that night, but I have not been there long—it is a coffee shop, and there is a place down stairs where people are occasionally accommodated—I was standing at the middle door and saw the prisoner come up from below—I had not seen her go down—you go down from the outside, but there is a middle door—you cannot go into that room without going into the passage of the house—when she came up my mistress went down and called out to the gentleman, "May your lady go?" he said, "She may," in broken English—I can positively swear the prisoner is the person—I saw the gentleman directly afterwards—he came up and made a noise that he had lost something—that was a few minutes after the lady left the house—this is the gentleman—I did not see them in the coffee-shop—they sell coffee on the floor even with the street, the other matters are done below stairs—the arrangement for the room was made with the mistress.</p>

               <p>the corner of Argyle-street and Oxford-street, where I saw the prisoner and prosecutor—I could not understand what he said, but he pointed to his watch—he had an interpreter with him who said that the prisoner had stolen it in a private room—she said, going to the station, "I have not seen the gentleman, and have not taken the watch and chain"—she offered me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. not to make any bother—I had her searched at the station, and found a purse and 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to her lodging and found six duplicates between the bed and the mattrass, but not relating to this.</p>

I am the landlady of this coffee-shop, in Chapel-street—on Tuesday night, Mr. Victor came there, with either the prisoner or somebody like her—I cannot swear to her, and I rather think it is not her—she is like her, but she had her fall down—they had no coffee—the gentle<lb></lb>man gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the top of the stairs for the room—I afterwards asked him if the girl might go, he said "Yes," and I took no further notice—I have seen the prisoner at my house before, and the girl that came was about the fame height and size—the voice was not unlike the prisoner's—there was nothing unlike her, only I did not see her face—I did not think it to be her at the time, nor did I at Marlborough-street—when I saw the girl at my house I believed it was the girl I have seen before, and I took her to be this girl, but will not swear it—I knew the gentleman had been before—I did not notice the girl that came in with him, but in stature the prisoner is like her—I believe by the description she is the person.</p>

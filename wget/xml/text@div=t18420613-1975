                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and work on the water, at Putney. I live in Coltman's buildings, Greenwich. On Thursday, the 26th of June, I was in the tap-room of the Red Lion—the prisoner was in the room—I threw some ale out of a glass towards the fire—it was not intentionally done—I think a little of it touched the prisoner—I had seen him before that—I had no quarrel with him—I did not intend to throw it over him—he ran towards me, I turned my back to him, and perceived a knife cut me in the back—my brother said he had a knife in his hand—I did not see it taken from him—I was wounded with it—it has got better now—I did not go to the hospital—the injury was not sufficient.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw Willcox throw about a table spoonful of ale out of his glass—I think some of it went on the prisoner's cheek—he instantly rushed between the tables, and began to hit him with his hand—we thought he was playing—nobody thought he had a knife in his hand till his brother said, "My God, he has got a knife in his hand"—Curtis instantly seized him, and took the knife out of his fist as he was going to make a <hi rend="italic">jab</hi> at him—he said to me, "I have done it; I will go any where with you; I have done it, and must suffer the laws of my country for it"—he was handed over to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the prosecutor, and found two wounds on one shoulder, and another on the loin—they were about an inch deep—I think the knife must have gone obliquely, which would diminish the depth—neither of them were severe, nor attended with any serious consequences—it was in a muscular part of the loin, and not followed by any inflammation—the knife produced would make such a wound.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner at the Red Lion—he appeared to have been drinking, and said he knew he had done it, and must suffer the laws of his country—I asked why he did it—he said he did not know that the prosecutor had done any thing to him to cause him to do so—a man named Curtis, I believe, gave me the knife produced—the prisoner said the man had never done him any hurt, and</p>

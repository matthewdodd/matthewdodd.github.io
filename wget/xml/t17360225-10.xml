               <p>Mary Pickering. The Prisoner and another young Woman came into my Shop, the 10th of February, about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and asked for a Bit of Cambrick; they had not been long in the Shop, before I perceived they wanted none. The Prisoner put her Hand down, and dropped something; I saw her stooping to take it up. I had no Body then in the Shop, but before they went away, my Mother came in: I gave her a Hint to watch them: They bought a Quarter and Nail of Cambrick, and paid for it; then they went away. I miss'd immediately the spotted Lawn, and though my Mother saw them turn down the next Court, yet we could not find them: So I went to the Pawnbrokers to desire them to stop it, if such a Thing should come to be pawn'd. The next Morning one came and asked me, if I could swear to the Woman and the Lawn: I said, if the Woman was in the same Dress, I could, and the Lawn was very remarkable, for there were several Darns in the End of it: I knew the Prisoner again, and I value the Lawn at 40 s.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master plasterer, and live at 26, Baxter Road, Essex Road, Islington—about half-past eleven, on the night of the 10th February, I was coming up Baxter Road with a whip in my hand, and was met by the two prisoners—George came behind me, and William in front, and struck me a heavy blow, which caught me right in the eye—it must have been very great, because it broke my hat and sent it down the area—William tried to get my watch and chain—I said, "Do not take my watch and chain, I have had it for many years, take my money"—whilst he was pulling at my chain, the other prisoner stood on one side—I hollowed out, "Police," as loud as I could—the police came up in about five or ten minutes—the watch and chain was not taken—had not seen the men before—I dropped my whip at the time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman N</hi> 288). About half-past eleven on the 11th February, I heard a cry of "Police" in Baxter Road—I went up, and saw the prisoners and prosecutor, and a female without a bonnet, who I believe to be the prosecutor's wife—William Smith was given into my custody—the other prisoner came behind, as I was taking him to the sta<lb></lb>tion, talking to a gentleman who was following up, until I met another constable, and he was then given into custody—I found eleven duplicates on William Smith—the prosecutor was not exactly sober; he had had a little, but he knew what he was about—I found his hat over in some railings—he was bleeding from the nose, and his eye was very much swollen—as we were going to the station, George Smith asked the prosecutor to have something to drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I took George Smith into custody—he said nothing—I had seen the two prisoners a short time before, at the top of Orchard Street, together—they were causing a dis<lb></lb>turbance in a public-house—I had to fetch them out, and when they got outside they took off their jackets, pretending to fight—they were not drunk.</p>

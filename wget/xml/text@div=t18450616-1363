                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker; Taylor was in my employ between two and three years. On the 15th of May I took stock, and found there was a deficiency from Christmas till then of about 300 pairs of boot-fronts—I then counted them from day to day—on the 19th of May I counted the contents of three drawers when Taylor went to din<lb></lb>ner—he returned at half-past one o'clock, and was left in the shop alone while I went to dinner—directly I returned he asked me to let him go out for about twenty minutes—directly he turned his back I counted and missed three pairs and a half of boot-fronts—I got an officer, and took Taylor—he said he had sold the whole to Crawley; he had sold three pairs and a half of fronts, and three pairs of boot-fronts, for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to Crawley's, in Monmouth-street, directly, and found him in his shop—I said, "We are come for those fronts and half-fronts which you bought of Taylor for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said he did not know Taylor—I said, "It is no use denying it, we know all about it"—we said they were in the drawers in the parlour—he did not deny it, but went into the parlour, took a key out of his pocket, and unlocked the drawers—at the top of one of the drawers we found</p>

               <p>three pairs and a half of boot-fronts, and three pairs of boot-fronts, together—the three pairs and a half of boot-fronts were those I had missed within an hour from my shop—there was other leather in the drawer, which was all of one kind—it was all calf leather, and I recognised it was mine by the quality—he said he had given 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for those he produced first—they are worth something more than 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was asked if he had any more leather on his premises—he said no—we searched a cupboard, and found other leather—I gave him into custody—before he went from home he said he regretted having bought leather of Taylor, but he thought he brought it from his father's—Taylor's father is a grinder and leather-seller.</p>

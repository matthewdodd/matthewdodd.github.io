               <p>I am a waterman and lighterman.</p>
               <p>In whose employ are you? - In my own; this day fortnight, about eight in the morning, I ordered my servant to get my boat ready for me, and to set the sail, I went down the river, and at Blackwall I was standing in my boat, and I saw two men hard at work heaving coals out of a barge at Bow-creek, my boy saw them, I went further to Blackwall and had a more full view of them, and I saw a man go out of the barge, I do not know who that man was, he was a stout portly middle sized man, they were hard at work, and then I saw the prisoner at the bar step out of the barge with a shovel, that was before I saw the first man go out of the barge, about five minutes, he began to trim his boat, there were some barges laying at anchor, I rowed round them, and he shifted upon the larboard quarter; I went alongside of him, and I said, what a young man you are, why will you be guilty of these things, of robbing that coal barge, he was in the barge; he said, you know, Mr. Nicholls, every thing is very dear and there is nothing to do upon the water, I said, I know it very well, says he, I can get nothing to do, and I must go a thieving, then says I, had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230110"></xptr> you better go and black shoes on Tower-hill or any where.</p>
               <p>Court. Well, what did you see him do? - I saw him heaving coals out of that barge into his boat for upwards of a quarter of an hour, I do not know whose coals they were, the number of the Barge was 172, and named the Fanny.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This prisoner is a very facetious gentleman, to hold this conversation with you, if you had been stealing coals, would you have said any thing? - No, I do not think I should.</p>
               <p>I Did not you think it extraordinary that the prisoner should declare it? - No, I thought it not so, because it is what he lives by, he is up and down every other day, stealing coals.</p>
               <p>You are very wrong in saying that, it will have a proper effect on the Jury? - He swore he would be the death of me.</p>

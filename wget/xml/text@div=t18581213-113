                  </hi>. I keep the Eaglet public-house, Seven Sisters'-road, Holloway. On 25th November, the prisoners came into my house in the evening—Higgins called for a pint of porter, and gave me a florin in pay<lb></lb>ment—I found it to be bad—I merely bit it; I did not cut it—I gave it him back, and told him it was bad—he run it round with his fingers, looking at the edge, and he said, "Dear me, so it is!"—he went into the tap-room, got gome coppers from Feast, and returned to the bar, and said, "Dear me; how you frightened me about the-two-shilling piece being bad"—they drank the beer and left the house, and my barman followed them—I had not defaced the coin so much as that any one could perceive it.</p>

On 25th November, about 4 o'clock, the two prisoners came in together—one of them asked for a pennyworth of rum and the other a pennyworth of gin—they were standing in front of the bar together—I served them, and one of them, I don't know which, threw down a florin—I bent it with my teeth easily—I threw it back to them, told them it was bad; they gave me a threepenny <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>, and I returned them one penny—directly they went out, the barman at the Eaglet came in and spoke to me.</p>

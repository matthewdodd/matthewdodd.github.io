                  </hi> I am wife of Samuel Lovett, surgeon, of Clare-street, Clare-market—it is his dwelling-house. On Thursday, 21st Oct., the elder prison came, and brought the younger prisoner to my husband, as errand<lb></lb>boy—we engaged him—we had no character with him—we took him on his father's recommendation—he said he was well known by people in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—he had to carry the medicine out, and clean the windows and shoes—on the following Tuesday I placed a silver watch on the dining-room mantelpiece—the boy had been cleaning the bed-room window where my jewellery was, on the Monday—he left on the Tuesday without notice—he was hired by the week—after he was gone I missed a brooch and diamond-ring, worth from 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a pearl-ring, a mourning-ring, and watch and guard, worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were in my looking-glass drawer, in my bed<lb></lb>room—he must have gone from one room into the other to take them—they were safe half an hour before they were lost—the prisoner did not come back—there were wages due to him.</p>

               <p>JAMES HAWKINS. On the 28th of March I was at a lock-up-house in Cursitor-street; the prisoner was there, and said he had procured bail and had sent his nephew into the City to meet them, and given him the money to pay them - while his nephew was gone, his bail came there - he said they would not wait for his nephew's return - he asked Mr. Colebeck and me if we had 8l. to lend him till his nephew returned - I pulled out my purse, and let him have 8l. - I had seen a 5l. in his hand; but one Pearson, whom he sent down with it, said they would not take that, and I saw another note in his hand - he promised to pay me before he went away - in about an hour I asked him for it - he said he could not pay me that night- that his nephew had returned, but he wanted all the money - I asked if had not some notes - he said he had a 20l. note, which he would leave with me as security till next morning, when he would bring the money and take the note back; it was a Wellington note, payable in town; I sent it next morning to a banking-house, by a porter, who is not here, and I sent it again by another man - I cannot swear they brought the same note back.</p>

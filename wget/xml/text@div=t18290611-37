I was called up to take the prisoner, who was struggling with the prosecutor; the pillow was given up at Marlborough-street by the pawnbroker - the prisoner said, "The things are pawned, and if you will give me time I will make them good;" I found the duplicates by the bed-side - I found four different keys in the room, of different apartments where they had lived.</p>

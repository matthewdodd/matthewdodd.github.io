             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday last, the 6th of January, I was in the City at the Jamaica coffee-house, and dined with some gentlemen, and drank too freely: a woman followed me, and asked me to give her a glass of wine: by and by I fell in with two men and a woman, and this woman began to abuse me; then the two men and women immediately attacked me; neither of those women are the prisoner: I got away from them, and was determined to get into the first public-house: I was going to my lodgings, and the corner of this lane I met with the prisoner. I was very drunk at that time. She conducted me to a house, and followed me into a room in that house. I sat down on a chair, and fell asleep: I have no recollection till I awaked: then I missed my money; on missing it, I immediately laid hold of the prisoner, and insisted she had taken it from me. The master of the house came in; I laid hold of him, and called out for the watch. When I awaked, this woman was in the room then. A number of other women came in, and all laid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130108"></xptr>hold of me; and I got several blows; I called out murder! and made a great many other noises. The constable searched the prisoner, and has some money: I only swear to the purse. When I entered the house, there was in the purse seventeen guineas and a half; it is a netted purse; I cut off the tassels as there was a hole at each end, and I tied a knot at each end.</p>

               <p>When did you last see your purse? - At the Stock Exchange coffee-house, about nine or ten; then there were sixteen whole guineas, and two half guineas, and some shillings: I counted my money at the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. This was on twelfth night? - I believe it was; it was the 6th of January.</p>
               <p>At the pastry cook's there was a great crowd? - No, Sir, it was eleven before I came past there: I will not swear that; but I do not think I could have been in the house at ten.</p>
               <p>This woman conducted you to this house on your application? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went, I suppose, arm in arm: are you sure she is the woman that went in with you? - I am sure that is the woman.</p>
               <p>You never had any doubt about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you at all jostled or hustled about by the people in Fleet-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Much? - Not very much.</p>
               <p>It was in Fleet-street that you was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - No, never had.</p>
               <p>When you awoke, this woman was in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And when the watchman came, he did not give you that assistance you expected: you talked of sending for my lord mayor and Sir Sampson Wright? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you the next day desire this woman to go about her business, and offer ten pounds to have nothing more to do with it? - No, Sir; no part of that is true; I said I had lost a considerable sum of money, and that I did not wish to be detained in town, as I understood she would be committed to Newgate; then a bill of indictment was to be found, and all this would be attended with a vast deal of expence; and I thought if I had the money that was saved, the ten guineas and a half returned, I would let the woman go.</p>
               <p>She is now indicted, you understand, for a capital offence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, as you are sober, I will thank you to tell me whether this is your signature? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is what you signed and swore to the next day before the magistrate? - That is the evidence I gave there.</p>

               <p>"which he believes was Fleet-street, he</p>
               <p>"was then very much in liquor, that he</p>
               <p>"was accosted by a woman who asked</p>
               <p>"him for a glass of wine, and who followed</p>
               <p>"him till he came to the house,</p>
               <p>"which he believed was a cake-house, and</p>
               <p>"before which house a great number of</p>
               <p>"people were then assembled; that the</p>
               <p>"woman then abused him; when all of a</p>
               <p>"sudden, he found himself very much</p>
               <p>"pushed and pulled about by the said assemblage</p>
               <p>"of people; that he ran into</p>
               <p>"a house in the neighbourhood for protection,</p>
               <p>"which house he is since informed</p>
               <p>"is No. 2, Great Shire-lane; that to the</p>
               <p>"best of his recollection, the next morning,</p>
               <p>"the prisoner Bethia Atkinson followed</p>
               <p>"him in; and when in the room</p>
               <p>"in that house, he thinks she took out of</p>
               <p>"his breeches pocket, the purse now produced,</p>
               <p>"which is his property; it then</p>
               <p>"contained to the amount of sixteen guineas</p>
               <p>"in gold, and some silver."</p>
               <p>Is that your deposition? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, after having sworn in that deposition the next morning, that you believed to the best of your recollection, the woman was the person; how came you to have any doubt about it? - I have stated the same just now.</p>
               <p>No, you have not, you answered you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130109"></xptr>never had any doubt about it? - That is the woman, to the best of my recollection; I cannot speak only to the best of my recollection; I swear positively, as far as I can swear, that is, to the best of my recollection; as far as I can recollect a person's face.</p>
               <p>As far as you, who was mortally drunk, can conceive, you think that is the woman? - I mean that is the woman that followed me into the house, and was in the room the next morning; in drawing up that deposition, that is just merely playing upon words.</p>
               <p>Now was you sure it was a pastry cook's shop, with all its illuminations? - It is what I call a cake house; I believe it was a cake house.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me just now, that there was no crowd at this cake house; you said before the justice, it was an assemblage of people? - I recollect the gentlemen asked me if I was struck; I told them no, I was pushed a good deal; they asked me if I received any blows; that is what I call jostling, as I conceived, with a view to take away my purse.</p>
               <p>Now drunk, as you was, will you venture to swear that you ever felt your purse, after you went through that jostling? - No, I will not.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner did not ask you for wine? - No: I firmly believe the jostling was done with that view.</p>
               <p>What are you by profession? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>What, a man of fortune? - I have hitherto lived on my fortune, and I fancy I can live on it a little longer; I live at present at Godalmin, in Surry; I do not keep a house there just now; I have never kept a house in England: my wife lodges at Godalmin now, at the house of Mr. Payne. I went from England to Jamaica, in April, 1782; and I landed at Falmouth about ten weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Where was your residence in town that night? - I came from Godalmin the preceding night, and lodged at the Angel inn, and was to have lodged there that night.</p>
               <p>Court. You say in this deposition that you think she took the money out of your breeches pocket; what do you mean by that? - By saying that, I say, I suppose it must be her; and I do not think it could be any body else; and by the purse being found upon her; and I think by her being in the room, and the money and the purse found on her afterwards: I did not see her do it, nor do I know she did.</p>

               <p>I live in Shire-lane. About half past eleven on Twelfth night, the prosecutor came to our house and called for a bottle of wine, sat down in the parlour by the fire side; the gentleman fell asleep by the fire side, leaning against the prisoner who sat next to him; and in a quarter of an hour he awoke, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be very drunk when he came in? - Yes, he got up and went into the yard to the privy, and staid a considerable time; the woman went to him; they came in again, and the gentleman said he wanted the watch; I asked him if he had lost any thing; he called watch! several times, he gave me no answer; there was nobody in his company but the woman; I sent for the watchman and he came; then he said the prisoner had robbed him; after he awoke he appeared more collected than before; while I sent for the watchman he two or three times desired the woman to go, and opened the door and bid her go, but she hung about him crying; the watchman was going to take her to the watch-house; I told him it would be more prudent to search her first, which he did, and he took out of her pocket ten guineas and a half, and a halfpenny, and a purse.</p>
               <p>Was the money in the purse? - No, it was not; it was in her pocket; the watchman put the purse and money in his breeches pocket, separate as he found it; I did not go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130110"></xptr>Mr. Garrow. I believe the room you was sitting in, is very near to that in which this gentleman was? - Very near, an adjoining room</p>
               <p>In that room you and your wife, and three young ladies were sitting? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You heard no disturbance or quarrel between these people? - No, we never suffer that.</p>
               <p>I suppose there are a set of regular formal questions that you put, and when they are answered you are satisfied? - We do not know whether they know one another or not; and therefore we always ask the gentleman if he has lost any thing.</p>
               <p>The gentleman pressed her to go away about her business, and she would not go? - No, she hung about him and cried.</p>
               <p>He has told us that he had slept from eleven, till betwixt twelve and one? - It was about a quarter of an hour, to the best of my knowledge, it was not quite twelve when he went into the yard; I always shut my house up at twelve.</p>
               <p>What is your's, a tavern? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A licenced tavern? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where are you licenced? - A wine licence.</p>
               <p>How long have you kept it? - About eight months.</p>
               <p>Now the next day, did you see these two people together? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he wanted to get rid of the woman, and make an end of this prosecution? - No, I never saw them after that night.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner, drunk or sober? - Very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Bradley, did it ever happen to you in your life, to have any body run into your house for protection? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>And I dare say, if you should live to be a thousand years old, it never would occur again? - I cannot say; they might have got drunk together before they came there.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 16th of August, about half past two o'clock, before day-light, near Pellican-stairs, I saw a ship's boat rowing to shore; I boarded the boat, the prisoner only was in it; I examined the boat, found it belonged to the ship, Hilton, a collier of South Shields. I took the prisoner in custody; when I landed him he made a start to run, I laid hold of him; I searched him, in his waistcoat pocket I found a watch, and chain and seal to it, two dollars, two shillings, and two sixpences; in his trowsers pocket I found two ten pound notes, a two pound note, a one pound note, and a guinea, in a brown silk purse; he made me to understand, that he had worked for the money, and the watch he had bought of some sailor, I locked him up; in the morning I found out the Hilton, and gave information, Captain Wood came to the office.</p>

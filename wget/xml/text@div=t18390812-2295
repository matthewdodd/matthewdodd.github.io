                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Montpelier-street. I had a sister named Charlotte—she died last August—I know the prisoner—I remember his keeping company with my sister before marriage—I was not at the marriage—I went to see them after their marriage—they lived together as man and wife—I have heard the prisoner speak to her as his wife always—they lived in North-street, Marylebone—this is my sister's hand-writing to the register—I have seen the prisoner write, and I think this is his writing to the register—they lived together for about eight years, and then separated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody on Tuesday, the 6th of August, about seven o'clock in the evening—I told him he was charged with having two wives, that I had got the cer<lb></lb>tificates of the two, and that his wife was just behind—he looked back—Cayley was just behind—he said, "Oh, she is no wife of mine"—I said I had got the two marriage certificates—he said one was a forgery, the one of his marriage to Cayley—he said he never was married to the wo<lb></lb>man who was following, pointing to her.</p>

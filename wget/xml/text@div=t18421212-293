                  </hi>. I am a draper, but am out of business, living at present on my property, till I get into business—since I have been in town I have been living at No. 2, Gray's Inn-lane—I have been in town little more than three months. On Tuesday, the 6th of Dec., about half-past three o'clock, I was passing down the Strand—I stopped for a minute or two at a print-shop window near Southampton-street, on the same side of the way—after I had been there a minute or two, a young man came up to me, and pressed himself against my left side, apparently with his person; but deeming it an accident, I took no notice—almost immediately after, Le placed his hand slightly and indelicately on * * * *—I immediately left the window, passed on, and turned up Southampton-street—I had not proceeded above eighty or a hundred feet when I heard a person coming after me, and as he approached me, he asked me, in an under tone, to give him half-a-pint of beer—on turning round, on the question being repeated, I ascertained it to be the same person—it was the prisoner—the question was repeated two or three times—I said, "No," left him, and crossed the road, to avoid him—he followed me, and still urged the request, entreating me to give him half-a-pint of beef, or money to procure it—I said I would give him nothing, and desired him to be off about his busi<lb></lb>ness—he said he would not leave me unless I gave him half-a-pint of beer—I then took from my pocket a penny-piece and two halfpence, and gave them to him, laying, "There is half-a-pint of beer for you, be off"—he took them in his left hand, laid them in the palm of his right hand, and holding it out to me, said, "Now, I will produce these to the first policeman I see, unless you give me more money"—I became greatly agitated and alarmed, and told him I had no more money, but a few halfpence—he said, "Give me what you have, and I will go away"—I gave him two more halfpence, which was all I had—he, said, "I shall hand these also to the policeman, and give you in charge, unless you give roe more money"—I told him I had no more money—he said, "You have something you can make money of, you have a watch"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he said, "Then give me that," which I refused—he said, "Unless you will give me a crown I will hand you over to the first policeman I find, and will expose you"—I said I had no money—he said, "Well, pledge your watch, and give me a crown, than I will leave you directly"—I said, to him, "Where is there a pawnbroker's?"—he said, "I will take you to one"—he led the way through several courts, and brought me into Long Acre, nearly opposite Mr. Priest's house, the pawnbroker's—he then said, "No, I will not take 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will have some more money, you appear a respectable person, and your character is worth more than that to you, or I will expose you"—I said, "How much money do you want?"—he said, "Give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will not wait a minute or two; unless you give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 141, Long-acre. On Tuesday, the 6th of Dec., I saw the prosecutor at my shop—in consequence of a communication he made (he gave me a description of a person) I went out, and saw the prisoner, who answered the description—I asked him if he was waiting for any body in the shop—he said, "No,"—I called to the prosecutor, and asked him if this was the man—he pointed to him immediately, and said, "That is him"—I made him walk into the counting-house, sent for a policeman, and had him given into custody—I told him in the counting-house what the gentleman had accused him of, and that he had given him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and asked him if he had any money in his pocket—he pulled out one penny piece, and four halfpence—he said he had never seen him before in his life.</p>

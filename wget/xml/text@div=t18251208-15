On the 12th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the parlour, Mrs. Gibbs gave me information - I ran out, pursued the prisoner down Wardour-street, Edward-street, and was directed down Duck-lane. I there saw him throw this linen cloth out of his blue apron - it was picked up in my presence - it had laid in the shop, about three feet from the door. I secured him immediately. I had not seen him enter the shop - there are twenty-six yards of it, and it cost us 2l. 12s.</p>

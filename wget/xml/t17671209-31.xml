On the Wednesday morning, about half an hour after twelve, I went to Billingsgate; I found Harrup's boat fastened to another there; the prisoner was in her; I asked him if that was his boat; I said, that boat belonged to Mr. Harrup; he said, she did not; I said, she was taken from Queenhithe last night; he said, he knew she was from Queenhithe, and that he gave a shilling for the use of her; I told him I knew to the contrary, for the owner had spoke to me about eleven o'clock at night about her; he tried to shove her off; I insisted he should not: he up with the scull to knock me down; I called for help; I got assistance, and secured him; then I went and called Mr. Harrup out of bed; I do not know who the ropes and things that were in her belong to; the prisoner said he had bought the ropes of such and such men, but did not know their names; I asked him his name; he said his name was

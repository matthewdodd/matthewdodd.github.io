                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. I took the prisoner into custody, on the charge of forging a bill of 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on Mr. Kewney, of Not<lb></lb>tingham—he asked me to treat him with kindness, and he would be quiet—I told him, I certainly would treat him with kindness, if he would be quiet—(I took him at his house at Hoxton-New-town)—he immediately made his escape, and ran out of the house—I pursed him, and secured him in the next street—I took him to the station-house, in Stoke-New<lb></lb>ington-road; and on fetching him from there, while he was in the cab, going to the Compter, he seemed anxious to say something—I cautioned him, and said it was a serious charge, and what he said to me might, per<lb></lb>haps, be evidence against him, and he had better say nothing—he said it could not affect his case; the charge of forgery they could not prove; but that I was very lucky; if I had not taken him that night, I should not have taken him at all, for he would have been off next morning, where nobody would have found him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. It was my duty to inquire into the validity of the sundry bills—I asked the prisoner about this bill—he said the acceptor was a respectable draper, living at Rochdale (<hi rend="italic">Bill read</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I claim your attention; I trust you have not made up your minds to send me over the water without hearing me speak; I did not run away for fear of being taken for forgery; when I said, if I had not been taken that night, I should have gone where I could not be found; I meant to say, my family would have been removed, where he would not have found me that day; for I had been apprised that my old assigees were going to lay hold of my furniture, and meant to move to<lb></lb>morrow, to save it. You have had one or two witnesses to swear to my handwriting; in answer to their evidence, I shall produce a clerk in my employ, whom will mpositively swear the bills are not in my handwriting; that witness has seen more of my handwriting than any person in court; no part of the acceptance is my writing. In March last I became ac<lb></lb>quainted with John Batchelor, and asked him to recommend us customers; about the 28th of March, he called at our warehouse, and said a friend of his, Mr. Mitchell, of Rochdale, had come to town, and he would bring him; on Monday I received a note, requesting me to meet him at the Three Bucks, in Eaton-street; he said he had a commission from some persons in Rochdale to purchase hosiery, and named a house which Mit<lb></lb>chell assured me was highly respectable; and what he (Mitchell) lived in Drake-street, Rochdale. I took down the orders, which being large, I thought it better to get bills accepted, than give them three months credit. I afterwards stated this to Mitchell; who stated, that if I would draw the bills, he would send them down to Rochdale for acceptance. On the 1st of April, I told Tillidge to draw the bills; four were drawn; I gave them to Mitchell, who promised to get them accepted; on the 12th of April, Batchelor called at my private residence, and gave me the bills, accepted by Ormerod and Co., and said he had received them in a parcel from Mitchell, who had returned to Rochdale; the prosecutor afterwards called on me for the payment of his account, 213<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was due in cash; my partner paid him cash and bills, accounting to, I believe, 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he would get the bills discounted, and return the balance; observing I had I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170109"></xptr>
               <p>other bills, he offered to get them discounted too, and I gave him the one in question, and three others; about the 23rd of April, I sent for the proceeds, but he refused to give it up till he saw what turn our affairs took; and being fearful, as our stock was destroyed by fire, that we might become embarrassed, we would not press him for it. (The prisoner entered into other particulars respecting his commercial transactions, but not reffering to the charge.)</p>

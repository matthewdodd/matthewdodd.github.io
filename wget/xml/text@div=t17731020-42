About two months ago I saw him go in and out of a house in the tent or ground near Long-alley; I saw him do that three or four times in the winter; the prisoner actually lived in that house; he had his workmen and his looms there; but they were brought from thence to Angel-alley, all but two looms, which were left still in the house at the Tenter Ground; he had carried on his trade four or five years in Angel-alley; he has not had this Tenter Ground house above nine months; he lived in that house with his wife and family last Christmas; at that time when he lived in the Tenter Ground his house in Angel-alley was shut up; he came back to Angel-alley last Lady-day, and then his family came with him; having observed this, and having heard some suspicious circumstances of the prisoner, I went to Wood-street Compter, and told what I suspected of the prisoner, and of his being in and out of this house, to one Mr. Berry, and Mr. Berry I suppose gave information to my Lord Mayor, and therefore I had notice to attend the City Marshal on the 10th of September last; accordingly I met Mr. Gates, the City Marshal, at the door of this house in the Tenter Ground, on the 10th of September, about two in the afternoon; Mr. Gates went in to search the house; there was nobody in the house. Mr. Wright has not only that house but two or three in the Tenter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200031"></xptr> Ground. He was at work three or four months ago at Angel-alley.</p>

            ; when we came there, which was about one or two o'clock at noon, I looked in at the hole in the cellar window, and there I observed a bench, some sand and some water, which looked suspicious, as it appeared as if it had been used for scowering or cleaning copper; this satisfied me my information was right; then I broke open the door; I went into the fore parlour; there I found a book with receipts; in the back parlour I found a cutting engine, for cutting blanks out of copper in order to coin halfpence; sheets or strips of copper are laid in the engine, then with one blow the engine will strike through the sheet or bit of copper, and cut out a round piece like a halfpenny; it had not any cutting materials in it, but it was fitted to receive such cutting materials. From the back parlour I went into the cellar, and there I found the stamping engine with two dyes in it; these dyes had the impression of each side of a halfpenny; the upper dye one impression, the under dye another impression; there was in the engine a halfpenny between the two dyes; that halfpenny has been mislaid. I found this half-penny (producing it) lying in a grove of this engine, and which is exactly the same piece of coin; I presume that halfpenny was left between the dyes left the two dyes should rub and hurt one another; at that time the dyes themselves were not cold, so that they had been very lately used. There were lying there besides, some of these round blanks of copper, and likewise cecel, which are remains of these strips of copper after the round dyes have been punched out of it; there was likewise at the same time a fire in the room, in a stove grate, and the engine appeared to have been very lately oiled, for the sake of going easier; there was likewise in a sack in the same room at least a peck of blanks hanging up in a sack like a hammock; they polish them by that-means, putting sand and emery among these blanks into the sack, and shaking them very well together; they will rub against one another, and by that means they gain a considerable degree of polish. Then I went up into the garret of the same house, and there I saw another cutting engine; the cutting instruments were still in that engine; it appeared to me that somebody had been lately at work at that engine in the garret because there was lying by a large quantity of this cicel very bright; there were besides in the cellar a number more dyes that were worn out with use. I found in the garret a large pair of shears, which were very proper to slip sheets of copper into such strips as they use when they punch the blanks out of them. The whole time we were in the house was about two hours. The engines were taken away and carried to the Mansion-house. After that I went in search of the prisoner to his house in Angel-alley; I could not find him there; the next day we found him in Southwark. On the next day in Wood-street Compter I searched him, and found these papers upon him (producing them). When he was carried before my Lord Mayor, he said he had let the house to some people, and could not be answerable for what other people might have done in that house.</p>

On the 10th of April, in the morning, one of my waiters informed me that the preceding day his box was broke open, and some money taken out, and my other servants had complained of being robbed of linen and things: I ordered every man's box to be searched in his bed-chamber, as I had lost variety of things. The man at the bar was one of my <rs id="t17640502-2-deflabel11" type="occupation">servants</rs>

A. and some knives and forks and wine of sundry sorts in bottles; on most of them were my mark; two of the napkins were sewed together, which the sister owned she had done herself to make a table-cloth; one of them appeared to have the mark taken out; she said her brother brought the things there, and that they were my property, before the justice. The brother said, To be sure he carried the napkins there with intent to have them washed, and to bring them back again. I do not remember any thing was said by him about the bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said, The prisoner had lived with him about ten years and a half: that he paid a great regard to him, and he never had any reason to suspect him before: That he takes the wine left by customers as his property, as they leave it for the advantage of the house; but that it is a common thing for the waiters (of which he has generally five or six) if they go into the room before the master, to take what is left in the bottles, and apply them to their own use: That he never countenanced their taking such wine out of the house to alehouses, but should not deny their drinking it at his own house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Andrews. When they were searching the waiters boxes, I observed the prisoner very busy in taking something from his box, and concealing it under his bed-cloths; I went and turned the cloaths down, and found there three glass cloths and ten napkins. My method is to deliver the waiters a certain number of glass cloths in a week, and when they give me back a dirty one, I deliver them a clean one. I employ a washer-woman to wash my linen, and do not expect the waiters to deliver the cloths clean to me.</p>

               <p>It is usual for all waiters in town to carry napkins in their pockets; as to the wine that gentlemen leave in bottles, that lies among the waiters; sometimes on an evening we save three or four bottles; and I have often carried a bit of fowl that has been left to my sister, and a napkin to be washed; the wine that is left we carry it into the garret, and save it among ourselves; I know nothing of the Rum and Arrack.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner at Newington Church in 1841—I married her as a widow—she told me she was a widow—I heard that she was not a widow, but that she had a husband living, about two years after we were married—I told her I heard that she had a husband living—I cannot recollect what she said—it is seven or eight years ago—since then she has several times threatened me that she would bring home my master, but I did not suppose in my own mind that ever she had been married at all—I married her on her representation that she was a widow.</p>

I then went and sat down, and in a short time the prisoner returned and sat down beside me, and endeavoured to put his hand into the left pocket of my pantaloons - he did not succeed, but put his right hand round my waist and into my right hand pocket, and took out five or six halfpence; I then thought it was time to send for a constable.

               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you charge this man with robbing you of more than 5 d. - A. I told the constable I had been robbed of two sovereigns and a half, and some halfpence.

            . I am a constable. I found the prisoner and seven or eight persons in the back parlour - the prosecutor said he had lost two sovereigns and a half. I searched them all one by one, and found only half-a-crown and three shillings on the prisoner, but no halfpence - one person there had some sovereigns, but he was a respectable man. Parker said the prisoner had picked his pocket of five or six pennyworth of halfpence.</p>

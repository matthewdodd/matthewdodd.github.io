On Sunday night the second of last month, at a quarter past ten, I came down into my shop with my shop-woman, and fastened all my doors. In the morning, about seven o'clock, my shopwoman came down to open the door; she returned instantly, and told me that the shop was broke open. I came down in five minutes. There were a great many marks of dirty feet in the shop; the window in the door had been broke open, I believe with a crow; a pane of glass was broke and taken out, by which they could get in to open the shop door. I missed more goods than I have put into the indictment. The counter was broke open where the valuable things were kept, and there was stolen from thence and the glass case all the goods mentioned in the indictment (reading a list of them). I saw some of these things on the Sunday night when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030011"></xptr> came down; all my goods were then in the shop, and I saw that the padlock was on the chest. Miss Jennings, who had likewise been robbed, informed me that she had seen some goods in Holland's house which she thought were mine. After that I went with Miss Jennings to Justice Sherwood's; there I saw three or four bundles containing some goods of mine intermixed with some of Miss Jennings's.</p>

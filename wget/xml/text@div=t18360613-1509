I went with Mr. Entwistle to the prisoner's house, and told her I had a warrant to search her house, as blankets and sheets were thought to be at her place, stolen from the parish workhouse in Bethnal-green—she said, "I suppose it is about that sheet that Mother Moody brought here," and that Moody told her she had received it from her daughter, who told her it was given to her from the workhouse—she directed her daughter to go up to the first-floor front room with me, and the daughter handed me a sheet, out of a little cot, folded up, with "Bethnal-green Workhouse," marked at each corner, and as O—I made a further search in a little back room adjoining the shop, where there were six or sever hun<lb></lb>dred different parcels, with small labels on them for figures; and in a large bundle full of sheets, linen and various things, I found two sheets with the ends cut off, but there was a little of the mark of the same colour as the other sheet was marked—that place was not pointed out to me by her—I went there of my own accord—when I found the first sheet, I said, "There is Bethnal-green Workhouse" in full length—she said, "That is the same sheet I had from Mother Moody"—when I found the other two sheets I asked if she knew any thing about them—she said, No; she had had them a long time—I pointed out to her where the marks appeared to have been cut off—she made no remark to that—part of the mark was visible—it is a little tinge, but very trifling—one of the sheets had been begun to be hemmed—there was a needle and thread in it—the mark of the other so trifling it was impossible to say they were marks—there is exactly the same colour</p>

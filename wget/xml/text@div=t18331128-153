On the 25th of October, I was sent to Mr. Brown's, Clerkenwell-close, to the flatting-mills, with some gold and silver, from Mr. Harris's, in Gloucester-street - I took it there, and was returning with it, in a bag; it was about 14l. worth- it had been flattened for cases - I was going back with my mother - as I came out of Mr. Brown's, I saw the two prisoners standing at the door; as I got round the Close I saw them again, and they looked at me - they then went up a street, and I did not see them again till I got to the corner of my master's street, which is about fifty yards from Mr. Brown's - my mother then bade me good-bye - Russell then pulled my cap over my eyes, and Wright pulled my bag; but I had the string so tight, that he did not get it away; but he had the bag in his hand - my mother then came up; Russell then left my cap, and pulled at the bag - they both pulled at it, and the string cut my fingers very much, and made them bleed - I caught hold of Russell, Wright then swore at me and wanted me to fight him - my mother told me to go down the steps and tell my master - I went and gave the bag to my mistress; I then ran after the prisoners and told my mother she was to bring one of them back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You knew Russell very well? A. No; I had seen him once before, but did not know where he lived - I had not played with him - I saw him once when I was looking for a place - he said to me, "Is there a boy wanted" - I did not know him name was Russell, till he told me up at the station-house - I did not know the other boy at all - they did not begin to play with me - my cap was not taken off and thrown down an area - I don't know that they knew what I had got - it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, on the 25th of October.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see them next morning? A. Yes - I saw Wright when I went to Mr. Brown's - he whistled and some more boys came to him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long was it before this night, that you and Russell went to look for a place? A. I did not go with him, I was looking at the bill when he came up to me, and asked if a boy was wanted - I had not tole them that I had any money or property about me - they did not tell me to deliver, or that they would have my things, or anything of that kind; but one struck my cap, and the other pulled my bag, and when my mother came up, they did so still - I did not stay to hear whether my mother scolded them, they walked away talking together; my master was not at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they see you come out of Brown's door? A. Yes; it is a large shop down a passage, with mills in it.</p>

            . I am the witness's mother. I went with him on the 25th of October, as he was timid - I meant to stop at the next door to his master's, that he might not know that I was with him - when I left him, he called out "Mother, they have got my cap over my eyes"- I returned back, and saw the prisoners, they had got the cap over his eyes, and were pulling the bag, and they would have got it, but the string was cat-gut - I asked them how they came to molest him; they then walked on some distance, and set their backs against a door - my boy then came, and said, I was to bring them back again; Russell said, "No, be d-d if we will; let him come to us if he wants us" - my boy said, "If you don't come to him, my master will come to you" - they then ran off laughing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The first you saw was one of these boys pulling your son's cap, and the other the bag, and when they saw you they walked away? A. No, sir, they tugged a good deal - I did not call for anybody - they walked away with me, and when my boy came, and said, "My master will come to you, if you don't come to him," they went away laughing - I did not know either of them - I went towards St. John-street - I did not pass any one.</p>

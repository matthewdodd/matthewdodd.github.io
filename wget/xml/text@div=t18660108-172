I am 18 years of age—I have known Collingridge about six or eight years—I was in the service of Mr. Willis—his shop is about five minutes' walk from Collingridge's—I entered their service about five weeks before I was taken into custody—I went to Collingridge's about half-past 8 or 9 on the Monday or Tuesday evening—the shop was shut up but the door was not bolted—I went in and and saw Collingridge there—I told him I wanted some money, that I had got two rings, and I asked him to advance me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so for a day or two—he advanced me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I told him I would call in a few days—he made no inquiry of me as to where I pro<lb></lb>cured the rings—two days having elapsed I went there again; the shop was then full of people, and I waited outside about twenty minutes; this was at half-past ten on the Thursday morning—after I thought all the persons had left, I went in, but I found another person sitting behind a clock—I had these thirteen rings with me—I gave Mr. Collingridge the rings wrapped up in paper, and said, "Here is thirteen more of them rings, I want to sell them"—he said, "Just give me a piece of paper where they came from"—I then went into a coffee-shop and wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "28, Hawley-crescent, Camden-town, December, 1865.

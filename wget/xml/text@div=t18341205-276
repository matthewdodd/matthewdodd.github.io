In July last we lived at No. 5, Maynard-street, St. Giles'-in-the-Fields—we rented one furnished room there—Mr. Corvin was the landlord—he is dead now—he did not live in the house—it was let out to different lodgers—the landlord neither slept there nor took his meals there—there were five different lodgers in the house—we paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for the room—on the 16th of July last, I went out with my hus<lb></lb>band, at eleven o'clock at night—I locked the door myself, and put the key into my pocket—my husband contracts for dung—I returned about half-past</p>

               <p>four o'clock in the morning—it was daylight then—I found a fork standing by the door, and the hasp and the lock hung on the door—the door was broken open, and a box, which these things were in, was broken open—a dung-fork, with three prongs, stood outside the door—it belonged to a man named Crook, a carter—I ran down stairs, and asked a man to come up stairs with me, fearing somebody was in the room—the door was shut, but the hasp and the lock hung on the door—it is a padlock—it was not in the state I left it—I looked about the room, and missed a pair of boots of my husband's brother's, a smock-frock, and a pair of trowsers—a man had gone up stairs with me—I found the lock of a box in the room broken, and missed a new gown of mine, a waistcoat-piece, two silk handkerchiefs, a cotton one, three pairs of stockings, a shift, snuff-box, half-a-crown piece, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in farthings, all belonging to my hus<lb></lb>band and myself—I also missed a new pair of trowsers, a smock-frock, a pair of boots, a sleeve-waistcoat of my brother-in-law's, Charles Cox—all his things hung up in the room, except the smock-frock, which was in the box with our property, which was all safe when we went out—I returned before my husband—I left the pitch-fork where it was till he came home—I fetched him as soon as I missed the things—I have seen a pair of trowsers found on the prisoner, but none of the other things since—he was appre<lb></lb>hended last Tuesday week—we could not find him before—we heard several times that he was gone down "hopping"—I know the trowsers again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of Eliza Cox. I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner four or five years—on the 16th of July I had employed him to go to Covent-garden market to bring some waggons up to the mews, where I buy dung, for me to load them—I do that every night—he went out of my room about ten o'clock, with my brother, Charles Cox, down to the market—I followed them an hour afterwards, and delivered the dung-fork to the prisoner to take to the market, to give it to a man named James Crook, who I had borrowed it of—I was to have seen the prisoner again that night—he brought a waggon up to me to load, and left me about one o'clock in the morning, in Chenis-mews—I sent him down into the market to bring me up another empty waggon, and the waggon was wait<lb></lb>ing for him, but I did not see him again—my wife fetched me about five o'clock in the morning—my dung-fork stood against the door—it was the same dung-fork which I had delivered to him—I was walking round to load my dung-cart last Tuesday week, and tapped the prisoner on the shoulder, in John-street, Berkeley-square—(I had been looking for him in the mean time—I had heard of him, but could not find him—if nothing had occurred, he was to have worked for me on the following day—I hired him by the week)—I told him he was the man I wanted to see—my brother minded him while I got a policeman to Cake him—he was given in charge—as we came along in Berkeley-square I saw that he had my trowsers on—I knew them, again.—I had seen them last on the 16th of July—I told him they were my trowsers—he held his head down and made me no answer.</p>

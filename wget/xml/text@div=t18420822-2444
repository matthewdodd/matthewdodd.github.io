                  </hi>. On Wednesday, the 13th of July, I went into the Sovereign, in Munster-street, and remained there—Oates was there when I went in—I saw the prisoner come in, at very nearly five o'clock, the first time—she went out with three more females, and came in again with a large key in her hand—the deceased was rather reclining on his seat before the bar—she tapped him on his shoulder, and called him "My Lord <hi rend="italic">Tom Noddy"</hi>—he said he would have none of her d——nonsense—she said, "Take that," and hit him on the right hand with the key—he then called her an Irish prostitute—she then ran at him, and struck him under the right eye with the key, which was on her fore-finger—he bled very much—I borrowed a handkerchief, and wiped and bathed it—the skin was broken—I did not stop with him—he said he did not care much about it—I said, "Don't be stupid, hold the handkerchief up to your face"—he appeared to be much hurt after it had done bleeding—he said it affected his temple—I saw him in the same house the next morn<lb></lb>ing, and he complained of pain in the temple—his eye was very nearly</p>

I am porter at the University College Hospital, On the 4th of July the deceased was brought there—his head and face ap<lb></lb>peared very much swollen, and particularly the right cheek—there was a small bruise or cut on the right side of his nose—he did not point that out to me—he said something about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the University Hospital. On the 15th of July, about twelve o'clock in the day, I saw the deceased—his face was then very much swollen from erysipelas, parti<lb></lb>cularly on the right side—the right eye was almost closed—I saw nothing more than a slight contusion of the eye lid—it was difficult to say How much of the swelling belonged to the blow, and How much was caused by the erysipelas—the whole of the right side of the face was swollen, and it was extending on the left side also—I found that he was a person of drunken habits—I cannot say whether he was then perfectly sober, from the change produced by disease—I talked to him, and he stated he had been struck the day before in the eye, but I did not inquire very particularly into it—he said he had been drinking porter and gin for the last eight or nine days, and she believed he had not eaten a quarter of a loaf in that time, or a quartern loaf—he died on the 19th from erysipelas, which I supposed to be caused by the blow.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You cannot undertake to say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—erysipelas is a disease very little understood as to its cause—there is no doubt that he died from erysipelas—it will sometimes seize on a person of intemperate habits without any exciting cause, or it may arise from natu<lb></lb>ral causes—it is more likely <hi rend="italic">to</hi> arise from an open cut than from a contusion—I did not see him till the 15th—the first surgeon who saw him is not here—I should not say he had <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, only simple delirium, which is the natural result of intemperate habits—it would be the more likely to result to a man who had had no solid food for eight or ten days—I cannot undertake to say the blow had anything to do with his death.</p>

               <p>—about 12.30 on the night of 15th May I went into a public-house, and the prisoner followed me in and asked me to treat him, but I would not—I had 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket-book at that time—I did not take my pocket-book out to pay for the beer I had—the prisoner followed me out—there were plenty of people outside—the prisoner first shoved me, and then struck me in the face and knocked me down, and six or seven men jumped on me—I cannot say whether they struck me—I did not lose my senses—I lost my pocket-book whilst on the ground—I got up and went for a policeman—I found one, and we came back to the place where I had been knocked down—the prisoner was standing there.</p>

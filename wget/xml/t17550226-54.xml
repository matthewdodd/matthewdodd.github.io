               <p>Q. When was the seventy-four pounds weight carried away, by night or day?</p>
               <p>Vinton. By day; we used to watch when the officer and boatswain's backs were turned, then we used to put it on board; but not all at once, but in different parcels, at different times going off.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you take the hundred weight?</p>
               <p>Vinton. We took that all away at several times, from the beginning in the morning, to the time we left work; after we got it on shore we sent for a man, one Duffey, to buy it.</p>

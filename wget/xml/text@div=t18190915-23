            . I am a brush-maker, and live near the prosecutrix. On the 9th of September I saw both the prisoners lurking about her shop - it was about twenty minutes after eight o'clock. I watched them, and saw Powell go to the window with a boy, who is not taken; they passed backward and forward - Anderson stood at the corner, about thirty-six yards off. I went into the opposite<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150010"></xptr>shop, and saw Powell cut the window, and go away with something in his hand, which he gave to Anderson at the corner - he was returning. I came out, and missed Anderson. I went round the streets, and then saw Powell giving more property to Anderson - I believe they suspected me. Anderson ran off, I pursued, and overtook him in Argyle-street, and found the property on him. I afterwards saw Powell at the watch-house.</p>

            . I live in the neighbourhood. My attention was called to the prosecutrix's shop - I went into a shop at the corner of the street, and saw Powell doing something at the window, but could not see what. I came out, crossed the street, and saw the shop-window was broken, and the cotton, on which the goods laid, was rumpled. I ran after him, and secured him at the end of Swallow-street, but found nothing on him. I am certain he is the person I saw at the window.</p>

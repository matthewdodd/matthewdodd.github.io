I found these chair-covers and curtains at Mr. Grant's, a pawnbroker, at Knightsbridge—I went with Chinn next day, and found the prisoner at the Rev. Mr. Brown's, Old Windsor—I asked her if she had got the tickets of the chair-covers and curtains she had pledged at Mr. Grant's at Knightsbridge—she said she had not—I asked if she had lost them or destroyed them—she said she had lost them—I asked if Mrs. Thompson had authorised her to pledge them, or any other article—she said "No"—I was in plain clothes—I told her I was a policeman, and took her—in going to the railway, she said she had lost a great number of duplicates.</p>

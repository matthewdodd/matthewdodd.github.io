                  </hi>. I am a mariner, and belong to the brig <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi>, which laid at Bell-wharf last October. The prisoner was one of my fellow-seamen, and came with us from Shields—the crew consisted of five—William Colson was the master—I and the prisoner came on shore on the 22nd of October—my brother was with me—we went to buy several small things for the passage back—there was a difference between my brother and him at the public-house, at King James's stairs, that night—they had a few words—the prisoner struck my brother across the table—I asked him what that was for—he made no more to do, but struck me in<lb></lb>stantly—we went to the door, and there were several blows between us on each side—we were parted by a policeman—my brother and I took a boat and went on board immediately—we came on shore again in about ten minutes, in the same boat, and went to an eating-house to get some sup<lb></lb>per—that was about eleven o'clock at night—I staid on shore about half</p>

               <p>an hour—my brother staid there all night, and persuaded me to stop with him, but I went back to the vessel without him, after waiting on shore half an hour—I had not seen the prisoner since the policeman sepa<lb></lb>rated us—when I got on board, I went to the hatchway and asked who was there—he said, "I am"—I knew his voice—I looked down, and saw there was no light—I heard his voice as if he was sitting on his chest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to think he was below? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked who was there—he said, "I am, come down here"—I said, "If you want me, you must come up"—the cook was in bed—the captain and mate were in bed in the aft-cabin—nobody was there but me—the prisoner came on the second step of the ladder, and said, "Come down here"—I said, "Oh no, if you want me, you must come up"—he then took hold of the handspike and flew up—there were several words of abuse passed between us before that, but I cannot recollect them—he jumped up on deck immediately the words passed—I had seen the hand-spike lying on the deck—he seized it, and flew at me, and gave me a blow with it on my head, before I was aware of what he was going to do—he had the handspike in his hand at the time he struck me on the head with it—he said nothing—I instantly fell quite senseless from the blow—I came to my senses next morning about nine o'clock, in the London Hospital—that is the first I recollect after it happened—I continued unwell ever since, and was seventeen weeks in the hospital before I was examined at the Thames Police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook on board the <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi>. I came on shore that day, and parted with the prisoner shortly after he went on shore—I fell in with him again shortly after—I saw him and the prosecutor at the public-house, and saw what passed between them—I heard George Dixon say to the prisoner, "How came you to say Mark Grady would not carry me?"—the prisoner said, "No more he would," and then the prisoner struck George Dixon—they began to fight—the pri<lb></lb>soner then abused Dixon's family, and said they had not a good word to give any body—Robert Dixon then jumped up, and said he would fight him, if he came to the door—they fought a few minutes, and were parted—both went into the public-house, and the prisoner and I went in as well into, the same room; then tie prisoner called to me to go and drink in a little room backward, and not stop with them—I said it would be better to make it up, and all go on board together—he made no answer to the proposal—he wanted a pot of beer—we came back to where we had left the Dixons, and they were gone—what passed about making it up was in a private room—he said nothing to that—I immediately returned into the room where we had left Dixons, but they were gone—the prisoner and I went and got a glass of spirits each, and went on board directly—it was about half-past eleven o'clock—the Dixons were not on board then—the prisoner and I went down below to go to bed—I took off my clothes in<lb></lb>stantly, and said I thought I would not strike a light, as we had to be up two hours after, to go off—I pulled my clothes off—the prisoner did not take his clothes off, nor go to bed—he did not say why—I did not get into bed, as the prisoner said to me, "Here: he is coming"—I knew who he meant, as only three of us slept on board in the forecastle—he hardly said so, before Dixon asked, "Who is below?"—the prisoner said, "I am below; what do you want?"—Dixon said, "Come on deck, and I will fight you; you cannot say there are two upon you now"—very abusive words took place between them, and in an instant Brady jumped on deck all at once; but I did not know what he was going to do—it was a very moonlight night—when he jumped on deck, I heard a man fall on deck, apparently—I went upon deck instantly, and as I passed the prisoner, he said, "I have done him; there he is lying"—Dixon was lying on the deck—I took hold of him, and set him on ray knee—I said to the pri<lb></lb>soner, "You have done it; this is a bad job, man"—he made me no an<lb></lb>swer—I saw blood running down from Dixon's head on my shirt—he was quite insensible—I thought he was dead—the prisoner was <hi rend="italic">rather much</hi> intoxicated at the time—he said nothing more to me—the policeman came on board directly—I did not see the handspike—I had come from Shields with the prisoner—he had been another voyage with me in the ship—I have seen him in liquor before—I did not notice any ill-temper in him be<lb></lb>fore—he and Dixon had had a few words before in the passage up, I heard the prisoner say Robinson would not carry his brother George up—that was in our passage—he said Robinson would not carry him in the ship—whether it was for a bad character, or what, I do not know.</p>

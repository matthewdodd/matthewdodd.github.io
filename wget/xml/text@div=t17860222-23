               <p>What did you do? - He pulled me up from the bolster, and in the mean time my breeches were gone from under my head; and soon as I arose from the bed, I went to feel for my breeches and they were gone, I had my watch in my pocket, and a couple of shillings; it was a silver watch, I am sure I had that when I came into the room, I put it into my waistcoat pocket, I found all the rest of my clothes, but not my breeches, I went down stairs, and when I came up stairs again, this prisoner and the other woman were in the room, and I could not find my breeches, and I begged of them to get a light that I might find them: I had searched about, but when the light came I found them, and put them on. and was going down stairs to leave the place, I gave them very good words, and the prisoner pulled hold of me by the arm, and called the two men up stairs to come and search me, because I had said before, I had lost my watch and my money, thinking it was in my breeches pocket, and forgetting I had put it into my waistcoat pocket; when she had hold of me, she called in the other two men, and one of them came in, and swore a great oath, and said he would pull my bloody life out, if I did not produce the watch; the prisoner had hold of me by the right arm at that time, so that I could not have the liberty of my arm, and he snatched my watch from me, that was the man that had hold of my throat, the short one that took my watch, and the other went away; the two girls had hold of me, I tried to get after the men, and I believe I broke the hinge of the door, I went to call the watch, and the women came down, and before the watch came, they both run away.</p>
               <p>Was this house inhabited by other persons? - I do not know who was in it, I was in the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>What became of your two shillings? -</p>
               <p>That was gone at the time I lost my breeches from under my head; I found the patrols, and they came with me to the same house, by the description I gave, and we found the prisoner wrapped up in the bedclothes, with all her clothes on in the same room, I am sure it was the same woman! I never got my watch again, the woman was taken by the patrols to the watch-house and lodged there all night, and the next day carried before a Justice of Peace.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not the person that laid hold of him, I was in the room some distance behind him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Had she hold of you at the time your watch was taken? - Yes, for I could not get my hand to my pocket to get it out, without some difficulty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He delivered his watch out of his own hand, into the young man's hand, to see what what it was o'clock, and he went off with it.</p>

               <p>That gentleman went home with me, we had two pots of beer, and two quarterns of gin; when we had been in bed about an hour, I was awaked out of my sleep, and the door was burst open, and two men and a woman came into the room, I could not tell who they were, and a light was produced in the room, then I saw who they were, and he had got his clothes on, and charged me with having his watch; he said he had lost two shillings; I insisted on his searching his pockets, and laid hold of his arm that he should search, and he took his watch out of his waistcoat pocket, and gave it to one of the young men to see what it was o'clock, and the man went off with it.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Patrol. She gave you names that you were to make a search after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you on your enquiry find that there were people of that name? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. After in your fright you had declared, you had lost your watch, who gave notice then? - As soon as ever I said, I had found my watch, the prisoner said, here, here, come and help and search this man, he says, I have stole his watch; no, says I, I have it; then when the man threatened me so, I took it out of my waistcoat pocket, and he laid hold of me by the throat, and with the other hand snatched it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you now in place? - I lost my place on that account.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was you quite sober when they picked you up in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any gin? - There was one quartern of gin, and two pots of porter.</p>
               <p>And you felt yourself quite sober? - Quite so, I went to the watch-house, and gave a description of the room, and the bed.</p>
               <p>Jury to Officer. You saw the prosecutor at the watch-house, did he appear to be perfectly sober? - He seemed to be rather flurried, but by no means in liquor, he gave us a particular description of the room, a hole in the window, and the bed on the right hand.</p>

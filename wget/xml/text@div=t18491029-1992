On 15th Sept., about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners in Bow-road—I followed them into the Canal-road—I saw them go into a marine-store shop—they both took some lead from their pockets and put it into the scale—I went in and asked where they got it from—Holbrook said, "We got it from Bow"—I said, "I know where you came from; you will go with me"—I took the lead out of the scale—they came with me to the Bow-road, and then Beddick said, "I am not going any further with you," and ran away, when we came</p>

(The prisoners received good characters.)</p>

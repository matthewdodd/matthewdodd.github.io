                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Foreign Office of the Post Office; the prisoner was one of the Presidents of that office, and had the control over the inferior officers. I received instructions respecting the prisoner, which made my attention to him more exact, and my memory more accurate—letters received at the receiving-houses, in different parts of the town, for inland and foreign delivery, are made up in bags for the evening, to he delivered at the Post Office—it often happens that Colonial letters are put into the foreign instead of the inland bags—(<hi rend="italic">the evi<lb></lb>dence given by the witness in the former case, page 1016, as to the routine of business at the Post Office, was here read to him, which he confirmed</hi>.)—when letters come by mistake into the Foreign Office, they are sent to the Inland Office, by a tunnel, with the money—the money ought not to come into the hands of the President—he ought to send the letters by a messenger to the bag-clerk—that is the usual course of the office—the prisoner had been in the habit of coming himself, in<lb></lb>stead of sending a messenger, to get the money—I had been spoken to to pay particular attention to Mr. Barnes—on Wednesday evening, the 2nd of March, I was on duty as window-clerk—I came on duty between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and remained on duty all day till half-past seven—the prisoner came to me, about a quarter before five o'clock, with three letters, which he said were to go</p>

(looking at a letter)—I believe this is the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. letter, as far as I can state—it has a penny-post mark on it, which is another thing which made me notice it—it was a busy might at the office; but at the time he brought me the letters I was not doing any thing at all—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he came about five minutes after, and brought two newspapers, which he said were going to the Mauritius and Madras—he got 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—he came again be-seven and eight o'clock, and asked me for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a letter which was to go into the Inland Office—I think he mentioned that it was to go to Nova Soctia✗—I told him, as I had not a letter agreeing with the amount 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he must go to the examiner of the bags, Mr. James—a Nova Scotia letter would property go to the inland office—I was present on Saturday, the 5th of March, at Mr. Peacock's office, when the prisoner was examined—Mr. Peacock came down to the Foreign Office, and he went up with him—Mr. Peacock asked him whether he had forwarded letters which he had been in the habit of coming for the postage for to the Inland Office—he said, "Yes, of course"—he was asked if he had any letters in his drawer—he said, "No"—he was asked if he had any about his person—he said, "No"—when he was told he would be searched, he acknowledged that he had some in his drawer—he was told by the solicitor it would be necessary to hare his person and drawer searched; and he said, a short time afterwards, "Now you ask me particularly, I recollect I have four or five letters in my drawer'—he never said he had any about him that I recollect—two foreign letters were found on his person.</p>

PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a clerk in the Post Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three years and a half—I am very conver<lb></lb>sant with the general routine of the Post Office duties—I expect to rise. as we are in the habit of doing, as vacancies occur—when a President is re<lb></lb>moved, I come rather near the presidency—Mr. Barnes's situation pro<lb></lb>duced him about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, I rather think—he has always been consi<lb></lb>dered a very able, intelligent gentleman, and an excellent officer, knowing the duties of the Post Office very well—but not performing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to tell us this gentleman was not active, able offi<lb></lb>cer who performed his duties well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do—I have been frequently with him in the office—it was his business to superintend my conduct—it does not occur to me not to make mistakes—the duties are not extremely intricate—it requires no skill or experience at all to make up bun<lb></lb>dles of letters—it requires to he done with great expedition on busy days—the business ought all to be completed by twelve o'clock—Mr. Barnes has assisted the junior clerks on busy nights—in doing so, he has undoubtedly done more than his own personal duty—it is the usual way to sent the money through the hands of a messenger with the letters to go to the Inland Office—it is the usual and proper way with a president—when Mr. Barnes did it, it would alleviate the duty of the messenger—Mr. Barnes would be entitled to transfer the money he receives for the postage through the tunnel by the hand of a messenger—he was not compelled to carry them to the tunnel himself—if I had been disengaged I would have done it, if he had asked me—we are all together in the office, but not pro<lb></lb>miscously—the messengers are on one side, and the clerks on the other—there are fire places in the office, round one of which we(the clerks) gather, and the messengers round the other—the President and clerks mix round the fire—the messengers are in the habit of stirring our fire—the messen<lb></lb>gers are not allowed to come and sit with us—they come when we send for them—I do not know whether the President gives security to the Crown for the situation he holds—I am in the habit of attending the window, but I am not called the window clerk—it I a term used among us—there are seven of us altogether—Mr. Barnes may have sent the money to the tun<lb></lb>nel by any of the inferior clerks—probably if he had asked a President he would not have objected; hut there being only one President on duty, he could not ask him—there are two Presidents, and a superintending Presi<lb></lb>dent in the office—there are sixteen clerks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now you say Mr. Barnes was in the habit of coming to you for these letters, did you ever refuse him on any occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—the usual course is to send a messenger—I could not object to Mr. Barnes having the money and letters from me—he might think proper to send the messenger to the tunnel—my business finished about thirty five minutes after seven o'clock, on the 2nd of March—I think Mr. Barnes finished about eight o'clock—I can say it is before twelve o'clock—his duty would finish at eleven o'clock—that was the time of their leaving every night, except post nights—that is the time they are authorized to leave—on Tuesdays sad Fridays they are sometimes there till after twelve o'clock—he is not obliged to sleep at the Post Office on Tuesdays and Fridays—I cannot tell whether he slept there on the Wednesday night—there is a bed room and sitting room on purpose for the President—I believe Mr. Barnes has a wife and family, and a house in the country—I know he has been in the habit of sleeping at the Post Office on busy night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Mr. Barnes came to you for the letters, he came at a time when you were particularly at leisure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when I had no<lb></lb>thing to do at all—I was not employed on any thing at the time—my at<lb></lb>tention was not then drawn by any important office business—that did not give me an opportunity of examining the letters particularly—I could have done it—he came to me the second time about five minutes after—he might have come at a time when I was more fully employed; and he did so, between seven and eight o'clock—he was first asked in the So<lb></lb>licitor's Office whether he had forwarded the letters he had been in the habit of receiving the postage on—I was asked at Bow street what he said at Mr. Peacock's office—I do not think I made the same statement on that occasion—I answered the questions that were asked me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>five to eight o'clock to send the letters through the tunnel—i said nothing to him about receiving letters out of the usual course, because I had no bu<lb></lb>siness to interfere with a superior officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose the President had sent the messenger to the bag-man, and the bagman had received the money and the letter, what would be the messenger's duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would take it, with the money, to the tunnel, and put it into the box to be conveyed over—that is the usual course—he would leave the foreign letter with Mr. Barnes, and take the money and inland letters to the tunnel—it would be the messenger's duty to take the money and the inland letter to the tunnel—he might or might not have to carry the foreign letter, it might be handed to him by the bagman himself—he might take the foreign letter to the President.</p>

I was present at the Post Office when the prisoner was examined by Mr. Peacock—Mr. Peacock asked him if he had any letters in his drawer—(that was the first question I heard; I was not present at first)—he said he would tell the truth—I had not gone into the room till some after the prisoner was there—I found these letter in his drawer—(<hi rend="italic">producing the same letter as on the former trial</hi>.)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is any part of that money lent to the junior clerks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been, though that is at his own risk—he is answerable for it—I have myself bor<lb></lb>rowed some of that money, for my own purpose—it is borrowed by the senior as well as by the junior—Mr. Barnes himself has borrowed it.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner being called upon for his defence, contended that by the 5th and 6th William IV, caput 25, sects. 8, 17, 28, and 24, he was authorised to exercise a discretionary power in the mode of transmitting letters—that on the night in question several addition mails required to be made up, which caused an immense pressure of business, and induced him to render his assistance in those inferior departments which his duty not require—that on retiring to bed, after every lock in the office was secured, he ob<lb></lb>served that two single letters were left, out, which were of no consequences, there being no postage on them, they being directed for ordinary seaman—he placed them in his pocket, for security, till the morning—that if the money, stated by the witnesses as paid to him, ever came into his hands, he must have forwarded it with letters to the Inland-office—he further stated, that the junior clerks had an interest in his removal, as they would thereby be advanced—and contended that it must be evident he should never have had the folly or madness to risk his situation of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, after twenty-seven years service, as well as his character and the interests of his wife and family, for so paltry a sum.

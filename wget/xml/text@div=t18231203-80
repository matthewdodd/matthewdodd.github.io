I was opposite, and saw her go into the shop - she stayed there five minutes - whether she was talking to Barker, or the figure, I cannot say. I saw him move his hand, to desire her to go out, but she still stood there - he pushed her out. I cannot say whether it was with violence. I saw her fall, and immediately went away, as she shut her eyes. I thought her much hurt, and was frightened.</p>

            . I live at Ratcliffe-cross. I saw the deceased on the ground. Barker was inside his shop - the woman was not crying. I went to her and said "Good-woman, get up," she said, "I cannot, for my leg is smashed." I said, "Nonsense, get up, and go home" - she said, "I cannot, for the man has smashed my leg." Two of Barker's men came out, and said, "Where is your home," he said, "Heaven, when I get there," - they said, "We will take you there" - they took her up, and the blood issued from her leg. Spooner, the beadle, met her, they said they were going to take her to Market-hill, till she was sober - he said, "Take her to the wooden-bridge," which they did; it is just by. Spooner fetched a medical man - she was taken to the Hospital.</p>

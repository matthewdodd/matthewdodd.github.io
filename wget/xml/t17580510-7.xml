After that I was informed that the prisoner flashed away with new cloaths; I described some of the aprons I lost, my friend's name is Robertson that informed me of this, and came and shewed me an apron which I said was mine; I went with her; I met the prisoner in the street, she had an apron on much like one of mine, but I would not swear to it, there being a darn in it, and I do not know that mine had a darn in it, Mrs. Robertson had an apron which I knew to be mine; (producing one) this is it.</p>

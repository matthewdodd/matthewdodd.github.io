                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Joshua Gill, a warehouseman, of Coleman-street, Surrey-place, Camberwell—on Saturday night, 21st May, about twenty minutes past 9 o'clock, I was in my kitchen, and I heard a noise in my front parlour—I had been in that parlour about five minutes before 9 o'clock, and left the windows fastened—my husband had fastened them—I did not go into that parlour after I beard the noise till about 11 o'clock the next morning—I then missed my cloak, my shawl, and vic<lb></lb>torine</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185906130100"></xptr>
               <p>—the window had been fastened with a hasp in the middle—the constable came to my house on the Sunday afternoon, and he opened the window with a knife and made the hasp go back—he made a noise which I could swear to as a similar noise to that I had heard on the Saturday night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How do you know when the robbery was done, whether that night or the next morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only speak to it by the noise—when I went into the room the next day, the window was a little way open.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 299). I went to the house on the Sun<lb></lb>day—I observed the state of the window—the fastening had been removed by some instrument, apparently by a knife—I had seen the prisoner on the Saturday night, about twenty-five minutes after 9 o'clock—he was within about thirty yards of Mrs. Gill's—he, was coming from the house—he appeared to me to be very bulky—I saw him on the Sunday in Camden-street, Walworth—I said to him, "Where were you last night at twenty-five minutes past 9 o'clock?"—he said, "I was in Bermondsey"—I said, "Who was with you?"—he said, "I was by myself"—I then told him I should take him in custody on suspicion of being concerned in a robbery in Coleman-street the night previous—I took him, and found in the breast pocket of his coat this pipe and case, and a number of lucifer matches—I found on the Sunday three lucifer matches outside Mrs. Gill's window—two of them had been lighted, and one had not—I am sure about the time I had seen him on the Saturday night—I had left at the usual time—I leave to go on duty—I had about a quarter of an hour to walk—he was then feeling first in his great-coat pockets, and then in his other pockets—I said to him on Sunday, "What were you so busy in feeling in your pockets for?"—he said, "For my handkerchief"—I have known him since 1856.</p>

             Robson, a carpenter - we live at No. 370, in the Strand. I know the prisoner; he came to my house in March, and brought a small parcel, tied in paper, and told me to take particular care of it, till he either came or sent for it - he did not say what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect, you have been examined before - do you mean to say he did not tell you what the parcel was? A. No, Sir; he did not tell me it was tickets - I kept the parcel by me until two young ladies were sent for it; it might he about the size of the parcel produced (the duplicates) - I never opened it; when the Police-officer came I did not like to deliver them up, without Mr. Robson's leave, and I put them in the coal-cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put them when the prisoner gave them to you? A. In the coal-cellar; I had workmen in the house, and did not wish them to know where they where - I took the Police-officer into the cellar, and he found the parcel I had received; I saw they were duplicates when he opened it - about a fortnight after I received them from the prisoner, Maria Rossan brought me a note, in the prisoner's hand-writing; this might be about a fortnight before the officer came - I had them three weeks or a month; I do not know what I have done with the note - I have destroyed it; the note directed me to deliver the parcel to Rossan, which I did, and three or four days after I received it again; I believe it was the same - it was delivered to me at the door, in a bit of brown paper - there was a cloth about it at first, but I did not take particular notice of it then; the Police-officer came three days after that, I believe - I did not tell him they were tickets; he came and asked me for the tickets - I said I would not deliver them up to him, as I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050082"></xptr>know him, but I would go the station, and give them up to Mr. Thomas, the superintendant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it to the station? A. No - I delivered it to the Policeman from the cellar; I did not put it into the cellar till after I received it back from Rossan - I cannot say it was the same as I had from the prisoner; it might he in the cellar about a week - nobody had any access to the cellar; it was the only place I had where nobody came -I put it into a box when I first received it, and then into the cellar, as there was no lock on the box - there was a lock to the cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell where the parcel came from? A. I cannot - my husband is not here.</p>

            . I am book-keeper to an ironfounder, and live in Robinson's-row. I have known the prisoner several years - on the morning he was apprehended I went to Bow-street, and saw him; I saw him a day or two after, at the New prison, Clerkenwell - I said I was sorry for his situation, and asked him the charge; he said it was a charge of robbing or plundering a house in Highbury-place - I did not hold out any promise or threat to him; I asked him what had become of the property - he said he believed it was pledged; I then asked if he could get the duplicates - he said he thought they could be got, or that he could get them; I told him he had better let me have them - he said, "Very well;" I was at the office at his next examination - I saw Rossan about a week after, and I had seen her before at the house she resided at, in Upper Stamford-street, Blackfriars - the prisoner requested me to call on her to send him a shawl and a night-cap; I told her poor George was in gaol, and she was astonished - he told me to tell her so; when she was at the office, she delivered me a square parcel, about that size - I think it had a piece of silk over it; it was wrapped in something - I opened it after I left the office, and it contained forty-nine duplicates; I immediately went over to Rossan, to return them to her - I only looked at them casually, and cannot tell any of the pawnbrokers' names; I went to Clerkenwell to the prisoner, the next day, or the day after - I wrote on a scrap of paper, that I had returned Rossan the duplicates, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ascertain from the prisoner that a man named Robins occasionally slept in the house when he was absent? A. I think he did say so - I cannot say whether he said it was when he was absent; I do not know that Robins has absconded - the prisoner was on a station at Kingsland for four or five months, in the new Police.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he dismissed from the Police? A. I believe he was: I had applied to the superintendent for leave of absence for him, and he did not return.</p>

I saw it on the table -Franklin had it open; I was at the other end of the room: I cannot say what it contained, for I did not look at it - it was like small cards; I cannot say whether they were like duplicates - I did not look at them; I saw Franklin tie it up; he then returned it to me - I cannot tell what they were: I saw they were small cards when he opened them, but not when he tied them up; I put them into a cupboard - a man afterwards came to me for them, and I delivered them to him; I am certain I delivered him the same parcel, in consequence of his telling me who he came from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know that the prisoner had a brother named Robins? A. No; I know a man of that name - he was an inmate of the prosecutrix's house: he has absconded since this charge; he was very near the prisoner's height, and of the same complexion - one might easily be mistaken for the other.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Pray have you been with the prisoner's attorney this morning? A. No - yes, I have been with him this morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know Robins has absconded? did you know where he lived? A. No - he has left Miss Hog's house; I have been at Miss Hog's while the prisoner and his wife were there; I understand from the prisoner that Robins has absconded.</p>
               <p>MRS. GIRTON. I am married, and live in Hornsey-road- I am an acquaintance of Miss Hog's. I have seen Robins, but do not think I should know him; I was in the habit of going to Miss Hog's house very frequently during her absence: after the prisoner was discharged from the New Police, he had another situation at the Milbank Penitentiary - he came to live at Miss Hog's house for good about July, and after that I never saw Robins there: I saw the prisoner at the house on the 17th of January, the day before Miss Hog returned - I had been there all day; he went out between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and I waited till twelve o'clock, as I was astonished at his leaving; I had told him before he went out that I wanted his assistance - be did not return; I met a Policeman in Highbury-place, and desired him to watch the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you happen to know that the prisoner was looking about for Robins? A. I cannot possibly say that; I went to Miss Hog's house on an average twice a week during her absence.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You told the prisoner you wanted him that evening at the house? A. I did; I had sent him on an errand to the end of Highbury-place, and expected him home in half an hour; his wife was in the house.</p>

            . I am beadle of Highbury-place. I know the prisoner; I have seen him come out of Miss Hog's house most mornings - he sometimes had a blue bag or a green bag, with books, and sometimes parcels - he very frequently came out with a bag, which appeared to contain something.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the night of the 17th of January I was desired by my serjeant to watch Miss Hog's house, and saw the prisoner come home at two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>MRS. GIRTON. Robins left in July, as I understand - I did not see him there after July, and the prisoner told me he was gone; when Miss Hog returned I asked the prisoner when he had seen Robins, and he said not for some months, as he had discharged him finally when he left the Penitentiary.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 17th Mrs. Girton desired me to go to Mr. Roe, the chemist, to inquire after Miss Hog's late servant; it struck eight o'clock when I came out of Roe's house, and then I went in search of Robins.</p>

            . I am a barrister, and have a situation in the Tower. I have known the prisoner ten or eleven years, and believe him a well conducted man.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is he a relation of yours? A. No- he is connected with me by marriage; he is my brother-in-law, and his family are very respectable; he did not bring any knives and forks, with silver ferrules, to my house, not to my knowledge - I saw some in my house; they were not mine, and I sent them back - I spoke to the prisoner about them; I cannot say whether he had brought them, or that Robins did - I had been abroad, and my own property had not returned from the continent, and I was going to have a party, which was the cause of their being there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen Robins? A. Very often - I forbid his coming to my house; I have not seen him since the prisoner has been in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner say who had brought the knives there? A. It is floating in my recollection that he said either he or Robins brought them; the prisoner was at my house almost every day for a fortnight before he was apprehended - he told me he was constantly looking after Robins.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you give the prisoner 1s. 6d. to get the knives repaired? A. I did not myself: I directed it to be given him to get them cleaned; Mr Girton called on me, and the prisoner called the next day - and I sent to Mr. Girton that he had an opportunity of bringing a Policeman if he thought fit, and next day he went with me to Miss Hog's; the prisoner remained outside the door while we went in, and when we came out he was waiting -Mr. Girton prohibited his going in, on account of Miss Hog's nerves.</p>

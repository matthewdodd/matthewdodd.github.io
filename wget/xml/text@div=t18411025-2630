                  </hi>. I am a gate-keeper at the St. Katharine Dock. On Saturday morning last, at half-past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the A warehouse, in the Docks, in which there is deposited hundreds of casks of tallow—he came to No. 1. gate, and came out close by the warehouse, with this bag—he produced me a pass of samples of tallow—I said, "What have you there?"—he said, "Samples of tallow"—I said, "Just let me look in the bag"—samples are taken from the Dock in this form—(<hi rend="italic">producing some</hi>)—he put the bag down, and seemed <hi rend="italic">fumbling</hi> a great deal about it—I took him into my box, and found five lumps of tallow in the bag, which altogether weigh 20lbs. —I said, "You don't call this a sample?" taking one—he said, "Yes"—I then looked into the bag, and found five others—he begged I would forgive him, look over it, and allow him to take it back—I took him then to the superior officer—he offered to give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if I would let him take it back.</p>

I am a Russia broker, carrying on business in Old Broad-street—the prisoner was my clerk for about six weeks—it was part of his duty to take samples of tallow from the Dock—I did not give him directions on the Saturday previous to this to get samples—I did two or three days before he had brought them—on the evening of the 15th of October I had given him instructions to go on board a ship to get samples, but he had no orders to go to the Docks—he might have gone—these are nothing like samples of tallow—this is an order which he had to take on board the <hi rend="italic">British Oak</hi>—he did not get them—I find he could not have executed that order.</p>

I am assistant to Wynn Ellis, and another, warehousemen, of St. Paul's-churchyard—on 6th May, about 12 o'clock, the prisoners came into the warehouse—the male prisoner very indistinctly, and in broken English, asked to look at some velvets at about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard, and said he could buy thirteen or fourteen pieces—there are from thirty to forty yards in a piece—I took them upstairs to the velvet-room—they stood at the counter—I showed them some velvets at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per yard—he put one piece aside as if bought, and asked me what quantity I could sell at that price—I told him about thirty pieces—Mr. Allen, the manager, then came up and charged the female prisoner with having concealed about her a piece of silk—she muttered something—he shook her slightly and lifted her arm up, and I saw this piece of silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) fall from under her dress—it is the property of Wynn Ellis, and Co., and is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are twenty-eight yards—the male prisoner picked it up, and Mr. Allen took it from him—I had not sold it or shown it to the prisoners—I did not know that they had taken it from the counter—I know it by the pattern.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to the prosecutors—about 12, on last Monday morning; I saw the prisoners go into the velvet-room with Mr. Pilman—I kept my eye on them—I began pulling some goods about so that they should not suspect me—I saw one of the men hand a piece of silk to the male prisoner, who handed it to the female prisoner—she took it to another counter, and took another piece up which she held up as a cover—the piece of silk which she took from the other counter was the piece which she took—Pitman was at that time showing the male prisoner another piece of silk—I saw the female prisoner slip the silk under her arm, and I ran and told Mr. Allen, who came up, I was not near enough to see what he did; but when I came back I saw the piece of silk on the floor, though I did not see it fell—I went for a policeman; he came, and Mr. Allen said, "Take this woman in custody"—this is the piece of silk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to the prosecutors—last Monday morning, at 12 o'clock, Mr. Hall sent for me to the velvet-room, and told me, in the prisoners' presence, that the woman had taken a piece of silk—I said, "Fetch a policeman"—I took hold of the woman by the shoulders, and said, "Have the kindness to step round this way"—she stepped back, and a piece of silk fell from her clothes—I took it up—it was quite warm—this is it—I sent them both to the station.</p>

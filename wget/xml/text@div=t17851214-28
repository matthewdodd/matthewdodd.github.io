               <p>The 28th of November, I was standing in the <placeName id="t17851214-28-crimeloc154">Court of King's Bench</placeName>

About five minutes after the prisoner was brought out of the Court by the prosecutor on the next indictment, I put my hand in his pocket, and pulled out several handkerchiefs, and among the rest, my own handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Have you seen him since you was in Court? - I saw him close to me in Court, but I did not take the least notice of him; he was brought into Court, and I was bound over to prosecute him, the handkerchief I have here is my handkerchief, I bought it at a sale, it is marked with an E.</p>
               <p>What is the value of that handkerchief? - They have laid the value at 2 s. but I do not think it worth so much.</p>
               <p>How much value do you put upon it? - I do not think it worth above 8 d. or 9 d. the prisoner's wife called at my house with two children, and told me her husband had a good character, I took the trouble, and went to enquire at different places in the neighbourhood, and he had a very good character.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner in Westminster Hall, and in a minute my handkerchief was picked out of my pocket, I came out of Court, went in again, and I saw him picking another gentleman's pocket; seeing him do that, I took him by the collar, and hauled him out from under the green curtains; and I said, if you picked that gentleman's pocket, you picked mine;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140053"></xptr> I wanted to go away and get my handkerchief, which was in his pocket, with three or four more, and I was hauled into Court to prosecute this man.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I had been at work all day, and carried home a pair of shoes, and I went into the Hall, and there was a croud, and I went to see what was the matter, and the handkerchiefs were all strewed about the Hall, and I picked up some.</p>

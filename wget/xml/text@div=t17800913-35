On Friday night, the 1st of September, between eleven and twelve at night, the prisoner came in for a bed; I went to call the chamber-maid, and when I returned I missed my handkerchief off the kitchen-dresser; the prisoner was gone out again, and got half-way up the gateway. I followed him, and called out, Stop him! and he was brought back into the kitchen; my handkerchief was found on the second step of the stairs, in the yard, where he was to go up to bed; he was brought back by those stairs my young mistress was in the kitchen, and saw him take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep lodgings at No. 17, Mitre-court, Lambeth. On the 24th of December the prisoner came to lodge with me; Henry Taylor came with him, and he took the apartment—the prisoner and Taylor passed as brothers, and had one room; they slept together in one bed—they did not always sleep at home—there was a box in which they kept their clothes—I sometimes went in their room—on one occasion, about a week or rather more</p>

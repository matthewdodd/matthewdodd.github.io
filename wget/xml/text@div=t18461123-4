                  </hi>. I live at No. 13, John-street, Adelphi, and am a surgeon.—I took the prisoner into my service. On Monday, the 12th of Oct., I went out about twelve o'clock in the day, and left him in full charge of the premises—I returned in about an hour and a half, and found the door locked fast—I had to pay a person to get in at the window—when I got in the prisoner was gone—he had been in my service about ten weeks—I went to my bedroom where I had a press in the wall—I had the key of it in my pocket—I found the press locked as I had left it—I opened it, and examined my cash-box, which was on a shelf—I found that all the money that was in it was gone—ten sovereigns and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the cash-box had been folded in a piece of paper, and tied—the paper was off, and was broken open—it had no lock or key, but merely to drop the sovereigns into a hole at the top—the bottom of the cash-box was broken out—I am quite sure I had this money in the cash-box—I had seen it perhaps forty-eight hours before—when I took the prisoner he had no money—I gave him no wages, but told him I would take him on trial—I found him in St. James's Park—he made up to me, begging—I took him to the baker's shop, and gave him a loaf, and took him into my service out of pity—the money in the box was mine—there are two different presses in two rooms in my house, and the key of one will open the other—the key of the other was left at home concealed on a mantel-piece—when I came back the key was moved—when I missed the money I ran into the kitchen to see whether the prisoner had taken his own trunk, and it was gone—I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police at Bath. On the 29th of Oct. I apprehended the prisoner in Bath—I asked him if his name was Henry Grant—he said it was—I asked him if he had been living in London—he said he had some time ago—I asked if he knew a gentleman named Adamson—he said, "No, I know no such gentleman"—I asked him if he was sure he had not been living as servant with Mr. Adamson—he said, "No"—I then said I was an inspector of police, and charged him with having robbed his master, Mr. Adamson, of ten sovereigns and a 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I took him to the station and read him the advertisement in the "Hue and Cry"—he then said, "I did live servant with him, but he did not give me any wages"—I found nothing on him, but I afterwards took from his person a new coat, a new black satin waistcoat, a new scarf, and a new pair of trowsers—he did not tell me why he left Mr. Adamson.</p>

                  </hi> I am master of the <hi rend="italic">Duchess of Kent</hi> steamer, which is in the Thames. On the night of the 31st of Jan. I was in the street, and was accosted by the prisoner—I do not know the name of the place—I believe I gave her a glass or two of brandy—we then went on to where a chain was extended across a dark place—she put me backward till the chain came about the back of my knees—I fell backwards—she forced her hand into my pocket, and took out my purse, which contained two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and eight sovereigns—as soon as I could recover myself I said "You have robbed me"—I saw a policeman, and said, "That girl has robbed me, take her"—he took her, and found the property on her.</p>

               <p>about at half-past two o'clock in the morning, on the 1st of Feb.—they were going in the direction of Crutched Friars—there is a chain across at the end of the India Company's warehouse—I heard a noise, and went there—I saw the prosecutor nearly on his back—the prisoner was in the act of trying to get from him—I asked if he had lost anything—he paused a minute or two and said, "I have lost my purse"—I followed the prisoner, who had then got a few yards from him—I took hold of her left band, and found she held it very tightly closed—I said, "Have you got this man's purse?"—she denied having it—I said, "If you have got it you had better acknowledge it"—she denied having it at all—I could see she had got either shillings or sovereigns in her right hand—I felt something which I fancied was the purse in her left hand—I pulled her hand open and took the purse from it—there were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. otes in it, and in her right hand were seven sovereigns, and one sovereign was wrapped up in the notes in the purse.</p>

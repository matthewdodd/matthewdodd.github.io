                  </hi>. I keep the Robart's Arms. About ten minutes past ten on the 22nd of Feb., I missed a coat from my private parlour—I had it in my hand the same evening—the prisoner has been in the habit of using the house—I went to look after him, but did not find him—he came to by house, and gave himself up—he said he knew nothing of the coat—there was a person named Welch there, who gave me information—I said if they would give me intelligence where the coat was I would take it out and forgive them—I have not found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and live with the prosecutor, at the Robart's Arms. On the night of the 22nd, the prisoner came into the tap-room—my master went into the parlour with a glass of rum-and-water—the prisoner came to me at the bar, and asked if I had nothing to give him—I asked what he meant—he put his head in the bar parlour, and saw my master's coat on the sofa—he said, "Can't you give me this?"—I said "I could not think of such a thing"—he said, "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if you will say nothing about it, and say it was an engineer in the skittle-ground that took it, and he had red whiskers"—I said I could not think of such a thing, and he said, "If you say anything I will have your life"—he took the coat on his arm and ran out—I ran after him, and told him three times to come back—he did not—I was afraid to tell my master.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your master has lost a great number of things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I was not in his employ at that time, I was at sea—he lost some bagatelle balls while I was at home—I have heard of nothing else—there was only master in the house on this evening—the parlour my master was in is about a yard from the back parlour—I was afraid to call him, because the prisoner threatened my life—I followed him out of the door to the entrance of the fields, and there I lost sight of him—no one heard me call out—I told my master I had seen the prisoner take the coat, because he suspected me—my mistress and her niece were up stairs at the time.</p>

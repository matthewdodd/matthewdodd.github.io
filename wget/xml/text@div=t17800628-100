I read the riot act at about half after three; I saw the prisoner with people, some of whom had bottles and bowls of liquor, which I imagined they got from Lord Mansfield's house, endeavouring to make the soldiers drunk; the mob was very violent; in order to keep them off from the soldiers it was thought necessary to order the soldiers to charge their bayonets; the men were drawn up from the corner of the iron rails which surrounded the grass, to the Duke of Bedford's wall; the prisoner was then with other people near the watch-house; the mob were very troublesome, and endeavoured to force the lines, but they were repulsed by the soldiers. I then went up to the prisoner and spoke to him, knowing the livery; I saw he was in liquor; I desired him to go home, and told him I was very certain Sir

He attempted to break through the rank a second time after that, whether he succeeded or not I cannot say. It was not his way home to break through the ranks, because his way home was either by the Archbishop of York's house, or he might have gone down a little street which comes from Southampton-row, and King-street.</p>

               <p>Could he have gone by the archbishop's house? - Yes, that was left open. After I had done that I went to the Secretary of State's office, and saw Mr. Frazier; I told Mr. Frazier I was very sorry that there were so many servants concerned in that riot, amongst which I mentioned that I had seen a servant of Sir Thomas Sewell's.</p>
               <p>What was the part which the prisoner seemed to take? - He seemed to be animating the mob.</p>
               <p>During the time you saw the prisoner there, what were the rest of the mob doing? - Behaving very violent, ballooing, crying No Popery! throwing stones and glass bottles. One of the privates of the guards was wounded exceedingly, and Mr. Lowton was wounded with a glass bottle; the mob were then pulling down Lord Mansfield's house and burning the furniture.</p>

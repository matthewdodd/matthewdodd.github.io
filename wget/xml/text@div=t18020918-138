             sworn. - I keep a cloathscellar, in Monmouth-street; I bought the handkerchief of the prisoner, who was a stranger to me: On the 5th of this month, between five and six o'clock in the evening, she came to my cellar, with two phials in her hand, and asked me if I would buy an old shirt, for that her husband was just come out of the hospital, that his thigh was broke in two places, and she was forely distressed, and had no other means of buying stuff for him; she said, she was also very ill with the complaint that was going about, and that it would be a charity to buy it out of compassion more than any thing; I agreed to give her two shillings for the shirt and handkerchief; the handkerchief, she said, was of no value; I got change, and paid her in the street; next day, the prosecutor's wife came and asked me the price of a new shirt; I told her, I had a dirty one down stairs, if she would look at it, it might answer her purpose as well; she came down stairs, and after looking at them, said, if they both belonged to me, she would bring her husband and buy them; accordingly, by and by her husband came, with another man; he seemed to own the shirt, but did not tell me directly; he seemed all of a slurry; at last, he told me it was his; I said, it he would lend for a constable, I would deliver it up; I described the woman to him, and he knew her to live in the house with him; I gave the shirt to the constable, and went and shewed him the thief.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the shirt and handkerchief you gave up, are the same you received from the prisoner? - A. The very same, and I am sure I had them of the prisoner.</p>

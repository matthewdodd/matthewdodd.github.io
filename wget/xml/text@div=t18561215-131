                  </hi>. I live at No. 20, Gloucester-street, Queen's-square, and am a clerk. Last Sunday morning, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was going up Holborn—three women accosted me between Fetter-lane and Turnstile—the prisoner was, one of them—they came against me and pushed me—I wished them to leave me—I passed on through Middle-row and past Chancery lane—one of the women passed me, and the prisoner struck me on the left cheek—the blow felled me to the ground, and she fell upon me—she kneeled on me and commenced riffing my waistcoat pocket—this is the waistcoat, which is torn—I had in that pocket a penknife and 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—I was not on the ground two seconds before the policeman came and seized the prisoner and lifted her from me—I am sure the prisoner is the woman—this watch was in my pocket—this is my knife.</p>

Last Sunday morning, at a quarter past 1 o'clock, I was in Holborn, on the opposite side to where the prisoner and the prosecutor were—I saw the prosecutor fall to the ground, and the prisoner fell on the top of him—I ran across and saw the prisoner's hand in his waistcoat pocket—I caught her hand, and took this penknife and two pence from her hand; and one penny I picked up on the pavement—the prosecutor gave the prisoner into custody, and I took her to the station—the prosecutor was rather the worse for liquor, but could walk very well, and seemed to know what he was doing—the prisoner was not in liquor.</p>

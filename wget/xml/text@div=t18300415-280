            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in Charles-street between twelve and one o'clock; I heard a noise in Fludyer-street, and proceeded to the spot; I found Crane tussling with Graves - Crane said he had come out of the area, and that there was another man in the area; I got a light, went down into the area, and found Bennett in the coal-hole - I asked him what he did there; he said some one had thrown his hat over - I found a skeleton-key on his person; in the corner where he was concealed there were several other keys, a chisel, a small crow-bar, the handle of a centre-bit, and several other skeleton-keys, which I gave up to Prior.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. HEATON. Q. He made no resistance? A. No, he seemed very much dejected.</p>

            . On Thursday night I went to Fludyer-street and found Bennett in custody; I went down the area - the kitchen window was lifted up, the pannel of the inside shutter bored throught with a centre-bit, and this piece and this small piece of the pannel were lying in the area; I fitted them into the pannel - I afterwards got the centre-bit and fitted it to some of the holes which had been bored; they agreed with it - after going inside the kitchen this blade of a knife was picked up, in my presence, by an officer, who is not here; I have compared it with the handle found upon Graves - they correspond exactly; the blade had been put through the hole, and I suppose snapped off, and fell inside - the impression on the shutter exactly corresponded with the crow-bar; the space between the inside of the window and the shutter I should suppose is not above two or three inches.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the kitchen under the house? A. Yes; the coal-hole is under the street - I did not find the centre-bit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Graves. Q. Where was the blade of the knife found? A. On the ledge under the window; I never said it was found on the table - I said I was near the table when it was picked up.</p>
               <p>MR. HYNDMAN. I was in bed, and was alarmed by the Police knocking at my door; I believe I went to bed last- I make a practice of going round my house before I go to bed; the shutters were fastened with a bar - the window sash, I believe was not fastened; there is a catch to it, but it is so stiff it is useless - I have no doubt the sash was down that night, but I did not examine that; it is the cook's business to fasten the window - she is not here; it might have been partly up for what I know.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATON. Q. At what hour did you go round the house? A. I think about half-past eleven o'clock - I had a light in my hand, and can say the shutters were whole; I distinctly remember there was no appearance of violence on the shutter.</p>

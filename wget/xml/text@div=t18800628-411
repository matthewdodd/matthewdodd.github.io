                  </hi>. I was formerly secretary to the Provincial Banking Corporation, Limited—I was with them seven years, from 1864 to 1871, and was then changed to the London and Provincial Bank, to which I have been secretary from that time—my first knowledge of the prisoner was his coming to the bank as a client on 14th June, 1875—I have an entry in the minute book "Mr. Mitchell appointed at a salary of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to give guarantee of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—his salary was increased the next year to 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in 1877 to 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was accountant at the head office about a year and a half—on 6th March, 1877, I have an entry in the minute book, of which I gave him a copy the same day—it says that "it appears he is not satisfied with his remuneration, therefore the Directors dispense with his services, and pay him three months' salary. He is directed to hand over his keys and books and leave the office this day"—about 10th March I got this letter from George Rose Innes and Son, Mitchell's solicitors.</p>

               <p>two copies of the register of shareholders; he took one away and paid for it, we have the other in the office still—after the printed circular came to the Directors' knowledge an action was commenced against the prisoner in the Equity Division—this is the writ. (<hi rend="italic">Applying for an injure tion to restrain the defendant from further publishing or sending the circular to the shareholders, and to have all copies delivered up to be cancelled.</hi>)—I made an affidavit, but only for the protection of the bank—this restraining order was made on the prisoner on 25th March, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the Order of Court of 7th April—the prisoner then called at the office more than once, and he told me on one occasion that he was going to summon me to the Mansion House for perjury on my affidavit—I said, "Indeed"—the next thing was the leaving of this letter at Munns and Longdon's—my Directors then took up the matter and instructed the solicitor—these letters are in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">One letter, dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th May, from the prisoner to the Directors, stated that he proposed to-morrow to apply for a summons against-Mr. Garden; another, dated</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th May, acknowledged the receipt of the Directors letter, and stated that he had never sought to injure the bank directly or indirectly, that he had sacrificed his time at a low salary to obtain a high salary, and had been disappointed, and would call on the Directors next day; another, dated</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th May, stated that his ante<lb></lb>cedents entitled him to</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">compensation if the Directors dispensed with his services, and that he intended to lay all the facts before the shareholders, as Mr. Garden, by making a perjured affidavit, had brought himself within reach of the law.</hi>)—the order was that of the Directors, not of Mr. Cross—the prisoner only referred to the perjury once when he came to the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You served me with a subpoena on 28th May—when you entered the bank clerks who were detained over<lb></lb>time had a small sum for tea money—Starling and Speed were clerks, and were paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each per night for overtime, but I had not the charge of that department—if you remained late you would be paid the same as the others—the payments to those clerks were made from money under my charge, but I have not brought the books which show it—I swore on 25th March that the allegations, "The bank letters were carelessly kept and the ledgers were in a disgraceful condition," were untrue to the best of my belief—Mr. Samuel G. Fluke was the chief accountant—I did not seo him in a state of hopeless intoxication in June, 1875—he was able to stand upright; he was under the influence of drink to some extent—it is perfectly plain from this letter that money is demanded from mo—you demand 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. compensation—the letters of the 18th and 20th were sub<lb></lb>mitted to the Board—the Directors were there daily, and the Board met on Tuesdays—any one who reads the letter would conclude that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was demanded from the bank for the purpose of withdrawing the charge—there are no imputations against your character in the Directors' letter—the real cause of your being dismissed was that the bank did not appreciate you so highly as you appreciated yourself—I do not remember that on 5th March, the day before the Board meeting, Mr. Cross tried to induce the Board to dispense with your services the next day—I do not know that Mr. Cross and you were on very bad terms—it is evident from your letter that your object was to extort money under a charge of perjury.</p>

               <p>may be fragments of truth in some of the charges, but everything is greatly exaggerated in the circular—all the Directors well knew of his application to inspect private documents at the bank—he also required to inspect the list of shareholders because he had not taken up the copy—he never told me that he had been to the Mansion House on 4th May, and had been refused.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in his Defence, stated that he issued a circular on</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th March</hi>, 1880, <hi rend="italic">describing the condition of the accounts when he came to the bank, and stating tliat he had worked very hard to bring them into the state of efficiency in which they then were, and had then been dismissed suddenly because he asked for a higher salary, which would seriously affect him in obtaining future employment; tliat Mr. Cross, the general manager, had behaved very badly towards him, and he proposed to ask the shareholders whether Mr. Cross was a fit person to be general manager, so as to enlist their sympathy; tliat he had given up an appointment of</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year for</hi> 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year on entering the bank, and therefore regarded the words of the circular as insulting and injurious to him, as from being dismissed summarily, people would imagine that he had committed some very serious offence; that the Directors were a very honorable body of gentlemen anxious to do right, but that they had been led away by Mr. Cross; that he intended to become a shareholder in order to expose Mr. Cross's conduct; that he had no idea of demanding</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">from Mr. Garden, but he believed the Directors would have given him</hi> l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">if they had acted on their own impulses, and even if they did not, his character would have been cleared.</hi>

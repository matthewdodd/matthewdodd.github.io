             told me, they had taken a man that had stole some plate: they had secured Knowland, Knowland threw his bundle away from him, and he ran away; that then Swiney immediately seized him, and Stevens and Lisson came to his assistance; in the interim Knowland defended himself with a pint mug, which he cut Swiney the watchman over the forehead with; upon this, when they told me that there was another that threw away the bundle, and having this pint mug, I desired Stevens and Swiney and Lisson to do their endeavour to take Gray; I told them not to take so great regard of the bundle, but particularly first to try to get the man, expecting that the man would come to that bundle himself, which was the case: he was coming to that bundle again, and then they took him to the watch-house. While they were taking Gray I searched Knowland; in his pocket I found the plate which was first produced, excepting the pint mug, that was not in his pocket; he had a knife, and a tobacco box with tinder in it, afterwards a bag was brought in, in which there were other quantities of plate, and a dark lantern found by the watchman; then the bag was brought and I likewise examined this Gray; they were sealed up before the justice and they have never been unsealed since; this dark lantern, (producing it) was found by the watchman in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110039"></xptr> street; this tobacco box (producing it) which has tinder in it, was found in Knowland's pocket; Knowland had that plate in his pocket; this was in the bag which I was told Gray threw from him; I was not present.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrols: I was coming down Holborn and met Morris, Swiney, and Stevens with the prisoner Knowland; I went up to the watch-house with them, and saw a quantity of plate taken out of his pocket; Swiney said, there was another man that was in company with him that had a large bundle under his arm; we were ordered down Gray's Inn Lane in pursuit of him, I picked up the bundle a little way from Gray's Inn Gate in Gray's Inn Lane; there was a great quantity of plate in a bag, I carried it to the watch-house; the constable examined it, and it proved to be the same arms upon it with that taken out of Knowland's pocket.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of August, going through Gray's Inn Lane at near four in the morning, I had the watchman belonging to that beat along with me, I am one of the patrole; very near Tash Street we met the prisoner Gray; we looked at him, and he looked at us, the watchman said, that was the man that had the bundle or bag under his arm, that went away when he apprehended Knowland; I said, if he was sure of that, we would take him in custody; I asked him where he lodged? he said, in Bloomsbury; when we took him to the watch-house, the constable examined him, and asked him where he lodged in Bloomsbury? he said, he would tell that when he came before the Justice; when he came before the Justice, he told the place where he lodged, and the constable and I went; I think he said it was Gilbert Court, he mentioned the man's name, I think it was Jones, and described particularly the house; the constable and I went there, and the constable made all the enquiry he could, we found no such person lodged there; he was taken about half an hour after Swiney had taken Knowland.</p>
               <p>Another Witness. It was about two hundred yards further up the street from where Knowland was taken that we took Gray; and in two or three yards of that spot we found the cutlass, salt, and dark lantern.</p>

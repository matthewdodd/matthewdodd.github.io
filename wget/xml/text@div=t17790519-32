               <p>Is the house and the hen-roost under one roof? - No; but the hen-roost joins to the house; there is no space between. My wife saw them in the evening. I did not. I was out till about nine o'clock in the morning. My man found them near the stable-door. There were five hens and the cock in a bag; they were dead, but were quite warm; they had been just killed. My man called me, and I got up immediately; he had them in his hand. We found a chissel in the pocket of the prisoner. The door had been forced open with a chissel. The four nails of the lock were drawn. This was between two and three in the morning.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I keep a stage-coach.</p>
               <p>- KIRBY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Dear. On the 17th of April, I came in with my coach at about half after two in the morning. I had been to Ranelagh. I had a little dog with me. As I was coming in he barked, upon which a man came out fromthehen-roost; he shammed drunk. I asked him what he did there. He said he was very drunk, and came in to lie down. As I was turning from him I saw another man come from the stable door, where the fowls lay; upon which I secured him.</p>
               <p>Had he any fowls upon him? - No; I sent for a constable, and took him before a justice of the peace.</p>
               <p>What fowls were there by the stable door? - Five hens and a cock; the hens were all dead, the cock was alive in a sack with them. The constable searched the prisoner in my presence, and found this chissel upon him (producing it). The prisoner said before the justice, that he held the sack whilst the other put the fowls into it.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - He seemed sober.</p>

               <p>I had been in the country, and was coming home in liquor. I got in there, and laid down to sleep. The dog barked, and waked me. I was coming out, and this man laid hold of me. I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>

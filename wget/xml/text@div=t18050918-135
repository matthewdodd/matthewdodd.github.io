               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes, I served one of them with nine weeks milk, and the other with five weeks milk.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any money they gave to you, did you apply to Mr. Wood? - A. I did, and he applied to Mr. Sapwell; I used to get bad money every week of them, and I used to throw it away. Mr. Sapwell told me to keep going on with them, and take notice of the money I received of them, and to mark it. On the 5th of August, they came one after the other as usual, Ann Alen came first; I was then in Smock-alley, she gave me a shilling, she had a pennyworth of milk, and I gave her the change; a little time after, when I came into Artillery-street, she said she liked my milk so much she would have a pennyworth more; then she gave me a sixpence; then Mary Evans came and had a pennyworth of milk, and she gave me a sixpence the same morning, and I gave her the change; they both met at the distance of about thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was first in the afternoon? - A. That I cannot tell, both of them came about one minute after the other; Mary Evans gave me a shilling in the afternoon, and I gave her change, and the other gave me sixpence.</p>

               <p>- PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are employed by the Mint - are these good or bad shillings? - A. They are counterfeit, both of them are new coloured; they have not been in circulation.</p>

               <p>Allen's defence. I went to this man and had a pennyworth of milk from him, and gave him a good shilling, it had a mark in the middle of it, he took his purse out of his pocket and put the shilling into it and looked for a sixpence and gave it me, he put his hand into his side-pocket and gave me five pennyworth of halfpence and thanked me; I went into Petticoat-lane to sell a few old cloaths; I was two hours gone; I was sitting at home, and inadvertently they came and took me prisoner, and he said, the reason why they took me prisoner was, he saw me speak to the other prisoner; I never opened my lips to this woman in my days; if he had produced that shilling he put into his purse, I should have known it, it was a good shilling; I never changed but two shillings with him in my life; he knew as well where I lived as I did myself; he did not come to me directly, but he came two hours and a half afterwards, and took me a prisoner; they distressed me and hurt me very much.</p>
               <p>Evan's defence. I have often been to this man; I went to him on Monday afternoon, I told him I had no occasion to change a shilling; I said to him, you know if you come and have a pennyworth of apples, I need not change this shilling; I never changed with him before Monday; a woman was sick, I went for a pennyworth of milk for her, the woman that sent me gave me the money; immediately I was stopped, I had no more than sixpence and fourpence farthing, which was taken from me.</p>

I am a tailor of King-street, St. James'—the prisoner has worked with me for the last six months—he left me on 25th April; I had no notice of his intention to leave—about an hour after he left I missed a coat and pair of trousers from the room where he worked—about a for<lb></lb>tnight before that I had missed some knives and forks—last Wednesday night I went with an officer to a house in Whitechapel, where I found the prisoner, and in that room 1 found the coat I had missed, and the knives and forks, and the trousers he had on—these are the things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when he first saw me he said, "How are you getting on, Mr. Davis?"—I said, "You know in what way you left me"—he said, "Don't say anything before the master of the house; I will go and speak with you"—he put his coat on and came out, and I told the policeman to take him in charge.</p>

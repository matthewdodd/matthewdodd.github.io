I am appointed by the Treasury to inquire into these cases—on 4th November, about 11.30, I was going to the Grey<lb></lb>hound public-house, and saw Inspector Brennan struggling with the pri<lb></lb>soner, who had got him down, in Compton Street—we were obliged to throw the prisoner down, and ultimately he was taken to the station—when there he said, "Are you not going to charge the other gentleman?"—that was a person named Reardon, better known as Barlow—I said, "What gentleman?"—he said, "That man outside?"—I said, "Whatever you say will be used in evidence against you; he is entitled to hear any accusation you make against him"—he was called in, and the prisoner said, "That gentleman I saw put a packet on the seat where he sat; I picked it up and walked out, and while I was walking along I was seized by the inspector, who took it from me; I went into the Greyhound to see a person respecting a dog, and I saw this man (meaning the prisoner, who was discharged) put a packet down on the seat; I picked it up and walked out"—Reardon was searched and detained till Thursday—no bad coin was found on him—I received this coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Inspector Brennan.</p>

I went to the Greyhound about 11.30, and shortly afterwards saw the prisoner come out with one hand in his right coat pocket—I followed him to Old Compton Street—he looked right and left, and then undid a tissue paper packet and put something into his left hand and returned the paper to his coat pocket—I stopped him; he struggled so violently that I had to get assistance to throw him down—I then took four counterfeit shillings from his hand, and this piece of tissue paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his pocket—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of the bad money—he said, "I picked it up"—I said, "That will not do for me, "and took him to the station—he said that he was sent to the public-house to make inquiries about a dog, saw a man put the parcel on a seat by his side, and he picked it up—that man was after<lb></lb>wards taken, and remanded, and discharged.</p>

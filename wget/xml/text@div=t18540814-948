                  </hi>. I am a traveller. I live at the Hand and Shears, No. 1, Middle-street, Cloth Fair—on the afternoon of 25th July I did not hear him say something abusive to my daughter, but my daughter came down stairs, and the prisoner came down not more than a minute and a quarter after—he stood at the parlour door and said, "I will kick your—y guts out, and cut open your b—y head with a poker"—I had remon<lb></lb>strated with him with respect to his conduct to my wife and daughter—he did as he said, he came and kicked me with his full force in the groin—he had his boots on—I was held fast by the women—my own daughter was one; she held me away from him, and there was the prisoner's mother behind—she had hold of me by the collar—I extricated myself by using my arms, and she had a long brush immediately and beat me on the back of my head—after the prisoner struck me with the kick, he returned to the tap room, brought the poker, and struck me on the temple with it—the effect of that blow was that I was stunned and my head cut open—I was taken to the doctor at St. Bartholomew's hospital, and he strapped it up—I have been suffering ever since—it was a very heavy blow, half of my head was completely numbed.</p>

I believe she did—it was before the cry of "Murder!" that I was struck on the head with the poker—on my oath, it was not after the cry of "Murder!"—she cried "Murder!" a long time before I was struck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it you did not say before the Magistrate what the prisoner said to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might escape my memory—I was examined the fol<lb></lb>lowing day—it appears it escaped my memory, but he did say so—I did not make use of any violent language to the prisoner, nothing more than I said, "You d—d rogue, if you don't give over insulting my wife and daughter, I shall teach you better in another way"—I called him a "yellow looking scoundrel"—I did not say "You d—d rogue;" I stand corrected there—I did not mean that—I did not say anything about "a white-livered b—r"—my wife is not here: she is an invalid; she has a bad leg and a bad finger—I was treated for this by the doctor—I was laid up all that night, and most of the next day—I am not one that is confined much; if I was, it would kill me—I was hurt in the groin—I have not been able to make water freely since.</p>

I recollect the day the quarrel was—I saw the last witness and the prisoner come down stairs—Mr. Barry came out of the parlour—I heard him use threatening language to the prisoner—he said, "If you don't leave my daughter alone, I will do so and so to you"—he called him a d—d rogue, and said he would strike him; and <hi rend="italic">Pat</hi> said if he struck him, he would strike <hi rend="italic">him</hi>—there were no blows in my presence—I saw them struggling—I saw Mr. Barry turn round and strike Mrs. M'Keowne—I saw her lift her cap up, and she shouted, "Murder I"—she was standing on the floor when she picked her cap up—I did not see her on the floor—I saw her distinctly lift her cap up, and I heard her cry, "Murder!"—after the cry of "Murder!" I saw the poker in the prisoner's hand, but I did not see him strike—that t was after the cry of "Murder!"—Sarah Ann Doherty is my daughter—she had my baby in her arms, and I told her to keep out of the way—there was a large cupboard, which prevented her seeing Mr. Barry.</p>

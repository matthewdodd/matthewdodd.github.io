                  </hi>. I am single, and live at St. Bartholomew's-terrace, Bethnal-green. The prisoner used to come to see me—on 30th Oct. I sent my sister, Mary Ann Lee, to pawn a gown—she brought the ticket, and I put it in a tea-caddy—the prisoner remained there from four till eight o'clock—on the next Saturday I missed the ticket, and have not seen it since.</p>

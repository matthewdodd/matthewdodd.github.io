            . I am a labourer, and live at No. 47, Featherstone-street, City-road - about half-past three o'clock on the afternoon of the 1st of February, I was going up Snow-hill - I saw the prisoner and another young man talking together at the corner of a court next to Mr. Baxter's shop - the other young man went down Snow-hill - the prisoner turned into the shop - I saw the elbow of the prisoner raised, as if he was taking the coat - he ran up the hill with the coat, pursued by the foreman, who brought him back, with it in his possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was the coat? A. Hanging up inside the door - I could just see his elbow when he lifted his hand up to take it - I believe it was inside the shop - I cannot say whether it was on the left or right side of the door - the prisoner, and no other person, is the man who took the coat - I was about three yards from the shop when he came out with it, and eight paces off when I saw him taking it - I was on the same side of the way - I never said I was on the opposite side - I do not think it was quite half-past three o'clock - I have been a labourer all my life - I worked at the London Docks last Tuesday and Wednesday - I was in the police before that - that was my first employment - I was discharged from the police on the 19th of December, in consequence of a misunderstanding which took place between me and another man - I mentioned the man's name in a public-house, and he was not present; and when I saw him on the Saturday night, I told him what I had said - he said I had spoken of his character when he was not present; and I was discharged, as he reported me - I never charged that man with any offence - I know Mr. Holley - I never charged him with anything - I was not discharged for using any improper language to his wife.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met with a friend in Holborn who had come from the country - I went into Thompson's, and had something to drink - on coming out, I met a friend - he had taken his place in Smithfield to go to St. Albans - we met a friend - he said, "Are you going over Blackfriars-bridge?" - I said, "No; I am going with my friend to Smithfield" - he said, "I bought a coat; if you will wait two minutes, I will go and fetch it" - he went off, and in a short time came again, and said, "You may as well come" - I said, "I will go with you" - he said, "Carry this for me" - I took the coat, put it on my arm, and was walking away, when the shopman came and said, "That is not your coat" - I said, "Certainly not - there is the person who bought it" - he did not say, I must go to him, but took me back.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Alderman Birch at times, and have been so ten or eleven years - on Saturday, 1st of February, I was in Holborn, coming from Donovan's the Poulterer's, at near three o'clock - I met the prisoner near Thompson's with another man, coming out - they asked me to take something to drink, and I went back with them to Thompson's - we all came out together, and walked up Snow-hill, towards Smithfield - the other man said, that he was going to St. Albans by the coach - he asked the prisoner to walk so far with him, for he had bought a greatcoat at a pawnbroker's close by - they walked on together about four or five yards - the man who was with the prisoner left us by the pawnbroker's, up the hill near Smithfield - I don't know the pawnbroker's name - we two walked on about five or six yards - I knew the prisoner before, when he kept the Devonshire Arms, Golden-lane - we were joined by the other man - he had a great-coat with him - he gave it to the prisoner, whether it was for inspection or not, I cannot say; for I said I could not stop a moment longer - I was going over the water to my master, who keeps the Surrey-gate Tavern - the coat was a dark brown great-coat- I was at work at Mr. Alderman Birch's on the Lord Mayor's-day as cook, at Merchant

            ' Hall, and have done so upwards of ten years - I have known the prisoner about seven years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what direction did they go when you left them? A. Towards Smithfield - the pawnbroker's shop is in the narrow part as you go to Smithfield, on the left hand side - it is up a hill - I do not know whether it is Snow-hill - I was going to the Surrey and Kent Tavern - it was formerly called Blizard's Hotel - this happened five or six yards from the pawnbroker's - I did not see the prisoner after I wished them good day - I do not know the name of the person - he was a tall man, about my own height - I never saw him before or since.</p>

            . Q. Was the prisoner running or walking when you first saw him? A. A sort of a trot, running as it were, going fast, not walking - he had nobody with him - the coat was dark brown - I did not run after him at all - I saw him at the door - I missed the coat from the door, and saw him going up the hill with it - he was not out of my sight until he was taken, from the time he took the coat, which was, as near as I can recollect, half-past three o'clock - it was not half a minute from the time I missed it till I saw it on his shoulder - I was not behind the counter when the coat was taken - I was near the door when I missed it - the same person I saw running with the coat was brought back with it by the foreman - I did not lose sight of him a moment - he was taken eight yards from the shop, at most - it was at Mr. Jones's door, the cook-shop, about six yards from master's door - the prisoner struck at the foreman, and began to show fight - when he was taken he said a man gave it him to carry - the foreman darted out of the shop and seized him in a moment with it.</p>
               <p>W. BARROW re-examined. I saw the prisoner stopped - there was no man at all near him to give him the coat - the man that was with him went down the hill before the prisoner took the coat - the prisoner turned to the right into the shop - I never saw Blizard before to-night - there was no man there at all except the prisoner when he took the coat - the prisoner was taken within seven yards of the door - the other man walked sharp down the hill - I had my two children, one in each hand, and did not run after him.</p>
               <p>COURT to H. HALL. Q. Describe the situation of the shop where you were? A. I almost that moment come down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200101"></xptr>from dinner - I came to the door and missed the coat - the prisoner could hardly have got out of the shop when I missed it - the foreman was at the end of the counter near the door, just inside it - the door opens just where you go behind the counter - there is no door to the counter - the foreman stood about a yard and a half from the door - there is no flap to lift up to the counter - there is a flap, but it is always open.</p>
               <p>W. BARROW re-examined. I saw the prisoner take the coat - I did not call "Stop thief" - I did not know he was stealing - I saw him pursued - I could not tell but what he was the pawnbroker.</p>

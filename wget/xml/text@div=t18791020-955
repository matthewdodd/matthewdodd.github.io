                  </hi>. I am shopwoman to Mr. Thomas Green, bootmaker—on 14th October, about 5 p.m., the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for a pair of 13 boy's laced boots—I looked, and told her I did not think we had a pair, and I showed her a pair of spring sides at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and asked her if they would do—she said "Yes"—I turned to get another pair, and saw her taking this other pair from the nail—I caught hold of her, and took her into the back room, and said "I caught you stealing a pair of boots, and I shall send for the police"—she said nothing, and I sent for a policeman, and gave her in charge.</p>

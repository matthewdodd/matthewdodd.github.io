            . Previous to the prisoner going to Mr. Steele's she came to my house, she came down in the bakehouse; there was a bit of beef standing on the board, she said that is my beef; I asked her for the ticket; she said her sister had not brought a ticket. Just at the time she said it was her's a person came in with the ticket, the fellow of it was in the dish, and claimed the beef. There was another piece of beef drawed out of the oven; she said she had made a mistake in the first; she owned the second dish; the first was a round dish, and this was a long one; a person brought a ticket and claimed that; she stood five minutes and there was another bit of beef drawn; she said that is mine, I know it by the dish. I did not let her have it, as I always give tickets.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. On the 22nd of January I carried a bit of beef to Mr. Steele's myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth - A. Two shillings and ten pence. The prisoner's sister produced the stand; it is my own making.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday night my mother bought a bit of beef and gave two shillings and six pence for it. On Sunday she sent my little sister to the bakehouse with it; when she came back I asked her where the ticket was; she said they had not given her a ticket; I did not ask her particular which bake-house she had taken it to; she told me she had taken it in James street; I went to fetch it; I went to this gentleman's, the corner of a court in James street; he said I do not let bakings go without a ticket; I asked for my dinner; I paid the two pence in the shop; I brought it home and knew nothing but what it was the same.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

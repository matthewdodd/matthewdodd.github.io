I was going home from a friend's house at Whitechapel—I got to St. George's-church, in the Borough, from half-past one to two o'clock, or it might be two o'clock—I had about me three sovereigns, two half-crowns, and a watch—I was on the right-hand side, coming from London-bridge—just as I was going across the Dover-road, to Mint-street, towards my home, the two prisoners came up to me—Buckley put his leg in front of me, and Gibbs <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me over Buckley's leg—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi>

            . I sell things about the streets. I met Pinerean, who brought me a spoon on the Tuesday or Wednesday before I was taken; he said, "Will you sell this" - I said, "I do not know, I will see;" he said,"You may as well sell it for us" - I took it to Pring's, and asked his son to buy it; he said, "What do you want?" - I said 1s. 6d.; he asked Pring what he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150060"></xptr>give - he said 1s.; I said I would go and ask if the boy would take it - he said Yes; I went in, and Pring gave the 1s. to his son, who gave it to me - Pring said it was the full value of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN WEST. I am a Police-officer. I went to Pring's; I said, "You must go with me to the watch-house" - he put on his coat and went; I asked if he had had a spoon of a boy - he said Yes, and given 1s. for it; I took him to the watch-house, went back, and found this spoon.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What is Pring? A. He mends shoes. I knew him by living opposite to him.</p>
               <p>Pinereau's Defence. Mackinley used to knock at the railing for me, and ask if I had any silver spoons or forks to bring up to him to sell.</p>


               <p>Pring's Defence. I never bought any thing stolen in my life; I was busy and my son bought it - I said I did not know whether it was silver, and he went to my son and got the 1s. of him; he had the 1s. of me, but I did not know it.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to say the son gave it you? A. I gave the spoon to the son, who asked what I wanted - he showed it to the father, who laid it on the place, and gave me the 1s.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Have you ever been placed in a dock yourself for any offence? A. I was before a Magistrate, but never was here - that was for receiving a handkerchief which another boy had stolen; once I was walking along Berkeley-square, and was taken up for nothing at all.</p>

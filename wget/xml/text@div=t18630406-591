                  </hi>. The prisoner and I have been sweethearts for about nine months—he is a boiler-maker—we had broken off our acquaintance about six weeks before this—on the night this happened, about half-past 9 o'clock, I was coming from my aunt's, in Mile-end-road—I think it was April 1—the prisoner met me coming out at my aunt's gate, and asked if I was going home—he wished to go home with me—I said that his company was not required—I saw him following me when I got to the top of the garden—I was frightened to go across the park, and turned up the Bethnal-green-road—he said that he would follow me, and I said that if he did I would go back to my aunt's—I asked him, in the Bethnal-green-road, why he was following me—he said, "I think you have been playing with me long enough"—I said, "In what way?"—he made no answer, and I turned back to go to my aunt's again—I did not go in; but as I was going there, I looked round in a dark place and saw the prisoner's hand raised from his pocket three times—I was watching his hand—I then heard the explosion of a pistol, and felt a sharp shock on my right side towards my back—it made a hole in my cloak and went through it, but not through my dress—I was about two steps from him when the pistol was fired, standing sideways to him—I went a little way down the walk, and fell against the fence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 27). On 1st April, about 10 o'clock at night, I received information, and found the prisoner at 29, Tomlin-terrace, Limehouse, putting his trousers on—I searched his box, and found in it this box, containing a good many rivets, some caps, and some smaller rivets—this</p>

               <p>pisto which had been recently discharged, and had an exploded cap on the nipple, was in his coat pocket, and one of these Chinese knives—I told him the charge, and he asked me if she was dead—as I was searching his box, he said, "I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with one of them"—that was one of the rivets—he said, on the way to the station, that he did not intend to murder her; he only <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it to frighten her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you knock at the door of his room before you went in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I produce a powder-flask with powder in it—I did not smell the pistol—this is the cap that was on it—I say that it had been recently discharged, because there was some black in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 289, Bethnal-green—on the evening of 1st April, I was called to see the prosecutrix—I found a large bruise on her right side, with a central ecchymosed spot, which I suppose was where the blow was received; it arose from congestion of the vessels from external injury—it was a recent bruise—I have seen these rivets—I think a rivet discharged from a pistol would be likely to cause the bruise I saw, and it might have perforated her body and killed her—there was a hole in her mantle corresponding with the position of the bruise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the bruise be caused by a pinch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it could—a stone might do it, if one was thrown—anything which would cause a bruise might have caused this—anything discharged from a pistol at two feet distance would be likely to do far more serious damage than I saw—it might or might not be caused by a bullet from a pistol.</p>

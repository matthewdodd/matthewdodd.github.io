On Sunday, the first of June, my boarder, and the little boy went to church, and afterwards they went out to take a walk, and I was left at home by myself; I bolted my gate, and fastened the door, and went up stairs; it was about six o'clock, or after; I have a very good clock in the house; I went up stairs and put on a gown, and heard my door chink, and I went down and unbolted the door, and when I unbolted the door, the prisoner at the bar came in, and threw over my head a thing that was made to draw like a sish apron, it stunk very strong of salmon, it almost stifled me, then I tussled with her, and as I tussled with her, I heard the words, be quick, and then somebody came over, and struck me over the head two or three blows; I thought my eyes flew out of my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose voice was it said be quick? - The prisoner's; and then I received the blows. Then I don't remember any more, but that I fell senseless against the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lay so? - I cannot tell; they tell me till it was near eight o'clock. When my boarder came home, she found me laying on the stairs; I did not recover till my boarder came home, and called several people in, and they thought I was dead. When I came to myself, I missed my ring off my finger and my pocket turned inside out; I had half a guinea, and half a crown, and one shilling in them, and I believe, two or three halfpence besides; the silver and gold were in one pocket, and the halfpence in the other; I had several more things in them, but they were found on the ground; I am certain I had that money in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Yes.</p>

            How long had you had the rings that you have been talking about? - I suppose I might have wore them twenty or thirty years. One was a wedding ring; the other was a ring that I bought in London.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you buy that ring? - Yes, and more that I have in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always wear rings in the country at Enfield? - Yes, I always wear two.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a shop did you keep? - I sold chandlery things.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take up this woman and charge her with the robbery? - I am sure I don't know the day of the month it was now. I had a doctor to attend me; I was not able to get out of my bed a great while. The high constable took her at Edmonton about three weeks after.</p>

            How soon did you apply to a magistrate, or to a constable to take up this woman? - When I was in bed; and he said, I could not do it till I was able to go myself, and she still kept abusing of me.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact you did not go before a justice till three weeks after? - I think it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner at the bar stay in the parish all that time where she had been before? - Yes, and put me at defiance, and said I could not do any thing with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a little quarrel with this woman, had not you? - She was always abusing me; I have bought sish of her many times out of fear.</p>
               <p>Q. She is a sish woman, is not she? - She is.</p>
               <p>Q. I am afraid that your cat played some tricks with her sish, on which she threatened to cut your cat's throat? - No, it was mine she threatened to cut.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this have not you exhibited articles of the peace against her? - Yes, but before that came on they did me this mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you never indicted the prisoner at the last session? - I was not able, I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another person you charged, a Mrs. English? - But that was on another affair, that happened last November.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take up Mrs. English, as well as Mrs. Freebody? - Yes; and I light of my mischief on the Sunday before the session came on.</p>

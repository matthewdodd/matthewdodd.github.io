                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Edward Bull, of No. 89, Shore<lb></lb>ditch. We are curriers and leather-sellers. On the morning of the 1st of December, in consequence of information, I fetched Knight, a policeman, and went into the kitchen with him—the prisoner was in my brother's service—I told her that I had suspicions of her honesty, and had brought a policeman to search her boxes—she said I was very welcome; for she had nothing but what belonged to herself, which she had bought and paid for—I went to au upper room, and she pointed out two boxes, which were locked—she produced a key, and unlocked one—nothing was found in it—I examined the second box—several things were handed out; and at last a paper parcel came out—I said, "What does that contain?" and before it was opened, she said it was things she had purchased in the Borough—I said, "Very well, lay it down on the bedstead"—another paper parcel was found—I asked what was in that—she said, things she had bought at the same place—I laid that with the other things; and found another bundle, which she said contained sugar—it was put down with the other things—I think it had an apron tied round it—after seeing all there was in the box, I examined the parcels—I found the first con<lb></lb>tained seven remnants of Irish linen, two pieces of duck, and one remnant of union, which is a mixture of cotton and linen; the second parcel contained a piece and a remnant of galloon; the third parcel contained sugar—they were brought down into the kitchen, and she gave the same account</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183412050037"></xptr>
               <p>of how she got possession of them—I sent to my brother to send me the several pieces of Irish he had in cut, which matched in quality with these—the duck and union correspond—the scissor marks correspond where it was cut off, and this galloon has my shop mark on it—it was never sold to the prisoner—the sugar is a similar quality to some we had bought to make wine a few months previous—the union I swear to positively—the galloon has our shop mark on it—they belong to myself and my brother—she was my brother's servant, and has been so nearly six years—she always bore a good character.</p>

               <p>The prisoner handed in a petition, expressing her contrition for the com<lb></lb>mission of the offence, and received a most excellent character.</p>

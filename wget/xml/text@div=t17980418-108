               <p>GREENHOUSH SHAW sworn. - On the 12th of March I went with my wife to see a friend at Stepney; I had occasion to go to a public-house, the Angel, and near the Angel I saw a most desperate battle; I saw the last half hour or twenty minutes of the battle, between the deceased, a young man a <rs id="t17980418-108-viclabel592" type="occupation">baker</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you know the situation of the prisoner at the bar, Homan? - A. I understood him to be a <rs id="t17980418-108-deflabel593" type="occupation">butcher</rs>

               <p>Q.Was he present at the time? - A. Yes, he was; he acted as second to the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing? - A. Yes, he took a very active part; apparently what he thought a friendly part for the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a second on the other side? - A. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. YOu do not know any of the bye-gone circumstances? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am an auctioneer: I was coming by and saw an assemblage of people; I saw the termination of the battle, which was the death of one of the combatants, Turner; I saw the prisoner there just before they went to fight; I thought I saw in the publican, Niblett, a disinclination to fight; I took him aside, and told him I hoped he would consider well before he went to fight; I told him it would let him down very much; he thanked me for my advice, but said he had gone so far, that it must be finished in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any particular conduct of the prisoner? - A. When I saw the deceased much hurt, I broke into the ring among them; I told the prisoner at the bar, if he set the man to fighting any more, I would have him taken up; by this time other people had broke in; the prisoner said he had a guinea in his pocket as well as me, and he would set him up to fight,as long as he would fight; he never did fight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. I would not advise the Jury to stretch this case to murder, though it approaches very nearly to murder. <rs id="t17980418-108-verdict594" type="verdictDescription">

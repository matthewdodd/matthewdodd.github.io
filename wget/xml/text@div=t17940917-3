I was at home, on Wednesday the 20th of August, the whole evening; about four o'clock a gentleman, a neighbour, sent for me to come to his house. In the evening there came by twenty or thirty women rather before ten o'clock, they cried out, Mr. Cafe, for Christ Almighty's sake get out of your house, for the mob is coming; there were several people in my house drinking, they all rose up; I told them I was not in the least dread of the mob's coming; I continued there till the mob were within ten or fifteen yards of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the number of persons there? - I should suppose there were an hundred. One of them came up to me, and laid hold of me by the coat, and said, d-mn my eyes, if you don't run off you will certainly be murdered else. I was about two or three yards from the steps, my wife called out, for God's sake, take take off your child; I said, Susan, go out of the house immediately. I went out and returned to my house between one and two o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find your house? - All the front of the windows pulled down.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170011"></xptr>Q. Do you mean the windows or the sashes? - The glass, and that that contains it, the wood work, and I observed the wainscotting torn off in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation were the window shutters? - The window shutters were down when the mob came, and when I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How were your windows? - The bars of the windows every one of them were broke, and then the frames destroyed; the bottles containing different sorts of liquor, totally destroyed; in the kitchen there was not a bit of furniture to be seen, only part of the jack, the frame of the kitchen window that leads to the parlour, that was totally destroyed.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the house above stairs? - There was nothing destroyed above stairs only the pannel of a door of a closet, split in two.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left your house that evening were these things in the situation you have now described, or were they all whole? - They were all whole.</p>
               <p>SUSANNA CASE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. On the 20th of August last I was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing taking place that was particular? - Yes; I was going up stairs between eight and nine or ten o'clock, I went up to fasten the room windows; I came down again, a parcel of people came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think? - Eighteen or twenty; and I went to the end of the back door, leading from the passage to the bar, and I saw Biggett and some more young men come in, I never saw him before in my life; that is the man at the bar with the red hair; I said, young man, what do you want? Biggett made me for answer, are you mistress of the house? I was rather fearful to say yes, but I did say yes; he asked me where my husband was? I said, I don't know; he said, I must go and setch him; I said, I could not go and fetch him, for I did not know where he was; and he proceeded to the bar, and took out a stone cask of gin, and put it on the top of the bar door, and turned the cock to let the liquor out; I turned it off, and he turned it on again, and I turned it off again, and he turned it on again; and I said, gentlemen, drink the liquor or give it away, do what you please with it, but don't let it run about.</p>
               <p>Q. What was going on at this time to your knowledge in the inside of the house? - They were breaking and destroying in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what they were doing without the house? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what was doing inside of the house while Biggest was at the bar? - They were breaking, destroying, and pulling down the place, and the furniture, as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they do any thing at the bar? - The bar is entirely broke down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Biggett there during the whole of that time? - I don't know that he was, I did not see him when he went out; he was there when the mob were breaking down the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe in what manner Biggett behaved, and the rest of the people behaved? - While this mischief was doing I saw nothing of Biggett, only taking out the jar and turning of the liquor on. The mob below broke all the windows, and window frames in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else? - After that I went out to the back door; I could not get out at the street door for the concourse of people; I went out at the back door, and went up in the court, and I could not get down at the end of the court, and I came in again, and just<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170012"></xptr>as I came in at the back door; I found somebody push or was pushed against me; I suppose I was out about the space of five minutes, and when I came back, I found some one push rather against me, and I looked up to see who it was, and I saw Osborne; knowing him, at first I was rather glad to see him, and I said to him, I thought that you would not have used me so; the answer be made me, was, I was pushed against you. He never passed any more words, good, bad, or indifferent; he went into the kitchen, but what became of him I don't know, I did not see him come into the house, nor did I see him go out.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went down into the kitchen, what was going on in the kitchen? - All the things were breaking in the kitchen, but I did not see him do any thing at all; I heard the noise, but I did not see any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Osborne live, that you had an opportunity of knowing him? - About a minutes walk from our house.</p>

            Had you seen him often? - I have seen him several different times, coming in for a pint or a pot of beer. I know him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The mob were pulling down the bar at the time Biggett was speaking to you? - Yes, destroying the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not in the tap room? - He was in the passage at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired to know where your husband was? - He asked me where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. All that Biggett did was in overturning this stone jar? - It was turning the cock, in which stone jar was gin.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all Biggett did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Excepting that when you turned the cock back, he turned it going again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dowers. At the time this happened it must be dark? - I believe it was, it was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that some body pushed against you, you was at your back door? - I was, coming in.</p>

            Had you any light? - I had not, but they had plenty in their hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You had known Osborne for some time? - For the space of two months, ten weeks or more.</p>
               <p>Q. And you was glad to see him? - When I first saw him I was rather glad that I saw a face I knew, being in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended he had come to assist you more than to destroy. You don't know that he did you any mischief? - I don't know, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. It was very light. How came it to be so light? you can describe that well? - There were five or six candles light up at a time, or more, and put on some part of the wainscotting that they broke down in the tap room; and at one time we were all in the dark, till the men went out and got lights. When they heard the horse were coming, they cried out, here are the horse coming, put out the lights.</p>

            How many do you think there were of the mob? - They were all about the door; the shutters were not up; there was a great concourse of people, they were swearing, and saying, where was the Black Raven? there were some stones came through the window and knocked the candle off the tap room table on to the floor, and all the window and frame almost came in together; they said, d-mn their eyes, if they would not kill Case, if they could catch him. Then I got off my seat where I was sitting, when I saw the candle fall, and I immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170013"></xptr>ran between the cellar door and the bar door, where there is a little passage, I went there, and there were five gentlemen, quite gentlemen, came in, and asked me who I was? I told them I was the servant; they asked me where my master was? I told them he was out, they asked me where my mistress was? I told them she was up stairs, and they made a kind of whistling, and the people came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you able to distinguish any of the persons that came in? - No. Then the gentlemen asked me who was up stairs? I told them there was nobody up stairs but the lodgers, and they cut some candles out of the bar, and they kept some themselves, and chucked the rest to the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think may be the number of the mob, twenty or thirty, or more? - More than that. They went up stairs with me, and my mistress was then going out at the back door with a bundle in her hand, and then Biggett came in, I did not see him come in, but I turned about and saw him in the bar; it was that young man in the red hair, I never see him only in the bar, till I see him before the justices the next day. I saw my mistress with him, with the bundle in her hand, and rather quarrelling with him, but what was said I don't know, I saw him knock down a bottle in the bar while he was moving the gin cag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he was doing at all with the gin cag? - I did not see any more of him at all, I only saw him at that time. Then these gentlemen bid me go up stairs with them, I went with them to the one pair of stairs, and I begged and prayed that they would not break any thing in my mistress's room, for they were all favourite things of her's, they stooped to look under the bed; while we were going up stairs, they below, were breaking down the bar, and the settles in the tap room; when I desired the gentlemen not to break any thing in my mistress's room, they said they would not break any thing, they were only in search of somebody; they came out, and I thought that I would not go away from my mistress's door till they came down, they had asked me who was up stairs further? I told them only a man and his wife, lodgers; coming down stairs, John Osborne, I did not know his name before, but I knew his person by being a customer in the house; he said to a chimney sweeper that was with him at the one pair of stairs landing place, d-n her eyes, push her down, for that is where the men are, or knock her down, I don't know which now.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he mean? - Me.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed then? - I told him he need not knock or push me down, for the gentlemen had been in and searched the room, and immediately he hit me on the head, and made me rather stagger; I turned about and I pushed him, he had a stick, and in turning round there was a splinter in the stick, and it made my arm bleed, the stick went against me, I don't know whether he went to hit me or not; he went into the kitchen afterwards, I believe he then went down stairs and was pushed against my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all this had taken place before he was pushed against your mistress? - Yes. When I came down stairs I saw him pushing into the kitchen, my mistress was standing at the back door, and the chimney sweeper asked me, if we had any beer in the cellar; I was afraid to say no, and I said yes, and he had a gallon pot in his hand, and my mistress said, go and draw some, and I heard the people outside saying the horse guards are coming, we have done enough here.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the people in the house, when this alarm was of the horse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170014"></xptr>guards? - I was drawing the beer, and I began at the stale bull, Osborne went down with me, and while I was drawing at the stale butt, he pulled out the cock of the mild butt, and set it all a float.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the mob stay in the kitchen after this alarm of the horse guards? - The alarm was made while I was going down stairs.</p>

            How long do you think that might be after Osborne made his way into the cellar? - They staid in it till I came up with the gallon pot three parts full of beer; they made their escape on the guards arriving; I came up with the beer, and said, here is some beer, and one of them took it out of my hand, and gave it outside. I am certain of Osborne.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. All you see Biggett doing was with respect to this stone jarr? - That was all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dowers. You did not see Osborne break any thing, or do any thing of mischief of that sort? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you sometimes go by another name than that you have now? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What reward do you get by coming here to day? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have never been promised a reward to swear so stoutly against Osborne? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 20th, and Osborne was not taken up till the 23d? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how that happened? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him between the 20th and 23d? - Yes, I saw him on Thursday morning, and I told my mistress, my master was not at home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When you saw Osborne before the justice had you any doubt of his being the man that struck you, and asked you as you have described? - No, I have no doubt at all, I am very sure he is the man.</p>

            What relation are you to Osborne? - I don't know him, I cannot say that ever I saw him before; as I was going up Golden lane last Monday, the maid of the Black Raven was coming down, there was a woman along with the girl, and the woman said to the girl, what are you to go to speak against these unfortunate young men? she said, yes, the woman said to the girl, I don't think you are capable of taking an oath; and the girl said to the woman directly, my mistress promises me a new gown and cloak, she says she will take care that I shall be well rewarded, and the woman said, ah, fie upon it, and went away shaking her head, and I turned to the woman and said, it is a pity that girl should be suffered to take an oath for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170017"></xptr>sake of a gown and coat. This is the girl(pointing to Clifford.)</p>
               <p>Court to girl. Did you ever see that woman before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath that you have taken is that she has said, or any part of it, true? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Case. Did you ever make any promise to your girl if she would swear against these people? - Never in my life, I always said this to the girl, Mary, don't say a wrong thing of any one, for you know it will be nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Gidness. Where do you live? - In Golden-lane, about the middle, in

               <p>Q. Did you live there the time you had this conversation? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it this conversation took place? - About three doors from the Black Raven, the woman was between the girl and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the woman went to that had this conversation? - She crossed, and went up Brackely-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a woman was it? - A very good looking woman. I turned about to her and said in this manner, it is a very bad thing that this girl should go to take away any man's life.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first speak about this? - I happened to speak about it when I went home that day, and they sent for me this blessed morning, or else I should not have been here, I mentioned it to Mrs. Guilliford and to several neighbours, not thinking they would have brought me on it, or else I would not have mentioned it.</p>

            Why is it not a very proper thing to mention that the girl was meaning to swear away two young men's lives, did not you tell them you would come forward and tell the story? - No, I did not say such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You see where this girl went to? - She went into her master's house, the house in the front was shut up, and she went to the house up the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Case or Mrs. Case that you heard her say so? - No, I am acquainted with Mrs. Case and Mr. Case too, they have been friends as far as I am a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to them, and say, dear what a bad story this girl is telling of you? - I have not been in the house these five months, because I have not my beer there now.</p>

            Why did not you tell Mrs. Case, be cautious about this girl? because you are to give her a new gown for swearing? Did you know Osborn? - No, I never knew him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew that he had been accused of this fact? - I did not, till it was mentioned, and the neighbours said it was a pity that I should not go to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you never offered to come till you was applied to this morning, and you would not have come if they had not sent for you? - I don't know that I should have troubled my head with such a troublesome affair.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope we have not many such women in this town; my good lady, can you at all tell what sort of a woman this was that she was speaking to? - The woman was close by me, and passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to this woman, what a desperate girl this is, that is going to swear a man's life away? - No, but the woman shook her head, and said, ah, fie upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever endeavoured to find out this woman, or get any information who she was? - No, I cannot say that ever I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman appear to be acquainted with the girl? - I don't know.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170018"></xptr>Q. Did not the woman say to the girl why you should not do so? - The woman only said fie upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. If you was to hear me say that I meant to go and swear away a person's life, would not you say I was a very wicked fellow? - I only tell you what I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you do you think? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Biggett. This is not the first life that that girl has sworn away, if she swears away ours, because she has a brother-in-law transported.</p>
               <p>Osborne. This girl was drawing gin in the back kitchen, and giving it away to every one that came in.</p>

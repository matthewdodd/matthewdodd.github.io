                   was convicted last sessions of stealing, he knowing them to have been so stolen
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>(The case was opened by Mr. Knowlys.)</p>
               <p>(The conviction of Charles Sebly read.)</p>
               <p>THOMAS TEMPEST sworn. - I am manager of the smith department to Messrs. Perry; Sebly was in the copperas manufactory, near the prisoner's house, which was in Poplar; Messrs. Perry had about thirteen or fourteen tons of Dutch filling nails, which they used in making copperas; I believe they had sold part of them, but I cannot say particularly: On the 11th of September, about seven o'clock in the morning, I went to Henderson's premises, with the officer, and saw him go out when I was within about one hundred yards from him; he is smith by trade; I saw two bags of filling nails brought out of his house, and were produced at Sebly's trial, and they are of the same kind as Messrs. Perrys'; I saw them in the back parlour, and believe them to be part of the stock; I understand the prisoner absconded, nor did I see him since the 11th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Will you swear he has absconded? - A. No, I cannot; I don't know whether there were scales where the nails were or not, there might he; there were two parcels in bags laying on the floor unconcealed; I should not have known any of the nails had been lost, except these had been found; when they break up a Dutch ship a great many of the nails fall out as they strip the bottom.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN sworn. - I am an officer, and searched the prisoner's premises on the 11th of September; I was told Mr. Henderson was just gone out; in the middle room, called the back room, I found a large quantity of filling nails, I suppose four or five hundred weight, tied up in bags, and a quantity loose; we brought them away as they were, and they were produced on the trial of Sebly; I had been at Henderson's on the 7th, and I think I saw them then; I made search for the prisoner, but never could find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hatt.

            Will you swear he absconded? - A. He was not to be found when I went to his house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DALTON sworn. - I am a constable, and apprehended Sebly; I have searched for the prisoner and never saw him till he surrendered.</p>

             sworn. - I am an auctioneer, and sold the prisoner's goods at Blackwall; on the 13th of November the son gave me orders, and I paid him the money as attorney for the father; I never saw the prisoner, or knew of his intention to quit before November.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley addressed the Jury on behalf of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TELLKAMFF sworn. - I am clerk to the Magistrates of the Shadwell Police-office, and solicitor to this prosecution; I don't know what intimation the prisoner had of the indictment, he had none from me; he gave notice a day or two after the last sessions that he would surrender the first day of this; but after that notice I sent to apprehend him because he was under no recognizance; it was my duty, and I would do it again; search was made after him, but he could not be found; the charge existed before October, and he might have surrendered the last sessions.</p>
               <p>ANN WHEELER sworn. - The prisoner is my father; I have seen such nails as these at his house; I remember some for years in a basket in a room where he kept old iron behind the shop, not applied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020056"></xptr>to any other purpose: On the 5th of September Mr. Wheeler and I only were in the house, a man came with a quantity of nails in parcels in his apron; he said he had some old iron to sell; I said my father was in Buckinghamshire, where he was gone to settle about his house; my father went away on the 12th, and a little while after the officers came; I knew my father intended to leave off business, as his brother had died and left him the house in the country; he desired me to take no orders or buy old iron; and when I told him the man left the nails he was very angry, and if the man called again he was to take them back, as he should have nothing to do with them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What kind of man was this? - A. An oldish man; he said he should leave them.</p>

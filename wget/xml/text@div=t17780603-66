               <p>Court. You did not know him then? -</p>
               <p>I did not; I suspected that it was Mr. Dawson, the person I wanted, but I was not certain. I took his wife down stairs into another room, and asked her why she said he was not her husband, and then I discovered that he was Dawson. I then took him down stairs into the bed-room, and searched the bureau, and there I found these three punches and a watch-case (producing the punches); I delivered the watch-case to the Assay Master.</p>
               <p>(It was produced by the Assay Master.)</p>
               <p>Clarke. This is the same I found; there is a piece put on one of the punches; I believe it had been broke, and that was put on to preserve it; he acknowledged the room to be his, and he put on his wig and clothes in it.</p>
               <p>Was the bureau locked? - It was.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the key? - I cannot say; either the wife or him; there was no one else in the room.</p>
               <p>FENDALL RUSHWORTH sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the senior Assay Master of the Goldsmiths company; I have assayed the watch-case; it is eight penny weights worse than standard; it is marked with a Lion, a Leopard's Head, and the letter B, which is the mark we use. The B is the mark for the year.</p>
               <p>What do you call the Lion? - A Lion Passant. These marks are in imitation of our's, but are not the real marks.</p>
               <p>Would they pass with persons that are not conversant with the company's marks? - I believe they might. I struck the marks with the punches found in the possession of the prisoner, on a piece of silver. The witness produced it, and a watch-case, with the real marks of the company, which were compared by the jury.]</p>

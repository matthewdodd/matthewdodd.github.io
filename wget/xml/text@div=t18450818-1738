                  </hi>. I live in Elm-street, Gray's-inn-road, and am fore-man to Thos. Horner, a painter, in Hart-street, Bloomsbury—the prisoner has been about three months in Mr. Homer's service. On Wednesday, the 6th of Aug., we were at work at No. 3, Hyde Park-gardens—the prisoner was left in charge of the things, sent there to finish the job—if this brush was left in his charge it was his duty to use it for work, but not to part with it—I should not like to swear to the brush.</p>

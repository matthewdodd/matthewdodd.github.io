                  </hi>. I am a delivery foreman at No. 4 wharf, at the West India Docks. On the 21st of February I delivered one hogshead of sugar to Mr. Dale's carman—I cannot positively say whether the prisoner was the carman, but I think he was—the hogshead was weighed at the time it went out—the gross weight was 16cwt. 3qrs. 14lbs.—this is the head of the hogshead.</p>

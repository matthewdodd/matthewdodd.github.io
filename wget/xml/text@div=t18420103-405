                  </hi>. I am a barrister-at-law, and have chambers at No. 4, Gardiner-court, Temple. The prisoner was in my employ as laundress, since last March, at a salary of fifteen guineas a year—when I went the circuit in the summer, I left her in possession of the key of my plate-chest—I returned in about a month, then went abroad, and did not come back till last November term—on my return, having some friends to dinner, I observed some imitation silver forks on the table, which I thought very odd, as I had not used any for some time—next morning I looked at my plate-chest, and found a great portion of my forks and spoons missing, in consequence of which I asked the prisoner what had become of the silver—she said she had taken it home to clean—I thought nothing more about it till next day, when I looked at the plate-chest again, and the plate seemed all right, except two forks—when the prisoner came, I asked her where those two forks were—she said she supposed she had left them at home—I told her to go and fetch them—she went out and returned—I asked if she had brought them—she said, "No," she would go and fetch them—but before she went she asked if I would advance 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of her wages, which I hesitated to do—she went out, and returned with what I thought to be two silver forks, which she put into the chest—I looked at the chest, and the plate seemed all right then—as I was going to lock the chest, I saw one of the forks sticking up, I looked at it and said, "This is not silver"—she said, "Is it not?"—I examined them, and found they were all imitation forks, substituted for the silver ones—I asked her what had become of the silver forks—she said, "It is better to</p>

               <p>confess the truth"—(I did not ask her to confess)—I said, "You have pawned them"—she said nothing to that, except, "Don't do any thing to me"—I said "Go and fetch the plate, or I will go to the police"—I went away, to consult a friend what I should do, and then came back—the prisoner returned soon after, and gave me a bundle of duplicates, re<lb></lb>lating to my plate—I lost a great deal—I think there were twenty-four silver forks, but I forget the exact number—she left very few remaining—I missed the articles stated, in fact half the plate was taken away.</p>

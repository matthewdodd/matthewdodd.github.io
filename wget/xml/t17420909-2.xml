             . I went to Church on Sunday the 22d of August, and when I came back I found my Drawer open, it is a Drawer in a Chest of Drawers; and about two o'Clock this Lad came Home a little fuddled. He had lived with me about three Months. - Mr James (the next Witness) was with him, and he begged Pardon, and said he would never do so any more. - He begged Pardon for being Drunk, for he had not been charged with any thing. - I was asked if I had sent him to receive any Money for me, and I said no: Upon this I went to my Drawer, took the Bag out, and laid the Money on the Table, and there seemed to be a good deal less than there was. I missed a 3 l. 12 s. presently. I could not make him confess any thing, so I carried him before a Constable, and he went to the Round-House. I sent for Mr James and asked him if he knew any thing of it, Mr James said, there was one 3 l. 12 s. two 36 s. Pieces, and four Guineas, which he left in his Hand the Day before at Welsh-Fair . I went to the Boy at the Round-House, and he confessed he pushed back the Lock with a Knife, and took out the Money; he said the Devil told him where the Money was, and that the Devil bid him do it; he own'd the 3 l. 12 s. the two 36 s. Pieces, and the four Guineas , and said that was all he took.</p>
               <p>Mr James . I think the 22d of August, I saw this Boy drinking with three or four Carpenters in Welsh-Fair . I was drinking a Pint of Beer, and seeing him throwing his Money about, I asked him what Country-Boy he was, he said he was out of Wales ; I advised him to go Home, he desired me to drink some Ale; perhaps, said he, you may think I cannot pay for this Ale, though my Hat on my Head is not worth Six-pence , yet I can pay for it, and pulled out one 3 l. 12 s. the Boy said he did not care to go Home, for fear his Master should beat him. I said if he would go Home along with me, his Master should not beat him: Said he, I will give you two Guineas. if you will let me go about my Business; no, said I, I cannot do that, then, said he, take it all. - I thought as he was a little in Liquor, his Master would be angry with me, and think I kept him out, so I would not deliver the Money till Mr Clarke came to me. Said Mr Clarke to me, Have you not two Guineas of my Boy's? Yes , said I, I have a great many two Guineas. On Monday Morning he confessed he took four Guineas, two 36 s. Pieces, one 3 l. 12 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not open the Drawer, I found it open, and that Man, James, made me drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the Drawer was locked?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I am not certain, I believe it was; I do not know that ever I left it open. <rs id="t17420909-2-verdict9" type="verdictDescription">

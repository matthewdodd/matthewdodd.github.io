            . The officer stopped me with these articles - I got them from St. Bartholomew's Hospital from sister Ross, the prisoner; she told me to take them to her mother's, No. 14, Ely-place, Lambeth, and when I came back she would pay me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know her before? A. I did; I had been to and from to my husband, who died in the hospital, and I had a child under her care - I do not know whether any one saw her give me the things; there were plenty of people in the ward - they were wrapped up and in a basket; I did not know what they were.</p>

            . I am steward of the hospital. On the evening of the 18th of December, two officers called on me - I saw the prisoner; she denied knowing any thing of the property or of Collins - I asked her if she knew any thing of the property being moved from her ward; she said No - I Said, "Then I must call in the officers, who are in the adjoining room;" the property was on the table -I asked if she had had any thing removed from her ward, which she also denied; I then called in the officers - they asked if she knew any thing of the property; they said they had seen Collins - they neither threatened or promised her any thing; I said I should not allow her to sleep in the ward that night, and the officers took her away - she said she would give herself up, and she confessed having given the property to Collins; the linen is never sold from the hospital - this boiler was made for the Queen's ward on the 12th of December, and on the 18th it was not to be found - there are two nurses to the ward; the prisoner was the sister, and had command of the ward.</p>

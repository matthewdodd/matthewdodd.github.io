                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Frederick Johnson, of High Street, Peckham—on 21st March, about 4 o'clock, Brown came in for a cake, and gave me a bad shilling; I bent it, returned it to him, and told him it was bad—he said it was the first he had, and that it was a bad afternoon's work for him—he had a herring-box.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, 1st March, I was in private clothes, at the Duke of Edinburgh beer-house, Shads Road, Peckham, about 300 yards from Mr. Johnson's—Brown came in for half-a<lb></lb>pint of beer, and threw down a bad shilling—the landlady handed it to me; I found it was bad, and asked him how many more he had of that sort about him?—he said, "No more"—I searched him and found fivepence in coppers and a good sixpence—I asked why he attempted to pass a shilling when he had coppers—he said he never liked to carry silver about—I broke the shilling in halves and threw it on the floor, he picked it up, and walked out—I watched him, he went down Meeting House Lane and joined Parks, took something from his pocket and gave it to her, and they walked on to where Sherwin was standing, and joined him—they walked together into the Asylum Road, Parks took something from her pocket and gave to Sherwin, who handed it to Brown, and he left them and went into George Street—Sherwin and Parks went down the Asylum Road into the Kent Road, where they all joined together, and went towards London—I got the assistance of Smith, and we stopped them—I laid hold of the two men, one in each hand, and Smith stood in front of Parks; I saw her hand at her pocket, fumbling about; I put my hand down and said, "Give me that bad money you have here"—I took from her hand nineteen bad shillings wrapped in tissue paper, in two packets—they were all three taken to the station—Parks said that the two men came for her in the morning to go out with them and carry the bad money, and they went and got it changed, and brought her back the good—I found nothing on Brown—I asked him what he had done with the bad shilling he had picked up—he said, "I suppose you will find it about me somewhere"—I searched him and could not find it, and he said, "I suppose I have lost it"—I did not find any good money—he had a box with about a dozen herrings, which he threw away when I apprehended him.</p>

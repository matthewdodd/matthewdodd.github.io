                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 64). I was on duty on the night of 13th July, near St. James' Church, Hatcham—about 10.25 I heard a noise in the church like something falling—I went to the north door and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner peeping out—he closed the door in my face as I was going to it I told him if he did not open the door I should burst it open—he opened the door and I went in—I asked him what he was doing there—he said "Nothing"—by the aid of my lamp I saw the implements produced lying on the font and close to the confessional box—I asked the prisoner if they belonged to him—he said "Yes"—I told him I should take him into custody for being there for an unlawful purpose—I then saw that the con<lb></lb>fessional box was very much disarranged, it was all to pieces, except the back part which was up against the wall—I took the prisoner into custody and also took possession of the tools—the prisoner said "Do not lock me up, let me go and see Mr. Fry"—Mr. Fry is the churchwarden elected by the parish—I said it was on my way to the station, I would call on Mr. Fry—on the way the prisoner said he had been to a carpenter's job in the St. Donat's Road, but the people were not at home—I think he said Smith was the name—I went to Mr. Fry's, and Mr. Fry and the prisoner went back with me to the church—I sent for Alexander Jewell, another constable, who came and made an examination of the church—we searched on the second occasion to see if there was anybody else in the church and found nobody—we shut the door, but the lock would not catch—I saw two men in the St. James' Road before I went into the church, that is near the church—I then went for the verger, Mr. Campbell, and took the prisoner to the station and charged him.</p>

               <p>—I asked what he had done with the tools—he said he had taken them to Mr. Fry's house, where he had taken the prisoner first, and that Mr. Fry had come back to the church—I examined the church to see if any one else was there, and to see if the doors and windows were fastened—they were all fastened except one—no one else was in the church—I sent East for the tools—I examined the confessional—it was all broken up except one side, which was standing—I compared the marks on the confessional with the tools, and they corresponded—I showed it to Mr. Fry—the injuries appeared to me to have been recently done—Mr. Webb then came to the church—I asked him in the prisoner's presence if the confessional was in the same state as when he last saw it; he said no, but that it had been com<lb></lb>pletely destroyed since then—I then sent for the verger, who came, and said he had locked up the church securely—I asked the prisoner what he was doing there—he said he was passing and tried the door, and found it opened and went in to see what was the matter, when the constable came and tried the fastenings—I asked him what he got the tools for—he said he had been to do a job for Mr. Smith—I asked where Mr. Smith lived, and took out my book to put the address down—he said in St. Donat's Road, but he did not know the number—I asked if he bad done the work—he said Mr. Smith was out—this was about 10.30 p.m.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attendant at the church—I was present on the evening of 13th July—there was choir practice, which concluded about 9.30—I went round and fastened all the doors securely before leaving—I went out by the north door and locked it—I delivered the key of this door to Mr. Fry, at his house—the prisoner had come to the vestry that evening during the practice, and given a Mr. McClure ft note—Mr. McClure had come to see Mr. Fry—I was not there two minutes; he did not enter the church at all—that was about 8.15—I was called up about 11.30—I was in bed—I went to the church—I entered what is called the confessional door with the policeman—that is not the north door, but just adjoining it—I had tried that door before I left—it had not been unfastened—I found Mr. Fry, Mr. Webb, the prisoner, and a constable there—I saw part of the confessional lying about.</p>

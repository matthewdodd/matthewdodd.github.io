The prisoner took my lodgings about eighteen months ago; he stayed about twelve months; he took them at 4s. 6d. per week; it was the top room furnished; these articles were let with the room: he left, without notice, four or five months back; he owed four week's rent: I afterwards examined the rooms, every thing was gone except the bedstead; I found that the bed had been cut, and the feathers taken out; about thirty pounds of feathers were gone; I have found some of the things since. He has a wife and two children. I saw him, about two months back, down by Hoare's brewhouse, but did not speak to him - I had before given information to the officers he was taken up about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. C. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you give information? A. About three months since; if I had spoken to him, I should have been knocked about - his wife did not go by the name of Sophia Mendoza; my son's name is Shaw - his name was Jones; I did not, while lodging with me, know that the woman was not his wife; I had never seen him since but that once.</p>

            . I took the prisoner on the 8th of this month, on Tower-hill; I told him that I apprehended him for the robbery at Mr. Shaw's; he said he did not do it, but that the woman did, and Mrs. Shaw knew it for they had a fight about taking away the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner had always borne an excellent character? A. I have known him for years; I met him by accident: I had been in search of him, but did not find him till that day. He had got his living by being a City porter, and was so up to the time that I apprehended him - I have been twenty times down to the wharfs to look for him. The woman,

             re-examined. The prisoner did ask me to get an officer to frighten her out; it was the proposition of some person or persons, but not of mine - I did not frighten her, but the officer did, but not from my proposition. His wife's name was Jones; she went by the name of Mendoza; that was her father's name. I heard a quarrel going on between the prisoner and the woman - I would not have interfered if they had called out murder for a week: he did not tell me she was stealing the feathers - he never told me that the woman was robbing me. I never knew from him, or any other person, that she was stripping the premises, nor did I go up to see in consequence, before he was gone.</p>

             re-examined. As near as I can recollect, I saw the prisoner in Tower-street; he applied to me and said he was in a dilema; he had been living with a creature who had robbed their lodgings, and there was a warrant out against him at the Thames Police; I said"Your are in a pretty scrape;" he said he went home and found the feathers gone, and asked Shaw to come up and see: I went to Shaw, and said to him "You have a man named Jones living with Mendoza, the fighting man's daughter;" he said that the prisoner had had the woman to the Thames Police, and that he ought at that time to have left her, but he was always coming after her - I asked what damage was done, and he said he did not know, but"I will transport him; I can, if it is six months." I told him what the prisoner had stated to me in Tower-street, and that I had come down to tell him; he said she had taken away every thing piecemeal, but he would not apply to her, he would have Jones. I think that he did say that he knew her name to be Mendoza - I said "Jones with the daughter of Mendoza the fighting man;" he said "Yes, the same." I asked what the damage was; he said he could not exactly say what the feathers and irons were worth: I think he said about 7l.; I asked him if he thought Jones had taken anything, he said "He must, they lived together."</p>

            . I heard Shaw say he would compound, if any person would come on behalf of him. I will swear that Shaw said the woman had taken the things, and said something about 7l. It might be three weeks before the prisoner was taken up, that they called on Shaw: I did not know where the prisoner lived; I saw him at work - I went at Mr. Lattimer's request.</p>

             re-examined. I did not like the concern; I did not like to meddle with it, and asked Press to go over too. I thought the longer the prisoner staid away the better; it might be five weeks after. I did not tell Shaw where Jones might be found. Shaw never said that he had taken the woman up, nor that she had stolen the property. Jones went out first; it was about seven o'clock, when he left; the woman went out after. He stated that the woman had been taken to Lambeth Street before, but not for his property.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHAW re-examined. I had heard that the woman was taken to Lambeth-street Office; an officer came to my house and ran up stairs; he asked if a woman named Jones lived there; I said Yes; he said he wanted her: she returned the same day - she was not committed. Shaw was in the habit of coming home every night to the premises.</p>

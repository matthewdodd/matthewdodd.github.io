                  </hi> I am bailiff to Mr. John Scrafton Thompson, of Ilford. On 19th April I counted some sheep of his in a field at Barking—there were seventy-nine at four o'clock that afternoon, and between nine and ten next morning I went to the field, and one was gone—I traced some footmarks into an adjoining fields, and there found marks of blood, where the sheep had been slaughtered—I found the skin there;it was marked "J. S. T."—I knew it to be the skin of the missing sheep—I gave it to Corbyn, the constable—I was present when the butcher afterwards compared some meat with it—the prisoner are strangers to me, but I have seen Webb once or twice.</p>

Charrington's brewery—I could not positively sweat to King's face but his dress and size are the same—I took Webb to the station, opened his bundle, and found it contained about half the carcass of a sheep, quite warm—I afterwards saw the contents of the other bundle; it was about the</p>

Charrington's, and he said, "I will have the parcel; take no notice"—I am certain King is that man—there is a gas<lb></lb>light there, and I could see his features—I gave information to the first police<lb></lb>man I met.</p>

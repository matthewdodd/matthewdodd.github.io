                  </hi>. I am an ostrich-feather manufacturer, in Princes-street, Cavendish-square. On Saturday, 7th June, that house was closed and locked up at 10 o'clock in the evening; my brother and myself closed it—it is in fact two houses with a long room at the back—I left no one there—a policeman was stationed outside to guard it, it being a newly built house—I left there twenty-four bird of paradise feathers, and a great many others—I lost to the amount of 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went again on Monday morning and found the house in great disorder, and a great many boxes were empty, and I missed the property stated—I think it was entered by a key—Mr. Alven came to me on 25th July, and in consequence of what he said, I went to a house in Weir's-court, Somers-town, and saw the prisoner, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission-agent, and live in Duke street, Grosvenor-square. On Kith July, I was called on by a Mr. Scott to value some ostrich feathers for him—I met him at St. Pancras Church, and went with him to the prisoner's to see the feathers, to an alley in Somers town—I saw the feathers now produced, and requested the prisoner to mike an inventory of them, and I would call with Mr. Scott the next morning—I went, and Mr. Scott took a list of the feathers from a list the prisoner made out—the prisoner wanted 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and he asked me my valuation of them—I told him I could not tell for certain—I thought 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I would tell Mr. Scott in the course of the afternoon—I had been in the trade for five or six years—I said the feathers were in a rough state—they were worth that, in my opinion, and no more—the prisoner said he had been offered 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them by a Jew—I heard that Mr. Adcock had been robbed—I communicated with him, and I went with him to the prisoner on the 25th—I asked the prisoner the price—he said 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and no less—Mr. Adcock said, "Where did you get them? they are mine"—the prisoner made no answer and he gave him in charge.</p>

I saw the prisoner turn into Princes-street, about a quarter past 12 o'clock at night—there was a female with him—they went into the doorway of Mr. Adcock's house, which is No. 3—I asked the prisoner what he was doing there—the woman appeared to be drunk—the prisoner said he had got a female the worse for liquor, and he should leave her in my chirp—in consequence of that I took her to the station, and did not see the prisoner afterwards—I was by this means off my beat about two hours—the woman appeared to be drunk when at the station—I know the prisoner, and am certain he is the man.</p>

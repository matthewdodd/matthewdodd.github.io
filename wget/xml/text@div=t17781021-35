               <p>I was not at home when these books were brought into my house.

He said, two books. She asked if he was agreeable to have the room; he said he was, and would bring his girl there by and by to see if she liked it; he said I will leave you these books till I come back again, and he never came back again. She gave them to her little boy, and because he lives with me he brought them to my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Hind Street, Poplar—on 10th March, 1876, about 9.30 p.m., I was going down Shovel Alley, St. George's-in—the-East, with a parcel in my right hand and a stick in my left—a woman cried "Old man, look out, there are some thieves after you"—I heard footsteps behind and turned round—I was seized and my arms were pinioned—one man opened my coat and took my watch and chain and I have not seen it since—I do not know how many there were.</p>

I live at 44, Spencer Street—I was in Shovel Alley on 10th March—I saw Marks coming down the alley with some eggs and butter in his arms—three lads came and took hold of him, unbuttoned his coat, and took his watch and chain—I was 10 yards off—I could not dis<lb></lb>tinguish their faces, but I know the prisoner by his hair—I did not follow them, as I had some coal with me.</p>

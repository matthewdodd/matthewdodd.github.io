I am a saleswoman at Mr. Whiteley's, of West<lb></lb>bourne Grove—on 18th February the prisoner came there and asked to be shown some mantles—I showed her some, and she bought a brown home spun tweed polonaise, price two guineas—she gave me to understand that she had bought a bonnet upstairs, she said she had spent all her ready money and would I change a cheque for her—she had the cheque in her hand, all ready written out—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked her to endorse it—she said she had already written her name there—I asked her to write the address, and was going to get a pen for her, but she took my pencil and wrote "Mitcham," telling me at the same time that she lived at Mitcham, Surrey—I went to the cashier with the cheque—it we receive a cheque from a person who is not a regular customer or not known to us, we always refer to the Directory to see if the name is there—we did refer to the Directory for the name of Low, of Mitcham—I found the name of Low, and the cashier gave me the change, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave it to the prisoner—she gave me the name of Low, Mitcham, Surrey, I thought that was not sufficient—she said "Oh, my husband is very well known in Mitcham"—she put on the polonaise and left a black mantle with me—on Friday, 26th March, I went with Dowdell, the constable, to Hanover Square, Kennington Park Road, I there saw the prisoner sitting at the window, with a baby, we went in and a gentleman, who was in the room introduced her as Mrs. Tanner—Dowdell produced the cheque and asked her if she had ever seen that cheque before—she said no, she did not know anything at all about it—he asked her if she had ever seen me before—she said "No"—I said that was a mis<lb></lb>take, for I-knew her very well, not only by her face, but she had on the same dress and belt that she had when she came to me—I told her so, she said "Oh, it is a mistake"—Dowdell gave her the cheque again and told her to look at it well—she then said to Mr. Tanner "It is one of Mr. Bradbury's cheques"—Mr. Tanner said yes, he believed it was one of his, that he had got him into a great deal of trouble—Dowdell said that she had passed a cheque before at Mr. Marsh's she said yes, she had done so, one of the same, but not signed Simcox, but Bradbury—Dowdell produced the warrant and read it to her—Mr. Tanner said she must go, and asked if she could not wait till the following morning—she asked to go into another room—Dowdell said she could not—she said she must go with her baby and I must go with her—I did so—she asked me if Mr. Whiteley would not take the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that Mr. Tanner would rather pay it than she should go to prison.</p>

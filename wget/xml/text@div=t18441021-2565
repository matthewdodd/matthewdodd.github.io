I was in bed in the forecastle—I heard the prisoner come down the forecastle, and heard him at one of the chests—he sat there a while—I laid awake, and heard him—he went to go up out of the forecastle—I asked where he was going—he said, "On deck"—I asked him a second time, and he said, "To make water"—I asked what he was doing at the chest—he went up the ladder, and ran along the deck—I followed, and he jumped overboard to the next ship—I lost sight of him there for a good bit—the people were all aroused out of bed on the other ships, and they found him under the heel of the howsprit—they put him out of there, and I said, "You have robbed Robert Johnson, give him the money"—he said, "Do you want to rob me"—I said I only wanted some of the money—he delivered up the money into the man's own hands.</p>

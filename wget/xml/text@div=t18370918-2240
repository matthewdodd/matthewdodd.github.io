                  </hi> I know the vice which is now in court—it belong to John Frederick Wheeler, a millwright, who was repairing the Creek bridge, it Greenwich—it was left on the bridge on Monday, the 19th of September—I saw it at half-past six o'clock that evening, and missed it next morning—it had been taken in the course of the night—it was found on the Thursday, I believe, and shown to me—I knew it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday evening, about a quarter past nine o'clock, I received information that two men we stopped with a vice at Williams's, a pawnbroker's, at Greenwich—I went there, and found two men with it—I asked the prisoner, (who was one of them,) if it was his property—he said it was—I asked where he got it from—he said that was his business—I asked who he worked for—he said that was his business—I examined it, and found it answered the prosecutor's description of it, and detained him.</p>

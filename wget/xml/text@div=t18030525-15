               <p>Q.Did the prisoner pass the dog-kennel? - A. Yes; the officer has the cheese, they weigh about five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure the cheese you saw in the binn was the cheese he threw down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure it was your property? - A.It had never been off the premises; it was the same sort we had on the premises.(Mr. Morgan produced the cheese.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of the cheese; it was not light enough to see any body throw it away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. There was a lamp in the shop, I am not certain that it was alight, but there were candles in the shop; it was light enough to see him take it from his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the character of the prisoner? - A.For some months back I have had great suspicions that he has robbed me. <rs id="t18030525-15-verdict77" type="verdictDescription">

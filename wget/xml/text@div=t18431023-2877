                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Anthony, of Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street, St. Luke's; it is our dwelling-house; we sleep in the parlour; the window is about four feet from the ground. On Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 22nd of Sept., about one o'clock, I went home, and got in at the side door—the shop was quite safe—my husband was in bed and asleep—I awoke him up, and gave him his supper in bed—I went to bed, and fell asleep—in one or two hours I was awoke by a dreadful noise, and saw the prisoner crouched down by the side of the bird-cages—my husband asked how she came there—she said she did not know; what way should she get out?—she was quite sober—we sent for a policeman—I found the window wide open—it was shot when I went to bed—the sheets were just under the window the night before—one was covered over the bird-cages—I found the sheets re<lb></lb>moved, the bird-cages broken to pieces, and the birds flying about—the policeman found the sheets and flannel in the yard.</p>

My wife came home—I went to supper, and went to sleep again—I head somebody in the room, got out of bed, got a light, and saw the prisoner crouched up by the side of the bird-cages—I asked how she came there—she said she did not know—she then said, "A man was opening your window"—I said, "I suppose he put you in?"—she said, "I don't know; how shall I get out?"—I said, "I will show you"—I called a policeman, and gave her in charge.</p>

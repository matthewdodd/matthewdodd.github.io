               <p>Q. When had you seen these lambs - A. I had lost lambs frequently; the last time I watched them was with my man no the night of the 3d of September. On the 4th of September, I went out about ten o'clock as usual, I took a round to the fields, I had sheep in three or four fields, I went round to see that they were all safe; as I was coming round Maiden lane that leads from Highgate to Holloway, I looked over the stile, I observed the sheep seemed frightened, and I saw a man rise up. I had my gun in my hand, we got over the stile to see what the man was at; and before we reached him he went down upon his knees and caught a lamb in his arms; we went up to him before he observed us; his back was towards us, he was not above thirty yards off when we first saw him; my man went up to him on the left hand and I on the right; I asked him what he was going to do with the lamb; he immediately let the lamb down; he said he had been to Highgate to see his brother; he was in liquor and and wanted to lie down; which was not the case; I told him he must go with us; he swore he would not; I desired my man to lay hold of him; they had a scuffle; he got from the man; I took to my fowling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him at last - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. Is this field in the high road to London - A. No, it is up by Maiden lane, that leads from Highgate to Holloway; there is a foot path in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from that foot path - A. About thirty yards; he had the lamb up in his arms ready to take away; he had two more tied, ready to take away from the very place where I first saw him rise from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he had the lamb completely in his arms - A. Yes, I am quite certain of it.</p>

            . I went up to the prisoner, he was among the sheep; as he rose up from the sheep he was looking about himself; he went up to where the lamb laid asleep, he stooped and catched up the lamb, and when we came up to him he stood upright with the lamb in his arms; we came up close to him before he saw us. I catched hold of his collar, he said he would not go with us; he got away from me; my master came up with his piece, he said if he would not go with us he would shoot him; we then secured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140044"></xptr>him. In going down the field we saw two lambs tied.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Were all four of the lambs' legs tied - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search this man - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

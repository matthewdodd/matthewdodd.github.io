On Saturday the 6th of October, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was sent to get change for a five pound note; I got change at Mr. Lawrence's, the baker, in Air-street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. What change did you get for the five pound note - A. Four one pound notes, fifteen shillings in silver, and a five shilling paper of halfpence I was coming home; I was within five or six doors of my master's house; the prisoner came up to me; he said, they think this is a bad note; he had a paper in his hand; it turned out to be a lottery bill; he said, I must give him the change again, and before I had time to speak, he snatched the four one pound notes and the halfpence out of my hand. I had the notes in my hand with my hand in my pocket. I had the fifteen shillings and the halfpence in the other hand; he took the notes and the paper of halfpence, and ran away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had a paper in his hand - A. Yes; when he took the notes and the paper of halfpence he shoved the paper into my hand; then he run up Air-street. I looked at the paper; it turned out to be a lottery bill; I hollowed out stop thief several times; he was stopped by Mr. Friend. I am sure the prisoner is the man; I never lost sight of him; he was stopped in Air-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not observed him in the baker's shop, either in the shop or about the shop; had you - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. LAWRENCE. I am a baker in Air-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that young man coming for change at your shop - A. Yes, on Saturday night the 6th of October; it was a five pound note I changed for him. I gave him four one pound notes, fifteen shillings in silver, and five shillings in copper. I did not see the prisoner in the shop or about the shop; there were four notes shewn to me afterwards, but whether they were the notes I cannot say.</p>

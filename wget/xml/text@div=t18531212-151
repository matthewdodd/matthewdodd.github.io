                  </hi>. I reside at Lewisham, Elizabeth Hart was my cook. I never saw the other prisoners till last Friday night—in consequence of some information I employed a policeman to watch my premises on the 2nd</p>

               <p>Dec., but nothing occurred till last Friday night between half past 6 and 7 o'clock—I was walking outside my door, and I saw Elizabeth Hart in the act of letting out of my stable yard gate the other two prisoners—that gate is not used as a door by which persons go to the kitchen—I prevented the prisoners from passing, and at that moment the policeman whom I had employed rushed across the road and apprehended them—he took charge of Angelina Hart and I took Miller, I went with them to the station—the cook followed me from the stable yard gate, and tried to prevent my taking her sisters—she said, <hi rend="italic"></hi>" 0, Mr. Legh, don't take my sisters, take me?"—or words to that effect—we allowed the cook to go back, and she was sent for to the station afterwards and was brought there—a bundle was found in possession of Miller, which was opened in my presence—I know the wrapper of the bundle, it is my property, and has my name on it—it is a kitchen cloth—it contained pieces of bread of various sizes—from her pocket was taken a bottle of milk—she had in her hand and carried to the station this jug, which I identify as my property—the jug was full of soup—Angelina Hart had a basket, a bottle of milk, a paper of rice, and a paper of mixed spice—I know this jug, and the cloth—the other things I cannot swear to—there was some beetroot found.</p>

It</hi> appears so—I have not seen it since—these are the pieces of bread that were in it—the beetroot is not produced, the policeman had it—it was boiled—it was very small—this is the rice and the spice—it was not a page in my service who gave me information—these are the bottles that the milk was in—I have a large family residing in my house, I have five children—I have a governess, a cook, a housemaid, a needlewoman, and a page—I believe the other two pri<lb></lb>soners to be the sisters of Elizabeth Hart, my cook—Miller is married, and has two or three children—I have seen Mr. Kemp" her husband's employer—I have three cows—I do not form anything, except occasionally, when we are overdone with an article, I let a neighbour have some—my cook had been in my service about eighteen months—Mrs. Legh had a verbal character with her from her previous mistress—the gate of my stable yard was locked—I have two front entrances to my house; the smaller one leads to the kitchen, which is the way all tradesmen go—both the doors lead to the road—I saw the houses <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Miller and Angelina Hart searched; nothing was found belonging to me—I believe Angelina Hart is a dressmaker, and lives with her father—I have ascertained that she had made very frequent visits to my house during the last six months.</p>

I was employed in the early part of this month to keep an eye on Mr. Legh's premises—I was there on the night of the 9th of Dec., and about half-past 6 o'clock I saw the prisoners, Miller and Angelina Hart, come to the end of Mr. Legh's house—Miller threw a stone over the wall, and about a minute afterwards the cook let them both in—I remained waiting about half an hour, when the stable yard gate opened; I saw the three prisoners come to the gate—Mr. Legh pre<lb></lb>vented their coming out—I ran across the road to his assistance—I took the bundle from Miller, and the basket from Angelina Hart—I went to the station house with Mr. Legh and the two prisoners—I left the bundle and basket, and went back and brought the cook from the house—I did not see the basket and bundle examined.</p>

I am a widow, and landlady of Grove Cottage, Cooper's Arms Lane, Putney—on the night of 11th April, about 9 o'clock I locked up the cellar door, which opens into the front-garden near the roadway and brought the key in doors—the cellar is contained in the same walls as the house—there is a garden gate which leads into the road—I bolted that and everything was safe at 9 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was present when the door was fastened up by my servant—she is not here—there Were two 18 gallon casks of ale and some empty wine bottles in the cellar the door is fastened by a lock—it is an old house.</p>

I lodge at Grove Cottage and am a tutor—on 11th April, about 12 p.m., I heard a whistle in the street and a sound immediately afterwards—I went out into the Street—I could see-nothing and came into the garden again, and then I heard a sound from the cellar—I found the door was open and I knew from that there was some one in it—I went for my friend—he came down and we held the door till the police came—Barton who was one of the men, surrendered to the police—the other man rushed out as soon as the door was open—Mr. Spedding seized him, but he managed to escape—I could not recognise that man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 90, Harleyford Road, Kennington and am a commercial traveller—on the night of 11th April I was stopping at Grove Cottage, Putney—I was called by Mr. Pringle and saw a light under the bottom of the cellar door and heard noises inside—we held the door till a policeman came—I let go the door—it was dark, and I could just see a man with a black coat and trousers—I held him on the ground by the throat, but he got away—the policeman afterwards found him and I identified him at the station among four—I can't swear to his face, but I can from other evidences, because I picked him out—I said at the Police Court if he was the man they would find some manure and straw on his back where I had him on the ground—the ground was covered with straw manure where I wrestled with him—I can't tell you how I recognised him, but Ipicked him out.</p>

"from Grove Cottage—I went there and found the two witnesses holding the cellar door—immediately I arrived two men rushed out—I secured Barton—he said "I will go quietly with you"—his hand was cut very badly indeed—the two witnesses chased the other man—I could not swear to him—I went back to the cellar and fonud the lock lying on the floor, about two yards inside the door, and a strange key by its side—I found a box of matches in the garden where the other man ran across—the garden gate was closed but not fastened.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard him say at the Police Court "The door was open when we went in"—he said they pushed against the door and that was the cause of the lock falling off.</p>

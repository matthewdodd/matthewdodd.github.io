                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate female, and live at No. 14, Falcon Court, Borough. Last Sunday fortnight, I had 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold when I first came out, about 11 o'clock at night; I went to Mrs. Evans's in Kent Street, between 12 and 1 o'clock, and saw Powderhill sitting there—he said that he had just come out of prison, and had nothing to pay for his lodgings—I gave him two sixpences—I had about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was going out, and he said, "Might not I come with you?" and followed me and an<lb></lb>other young woman out—we went to a coffee shop, and I changed a sove<lb></lb>reign, and gave him some eggs and bacon, and some tea, as he said that he was in want—I had only a half crown out of the sovereign, and we then left and went to the Borough Market—Powderhill and two or three young women, and the boy Timothy Lennard, who is a witness—there are no females allowed in there of a morning, so I gave Powderhill half a crown</p>

               <p>out of the change I got at the coffee shop, and he went in and fetched out some drink, and gave me the change, and we drank outside—we then went to Mr. Clark's, in the Market, and he would not serve us because he knew Powderhill, so Powderhill called the prisoner Leary—we did not go in—we asked for a pot of ale, but he would not serve us, and then we went to Mrs. Pike's in the Borough, where Williams is barman—Leary went with us, and I asked Mr. Williams if he would be kind enough to take care of some money for me—he said, "Yes, <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi>," and as I was pulling my handker<lb></lb>chief, containing fourteen sovereigns and two half sovereigns, from my bosom to give it to him, Powderhill seized my hand and dug his nails into it, and Leary seized me by the neck, and knocked me down on the floor backwards—I did not state it to the Magistrate, but when I was down Powderhill had his knee on my stomach—I held my handkerchief tight, but was obliged to let it go, and Powderhill got it, and a half sovereign fell out, which the police<lb></lb>man gave me back—Powderhill ran out at the door, and then Leary ran out, and I <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> him by the coat, and held him till the policeman came—I am sure he is the man; there was nobody else there—on the way to the station, Leary said, "Let me go, and I will find <hi rend="italic">Jessee</hi> and will get you six <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>"—Powderhill is called <hi rend="italic">Jessee</hi>—I said, "Go with the constable, and I shall be satisfied if you find <hi rend="italic">Jessee</hi>"—I was saving the money up to go to America—a captain allowed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and I had a witness to prove it—they wanted to bring a robbery against me, but the gentleman said that I was not the woman—I had more money than that—I do not wish to give the captain's name to disgrace him.</p>

(THE COURT <hi rend="italic">cautioned the witness that she need not answer any question if it would tend to criminate herself.</hi>) I did not tell you I got it altogether from a captain; I told you a captain allowed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and I was saving it up to go to America—he first came to Mrs. Evans's with me six years ago—he began to allow me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week four years ago—I last saw him six weeks ago—I do not intend to answer any more questions—I was never in such a place before—I will not tell you how much money I had six weeks ago, or five weeks ago, or two months ago, or how much I had in Oct. or Sept. last, or when I last counted the money—there was fifteen sovereigns and two half sovereigns in my handkerchief when I went out—I put them in on Friday morning where I live—a good many people live in the house besides; a number of unfortunate females—Powderhill lived there, and there are married people there—I had not told those persons that day or the day before that I had 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that any person ever saw me with that 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before that night—I took the money out because I had had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with the young man I was cohabiting with; he cut my head open, and I was taken to St. Thomas's Hospital—I had the sixteen sovereigns then in my possession—that was on the Wednes<lb></lb>day before, I am quite certain of that—I did not pay for my conveyance to this Court this morning—I have been in prison and was remanded—I will not tell you when I first got into prison—I have been in prison ever since I preferred this charge; it was because Powderhill said that I had stolen something—it was about the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a gentleman came into Horsemonger Lane to identify the woman who took his money—I do not know who the woman was who took his money.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On 27th March the prosecutrix came to my mother's house—I was in bed, but was called up, and sent for some tobacco—I do not know who sent me—I dare say the prosecutrix paid for it—I took a shilling—the change out was 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the prosecutrix told me to keep it—after that, I went with her to Evans's lodging house—I saw <hi rend="italic">Jessee</hi> and a young woman; they call Powderhill <hi rend="italic">Jessee</hi>—we all went to a public house, and then to a coffee shop—we had refreshment at both those places, the prosecutrix paid for it—after that we went to a public house in the Borough Market, and had some liquor outside the door—as we went through the Borough Market, Leary was standing by himself, and Powderhill called her; we then all went to Mrs. Pike's—I cannot say what we had to drink there—the prosecutrix said to the barman, "Mr. Williams, will you be so kind as to mind a few pounds," or "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?" I do not know which she said—he said, "Yes, I will"—she drew her handkerchief from her bosom, and <hi rend="italic">undone</hi> it, and was in the act of pulling out some, when <hi rend="italic">Jessee</hi> made a snatch at it, and said, "<hi rend="italic">He</hi> shall not have it"—they were scuffling a short while, and Leary went into the scuffle, and whether he was trying to get the money to give it back to the young woman I do not know—I saw her fall on the ground, and Leary was on the ground a short time, but he was no sooner down than he was up—I saw no one's hands on the prosecutrix's throat, and saw no one on the top of her—there were these two young men, and she was in between—<hi rend="italic">Jessee</hi> ran away, and the young woman seized Leary by the coat, and held him, and gave him to a policeman—he tried to get away.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 64). On Saturday morning 28th March, I saw Powderhill at the Crown public house, Kent Street—after that, about 6 o'clock in the morning, I received information of the robbery, and took him into custody; he was running away, but I cried, "Stop thief!" and took him—going to the station he called to his wife, or his woman, "Turn <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi> up three <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>, or I shall be <hi rend="italic">lagged"</hi>—I had seen him in a public house. but did not know whether he was the person, and went back to the Golden Lion, to the prosecutrix, returned with her, and she said, "That is him," and he ran.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know Annie? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was present when she was detained—there is no charge made against her at present, but she is still in custody—there is no charge entered at the station against her—I have heard that she has been before a Magistrate about robbing a person, but do</p>

               <p>not know it for a fact—she is under remand because she cannot find security.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrate consider her as a person of no great character, and say that having received an offer he should have her made to appear as a witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a person came to identify her last Saturday week as a woman who robbed him of a large sum of money, but said that he would not be positive, but she resembled the party, and I understand he charged another party with it afterwards—he said nothing about the party being an orange woman.</p>

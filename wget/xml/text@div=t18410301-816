                  </hi>. I live in Charlton-street, Fitzroy-square. I know Mr. Francis Richbell, a broker, at No. 4, Lower Charlton-street. On the evening of the 8th of February, about half-past 7 o'clock, I was in my shop sawing wood, and saw the prisoner go by the prosecutor's shop, backwards and forwards, and handle a child's cot which stood there—I watched him for half an hour—I went into the private door of my house with a pair of steps, I then saw the prisoner take two tubs up from Mr. Richbell's door, and go away—I followed him into Marylebone-street, and found him sitting on the tubs, and, seeing me, he ran away, leaving them behind him, and his bat in the tubs—I followed him, crying "Stop thief"—he was stopped in Noble-street, by Crosby, without my losing sight of him—he was taken to Richbell's shop—he then said, "Give me my hat"—I gave it to him—there was an old knife and fork, and an old iron in the tub—he had carried them about 200 yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was impossible to see a man put the tubs down—I ran after the man—he let the man go that took them, and stopped me. <hi rend="italic">Wit<lb></lb>ness.</hi> There was a candle burning within two yards of the tub, and a gas-light on each side the house—there were two shutters up, but they did not prevent my seeing the tubs—they were on a grating by the door.</p>

I was in Noble-street on the 8th of February, and heard a cry of "Stop thief,"—I saw the prisoner run past me, and turn down Marylebone-street without his hat—I ran after him, and stopped him—he asked what I stopped him for, and began crying—I said I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and wished him to come back to see what was the matter—he said he had not been thieving any thing—I took him into the shop—he asked for his hat, and George charged him with stealing the two tubs—he de<lb></lb>nied taking them—I gave him in charge—I at first saw him running from Marylebone-street into Noble-street—as I brought him back, I met George with the tubs, and the hat in them—Mr. Richbell is not here.</p>

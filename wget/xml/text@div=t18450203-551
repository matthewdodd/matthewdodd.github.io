I live at Deptford—the prisoner is my brother—he lodged with us, but used to go away for a month or two months together—when he came home, my mother used to clothe him, and soon after he would rob us—I had a pair of gloves and a handkerchief safe on the 26th of Dec.—I missed them on the 3rd of Jan.—this is the handkerchief—the gloves have not been found—my husband has been away two years—I have one child, which is a year and ten months old—I have had no quarrel with the prisoner—I went down to a party the evening that he robbed me—I live with my mother who is independent—she knows of this prosecution but she is not here—my father was a publican, and lived in Stone-street, Borough-market—I was but four years old when he died—my mother was not in business long after he did—his property was more than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe, and when my motherdies it will be divided amongst us—there are five of us.</p>

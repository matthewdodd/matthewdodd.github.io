               <p>on duty in Castle-street, Leicester-square, and saw the prisoners and another man, named Hints, and two other girls, coming out of Cranbourne-passage, using very bad language—I heard one of them say, "Let the b——h have it"—I followed on the other side of the street, thinking there would be a brawl, and when I got opposite Earl's-court, I saw McCormack, Hide, and the man not in custody, holding the prosecutrix up against the shutters in Earl's-court—White was standing two or three yards off, and I believe it was she who called out,"Here is Gordon,"as I crossed the street—I am certain the prisoners were all there—they then took to their heels as fast as they could, got round to the back of Little Newport-street, and I lost them—I came back, and the prosecutrix was not there—I am quite sure McCormack is the man who was there—I have known him six years—he lives in Tooley-court, and the other two live in Clement's-lane.</p>

               <p>JAMES TREVILLIAN. I live in New Inn-street, Shoreditch. I employed the prisoner to help to remove some goods from Trimbley-court - I put this bed on his head with two sheets tied up in a blanket - he was to put them on the waggon, to go from the same house - I came down with a bundle - the prisoner and the bed were gone - I went after him for about an hour - I then caught him, and said,"What have you done with my bed?" - he said, "I know nothing about it" - I took him to the waggon and said,"For God's sake tell me where you have put the bed, for I have no other" - he still refused, and I gave him in charge - they found 2s. 6d. in his pocket, and 15s. in his mouth; and this duplicate was found inside the fold of his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you say, "I am short of money, you must pawn this bed?" A. No.</p>

            . I was a police-serjeant. I took the prisoner - I found half-a-crown and some half-pence in his pocket - the inspector said he had something in his mouth - the officer seized him, and from his mouth he dropped 5s. and a half-a-sovereign.</p>

            , I am in the service of Mr. Castle. This bed was pawned by the prisoner for a guinea, in the name of John Smith - I gave him a sovereign and some half-pence.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor employed me and six or seven more to remove some goods, about five or six o'clock, as he was going to leave his wife, unknown to her - between seven and eight o'clock, he was coming downstairs, and said to me, "I am short of money, you must sell this bed or pawn it; and if they stop you, or ask any question, say you are going to leave your wife" - I took it, and when I came back, the landlord said he had gone with the goods - I asked for my hat, and they said he had thrown it into the van - I saw him afterwards, and he said, "What have you done with the bed?" - I said, "You know very well" - he told me to keep the duplicate till he saw me alone.</p>
               <p>JAMES TREVILLIAN. I was removing; but I did not give him the bed to pawn.</p>

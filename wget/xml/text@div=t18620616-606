                  </hi>. I am an agent, and live in Carnaby-street—on 27th May, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Long-acre, going home, and as I crossed over from Covent-garden, the prisoner seemed to come out of a house with two women—Williams placed his hands on my waistcoat pockets—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away, saying, "You have made a mistake"—he again in a more determined manner placed his hands upon me a second time, and I more violently shoved him away; I turned to walk away, and received a blow on the back of my neck from McCarthy, and at the same time felt his hand on my coat tail pocket; I turned round and knocked him down—I had a full opportunity of seeing both the prisoners, and am certain of them—I walked away down Long-acre, and when I got into St. Martin's-lane, I heard footsteps running after me, and the two men and two women saying, "That is him"—some of them ran on one side of the street and some on the other—not wishing to go up the dark street, I stood at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, and Williams halloed out to McCarthy, <hi rend="italic">"Jack,</hi> that is him; give it to him," and he <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> up to me—as I was defending myself Williams tried to come to this side and attack me also, and the women were about me—I halloed for the police, and a gentleman came up, Mr. Fichon, who saw all the latter part of it.</p>

               <p>and attempted to strike me a second time, I thought of charging them with attempting to rob me, and I knocked McCarthy down—I was perfectly sober—I had been sitting with an invalid friend at Brixton all the evening—I left Brixton at 12 o'clock, and walked over alone—I had on a white waistcoat like this—Williams said to the policeman that he spoke to me thinking I was a friend of his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of 3, Bridge-street, Westminster—on 27th May, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I was turning out of Cran<lb></lb>bourn-street into Upper St. Martin-lane, and heard cries of "Police!"—I looked in that direction and saw five figures, two men hitting a third man, and two women—the two men were the prisoners—I never lost sight of them till they were lodged in Vine-street station—the prosecutor is the man they were attacking—I did not see anybody on the ground.</p>

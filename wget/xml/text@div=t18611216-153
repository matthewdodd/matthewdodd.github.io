                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Abbott, of 58, Blackfriars-road, a licensed dealer in wine—on Monday evening, 25th November last, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner, and a man named Quebeck, came into my shop together—the prisoner asked for a pint of half-and-half, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Quebeck</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Ekstedt, who acts as pianist at this house in the Blackfriars-road—I was there on 25th November, and saw the prisoner there about 9 o'clock that evening, in company with a short dark man, named Quebeck, whom I have seen since—they had a pint of half-and-half—I did not see it paid for—about an hour, or an hour aid ten minutes afterwards, the prisoner came in—he then appeared very tipsy—he called for something to drink, I do not know what—Mrs. Abbott said, "I expected you back again," and in the meantime the dark one came in—I am certain they were the same two men whom I saw drinking together about an hour before.</p>

                  </hi>. This is part of a bad shilling, and this is some melted metal which has passed through the fire—it is the same kind of metal as we find coins made of, and judging by its weight, and what it would lose in passing through the fire, I should say it was just the weight used for a half-crown—I have had great experience in coins for many years—a good half-crown would not melt if thrown into the fire—some of this would adhere to the cinders—there is too much metal here for a shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was the worse for liquor; I went to the theatre. I had a half-crown, and in the burry and excitement of getting in, I did not think of looking at my two shillings change. As I was going home, I went into this woman's house and called for the ale; I gave her the shilling, and she said it was bad. I begged her pardon, and said I did not know it was bad; she gave me the two pieces of a shilling back. I said, "They are no use to me," and laid them on the counter. She sent for a constable and I said I did not know it was bad; she said I must tell the Magistrate that.</p>

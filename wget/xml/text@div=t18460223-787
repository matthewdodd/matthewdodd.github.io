                  </hi>. I am foreman of the stone-yard of the parish of St. Mary, Newington. The prisoners have worked there for some months—I receive money from the officers of the parish every morning to pay the men employed in the stone-yard—on the 14th I received 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that purpose, six half-crowns and a sixpence—I put it inside this book, and put it in a counting-house in an inner shed, which is connected with the stone-yard—the prisoners were at work there that day—the dinner time is from one to two o'clock—the men went to dinner at that time; and I changed one half-crown to give the men some halfpence, and put the remainder in the book—I locked both the door of the counting-house and the outer door shed—I have the charge of the counting-house for the parish—it belongs to the stone-yard, which belongs to the governors and guardians of the poor—I left the keys at the lodge, leaving five half-crowns and a sixpence in the closet—I returned at two o'clock, found the bolt pushed back of the outer door shed, and also the bolt of the counting-house door—I went to the closet, and found the money gone—the prisoners had gone away, and did not come back to finish their work—they had a small portion of work to do, which would have entitled them to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—they had worked in the yard the day before, and remained to the stone-yard to the dinner hour that day—on missing the money, I went for a policeman, went with him, and found the prisoners at their lodging, in the Mint—I gave Winton in charge—I then went to a building, and called "Cooper"—I got no answer—I went up, and found him there—he must have heard me call—they were searched at the station-house, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on the two—I was present—neither of them had the same dress on as they worked in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On Saturday, the 14th, I went with Single<lb></lb>ton to the Mint, and found both the prisoners there—Winton first—Cooper, I believe, ran out of the house—Singleton brought him to me—I took both to the station—in going along Winton said to Cooper, "They cannot swear to the money"—I searched Cooper at the station and found on him a knife, two half-crowns, sixpence, a penny, and one halfpenny; and on Winton, one half-crown, two shillings, and fourpence—I asked why they left the workhouse—theysaid they had heard of another job—I asked where—they said at the docks—I asked which docks—they could not tell me—I went to the work-house, examined the outer shed, and saw some sharp instrument had hooked the bolt of the lock back, and the marks corresponded with the knife—I examined the counting-house door, and found a piece of wood had been cut away by screwing the knife round, and there is a little gap in the knife—I tried both the locks to see if I could put them back with the knife after they were locked, and I did.</p>

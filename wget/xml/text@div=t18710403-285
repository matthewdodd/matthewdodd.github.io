                  </hi>. I live at 5, Rupert Court—last Thursday week, about 11 o'clock, I was with my sister, in a public-house, in Coventry Street—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket, and two keys, and a notice to quit the apartments I was in—we saw the prisoner there—he told us to drink up, and he would refill the measure—I put my hand in my pocket, and found it perfectly empty—I accused him of taking my keys, and said that if he did not deliver them to me I would give him in custody, and he knocked me down—I gave him in custody, and the keys and the notice to quit were found on him—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

               <p>penal servitude; I did five years and eight months. On the next day I received 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the Society.

I was going to Castle Street to get a lodging, and met the prosecutrix by the "Alhambra;" she said "I will take you where there are lodgings." She took me to Castle Street, and said "Come in here, and have a glass of something." I did so, and she said "You have come from Chatham; I know by your clothes; my <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> is doing fire years now." I wanted to get away, but she clung to my arm, and said "Come along with me." I shoved her, and she caught her eye against the door; I was very sorry. As to the key and the other things, I know no more than you do how I got them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, and live at 26, Gower Place, Easton Square—upon the afternoon of the 27th March, about 2.45, I went into the African Chief, in Somers Town, and there met Cain's brother—I bad previously known him—the prisoners were there—I remained three-quarters of an hour—I treated them—I wanted a cab; Cain's brother fetched a four-wheeler—Cain and I got in—we drove away and stopped at the Rising Sun, in Euston Road—I had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy, and Cain a glass of ale brought to the cab; Cain had asked me what my watch and chain were worth at the African Chief—I said 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took it out in the cab while it was waiting at the Rising Sun—we then drove on—in Grafton Street, I received a blow in my face, and another on the top of my head—I had two black eyes; Cain gave me the blows—he and I were the only persons in the cab—I had 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket—we struggled; I felt a tug—the cab was stopped—I missed my watch; a policeman came up—we drove to the station and then got out—the constable walked by the side of the cab; I told the inspector Cain had robbed me, but he declined to take the charge; I was in liquor—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a part of my chain—it dropped from my waist<lb></lb>coat button when I was standing in the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I treated the men to whisky, I never drink it myself; four or five men were there—I have known Cain and his brother for some time—Cain's wife has worked as charwoman for us for five or six years—I told the Magistrate I had a blow on the nose; that gave me the black eyes—I was sitting on the back seat inside and the prisoner was sitting opposite—the window was broken in the struggle—I looked at my watch to see the time when we got in the 'cab at the African Chief, I saw it while we were stopping at the Rising Sun; I said so before the Magistrate—I did not charge Cain till we got to the station—I was not charged at the station with being drunk—the officer picked up off the floor the piece of chain—that was not when I first accused Cain of robbing me—I did not quarrel with Cain in the cab nor say "I have got you alone"—I never thought of striking Cain; I believe I did strike him, I never said I did not; I only struck him in my own defence in the scuffle once or twice—no complaint has ever been made against me as a coffee-house keeper.</p>

I am a cabman, ray number is 1,626—I live at 12, Cooper's Buildings, St. Pancras—on the afternoon of March 27th I took up a fare at the African Chief at the corner of Chapel Street—Cain called me as I was coming down the road; I know him by sight—they were all drink<lb></lb>ing and I had to wait some time—Banks and Cain got into the cab—as I started I noticed Waugh on the pavement—I drove on till we got to the Rising Sun, about 150 yards off; when we stopped I saw Waugh again; he had followed us—another young man was with him—we drove on after a while—my attention was attracted by a noise in the cab when we had gone about a quarter of a mile—I heard scuffling and saw Cain's elbow come through the window—I stopped the cab and got down—I saw Waugh running away—I saw Cain hit Mr. Banks twice, once on his right eye and once on his nose; that was after the men were running away—I gave a boy a penny to fetch a constable while I held up Banks by the collar—I went to the</p>

About 3 o'clock on the afternoon of 27th March I was called to Grafton Street where I saw a cab and the pro<lb></lb>secutor and the prisoner Cain in it; I took it to the station—the prosecutor was the worse for liquor, and was bleeding over the left eye—while in the station a piece of chain dropped—I asked the prosecutor whose it was—he then accused Cain of taking his watch and chain—Cain said "I have not got the watch on me," and began to pull his clothes off in the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Cain did not say he had not stolen the watch, but that he had not got it—there was no charge made till the piece of chain fell—I had them in charge for being drunk and disorderly—Cain was charged with stealing the watch and chain that night, but it was not taken till the next morning, because the prosecutor was drunk.</p>

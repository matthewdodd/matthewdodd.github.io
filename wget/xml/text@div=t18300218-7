L. Watkins, coach-founder and plater, No. 90, Long-acre, London;" he gave me a card similar to this, as an introduction, wishing me to give him money for the bill I now hold in my hand; I then told him I would not - it had an acceptance on it at that time; he had been waiting for me in my house an hour before he gave me the card - I was down in the cellar; I told him I would not give him the money for it - he then mentioned my brother's name; my brother is inspector of pavements to St. Martin's board - he said he knew him, and had seen him several times; I told him if my brother wished for the bill to be answered by my giving money for it, he would get a note from him to testify that the bill was a legal and honourable transaction; he went away, came again next day, and brought a note from my brother; I have not got that here - I have searched for it, but did not preserve it; I have every reason to think it is lost or destroyed; the bill is the only document I have preserved; my brother knew the inhabitants of the parish so well, I was aware if the transaction was honourable he would be able to ascertain whether it was so; the note, as near as I can recollect, said, "Dear brother, I have made diligent inquiry as to the respectability of the house of Messrs. Long and Son, and saving lived so many years where they now do, I consider the bill perfectly safe, and if you wish to serve the young man I think you may do it with safety;" after seeing that document, the prisoner sat down in the parlour some time, called for something to eat, and asked me to have it cooked for him; he sat there some time - I called him to the bar, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180015"></xptr>inquired of him the nature of the bill; he said it was as safe as the Bank - that he knew it was usual on such occasions to allow more than legal interest; I observed to him that I should not do so, I should take 5 per cent. interest, and no more - I then made a calcuation, and took the bill from him - I gave him a 30l. and a 20l. note, also from 8s. to 10s. in silver, and his lunch was not paid for; among the silver there happened to be a bad 5s. piece - he immediately said, "This will not do for me - this is a bad one;" I did not know it myself - I changed it for him: he then said he would take the remaining part in wine and spirits; he said it was of no consequence to him, as when a gentleman called on him on business it looked very respectable to ring the bell and call the servant, requesting her to bring a bottle of wine out of No. 5 bin, and two or three other names he mentioned, for a person that was looking forward in the world; thinking him a respectable tradesman I sat down about ten minutes with him in the parlour after he received the money, and he had a glass of brandy and water; I had one with him, and in ten minutes he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave the bill in your possession from the first day he came to the second? A. To the best of my recollection he did; I had no idea at the time that it was not proper - the bill has never been out of my possession, except when I gave it to James Miles, my brother, to present when due - it was out of my possession then, but at no other time; he brought it back to me, and I have had it ever since: having received information on the afternoon of the day he gave me the bill, I showed it next morning to a neighbour, and while I was doing so his father-in-law, John Rogers, came into the bar - in consequence of what he said I made application at Bow-street for a warrant, which I placed in Herring's hands; that was two days after I gave him the money for the bill; I attempted myself to find out where the prisoner was, but did not succeed - he was not apprehended on this charge; to the best of my recollection he was taken last Monday fortnight - I did not see him from the time I gave him the money for the bill till he was at the office; I have had no conversation with him since.</p>

               <p>Q. Then when they are called supernumerary sergeant, it is not that he is a sergeant of the marines. - A. No, only the rank; all the supernumeraries on board are entitled to a private seaman's share, twenty-four pounds, one shilling and six-pence; they are put upon that class.</p>

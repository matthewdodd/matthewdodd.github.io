            . I am in partnership with Mr. Cole. Dory and Groves came one morning for one hundred bushels of grains. I do not recollect what day it was; they had one hundred bushels, for which, I believe, Dory paid; I received three sovereigns, and said, "This is just right;" as I thought it was two sovereigns and a half, my sight not being good; he said, "How much are they a bushel?" I then saw it was three sovereigns; I gave them to another man, who, I believe, gave change. I saw "S. Howard, Rickmansworth," on the waggon. There were no horses in it when I first saw it, but afterwards there were four - I think one was grey.</p>

            , and live on Hounslow-heath. Fielder's house is on Hounslow-heath: on the 15th of March, about eleven o'clock in the morning (I think) I saw a waggon with four horses standing at his house. I did not read the name on it - I saw two men with the waggon - Dory is like one of them; I saw him before the Magistrate - he was then dressed like the man on the waggon, but I cannot be certain of him - I believe him to be the man; there were grains in the waggon. I saw a sack nearly full put on the other man's back from the waggon; it was carried round Fielder's house. I did not see Fielder then - I had seen him before, talking to the two men with the waggon - the man on the waggon put the sack on the other man's back, who carried it round the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live next door to Fielder? A. Yes; his premises are enclosed in front, but open on the side - he is a carman; he does hired work, has a little land, and keeps pigs and horses. I have frequently seen him buying grains of a man who sells them - he generally goes himself to Mr. Palmer, a brewer, for them - but at times people come and sell to him. I am sure I saw him and his son speak to the men. I know a boy named Gritteridge; my husband is a carpenter - there never was any dispute between him and Fielder; my husband was discharged under the Insolvent Act in July, and there was a little difference between them then, but since that they have been friendly. I believe Fielder can neither read nor write.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do people who sell grains at his door come with a waggon and four horses? A. No; a jobbing man comes with a cart and one horse. Two of the horses were brown.</p>

            . I live at Hounslow. I know Fielder, and I know Dory's person; on the 15th of March, in the morning, I was by Fielder's house, and saw a waggon directly opposite. Dory and Groves were with Fielder, and his son stood close by the waggon, which was loaded with grains - it was a large one - I did not notice how many horses there were. I saw Dory on the waggon - he filled the sack with grains from the waggon - it was taken into Fielder's yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was Fielder at that time? A. Standing by the waggon.

            . I was in Mr. Howard's employ - Dory was my fellow-servant - he kept the nags. On the 14th of March Mr. Howard sent me to the brewery for grains - we got a hundred bushels - Dory paid for them - I do not know how much; we put one bushel into the stable for the horses, and then went towards home. Dory called at a house on Hounslow-heath as we went - he went on before the horses, and called at the house; I came up soon after - he spoke to somebody, but I did not see who it was. When we returned home, Dory went on before, and spoke to Fielder on the heath. Dory got up on the waggon, and bid me come up, and put some grains into one of master's sacks, which we had taken some grains in for the horses. I carried the sack of grains into Fielder's stables, emptied them out, and brought the sack away - Fielder stood by the yard in view of me and Dory. I did not know him before, nor was I ever that road before - we were opposite the house three or four minutes - Fielder said nothing to me - I did not hear him speak to Dory. We all went to a public-house, and Fielder wished me good day - he told us to call again. When we got home Dory gave me 2s. 11/2d., and said that was my share - he did not say what of. We were about ten minutes in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. How long are you going to Twickenham and back? A. I was never that road before - master gave us 2s. between us for going; we went away about eleven o'clock at night, and returned before dark next day. Dory went on to Fielder's house before me - I carried the sack in; I have been accused of stealing the grains - master said if I would tell the truth he would forgive me. Dury said nothing to me about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Dory call at the same house in the morning? A. I did not see him go in in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often did you go into the stable? A. Only once; there were about two bushels and a half in the sack - I received 2s. 11/2d. as my share - grains are sixpence a bushel; no explanation was given me by Dory. I was committed as the thief; I saw Cook the constable once while I was in Newgate - he did not ask me to accuse my fellow-servant. Mr. Fellows, the lawyer said, I was to come as a witness, and asked what I knew about it - he said if I would be of use on the trial, I should not be prosecuted; this was the day before yesterday. I heard Fielder say nothing about the grains.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time in the morning did you cross the heath to go to the brewery? A. A little before four o'clock, I think - there was then some hay for the horses on the waggon. Dory did not say what the 2s. 11/2d. was the share of - the waggon stopped on the heath as we went, for three or four minutes, just opposite Fielder's. I was behind the waggon, and saw a man speak to Dory, but cannot say who it was - he came from Fielder's yard.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was dark at four o'clock? A. Yes, rather - it appeared to be a man that I saw.</p>

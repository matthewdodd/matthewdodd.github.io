               <p>I am a watchman of Whitechapel; my beat is down Rosemary-lane; going along, the prosecutor called out watch! he came out of the Windmill public-house; he said he had been robbed; he said so in the house, in the prisoner's presence, and requested me to take custody of him; he said the prisoner had knocked him down, and robbed him of his watch and eighteen shillings; I took them both to the watch-house, and the prisoner was committed: there was another man and a woman at the public-house; the man said he would go voluntarily with me; but he ran away; I left the prisoner in the custody of Mr. Lanson; the other was discharged, because the prosecutor could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went from the watch-house with you, to New-prison, was I any way confined? - Only I took hold of you.</p>
               <p>Did not I walk quietly with you? - Certainly; if you had not, you must.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. When did you see your money or your watch, before you was robbed? - I had it in my hand coming down the Minories: I went to see what it was o'clock; I swear positively the prisoner was the person that took the watch out of my pocket, and no other; I saw it in his hand with the string, holding it up over my head to the woman; I had a pint of beer, and I believe, and am sure, there was above the money I put down in the indictment; every identical thing was taken from me, and my handkerchief; but I would not put it in the indictment; I did not think it worth while; I mentioned the handkerchief to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Court to Pentelow. Did the prosecutor say any thing to you about losing the handkerchief? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>To prosecutor. Where do you live? - I lodge in the middle of Stratford; I did work for one Mr. Bond in Stratford, about three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>What reward is there in this prosecution? - I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you ever prosecute a man before? - No; I have heard since, lately, about the reward; I have been told by several.</p>
               <p>Who told you? - I cannot say; I have heard it several times; I have heard it about half a year ago: I think it would be worse for me to sell my soul to the devil; I think my soul of more consequence than his life.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the night beadle at Whitechapel: the prisoner was brought to the watch-house: Mr. Tate, when he came in, seemed to be very much in liquor; he made a kind of a stagger towards our door in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130058"></xptr>Did he talk like a sober or a drunken man? - The chief of his talk was, that the prisoner had robbed him of his property; I set the charge down in the book; the watchman said in the presence of the prisoner, that there was another man in company, who ran away from him; I asked the watchman if he knew him? he said his name was Bassett: we went and took Bassett out of bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish that witness to produce a paper that he has? - I told him I would give it him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a navy warrant, to join the Otter sloop of war, where I was going down to, that was at North Yarmouth.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I arrived in London five days before this happened, in consequence of a warrant I received from the Navy-office, to join the Otter sloop of war; I was going down Rosemary-lane to see a person of the name of Alexander M'Enzie; I went inadvertently into this public-house to get a pint of beer; I belonged to the Oriel, a seventy-four, before this warrant was sent to me from London to Plymouth; my general character depends on his Majesty's Navy; going into the house, my prosecutor went in near on the same time; his foot slipped up the step; I was behind; I was in the public-house about the space of ten minutes before he charged me with the robbery; I went out into the tap-room, and was searched by his request; I had nothing about me; the night was so exceedingly dark, that had I met an old acquaintance, I declare to God I could not have known him; further, the prosecutor in his deposition before the justice, has varied; for he said I walked away; now he says I ran away.</p>
               <p>(The deposition handed up.)</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Did you drink with the prisoner? - No, I did not: he said I did, but I did not; nor yet was he ever searched; he offered to be searched before the justice, but the justice said it was of no use to search him.</p>
               <p>Did you say he walked away? - First he walked, then he ran; then he walked into the house.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say before the magistrate, that he walked? - Yes; I said he ran, and then walked, and then ran at the later end.</p>
               <p>Court to Pentelowe. In what condition did you find the prosecutor, as to his figure and appearance? - He might be a little in liquor; he did not seem any way dirted much; he looked a little reddish about the face; his clothes were all over mud.</p>
               <p>Court to Langhorn. How did he appear to you? - Why, he was muddy, very muddy; all his back was muddy, and his face; but I saw nothing about his face either of blows or redness.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prosecutor the next day? - Only the Monday.</p>
               <p>Did you see any mark or any blow about his forehead, or any appearance of it? - No</p>
               <p>Court to Pentelowe. When did you see the prosecutor? - I saw the prosecutor on Monday.</p>
               <p>Had he any mark on his forehead? - I could not find any, nor did not see any.</p>

               <p>I am a tallow-chandler and oil-man: On the 17th of November last, a person, quite a stranger to me, called at my house, and offered vinegar for sale, with a sample in a vial; he asked me if I wanted any; I told him I did not, supposing he had come from some maker; I asked him where he came from; he said, he was not in the trade, his name was Shaw, an ironmonger, at Islington; he had sent goods into the country, and the person had sent up half a hogshead of vinegar, soap, and candles in part of payment: he said the cost price was 35s. and if I would have it, I should have it for 30s.; I told him I had plenty in the house; he said afterwards he would take 20s. for he did not know what to do with it, he did not know any body in the trade; it was brought to me, by a man now in Court, in about an hour upon a truck, and I paid him the money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen that man since? - A. No.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Maynard: On Saturday the 19th of December, about three o'clock, as I was at work in my master's yard, pumping some vinegar out of the vats, and in pumping I wanted a wisp to put under the cock because it should not splash over; when I was placing that wisp, I hit my hand against something, and could not tell what it was; I thought it had been a stick; I held it fast; I thought to pull it away from me, but could not; I got a candle to look, and then it was gone; I found a hole in the wall about three quarters of an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if the brick had fallen out, or was it circular? - A. It appeared to have been done on purpose, as if it was bored; I called the cooper; he brought with him a twig about three foot long; we put it into the wall to see how far it would go, and it went quite through the wall, which I suppose is 14 or 15 inches thick; I desired him to acquaint my master; he went and fetched my master, and he saw the hole as well as me and the cooper.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I work for Mr. Maynard, in the occupation of a cooper: On Saturday the 19th, the last witness called me and told me had found a hole in the wall; I went to him with a light, but the pipe was gone; I acquainted my master, and fetched a constable; when the constable came, I got over our premises into their's by a ladder; when I got over, I saw under their shed three half hogsheads full of vinegar; there was a fourth partly full.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those half hogsheads in a line opposite to the vat where Mr. Maynard kept his vinegar? - A. Yes; I went into the house and saw Mrs. Sankey, but nobody else belonging to the house; we searched for instruments, as we supposed there must be, to draw vinegar from our premises, but did not find any for the space of an hour and an half; upon looking at another hole, where there had been some more appeared to be drawn off, by there being a great slop at the place, I discovered two tubes and a rod that goes through to take out a screw that is in the vat, (producing them); this screw is put in by them, and answers the purpose of a peg to the vat; after we had found these things, we tried whether they would answer the purpose of drawing the vinegar, and we found that it would, for we drew a pail full in five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner a married woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her husband in the house at the time? - A. No; if he was, he was not to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to the property? - A. No.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of the month, Mr. Sankey, I believe it was, (I have understood so since), asked me to draw a truck for him to Mr. Pitman's, the corner of Dyot-street, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Court. You see, Gentlemen, although this practice seems to have pretty considerably prevailed, yet the prisoner's husband is the person who appears to have given orders: if the husband had been absent, it might have been a different thing; the husband being present, and giving the order, it appears to me that it is impossible to find her guilty.</p>

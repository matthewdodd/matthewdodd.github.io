            . I am a constable. On the 24th of December last, about half past nine in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Marston's house. I watched him into a public-house, the corner of Wych-street. He did not stay there. When he came out he crossed over to Newcastle-street; I tapped him on the shoulder; I told him, I wanted to speak to him. He ran away from me; I ran after him, and catched him by his collar. I then took him to the watchhouse. He then confessed that he had two pair of stays about him. I searched his person, I found two pair of stays inside of his breeches, and about three quarters of a yard of calico in his coat pocket, which he confessed to be his master's. He said, he had been robbed himself a few days before, of nine shillings, and that he had taken his master's property to replace that. These are the stays.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my stays; they have my private marks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These stays are my own goods; I cut them out at my leisure hours at my lodgings. I took the stays to my master's shop to prop them off with the hot irons, having no opportunity I withdrew my attention. At the watchhouse I was so confused I did not know what I said.</p>

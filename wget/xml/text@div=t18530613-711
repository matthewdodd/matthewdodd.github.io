                  </hi>. I am inspector of the Independent Gas Light Company at Haggerstone. I know the prisoner very will, he is an umbrella and parasol maker, and lives at No. 46, Hackney-road—he has a shop there, which is supplied with gas by the Company—it is my duty to collect arrears and payments for gas for the Company—amongst other persons I had to collect from the prisoner—on 7th May I went to him to collect for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I wrote this receipt (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), in his shop—here is a memorandum which was given me by the collector previously, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it is scratched through as being paid—the prisoner paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I gave him the receipt for the amount—this is the receipt with the exception of the alteration of the figure 1 into a 2—I wrote this in the prisoner's presence—I find on the receipt the word "one" that has not been altered, but the figure 1 is made into a 2—that has not been done with the same ink—this is a sort of brownish ink—this is the counterfoil taken from the book, find here is the book it is taken from (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I made this memorandum on the counterfoil at hit shop before I wrote the receipt—I think I saw the prisoner again on 9th June—I was in the private office—I had had some communication previously from one of the officers—I asked the prisoner the purport of his visit to the Company's office, and he told me he had paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had not the receipt with me then—it had been left by him with Mr. Monteith—he said to me, "I paid you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>"—I told him he was not robbing the Company, he was robbing me of a sovereign—it was in consequence of some conversation I had had with Mr. Monteith that I used that expression—I said to the prisoner the recipt had been altered—he said he had not altered it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks of the Independent Gas Company. On Monday, 6th June, the prisoner came to the office, between half-past 1 and 2 o'clock—he brought with him two receipts for an explanation of the charges—he produced this receipt to me—at the time he produced it, it was in the state it now is—I saw it was given for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in appearance—he said, "I have called for an explanation of the difference between this receipt and the amount of gas I have consumed—I referred to our books, and found it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him there must be some error in the case, and if he would leave it with me I would get it explained—he gave this receipt into my hands to keep in my possession—I said it was very much out of the usual course for persons to give their receipts up, but I locked it up, and thought nothing of it till the next morning, when Mr. Kitchen came—I called him in and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner call for the return of any money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but merely for an explanation—I asked him what he had paid—he said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him to wait, and I got the receipt—I told him I discovered that it had been altered—I pointed out the change in the figures and in the ink—he said it was false, and said he did not do it, and did I suppose if he had be would have returned me the receipt—I told him it was a very barefaced attempt at fraud, and gave him into custody—he did not ask for any money of me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the fraud you suggested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he had paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Kitchen, Mr. Kitchen must have returned 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him—the amount of gas consumed was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he said he had paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

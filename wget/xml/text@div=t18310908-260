On the 12th of July we bought two quantities of paper of the prisoner Thomas Wakeman; on the 14th he called again in the afternoon, and said he had about 10 cwt. of waste-paper, which I agreed to purchase of him, and on the 15th he brought it in a caravan - there was a young man with him, but I saw nothing of Lill; I paid him 4d. per 1b. for the paper, which is the price of good waste-paper: it came to 21l. 12s. 4d. - I kept it by itself, and Mr. Brettell came and claimed it the same day; I gave it up, and it is here to-day -

Yes; I have known Wakeman six or seven years, and my father much longer; I always considered him an honest fair dealing man - I had had dealings with him before, though not to so large an amount; I am not quite positive that he did not say he had it to sell for a person who brought it from a lawyer, but I understood he had it from a lawyer - Apollo-court and Bell-yard are very near Liucoln's Inn.</p>

            . I am a carter, and live in New-court, Peter's-lane, Cow-cross. On the evening of the 14th of July, Wakeman came to me in the stable yard, and said,"I want you to do a job for me between five and six o'clock in the morning;" he told me to take my cart, and remove some paper - I asked him what quantity; he said he did not exactly know, but he supposed four or five hundred weight - I said it was an awkward time, and an awkward morning, but I agreed to go, and I went with my cart and horse towards his house, where he had told me to go, but as I was going up Warner-street I saw Wakeman and Lill, apparently coming from Wakeman's house; we stopped at a public-house in Warner-street, and all went in and had something to drink - there was another person with him, who was a stranger to me; we staid about a quarter of an hour - Wakeman then told me to go to Carey-street; the strange man went on before my cart, and Wakeman and Lill went up Eyre-streetbill into Leather-lane - when I got into Leather-lane I passed them with my cart; the strange man still kept on before my cart, but on his turning out of Chancery-lane into Carey-street I lost him - I then drove on about fifty yards past Bell-yard; the strange man then called to me to back my cart as far down Bell-yard as the pavement - I tried to do so, but I could not get it above half-way down; while I was backing, the strange man and another strange man, each of them, brought a large bundle of paper out of a turning in Bell-yard, but I do not know where it leads to - it was on the left-hand side in Bellyard; they put the bundles of paper into the cart, and I let down the tail-board, unbuckled the seat, and got the cart in order while they brought some more - they kept bringing out till I expect they had got about 7 cwt. in the cart; I told them that was as much as my pony and cart could draw - they said I must take some more, they had not got much more - they brought out two bundles more, and said there was some more; I told them I could not take any more then, I must come a second time - I then began to tie some ropes across, and they brought out three bundles more; I tied them on, and moved my horse up Bell-yard till I came opposite the large new building, and there my cart, being loaded heavy behind, it swagged - both the shafts broke right off, and it went up; a great deal of paper fell off - the strange man told me I must go and get another cart; I said I did not know where to get one without going home - one of the strange men said he would go and look for one; while I was taking out the paper, and tying it up as well as I could, another cart came up; I took away my broken cart - after I had taken it home I went to Mr. Wakeman's house, and his wife paid me by his order; I do not know what became of the paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Yours is a pony-cart? A. Yes; I will not say whether Wakeman had an apron on - I had seen him many times with an apron; one of the strange men had an apron when I came - I had known Wakeman, and worked for him for two years; it was about twenty minutes before seven o'clock when my cart broke down - there were plenty of people about; I did not see Wakeman after I passed him about the middle of Leather-lane - I think that is a quarter of a mile from Bell-yard; I think I received in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080118"></xptr>formation about eight o'clock or a quarter past eight the same morning, that Mr. Butterworth had lost paper - I know a man named Chidley, and had been to his house; I had been to Wakeman's house before that, but I did not then know of the robbery; I went to Wakeman's as soon as I got home, to try to get some recompense for my cart - Mrs. Wakeman said that Wakeman and the people were gone to take the paper to Chidley; I went to Chidley, and asked if Mr. Wakeman had been there - I heard there that the paper had been stolen, but from whom I did not know; I went back to Wakeman's - he was close by, and was sent for into the presence of me and Chidley; it was then about nine o'clock; Wakeman asked me how much I charged for my cart - I said 1s. 6d. was what he generally gave me for jobs that lasted about an hour, and he told his wife to pay me; I asked Mr. Chidley if he wanted me any more - he took my address, and I went home.</p>

            . I know Lill. On the morning of the 15th of July I saw him in Bell-yard, which is near my house; he was shoving forward a truck with some paper in it - it was about half-past six, or twenty minutes to seven o'clock; there were two men in front of the truck, pulling it, and Lill pushed behind - I passed by them, and saw them when the cart broke down; I had known Lill before.</p>
               <p>Lill. I was not there at all, nor near the place: he said before that it was seven o'clock when he was there.</p>

I said between six and seven o'clock; I had to go to Chapel-street, Lamb's Conduit-street, and I got there before seven o'clock - the cart breaking down first attracted my notice; I thought the paper might be Mr. Howard's - It did not strike me that it was a robbery; there were several people about, asking what was the matter - I spoke to Lill, and said, "Joseph you have got a good master, for he is teaching you to draw," meaning that a man is not a finished bricklayer till he is able to draw plans; my son was with me - but he is not here.</p>

            . This is part of Mr. Butterworth's paper; I tied it up myself, and put this card on it; it is Chitty's Commercial Law, Nos. 2, 3, and 4.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When did you see it? A. I put it there in December last; I cannot say when I saw it last, perhaps a month before; Mr. Butterworth is an extensive publisher - some law-books sell better than others; it is customary to sell works for waste-paper, which will not sell in books - Chitty's Commercial Law is a very saleable work.</p>
               <p>Wakeman's Defence. Had I been in the least aware of being brought to a place like this, I could have produced proper documents to prove my innocence; the man I bought the first paper of is Bowyer, whom I have known for twenty-five years - he is a rag-dealer and dealer in paper: I could often sell paper for him, when he could not sell it himself - I sold twenty-four reams for him to Mr. Johnson, of Bishopsgate-street; I am aware that the law must take its course, but I am as innocent as I was the day I was born - Mr. Chidley called on me, and said, "You have had some paper;" I told him Yes, and where I had sold it: I went with him to Mr. Butterworth's, told him where I sold it, and he got it all backthe last parcel of paper I bought of a person a total stranger to me, to whom Lill introduced me; I said to the person, "I think you sold some of this paper to Bowyer:" he said, Yes he had, but should not sell him any more, for he could not get his money from him.</p>
               <p>Lill's Defence. I never recommended Wakeman - the truth was this, two persons told me they had some wastepaper to sell, and I said I knew a person who bought it; I sent them to him with it, and he made the agreement - what it was I do not know, but I heard it was some where in Lincoln's Inn.</p>

            . I am a bookseller. I deal in wastepaper, and live in Goswell-street; Mr. Brettell called on me about half-past seven o'clock on the morning of the 15th of July, and asked if I had had any paper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080119"></xptr>offered me that morning - I said, No, it was not likely I should have it so early in the morning; he then told me Mr. Butterworth had been robbed of a large quantity of books - I told him to take pen and ink, and write down his master's name, place of a bode, and a list of books lost, and I should know what to do if they were offered me - I asked him if the warehouse had been robbed that morning - he said it had; I then said, I had had a quantity of law-books brought to me as waste-paper a fortnight before - if he would go with my young man to my warehouse he should see them - they went together - my young man came back and said the whole belonged to Mr. Butterworth; I then went to the warehouse myself, and said to him, "Are these your master's property?" he said,"They are;" I then said, "It is right I should give you the name of the person I bought them of" - I gave him the name of

            , Clare-market, but as I did not know his address, I took him back to my shop for my young man to tell him - while we were there, Jupp came and asked if Mr. Wakeman had been there; in consequence of what he said Mr. Brettell and I went to Wakeman's house - we found him coming out of the public-house at the corner of the street - when I saw him I said,"Wakeman, have you had any paper at your house today?" he said he had, and had sold it to Mr. Emblin, a tripeman - I had known Wakeman before, but not much of him; I asked him how much he had sold - he said 11 cwt. 2 qrs. and some odd pounds, but I do not remember how much; that he had sold it at 4d. per 1b., and I believe he said "a good price too" - he then asked me if there was any thing wrong about it - I told him I had received information that it was all stolen; he said he did not know it; I said, "I suppose you know who you bought it of" - he said Yes, of a bricklayer - I said,"I would advise you to go with me to Mr. Butterworth's directly, and give some account of it." which he agreed to do; Wakeman said, "I have bought paper of Bowyer;" my young man said, "Bowyer, in Ray-street?" he said, Yes - Wakeman looked across the way, and said,"Why, there is Bowyer, call him over;" this was in Great Warner-street, about one hundred yards from Wakeman's house - we went on to Mr. Butterworth's, and reached there soon after nine o'clock; Mr. Butterworth was there - I stopped till about eleven o'clock - Wakeman did not stop all the time there: he went in and out - the officer came in half an hour; Mr. Wooller was there part of the time, and I believe he took down what was said - I cannot state what passed; Wakeman stated some of the circumstances to Mr. Butterworth in my hearing - I have lived in Goswell-street sixteen or eighteen years; I attended at the Magistrate's by desire of the prosecutor - I was not called - Wakeman appeared very willing to give information.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. But whether what Wakeman said was true, you cannot tell? A. No; there were many cases inquired about; I knew nothing of the robbery, but what Mr. Brettell had told me - I had bought paper of Wakeman three or four times; I never went to a warehouse to get paper away - I do not think I told the prosecutor of Wakeman having said he bought it of Joe, the bricklayer - I cannot say whether I did or not; I believe I told him all that Wakeman said.</p>

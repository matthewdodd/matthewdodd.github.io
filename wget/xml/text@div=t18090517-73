            . I am servant to Mrs. Hoare, at East Sheen. On the 1st of February I was in London, I was out of service then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose your watch on the 1st of February - A. Yes; I had a two pound note, two ones, and eight or ten shillings in silver; this was in the evening about a quarter after ten o'clock; I had been drinking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170047"></xptr>but I was perfectly sensible of what I was about; I had been drinking from between three and four o'clock, but not hard.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the town was it that you left the last public house - A. In St. James's-street, Covent-Garden, I believe, but I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Then every body else must be sure you was drunk, how do you know that your watch and bank notes were about you when you left the last public house - A. I am convinced they were; what I had there I paid for; I returned my purse into my fob on the top of my watch, both in my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. The house you left about ten o'clock - A. Yes; my lodgings were at the Mason's Arms, Maddox-street, Hanover-square. I met these two girls in Covent-Gardon; they asked me to give them something to drink, and I did; it might be nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took them to this house in James's-street - A. Yes, I cannot say the sign of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got your watch and your notes again - A. None of the notes, the watch is here; I had nobody with me but these two girls; after I got out of the house I went towards my lodgings, through St. Martin's court.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you getting from James's-street, to St. Martin's-court - A. Not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. I think any body might walk in a minute and a half - A. I was along with these two girls; we did not hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether you were sober enough to recollect the persons of any body - A. I was sober enough for that.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these girls again, if they were the girls that you were with - A. I never saw them till last Wednesday before the justice; I am perfectly sure it was them. I went strait from St. James's-street, to St. Martin's-court with them; we did not stop any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am sure you must be drunk - A. There they took the advaniage of me; my fob was torn, and the watch and purse were both taken out, I did not perceive them take it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know your watch was in your pocket in St. Martin's-court - A. I stopped no where else; they stopped with me perhaps five or ten minutes; I was all in an instant left by myself; that minute they were gone, I perceived what was the matter; it was dark but there were lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so indecent to have two women - A. They hanged about, me and asked me to give them something to drink.</p>
               <p>- GILLMORE. I am an officer belonging to Queen's-square. On Friday was a week, Mr. Courtney a pawnbroker, sent for an officer, the watch was there to be pawned by a woman of the name of Silverthorn; I detained her, and went in search of her husband. They are costermongers; the watch was claimed by the prosecutor. I apprehended the prisoner; he identified these two girls.</p>
               <p>- SILVERTHORN. Q. Do you know any thing of that watch - A. Yes;

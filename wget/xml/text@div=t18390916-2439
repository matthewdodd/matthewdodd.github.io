                  </hi>. I am a musician, and five in Keppel-terrace, Pimlico. About one o'clock on the morning of the 22nd of August, I met the prisoner, she asked me to relieve her, as she was in great distress—I said I had no property about me, and requested her to leave me—she kept on with me till I got to Eaton-square, when she made another appli<lb></lb>cation—I still refused—she then made an attempt on the property which was in my inside coat pocket—I called, and an officer came up—I gave her in charge-another officer took up the purse with four sovereigns in it, and while he was picking it up, four more sovereigns fell from her person this is the bag—the officer then looked round, and found two more so<lb></lb>vereigns—the other three and a half have not been found.</p>

I came up—the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner, and told me he was robbed of eleven sovereigns—the sergeant came up, turned on his light, and found four sovereigns, and I found the purse on the ground, which contained four more, and then two more—the prosecutor was not drunk—I was not holding her—I heard something drop from her.</p>

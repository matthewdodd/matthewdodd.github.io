            . On the 10th of August I employed the prisoner to take a horse to Galley-quay, to go to Sunderland; he had two sovereigns to pay the expences - he did not put the horse on board, but put it at livery, and I had the bill to pay for it: I did not see him again till the 21st of March; I put my hand on his shoulder, and said,"Halloo, my friend!" he looked up and said, "Will you have any gin" - I said, "I will gin you to the watchman;" he said he had spent some of the money, and the rest he had lost; I found the horse at livery the day after he took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not send me to No. 11, Catherine-court, Trinity-square, to ascertain where the vessel laid? A. No such thing; I told you to go and put the horse on board, and I would give you half a sovereign when you had done.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me this horse, and told me to go to the place and inquire; I saw two gentlemen, who said the vessel was not to sail for three days, but I had better wait to see if the gentleman belonging to it would come there; I walked the horse about for an hour, and then the gentlemen came and said, "You had better put that horse up," which I did; I met a shopmate, and got rather too much - I do not know what became of the money, nor myself either hardly; I have since then broken my arm, and have been three months in the hospital - I have not had an opportunity of returning the money; if I had meant to have made a theft of it I should not have left the saddle and bridle in the ostler's hands.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Smart; Staple's-inn  is part in Middlesex, and part in London; this part, No. 8, has been always reputed to be in London: On Sunday evening the 27th of December, about a quarter before nine, I was going up into the chambers; I unlocked the door, and heard the chairs move, which led me to suspect there was somebody in the room; I called out, but no answer was made, and the chairs still continued to move; I immediately shut the door again, and went to the porter's-lodge for assistance; the porter and two or three others went with me; when we got to the staircase, we heard somebody on the staircase, and when they heard our voices, they went back again on the staircase; there are a number of closets which they searched a considerable time, and at last found the prisoner at the bar concealed in one of them, with a candle-box, and candles secreted under her clothes; the candles were in the candle-box; we took her into the chambers.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020113-5-person87">Q. </persName>
            Whose property were they? - A. Mr. Smart's; we searched her, pulled off her pockets, and found about seventy pawnbroker's tickets in them; we then went into the bed-room, and found the bed-room had been stripped; there were four blankers, a counterpane, and the sheets, gone; I then missed a great-coat and waistcoat of my own; the prisoner then said, she had removed the articles I missed, to her lodgings.</p>

            Had you made her any promise of favour? - A. No.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020113-5-person89">Q. </persName>
            Did you threaten her? - A. No; she said, they were at her lodgings, in Portugal-street; we took her there, and she delivered me a counterpane, a set of fire-irons, and my great-coat and waistcoat; she hoped I would forgive her, the devil had been very busy with her that afternoon; but I made her no promise.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOWARD sworn. - I am inspector of the watch and lamps of St. Andrew's, Holborn; about a quarter before ten, on Sunday the 27th of December, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; I found her in the Lodge, at Staple's-inn; she said, as you have got your things again, I hope you will forgive me; Mr. Thomas desired I would go up stairs with him; I went up, and he shewed me the property. (Produces it.)</p>

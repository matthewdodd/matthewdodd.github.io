I lost a box out of my room with 29 pound in it; when I missed the box I had a suspicion of the Prisoner, and found him at the Crown in Grubst-reet; a place he sometimes went to. I searched him, and took 14 guineas from under one of his garters, and two 36 s. pieces from under the other. He said he took the box out of my room, carried it into the haylost, and broke it open with a stable fork tire, and took 29 l. out of it. I had discharged him the day before, but he found means to get into the yard, and owned he came into my chamber when I was in bed, and took it away. - I lie with my door open that I may hear people knock.</p>
               <p>Lyonel Daeth . I was present when the Prisoner owned he took 29 l. from the Prosecutor; 14 guineas were taken from under one of his garters, and two 36 s. from under the other, and also 2 s. 3 d. he gave Mr. Ireland.</p>
               <p>Ireland. He did give me 2 s. 3 d. but I forgot that Daeth, when we took him, said, if we had not taken him then, he was going on board a privateer, and we should never have seen him any more.</p>

I can hardly walk on level ground. I am a paralytic on one side and cannot use one arm and leg; since I have been afflicted I get my living by cleaning boots with one hand. I was out all this night. I had no money to pay my lodging. I knew a young man at Islington who owed me a shilling, and I thought I would go and ask him for a sixpence to pay my lodging; I waited there till past 12 o'clock, and then he had not come home; I did not know what to do, so I walked about till the morning. I was going along the Lower-road, Islington, at about half-past three, and I was stopped by two men and they asked me if I had a mind to earn two or three shillings; I said I should like it, and they gave me this bundle to carry, and I was along with them when the policeman took me, and I have been in custody ever since.</p>

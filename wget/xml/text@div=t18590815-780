                  </hi>. To the best of my belief the prisoner was with me at the time the accounts were being examined, under suspicion of being wrong, in Cattleman's office, and I saw this I O U in Castleman's hands who said that he had advanced the money for paid-ons on account of the then running wool sales—the wool sales generally last some weeks—I asked the prisoner how he had disposed of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he had paid a portion of the money; and when his accounts were made out, there was no doubt but that the payment would be explained—the accounts were then made up—the invoices were there at the time, and the account was put into the hands of the accountant to make up—I did not stand by the accountant, but he and the prisoner had to make up the account together—I then saw the prisoner, and said, "Strickland, I do not see that you have accounted for this 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor are there any items to your credit that will contribute any portion except 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," which was a deposit either at the London or St. Catherine's Docks—I said, "Will you have the goodness to hand over the difference between the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—his answer was that he had spent the money, and had not got it—this money was advanced by the cashier, by our full authority, each sale: according to the wants of the prisoner, as has been the custom for some years, to pay paid-ons for wool alone; and during the recess between one wool sale and another, it became his duty to make out the items—for fully fourteen days after the wool sales there is full occupation for the prisoner in clearing up disputed matters between the senders of wool and the purchasers as regards the delivery, the result being that he has deposited the orders and lodged them, without being able to obtain the wool.</p>

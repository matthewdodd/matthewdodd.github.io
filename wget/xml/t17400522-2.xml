               <p>Mr Tarrant. I was not present when the Goods were taken: I was invited out on the 22d of April to spend the Evening; and apprehending the Business of the Day was over, I went out about 8 o'Clock, and bid my Servant shut up the Shop: but I was immediately sent for, with a Message,. that my Servants had got two Shop-lifters; upon which I returned immediately, and they told me they had taken this Piece of Linnen from the Prisoners; it is my Property, and here is my Mark, and Number upon it: I am sure it was in the Shop when I went out, and I value it at 17s.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mr Tarrant, and know this Piece of Sleezy to belong to him, there's his Mark and mine upon it, and it is numbered. The two Prisoners came into the Shop on the 22d of April, under Pretence of buying some Printed Linnen; I shewed them several Pieces; they did not like any of them, but desired to see more. Accordingly I brought more forward, and at last Towers pitched upon one Piece, and gave me Six-pence earnest; telling me, she must go and fetch her Mother, and if her Mother liked it she would have it, but if she did not she must have her Money again in a Quarter of an Hour. Then they were both going off, but from their Actions I mistrusted they had got something which did not belong to them, so I called them back again and searched them; and this Piece of Cloth I took from under Bannister's Cloak, and I am sure it was in the Shop when they came in. I asked Bannister when I called her back, what she had got under her Cloak? Towers replied, - whatever she has got, it is none of yours. I desired to see it, and found it was ours, with our Marks on it. I shewed my Master (when he came home) the same Piece, which I had taken from under Bannister's Cloak.</p>
               <p>Bannister. I had been out that Day in the Morning, with a Hundred and Half of Herrings, and in the Afternoon I was out with Raddishes: After which, Towers came and asked me to go with her to buy a Bit of Linnen. I told her I was too dirty to go to a Shop; so she borrowed a Cloak for me, and while we were in this Shop, she gave me this Piece of Linnen to hold for her, and I thought she had paid for it. I had Opportunity enough to have gone off with it, if I had known she had not paid for it.</p>
               <p>Hind. The Piece of Linnen which I took from Bannister, was not the same she gave me earnest for. It was printed Linnen she pretended to buy. Both <rs id="t17400522-2-verdict11" type="verdictDescription">

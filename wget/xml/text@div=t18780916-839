                  </hi>. I live at 120, Ackerman Road, Brixton—was walking along Newington Butts, going home, at about 12.45 a.m., on 31st July, when I met the prisoners and another man—Dunford asked me for a light—I gave him my fusee-case, and noticed his hands down in front of me—I then saw my silver watch in his hand, which was safe in my waistcoat, with a chain, a few minutes before—I made a grasp at it, and Kemp forced his way between us and forced him out of my grasp—I am quite sure Kemp is the man—Dunford got away—I don't know what became of the watch; this is the chain—I tried to run after them, and Kemp got behind me and tripped me up—I could see him over my left shoulder—I lost sight of the men—I got up—Dunford went in the direction of St. George's Road, and I went through Short Street into Walworth Road and met a constable about 25 yards from where it occurred—while speaking to him Kemp came up, and another man, from the direction of Short Street, away from the place where the robbery was committed—I don't know who the other man was, he ran away—my attention was drawn to Kemp—I gave him in charge; I have not the slightest doubt as to his identity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was not the worse for drink, I had had no more than I usually drink; I was sober—I don't recollect saving I had been drinking—I had been to New Cross and Greenwich, and had been out 12 hours, during which I had drunk four glasses of ale and four two<lb></lb>pennyworths of whisky; that is all I remember—I had been into eight public-house—a third man was charged before the Magistrate, named Strutton—I said I was not quite positive as to him, and he was dis<lb></lb>charged—I lost sight of the men when I was thrown, and while I was talking to a constable in uniform Kemp came towards us, that was about two minutes after the robbery—I don't think I have any doubt—he asked me what I was charging him with, and I said, "Robbing me of my watch"—he said, "I had nothing to do with it"—on going to the station he took his watch from his pocket, and said, "Why should I take this man's watch when I have a watch of my own?"</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 94). I was on duty in Walworth Road—Jones spoke to me—Kemp and another man approached, and he put out his hand and said, "This is the man"—I cannot say who the other man was, he stopped and went away in a sliding manner—I took hold of Kemp, and Jones charged him with being concerned with two others in stealing his watch—Kemp said it was all a mistake—on the way to the station ho pulled out his watch and said what did he want with this man's</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I swear Jones was sober—I said before the Magistrate that he was excited, and that he had had something to drink—I mean he might be drinking without being drunk—from my experience in the public streets I thought so—Kemp said "It is a mistake, I know nothing about it", and came quietly with me.</p>

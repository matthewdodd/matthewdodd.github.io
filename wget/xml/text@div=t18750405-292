               <p>—on 27th March, about 12 o'clock at night, I was on duty at the signal box at Plumstead—I heard the cries of a child on the opposite side of the line—the-station master came out of his house and called me to come across the line, and I went with a lamp—I found a child lying outside the railway fence—it was lying on its stomach crying—I took it to the signal box—about 5 o'clock the nest morning the prisoner came to the station master's house—I went to her and asked her if the child was her's—she said "Yes"—I said "Why did you leave it all night"—she said she had given it to a woman to mind, and the woman had given it to a girl, and the girl had laid it down there, and she pointed to the place she said the girl told her—I said "If the girl told you why did not you come and take it away?"—she said the girl had not told her till the morning, and she had had no peace all night till she came to me for it—I sent her to the station; it was a cold night when I found the child.</p>

About 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, the 28th March, a child about eleven months old was brought to the station by a constable—about 5.15 that morning I met the prisoner in Powis Street, Woolwich—I said "Where are you going so early this morning?"—she said "I am going to the police-station to fetch my child"—I said "How do you know your child is there?"—she said "Because I do know"—I said "Have you been in bed all night?"—she said "Yes, but I could not sleep"—I said "I shall charge you with deserting your child and abandoning it by the side of the railway"—she said "How could I desert it when I saw a man pick it up and take charge of it; I should have taken it home, but I was afraid my father-in-law would not take it in"—I said "How did you account to your mother for it?"—she said "I told her it was dead."</p>

             sworn. - I am a single woman: I was robbed on the 14th of July, in the afternoon, I cannot say what time, in a common path, near <placeName id="t18000917-12-crimeloc52">Turnham-green</placeName>

               <p>Q.When he put his hand to his bosom, did he produce any thing that caused an alarm in you? - A. No; I thought he had something, but he did not pull it out; he was dressed in a light coloured coat, a stone colour, or something of that sort; he had a round hat on, a blue waistcoat, and a plaid handkerchief about his neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man a wig? - A. I cannot say; but it seemed to me to be his own hair hanging about his face; he had the appearance of a countryman.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might this take up? - A. I cannot say to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively that the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any crape, or any thing to hide his face? - A. No; I found him at the watch-house at Acton.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from the place where you were robbed? - A. Not half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Try and recollect what time of the day it was? - A. I believe it might have been between four and five, or it might have been between two and three; he was taken to the watch-house, there was my father and brother there, I believe, and a great number of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he pointed out to you as the man that robbed you, or did you pick him out? - A. He was not pointed out to me, I pointed him out to my father as the person that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he was the man? - A.From the impression his face made upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man at the watch-house in the same dress as the man who robbed you? - A.Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your money such that you could have sworn to it? - A. No; he had some money when he was carried before the Magistrate the next day, but I could not say it was mine; there were two persons that I met with just after I parted with the prisoner, I told them I was robbed, and asked them if they knew any thing of the man, for he had robbed me; and they said, yes; he had been sitting with them on the grass all day, and they could not get rid of him; but they have disappeared.</p>
               <p>LUTHANIA MAGUIRE sworn. - I am sister to the last witness: I was with her when she was robbed, on Monday the 14th of July, in the afternoon, I cannot say exactly as to the time; the prisoner passed us, and called out after us to stop, or he would follow us; we went on, and he called after us again; he put his right-hand to his bosom, and desired us to deliver our money, or he would blow our brains out; my sister then gave him a shilling and a sixpence, I saw her give it to him; he asked her if she had any more money; she said, no, she had not; then he asked me if I had any; I told him I had none; he asked me again, was I sure I had none; I told him I had not; he then said, God bless you, and went away towards Turnham-green; I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170019"></xptr>see him again till the Friday afterwards, when I saw him at Bow-Street; I saw him in the passage going into the office, and at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time know that he was the man charged with robbing your sister? - A. I heard him ordered to the bar; I knew him as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he pointed out to you as the man? - A. No; I made the observation first, and told Mr. Bond that he was the man; he had on the same coat that he had on when he robbed my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that struck you the most forcibly about him? - A. His features; he wore his own hair, and had the appearance of a countryman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his voice? - A. I knew his voice again immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Under all the circumstances, do you believe the man you saw at Bow-Street was the same man? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon your mind? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came to be taken up? - A. We described him so particularly to our brothers that they made inquiries after him, and traced him to Turnham-green.</p>

             sworn. - I am the father of the prosecutrix: I took the prisoner into custody at an alehouse on Turnham-green, I think they call it the Barley-mow, about six o'clock; I saw him in a country club-room, there were a great many people in the room; I took him into custody, and brought him to the constable's house, at Acton; he was taken to the watch-house, and there my eldest daughter saw him, and said he was the man; I do not recollect that the prisoner said any thing at that time; he went very quietly with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in any business? - A. No; I have been in the army, but am a private gentleman, and live at Acton.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Frances Macguire.) It never happened to you to be robbed before, I suppose? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you under any alarm at the time? - A. I certainly felt an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Macguire.) What passed when you went into the room, did you charge him with robbing your daughter? - A. Yes; but he was silent, I thought rather stupid, he was leaning down; a woman that was with me pointed him out to me; I don't recollect that he said any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to my club on the 14th of July, I was there by twenty minutes after one o'clock, and I was not out of the room till I was taken out by that gentleman; as soon as the gentleman came in, he said, do not be alarmed, for there is a person in the room that has committed a robbery, then the girl pointed me out, and he said, I must go with him; I was smoking my pipe; I begged of him to let me drink a glass of punch before I went, which he did, and then he took me to Acton, to the constable's, and then I was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Frances Macguire.) I wish, if you could at all recollect, the time with more certainly? - A. I can only fix it by this, that a good while after I had been home the clock struck three.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you last come from? - A.From Turnham-green; I had been to the Post-office at Hammersmith, and was very much tired, and when I came from the Post-office I sat down upon a stile for some time, I cannot exactly say the time.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Luthania Macguire.) Can you say, with more certainty than your sister, what time it was? - A.No, I cannot; but I think it must have been near two.</p>
               <p>Q. You sat upon the stile some time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you were robbed? - A. Before we were robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you see him the day he was taken up? - A. I saw him at twenty minutes before two o' clock, I looked at my watch when I came upon the Green, and he was the first man that I saw upon the Green, standing under a tree, looking at two other members playing at quoits; I always regarded him as a very honest man, and a very good member.</p>

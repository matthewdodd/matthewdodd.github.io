                  </hi>. I carry on business in Long-acre—I was in Lothbury on Saturday, 5th September, about half-past 1 o'clock—I went into a urinal at the back of the bank—I felt a slight pull at my coat-pocket—I turned round and saw a man leaving the urinal—I placed my hand on my hip and at once missed my pocket-book—when I turned round, Boyd and another man were at the entrance, and as soon as I adjusted my cloth<lb></lb>ing, I said to them, "I have lout my pocket-book, and think one of you must have it"—each of them attested their ignorance—I kept hold of Boyd short time and I then let go of him and took hold of the other man—he pulled a small book from his pocket and said, that was the only book he had—I then again took hold of Boyd—the pocket-book contained a cheque payable to order, a five-pound note, and some postage and receipt stamps—I went immediately to the London and Westminster Bank, and received the number of the note at once, and then went to the Bank of England—there was another person in the urinal, whose back was towards me, but he was not near enough to be the one who took the pocket-book from me—I could not tell what movement had taken place before I turned round—the prisoner and the other man appeared to be coming in; they must have given place, in order that the person in there could go out—the cheque was payable to my order, and was not indorsed—I have not seen anything of that since—I received information about the note, which I had stopped at the bank, about 1 o'clock on the Monday, this being on the Saturday—a note was produced and shown to me at Bow-lane police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Davis, a bullion-dealer, of 54, Cornhill—the prisoner came to our shop on Monday, 8th September—I and another clerk were in the shop—the prisoner wished for 460 france, French money, and he produced three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—this is one of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes he presented; this is my writing upon it—I did not give him change in francs—I went to the Bank of England with the three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and left him waiting at the office—something occurred at the Bank of England—I did not get gold for that note—from what passed there, an officer went back with me—I found the prisoner still waiting in the shop—the officer followed me in, and said that that note was stolen—he mentioned his name, and said he must go back with him to the Bank of England—the prisoner said that he had received it from a party who was stopping in his house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective-officer of the City—I was on duty at the Back of England on 8th September, about 1 o'clock in the day, or little after—my attention was called to a Bank of England note, and in consequence of that I accompanied the last witness back to his master's shop—I found the prisoner there—I told him I was an officer, produced the note, and said to him, "From whom did you receive it?"—he said, "I received it from a lodger of mine; I keep a registered lodging-house, and that is my name and address on the back of the note, which I placed on it"—I asked him what he had taken it for; he said, "For two napoleons, one breakfast, and one night's lodging"—I asked again a second time from whom he took it; he said, "A foreigner; his name is Jarvis"—I said, "This note has been stolen, and you must accompany me to the Bank of England"—I then left him in charge of another constable, and from what was said at the Bank, I afterwards took him to the station—I saw Mr. Hayward the same day, and found that what the prisoner had said about the lodgings was false—I went to the lodgings, and when I returned Mr. Hayward was at Bow-lane station—I have had charge of the note since; my initials are on the back.</p>

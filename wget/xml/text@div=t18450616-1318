                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and was lodging at Kensal New-town. I met the prisoner at half-past eleven o'clock at night, on the 21st of May, in a public-house in Steven-street, Marylebone—I said if I could get a bed I should stop in that part of the town, as it rained—the prisoner said I could stop with her—I went with her to No. 20, Steven-street—I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket when I went home with her—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I put the other into my purse, and put it into my watch-pocket—I after<lb></lb>wards lost my purse and the shilling—I have never found it at all—when I was in bed I saw her go to the foot of the bed, and stoop down where my clothes were—she then went out of the room—another woman came in, and said it was her sister's husband's bouso, and he would soon be in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 95.) I went with the prosecutor to No. 20, Steven-street, and found the prisoner there—I told her I wanted the purse and shilling which that man had lost—she said she had not seen them—I told her she must go with me—she then said he was going to stop with her all night for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and at the station she said she spent the shilling in gin, and that might be the one he gave her—she did not talk of two shillings.</p>

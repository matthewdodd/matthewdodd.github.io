            . I am a patrole of St. Luke. Chelsea: about five or ten minutes after twelve, I got to the bottom of Hinman's-lane; I met the prisoner full butt, I cannot tell whether he was running or walking; I said to the prisoner, halloo, my fellow what have you got there; he said, his brother had stripped to fight at a house below, he gave him the things to take care off, he said, he was going away to take care of them; I told him he must go back, and show me his brother; he tried to get past me; I took him by the collar, and shoved him against the wall, and took the coat and waistcoat from him, and going along Jew's-row I saw a soldier ran up to Clubb with a stick, and Clubb turning short round the house the blow missed him. I asked Clubb what he had lost; he said his coat and waistcoat; he said I had them under my arm. I asked him where he had lost them; he said, he was knocking at the public-house door, (pointing to the Royal Hospital public-house,) three soldiers rushed out and knocked him down. I then took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and Clubb went with me. The prisoner begged me to take him to his officer; he said, he bought the clothes with his clearance money, of some boy in the street, he gave nine shillings for the coat and waistcoat, out of his clearance money; I went to his pay serjeant, the serjeant said his clearance money was only five shillings and four-pence altogether. I do not know what became of the other two soldiers; I have made all enquiries after them, I could not find them. I produce the coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. to Clubb. Is that your coat and waistcoat - A. Yes, this is the coat and waistcoat that I gave to Wynn to hold on Saturday the 24th of December, Christmas Eve.</p>

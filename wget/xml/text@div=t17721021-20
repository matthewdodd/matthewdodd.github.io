I am ostler at the Red Lion, at Highgate; I stopt the prisoner on suspicion of his stealing a bridle, a plated bit, a pair of spurs, and a pair of boots, on the 8th of this month, at eight in the morning. He came to the Red Lion, and said he should have put up his mare with me, but I was not up, and so he had put her up at the Wrestlers, and by the description that Mr. Smith, the bridle man's servant, gave me, I suspected this was his bridle; I had an account of the bridle before I stopt him; I went, and saw the mare, and the spurs and bit answered the description I had left with me; I went and fetched a constable, and gave him charge of him. We advertised the mare and this gentleman came and owned her; I went with him to Sir

                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant of 16, Walbrook, and am agent for Messrs. Schroder Freres, Bordeaux—early in January I put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>, and on the morning of the 5th I received this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I subsequently called at Smith's office and saw him write this: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Memorandum. From C. C. Smith, Emigration and Shipping Agency, 23, Leadenhall Street, London. Passages booked to all parts of the world. The writer has a connection and can be seen any day at 10.30.")—I spoke to Smith with reference to that memoran<lb></lb>dum, and he told me he had a business and was a shipping agent for the Queensland Emigration Commissioners, and sometimes sent out wines to the Colonies; sometimes in wood and sometimes in cases—he said he would call at my place, which he did a few days afterwards, and tasted some samples of claret—I afterwards received this memorandum of 17th January, "Can you guarantee it to keep on a long voyage?" and he subsequently ordered five has. of claret—I forwarded the order to my principals, and wrote to Smith on 19th January for a reference, and in reply, on 21ST January I received this letter: "Queensland Emigration Agency, 23, Leaden<lb></lb>hall Street, London, C. C. Smith. Dear Sir,—In reply to your favour of 19th, I have much pleasure in referring you to Mr. F. Smith, 144, Gresham Street, which, although the same name, is only a business reference," &amp;c.—I accordingly went to that address and saw a person who called himself Frederick Smith—I said I had been referred to him by C. C. Smith, and I asked him what he knew of him, and he said, "I have known him for some time"—I said, "Is he good for a certain amount of business?" he said, "He is most respectable and can fairly be trusted to the extent of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." This was the office of the Massicot Cement Company, of which he was shipping agent—I was satisfied and executed the order—C. Smith came to my office to taste some brandy—I handed him the bill of lading</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180054"></xptr>
               <p>for the five hhds. of claret about 7th January—it came to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he accepted a bill for it payable at his office, which was met in April—he ultimately gave me an order for 50 doz. of brandy at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., free on board, the other side—that came to 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 4th February I received a letter from him saying that he was about opening a banking account at New South Wales and should in future make bills payable there—I forwarded the order to my principals—I received this bill of lading for that on 14th February, which I handed to Smith—it was <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> ship Lumley—a day or two after I handed him this draft for acceptance—it is drawn by Schroder Frères upon him for 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "Accepted payable at the Bank of New South Wales, C. C. Smith": it is in his handwriting—it was afterwards returned by Messrs. Schroder Freres dishonoured: "No account"—while that bill was running I received this memorandum, dated 19th February, giving an order for 50 doz. of brandy at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the other side, amounting to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received the bill of lading and handed it to Smith, together with a bill of exchange, dated 5th March, for the amount payable as before—about 20th March he called at my office and gave a verbal order for 10 cases, and afterwards I received this memorandum, altering it to 25 cases at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., amounting to 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I handed him the delivery order—we asked him if we should warehouse it at the Red Lion Wharf, as before, and he requested us to do so—I handed him the bill of exchange, drawn as before, payable at the Bank of New South Wales—at the time this became due the other two had been returned, so I did not present it—I subsequently had a further order for claret from him, which I did not execute—I met Smith in Leadenhall Street, about 20th March, and he gave me a card of Davis Brothers and Co., of 109, Fenchurch Street, similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he told me to take them some samples of brandy, I might do some business there—it was wanted for mixing purposes—I called there and saw on the door "Davis Brothers and Co."—the office was shut—it was about 11.30 a.m.—I called the next day and saw the prisoner Davis alone, and asked for one of the principals of the firm—he said he was Mr. Davis, and I told him I had a card of introduction to him from C. C. Smith—he spoke about some samples of brandy, and I asked him what kind of brandy, and what price he would require—he said, "The best you have at the lowest price you have"—I sent him samples and called on him again, when I saw the prisoner Hardinge—I asked if they had tasted the samples of brandy, and Davis said "Yes, but I prefer the one at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he gave me an order, which I took down in my pocket-book, for eight quarter<lb></lb>casks of brandy—it was to be marked D and a diamond—when I got back I found an order which Davis said he had sent, and which was for 16 quarter-casks—I called again and saw Davis, and he then altered the order to eight quarter-casks—these letters are in Davis's handwriting—I asked the mode of payment, and he said a three months' bill—I forwarded the order to my principals—before I received the bill of lading I wrote to Davis and Co. for a reference, and received this letter in reply, in Davis's writing, dated April 6th, 1878, marked T.: "109, Fenchurch Street. Messrs. Gabriel and Co. Gentlemen,—In reply to yours of to-day, we beg to refer you to Herbert, Thomas, and Co., Water Lane, Eastcheap," &amp;c.—I went there and saw some one, and inquired for one of the principals, and said I had been referred by Davis and Co.—he said he had known Davis for several years as a most respectable man—I asked him if I should</p>

               <p>be safe in doing business[with him—he said "Certainly"—I suggested 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he thought he was safe for that amount—I handed the bill of lading to Davis and sent him this draft for acceptance in the usual way—it is drawn by Schroder, on Davis Brothers and Co., for 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I saw the acceptance written on it in my office by Davis—it was in due course presented, and returned dishonoured, "No account"—before the bill was accepted I received a memorandum from Smith saying he wanted to see me particularly—I went to 23, Leadenhall Street, and saw him—he said he could not go into the matter, he wanted to see me about until the arrival of a gentleman—he arrived, he being Howard, whom I had met at Davis's office—he said, "I am sorry to inform you that a trouble has arisen between Davis and Hardinge, and some steps ought to be taken about your brandy" this was about the 10th or 11th April—Smith proposed that the eight quarter casks should be placed in his name, and he produced to me a copy of this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I approved of the transfer as a temporary measure—Howard said in Smith's presence that Davis had found that Hardinge had not been acting fairly or right with him—there are two signa<lb></lb>tures to the document, of Davis Brothers and Co.—I recognise the second one—it is on their usual note-paper—I wrote to the wharf, authorising the transfer into Smith's name—I required one of the quarter casks, and went to Smith about it early in the week, and said I wanted it by Thursday or Friday, as I could not get it the other side quick enough—he said he would endeavour to get one, but that he must consult Davis—this was about a fortnight after the bill was accepted—I saw Davis about it, and he said he would write me, which he did, saying I could have a quarter cask if I would give my acceptance—I went to Smith, and said I preferred giving my cheque, and paying the money into the City Bank, to part meet Davis's bill for 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Smith said he would have my acceptance instead, and as I was much pressed for the brandy, I agreed, and gave this acceptance for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was met at maturity—I have never been paid for the brandy—after I had seen F. Smith at Gresham House, he also ordered 100 cases, which I supplied, and he referred me to Marsh Brothers and Co., of Gres<lb></lb>ham Street—I never received payment—he gave me his acceptance, which was dishonoured, and at the time he came and said it would be paid—since these proceedings, I have been to Mr. Robert Attenborough, of the Minories, and have there identified several warrants relating to this brandy—they were produced at the police-court—these are warrants for seven out of eight quarter casks (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are three warrants relating to 30 cases, part of the brandy I supplied to Smith, the first lot—I have also been to the British and Foreign wharf, and seen there the seven quarter casks and the 30 cases of brandy, and at Red Lion Wharf I saw 49 out of the second 50 cases of brandy supplied to Smith—I parted with my goods on the faith of Smith being agent to the Queensland Emigration Commissioners, his respecta<lb></lb>bility generally, and the reference he gave me to Frederick Smith, and I parted with my goods to Davis Brothers from the introduction I had received from C. C. Smith, and also the reference to Herbert, Thomas, and Co. and I believe the bills to be reliable documents—Davis on one occasion said he believed Hardinge to be a rogue.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180056"></xptr>
               <p>did not care where the claret was as long as I got my money—I was informed it was for shipping—I approved of the transfer as a temporary measure—I did not know what was going to turn up—it was not so much to oblige me—I had to pay for it—it was a matter of business—I did not have transactions with Davis, which caused the transfer into Smith's name—after the arrangement was made at the wharf, Davis came to me and gave the acceptance—it was not understood between us that I was not to go to Davis—I got into no trouble with Schroder Freres—Davis was <hi rend="italic">non est</hi> there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PURCELL</hi>. When I went to Davis's office at 109, Fenchurch Street—I did not observe anything on the door about a lubricat<lb></lb>ing agency—I simply saw the word "Lubricator"—I did not see a number of lubricators upstairs—I saw a number of things which looked like mats, and there might have been other things open or unpacked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I cannot give you the exact date when I first saw Hardinge—I think it was about 25th or 26th March, and again two or three days afterwards at the same office, sitting at the table writing opposite Davis—it was about a fortnight or three weeks after that that Davis told me Hardinge was a rogue, when he was accepting the bill in my office, which was afterwards not paid.</p>
               <p>By the <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. The transfer of the eight quarter casks of brandy was effected after I had given up the bill of lading, but not before I had given up the goods.</p>
               <p>By <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SIMS</hi>. Smith was for some time appointed by me as agent at a commission of five per cent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. There was an understanding between Davis and Smith that the transfer should be made to Smith, so that it should not fall into Hardinge's hands at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. I had no authority from Davis and Hardinge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. Howard said he simply acted as a friend of mine in the matter—I should certainly not have parted with the goods had I known the warrants were going to be pawned.</p>

Smith, Colonial Govern<lb></lb>ment Agent, 97, Leadenhall Street," a few days after the tumblers were made, and Smith called and approved of them and ordered a hundred dozen—they would come to about 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I forwarded the order to Cochrane and Co.—Smith wanted them sent to the Poplar station, to his order, marked W. W. 1 to 4—he wanted them in by 10th August—I think they were in town by the 7th—this is the invoice, it is dated 7th August, which would be the time they left Glasgow—Smith said they arrived too late for a certain ship he wanted them to go out in, and in consequence he had lost the ship<lb></lb>ment by that vessel—this is the letter I received from my principals in Glasgow: "Dear Sir,—I have only to-day received your advice saying I have lost the ship, causing me delay and loss," dated 12th August, 1878—I told Smith my mode would be 5 per cent, and an extra 1¼ if he paid in a month, and being the first order I should require payment—about the beginning of September I applied for payment, and he said he should want a little more time as the goods had lost the ship—I said, "Very well, Mr. Smith, I will give you the time, shall we appoint a day?" he said, "Yes, if you like we will say 20th September for payment"—I was ill on the 20th, but I applied to him on the following Monday, at his office, for payment—he said he had been disappointed of some payments he was to receive, and could not settle—I applied two or three times afterwards, but did not get payment—on 2nd October I received this memo<lb></lb>randum marked A. R. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To Edward Cherer, from C. C. Smith. Dear Sir,—Mr. Smith would feel greatly obliged if you will draw on him for the amount of account at one month,"etc. "Yours truly, Scott") I did not do so—I afterwards received this post-card—I think it is dated 2nd September: "I presume you fully understand I require a duplicate shipment of tumblers at once"—he had said nothing about a duplicate shipment, and I did not execute the order, the others not having been paid for—I supplied the goods, as he was introduced by my friend, whom I had known for about 12 years, and Smith made it appear that he had been appointed Queensland Emigration agent entirely to this country, for that country, and upon that I let him have a small quantity of goods.</p>

               <p>109, Fenchurch Street—in April and May last I saw Davis at 109, Fen<lb></lb>church Street—at the end of May the name on the door was changed from "Davis Brothers" to "Hardinge and Co., lubricators"—I met Smith in Lombard Street on 14th October—I told him I was an officer, and held a warrant for his arrest—he said "Yes, very well; it is about some wines and brandies, is not it?"—I said "Yes"—he said "I thought so; a friend of mine told me that the police had it in hand. How long have you held the warrant?"—I said "From the commencement of this month; come to the police-station, I will read the warrant to you"—I took him there and read the warrant—he said "I see by this you want Fred Smith"—I said "Yes"—he said "I have not seen him for some time past; the last I heard from him was from York; he has had about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of the wines, and has led me into this, me only being his agent; I have also pawned some warrants with Messrs. Attenborough of the Minories for Davis, to enable him to go to Liverpool"—I said "Have you the contract notes for those warrants you have pledged?"—he said "No, I have not, I fancy I have lost them; I put them in a large pocket-book of mine"—I then went to his office, 97, Leadenhall Street, and found a number of papers in a tin box, and amongst them the contract notes which have been produced; and also the duplicate pawn-tickets relating to the sample brushes; also these letters—I also found a call-book, letter-book, and ledger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), also bill-files and invoices—I went to the police-station on the 15th, and found Davis in custody there—he said "Good afternoon, Green"—I said "Good afternoon, Davis; the last time I saw you was in May; I told you what it would come to"—he said "Quite right"—on the 18th October I arrested Hardinge at 109, Fenchurch Street—I said "You must consider yourself in custody; you will be charged by Messrs. Hutchins, solicitors, with being concerned with Courteney, Clarke, Smith, and Thomas Davis, now in custody, in conspiring with them to defraud people of goods"—he said "For God's sake don't take me now; let me wait a while," and he sat down, and after a time I took him to Bow Lane station—I then went again to his office, and found invoices, a letter-book, and other small books.

                  </hi>. I keep the Red Hart Livery-stables, Fetter-lane. In 1843, the prisoner was in my employ, as ostler—I did not keep any other man—at the latter end or August that year I had a grey mare in my stables, the property of Mr. Charles Beavan—I went from home on Thurs<lb></lb>day, 23rd Aug., and did not return till the following evening about seven o'clock, or later—I had heard something, and the prisoner came and told me he had taken Mr. Beavan's mare to Tattersall's, but as there was not room enough for it, he had brought it back, and would take it again—next morning, in consequence of what I heard, I said, "Now, Charles, I am going into the City, you will not move till I return, it will not be time to take Mr. Beavan's mare till six in the evening," meaning six o'clock on Saturday evening—this conversation was on Friday night, and I repeated it on Saturday morning—he made no reply on Friday evening, but in the morning when I was going out, I said, "Now, Charles, I am going into the City, don't you move from the yard till my return"—this was about eleven o'clock—he said nothing about having seen Mr. Webb about the mare, or Mr. Bedsor—I came back about half-past one o'clock—I found the prisoner gone, and the mare also—I did not see him again till he was in custody, a short time ago—the mare was brought back by a</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister—I have chambers in Lin<lb></lb>coln's-inn—in August, 1843, I had a mare standing at Mrs. Savage's stbles—on Thursday, the 31st, I gave the prisoner directions to take it to Tattersall's on Friday, to be sold on the following Monday—I believe they require a horse to be there one day on view—the policeman fetched me to Mr. Webb's stable, in Gray's Inn-lane, on the Monday—I there found my mare—it was taken from there—the inspector and several of the police were there—I know nothing of this receipt—I have no clerk named Clark—it was never written by my authority—I believe I had named 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the price of the mare in the prisoner's hearing—he stated to me pre<lb></lb>vious to the Thursday that a butcher had made an offer for it—I do not recollect the sum he named, but it was so small I declined it—I never gtfe him authority to sell it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Of course you have well considered the last an<lb></lb>swer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not the slightest doubt about it—an action has been brought against me for taking the mare from Webb's, and a verdict against me—a rule is pending for a new trial—I have sold the mare to the sane gentleman that Webb had sold her to—it wat to be sold for what she would fetch, but I do not remember telling the prisoner so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you tell the prisoner to take her to Tattersall's, and sell her far what she would fetch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it would be inconsistent to say so—my belief is that I did not—I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect the prisoner telling you he had a conversation with Bedsor about the mare when you came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and your saying you thought you could get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect it, and believe I did not say so—I swear I did not say, "Well, Charles, you will see the person about buying the mare in the morning; if he does not buy her I do not intend to keep her any longer, as she is no use to me, as she is eating her head off"—I recollect his telling me he had anoffer from a butcher—he told me the price, and I declined to sell her—I never said, "Sell her at Tattersall's, or anywhere else"—I directed him to take her to Tattersall's, and did not fix any price—I do not believe I said, "Let her go for what she will fetch"—I believe I did not—it is two years ago—I am quite cer<lb></lb>tain I did not.</p>

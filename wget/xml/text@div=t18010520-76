             sworn. - I am an officer,(produces the property): On Tuesday, the 19th of May, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner with a bundle; I had had a description of her from the prosecutor; I traced her to a lodging-house, in Dyot-street, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>(To Mrs. Cramer). Q. How long had the prisoner lived with you? - A.Four months.</p>
               <p>Horwood. When I came up into the garret, I saw the prisoner sitting at the foot of the bed; there were two old women in the room; I told her she must go along with me; I asked her who that bundle belonged to at the foot of the bed, and she told me it was her's; I took her to St. Ann's watch-house; some of the things in the bundle were her own property; Mrs. Cramer came to the watch-house; I opened the bundle in her presence, and she claimed the articles that I now produce; the prisoner put her hand into her pocket and took out a box, which I took from her; it contained nine guineas in gold; I asked her whose money it was, and she told me it belonged to her mistress; Mrs. Cramer said she could not swear to the gold, but she had lost ten guineas; I searched her pocket at the watch-house, and in one of her pockets I found a veil, which Mrs. Cramer said was her's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cramer. I know all the things; they are all marked.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence. <rs id="t18010520-76-verdict420" type="verdictDescription">

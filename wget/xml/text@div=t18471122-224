                  </hi> I am a jeweller, at 117, High-street, Southwark—it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. George-the-Martyr, South<lb></lb>wark—on Monday, 1st Nov., between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in—I was him standing looking at a tray, containing diamond pins—I watched and distinctly saw him take a pin off the cushion, and place it in his pocket—I went into the shop, and stood there till he had selected a pin which he said he would take on the following Saturday—he left half-a-crown deposit on it—he was then going out—I said, "You will excuse me, but before you leave the shop I wish to put my hand in your left hand pocket"—he thrust his hand into his pocket and took out this diamond pin which I produce, and dropped it in the tray amongst the others—it is mine—it is worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he attempted to get out of the shop—I caught hold of him, my young man came to my assistance, and he bit his arm very severely.</p>

                  </hi> I am in the employ of Mr. Hughes. On 1st Nov. the prisoner came to look at some diamond pins—I showed him a tray which I placed on the counter—he wished to see some others—I turned to get another tray and put that on the counter—he then selected a pin from the first tray, and left me half-a-crown and his name—Mr. Hughes spoke to him, and he dropped this pin on the tray from his hand.</p>

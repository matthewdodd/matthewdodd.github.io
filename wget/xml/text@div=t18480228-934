                  </hi> I am a mason—I kept a beer-shop, in Cols<lb></lb>man-street, Woolwich. I know the prisoners Johnson, Flowers, and Burlton—I cannot say that I have ever seen Mayhew—on Saturday, 22nd Jan., Burlton had something to drink at my house—he had been there many times before—he said he wanted to speak to me, and I went out with him towards Warwick-street—in the course of conversation he said, "Would not a <hi rend="italic">thick</hi> one or two be very serviceable this cold weather?"—I laughed, and said I did not know what he meant—he then said, "Can't you <hi rend="italic">tumble?</hi>" meaning "Cannot you understand"—I said, "No"—he said, "Do you know any one that has got any <hi rend="italic">dust</hi>, any plate, or watches, or anything that is valuable?"—I said, "Now I understand you"—he said, "I was concerned in that affair of Covill's, for which I had a tenner out, and nobody knew anything of the affair"—I said, "Oh, did they give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said, "Yes"—I under<lb></lb>stood by a <hi rend="italic">tenner</hi>, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I have often heard that expression made use of—I have heard him make use of it—he asked me if I would go as a copartner with him, and so on, and said I could sit down and <hi rend="italic">blow</hi> my '<hi rend="italic">bacco</hi>,' and have 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and need not be seen in the affair at all—I told him I would consider—we then went to the Trafa'gar, and had some rum—on the way there, he said, "If you <hi rend="italic">split</hi>, I shall swear it is a d—d lie"—after we came out, he pointed to a grocer's of the name of Oliver, and said, "That is one I intend <hi rend="italic">to do</hi>"—we then parted—I saw him again next day, Sunday, and he said, "I think I was a little <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> last night, was I not?"—I said, "I think you were"—he said, "I mean all that I said last night, if you do?"—I said, "I never commence a thing unless I go through with it, if I can"—I after<lb></lb>wards made a communication to Mr. Levy, the inspector of the Woolwich police, and informed him of the arrangements I was about to make, and he sanctioned what I did—I went to Mr. Mould's, at the Powerful, on the next Sunday—I had been there repeatedly before to see him, but could not; and I went repeatedly to Mr. Covill's before I could see him—I at last saw him, had some conversation with him, and went with him and Mr. Mould to the inspector—I afterwards went to Burlton—he asked how I got on—I told him thought we had got a little bit o a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> that would suit; that I understood there was a good bit of money up stairs at the Powerful—(that was in pursuance of an arrangement I had made with Mr. Mould and the inspector)—Burlton said, "Oh, when must it be done?"—I told him, "Be<lb></lb>fore Friday"—this was on Monday—he said, "Then I will go up to-morrow.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184802280150"></xptr>
               <p>to London, and introduce you to the parties, in order to bring them down"—he called on me about two o'clock on the Tuesday, 1st Feb., and we went to<lb></lb>wards the wharf where we were to embark—before we got there, he said, "We will ca on Mr. James, I want to see him"—he is a watchmaker—I went with him into James's house, and he said he was going to London, and wanted the direction of a Dr. Penny—Mr. James said he would give it him, and he got his book, and wrote the direction—Mr. James went away into the shop or up stairs, and Burlton said, "There are five is watches there, and there are plenty more up stairs, which I shall take; this is one that we must <hi rend="italic">do</hi> on a Sun<lb></lb>day night; but I do not think he has got much cash"—there were five watches on the table—we then went across the river, by the Eastern Counties Railway-boat, and went up by the rail; but before that he said, "I will show you how I can work the old man out;" and when we came out, he said, "Take particular notice of the locks, and so on, so that we can give a parti<lb></lb>cular description of them when we get up"—he asked Mr. James if he would take anything, and he came with us to the Pier Tavern, and had a pot of porter; and after that he said, "You see how I can work him out"—while on board the boat he made a remark about Fryer, a policeman, and said, "What is that <hi rend="italic">bobby</hi> doing there?"—he went up to Shoreditch, and after we had got out of the train, Burlton said, "So help me God, I thought he would have <hi rend="italic">crabbed</hi> the <hi rend="italic">deal</hi>"—he meant that I was trying to put some one of his to catch him—I said, "Oh no, why should you think that; if you have not got confidence in me, don't go any farther"—he said, "Oh no, come on, it is all right now, I see"—when we got to town, we went to the Duke of Wel<lb></lb>lington, and from there to the Folly House Lamb's-fields, Bethnal-green—the name of "John Flowers" is over the door—we went into the tap-room—it was then about three—there were four people there, playing at cards—we waited till four, when Flowers and Johnson came into the room—they were going out again on seeing me, but Burlton said, "He is one of us'" and they came back again, and we all four went not the parlour—while there altoge<lb></lb>ther, Burlton said, "We have brought you a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">job</hi>"—Johnson said, "That is right, what is it?"—Burlton said, "It is a public-house job, and almost as good as the other, I think, but this party will tell you more about it than I can"—Johnson said, "I hope we shall not have so much trouble as we had with the other;' and he blamed Burlton, and said if he had not have <hi rend="italic">crabbed it</hi> the second time, he would have been in that—Flowers asked when it was to be done—Burlton said, "Before Friday, for that is his brewer's day"—Johnson said, "We will go down to-morrow, and meet you at the some house as before," meaning he Trafalgar—we were to be there a little before three—Burlton said, "Mr. Mould is a man of the world, he must be worked out;" and said that as I knew him I could do so—I said I would take his to Greenwich, as I had a little business there—Burlton was to look that see Mould and me pass, in order to go to th Traflagar, to let them know that we had passed, and were out—Johnson said if there was anything like 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he should give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and Burlton 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the Wednesday afternoon, and Feb., about one, I called on Mr. Mould—he went out with me, and we west towards the piper, past Burlton's house—I did not see him in the shop—so I went in, and he came out of the back-room, and said I was <hi rend="italic">piping of</hi> you—I thought be meant that he saw us—Mr. Mould did not hear that, he walked on—I afterwards joined him, about a hundred yards on—we then went to the sand-pits, and came round by another road, at the back, and into his house; that had been arranged between us—we went into the back-parlour,</p>

               <p>where there is a curtain—we looked under the curtain, and in about three minutes after three, Flowers came in, and called for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy and water—he stood at the bar, and said to Miss Mould, the bar<lb></lb>maid, "Is your father out?"—she said, "Yes; he is gone to take a walk to Greenwich"—he said, "It is a very fine day for a walk, Miss?"—she said, "Yes, sir"—he said, "I see you have got several beer-shops about here"—she said, "Yes"—he said, "I think you have too many;" that was all I could hear—he stopped there, drinking his brandy and water, and smoking his cigar—Johnson then came in, and Mayhew followed him in almost immediately, as close as could be, and they both passed Flowers, and went up stairs—there were some policemen in the parlour with us, and I pointed out the prisoners to them as they came in—there is a coffee—room up stairs, over the bar—when I was at Flowers's house, he brought out a package of skeleton keys from a drawer and another from the cupboard, in the parlour—they were placed on the table, and Burlton said, "These are the men to handle these sort of things; there are not better in London"—I afterwards, when the prisoners were in custody, accompanied the policeman to Flowers's house, and pointed out the place where I had seen the keys, and they were found there—from the Sunday, the second day that Burlton spoke to me about this, I acted in compliance with the police, and in concert with them and Mr. Mould.</p>

               <p>it was all right at the Folly-house beer-shop, when Burlton said he had brought a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">job</hi>—I am not confusing Johnson with any one else—I do not know a widow of the name of Saunders—I recollect an excursion taking place—it was not for the benefit of a poor widow and her family—I do not know who the benefit was for—the <hi rend="italic">Odd Fellows</hi> got it up—I was then a member—I sold ten of the tickets—I received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for each ticket—I never paid that to anybody, because they owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, for my expenses, in going down to Gravesend to hire the boat for them—the committee agreed to pay my expenses, but did not—I cannot say for whose benefit the excursion was—I did not see something in the bills about a widow—each of the committee were to have one ticket free, so I accounted for nine—the boat was to be 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the captain had 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would not go without the whole of the money, on account of his orders from the proprietors—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid him, and I advanced 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I considered he had a right to have it—I suppose about two hundred and fifty <hi rend="italic">Odd Fellows</hi> went in the boat—I planned this robbery at Mr. Mould's—I had never worked at his house—I used to pay my men there when I was a master—I sometimes had twenty or thirty men, according to business—I told Burlton that the money would be in the bedroom over the coffee-room, and the coffee-room was over the bar; that would be on the third-floor, including the ground-floor—there are two rooms there—there is a stair<lb></lb>case—the doors of the rooms are directly opposite each other, and there is only four and a half inches between them—the staircase is lighted fort the window of the concert-room, which is on the first-floor, over the skittle<lb></lb>ground—it is a very dark staircase; it is quite dark in the passage—I never noticed any gas lighted there during the day—Mr. Moule told me, on the Monday or Tuesday, that Friday was his brewer's day—I advised him to put his money between the bed and mattress, and I told the prisoner it would be found there—I do not think Mr. Mould keeps a cash-box—I did not observe any drawers in the room—I first told Mr. Covill of this on the 30th, and Mr. Mould next—Burlton had spoken to me on the 22nd—I tried to see Mr. Covill between the 22nd and 30th, but he was engaged in London—this is the first time I have had to do with anything of this kind, and I hope it will be the last—I swear I was never the means of anybody's being taken in to custody before—I have never been a <hi rend="italic">plant</hi> before, not ever <hi rend="italic">peached</hi>—I have never been <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>—I have never been under a lock—I swear I have always been a respectable character.</p>

                  </hi> I am a watchmaker, at Woolwich, and a goldsmith of the City of London. I have known Burlton five years—he has borne a most honourable and upright character, to the best of my belief—I recollect the witness, Duffield, calling with Burlton at my shop some time in Feb.—I took them through the shop into the parlour—Burlton called on me to give him the address of Dr. Penny, who lived in Billiter-street, and who had run into his debt 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave it him—I did not leave him and Duffeld alone together from the time they came in till they left—I heard all that passed between them—I did not go from one shop to the other, nor go up stairs.</p>

               <p>ROBERT GRIFFITH. I was with Enwright in the fields- I saw he had a bag in his hand, and he showed me a shilling and two halfpence in it; the prisoners came up together; Thacton took the bag from him, and gave it to Light - they then threw something into the water, and said there was the bag and money; they took the shilling out, and wanted to give the bag and the two halfpence back -Enwright said he would give them the penny if they would give him the shilling; they then got up, and we went to go after them - they said they would beat us - we saw an officer, and told him.</p>
               <p>JAMES MARONA. I was selling some fruit on the Bays-water-road - I gave Light change for 1s., and he bought 1d. worth of nuts of me, on the 2nd of May, between six and seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS TURNER (Police-constable A 43). Enwright told me of this; I had seen the two prisoners pass me just before - I pursued, and took them at Knights-bridge; I found 9 1/2d. on them, part on each of them - the other 1 1/2d. Thacton said he had bought milk with.</p>
               <p>Thacton's Defence. I saw the two boys gambling, and I took up the bag, which I carelessly threw to Light, but we took nothing out of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Booth; the prisoner was in his service; she came on Shrove-Tuesday. On Saturday afternoon 3rd May, I missed a collar of my daughter's—I asked the prisoner if she had seen it—she denied having seen it—she had had notice to quit, and knew she was to leave that evening—the collar had been in a cupboard in the kitchen; I had seen it there on the Thursday before—I took the prisoner that Saturday evening, at six o'clock, to St. Pancras Workhouse, where I had her from—I paid the wages due to her to the matron—I told the matron, in the prisoner's presence, that I thought she had a collar belonging to my daughter—the prisoner made no reply—the matron searched her, and the collar was found in a pocket of mine which was round her waist—I had not told her she might have that pocket—I also found a pair of mittens and a hair-brush—she had a bundle with her, and in that I found a pocket-handkerchief and a silver fruit-knife—these are the articles, they are all mine—she said if I would forgive her she would never do it again.</p>

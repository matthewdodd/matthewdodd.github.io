               <p>I went out about a quarter or twenty minutes after seven, I locked my door safe, and latched the outer door, I pushed it with my knee, I am sure I latched it.</p>
               <p>Were any of your lodgers at home at that time? - All of them, I believe; I returned again, about a quarter after eight, and the street door was locked, I could not get in, I called to my lodger that lodged in the garret, and she came down and let me in, when I went in I found my door wide open, and the room in darkness, I called her back again to let me have a light, and the first thing I missed, was the watch from the mantle piece, I looked round the room, and found the bag of clothes was gone, nobody was in the room; in a short time my husband came home.</p>
               <p>Is that lodger who opened the door for you here? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not know how the outer door came locked? - No, the lodgers were all at home, two in the chambers, and one in the garret, my room was the lower room, the door just by the street door.</p>
               <p>How did the door appear to have been opened? - It was forced open, the lock was spoiled.</p>
               <p>Could that be done without making a noise sufficient to alarm the lodgers? - I do not know, the woman that lives in the chamber is hard of hearing, and the woman in the garret might not hear it, I was not long in the place before the officer came in the place, and asked me if I was not robbed.</p>

               <p>Jury. Where is the woman? - When the Gentleman met me, I went to look for the woman, but I could not see her, there is somebody at the door for my character.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to ask the prosecutor's wife, whether she tried the door? - It was tied back with a piece of string, I left it on the latch, because we had lodgers in the house, and could not fasten the door.</p>

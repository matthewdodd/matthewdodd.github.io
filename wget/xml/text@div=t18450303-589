                  </hi>. I am a plane, saw, and tool maker, and live at No. 2, High-street, in the parish of St. Giles. On the night of the 5th of Feb., I went to bed about twelve o'clock—I was the last up—there is ao inward communication from my shop to the house, by means of stairs, which lead to the different dwelling-rooms above the shop—I was awoke about five in the morning, by the policeman—on getting up I found the street-door open, which I am confident I had shut—it was not fastened in any way, no more than by the ordinary bolt of the lock—it was fastened in usual manner—I am sure it was locked the night before—I found two or three drawers under the counter partly open, and missed some brass and bell<lb></lb>wires, with a brass bolt, and two pair of antique shoe-buckles—one pair was of copper, inlaid with mother-o'-pearl, I believe, or something similar—I</p>

On Thursday morning, the 6th of Feb., about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner in High-street, St. Giles's—I saw something bulky in his jacket-pocket—he had a round fustian jacket on—I watched him for about 200 yards, then came be<lb></lb>hind him, and asked what he had in his pocket, at the same time touch<lb></lb>ing the bottom of his pocket with my hand—he said, "Nothing but tome bits of iron I have been picking up"—I said, "You don't pick iron up at one o'clock in the morning, do you?"—he said, "O, I picked it up in the course of the day"—I put my hand into his pocket, and pulled out a shoe-buckle—I said that was not iron, I was not satisfied, and should take him to the station—I took him to the station, searched him, and found the articles I now produce in his jacket pocket.</p>

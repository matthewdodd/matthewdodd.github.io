            . I am a butcher, and live in George-yard. I have frequently seen the prisoners about there. On the 20th of July I was in the George, public-house; the prisoners sat in a box on the other side by themselves - Carthy sat in a box with me and Jones, and another Englishman whom I do not know. The servant, and another woman or two, were dancing. Carthy went to light his pipe and dance with them, I believe. Two of the Irishmen jumped from their box when they saw Carthy going to dance, pitched into him, and gave him three or four blows - they were Callaghan and

I saw Carthy next day, he was trying to work; he complained of a clicking in his head where it was fractured. I went with him that morning to the doctor's in Wentworth-street, near George-court, and saw his wounds dressed; there were two or three wounds and a large fracture in the skull. I saw him again next day, with his head in a dreadful state. He asked me to go with him to have it dressed, but I could not bear it. The plaister had worked off, it appeared to be a large wound, as if done with the knob of a poker.</p>

               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. You left the house in consequence of hearing that the Irish were coming to murder you - A. Yes, I left hastily. I saw Carthy running out after me. The deceased got worse and worse, he did not appear in a condition to go to a dance on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>WM. ROBERTSON. I am a carpenter, and live in Wentworth-street. On the 20th of July, I was in the tap-room of the George, Carthy and I went in together. I do not recollect seeing S. Williams, about twenty persons were there, principally Irish. I recollect Callaghan, and Mrs. Donovan there; Callaghan was dancing with some women, Carthy got up to go to the fire to light his pipe; he took hold of the servant, and said</p>
               <p>"Betty, we will have a step together;" Callaghan then struck him, and immediately another man who is not here, came out and struck him too, he did not return the blow, but was sitting down, and was immediately seized by several people, who said nothing but dragged him away into the back yard, they were then going out as fast as they could - they collared him and dragged him away as though he was a child, he was on his feet as long as I saw him; I went into the court and saw a quantity of people rushing through into New-court. I saw Garvin and Marney with bludgeons, beating Carthy. I did not notice any of the prisoners. I saw several women heaving brick bats towards the deceased. I stood there till they had pretty well killed him. I suppose there were forty or fifty, men, women, and children there. I do not remember seeing the prisoners in the court, they might have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you last saw the deceased, in what situation was he - A. Apparently dead, and all over in a gore of blood, he appeared to be wounded in the left side of his head. I saw him a quarter of an hour after with his head tied up. I saw him five or six times every day, he appeared in a very bad state.</p>

            . I am a German, and an apothecary. On the 26th of July, I was assistant to Mr. Rogers, in Wentworth-street, Brick-lane, about twenty yards from the George, public-house, an Irishman was brought in wounded, between ten or eleven at night. I ordered a hairdresser to shave him; he could not do it, and so I did it myself; his wounds appeared dangerous; it was the same man that afterwards went into the hospital, they called him Jerry. I dressed his wounds in Fortesque's presence, the principal wound was in the side bone, on the right hand side of the skull, that was the most dangerous. I probed it, but could not say whether the skull was fractured. I attended him four or five days and told him to go into the hospital, but he would not. I thought by good care his wounds could be cured, but he came more than once intoxicated. I told him if he did not pay attention, he would die of his wounds; the principal one seemed to be done with a blunt iron; he was bruised all over; when he was dead, I felt that his skull was fractured, but before I could not tell that, as it was so swollen. I had told him not to work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he first came to you, did he appear drunk or sober - A.Drunk; he called on me on the Monday after the accident, without any dressing whatever on his wound; he said he could not keep them on; he mentioned nothing about any accident happening to him on Sunday.</p>
               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. You told him to take care, or his wounds would he fatal - A. Yes, I told him to take the people up. Such a blow would occasion a man to appear intoxicated, but he smelt of gin. There was no appearance of a new injury on the Monday.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. On the 28th of July, the deceased was admitted as a patient; the principal wound was on the left side of the head; he had a very trifling one on the back of his head. A small quantity of hair round the wound had been shaven off, they appeared to be inflicted by some weapon. I suppose they had been inflicted several days; the inflammation on the skin had subsided very much; the wound was closing. I probed it, there was a very trifling fracture of the external table of the skull, but it had rose again, there was a circular fissure but it was not depressed. In consequence of the wound an inflammation had taken place in the brain, which caused his death; but probably the inflammation would not have been so severe if he had not continually drank, but there would be no inflammation had it not been for the wound; the brain was injured both by the depression and inflammation, the blow naturally produced inflammation, and intemperance afterward would increase it. Intemperance would not occasion the inflammation if it was not for the blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The skull was not depressed when you saw it - A. No. I suppose it had been, on account of the fracture all round; the diameter was about the size of a sixpence. The inflammation might be much aggravated by intoxication. If he had proper attention, and was kept sober, he probably might have recovered.</p>
               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. He was in the hospital from the 28th of July, till the 4th of August, during that time there was no intemperance - A. Certainly not. I do not think the wound would have caused the death of the most temperate man, he was intoxicated when he came to the hospital, the wound might have been healed with proper attention, it was very slight; the fracture did not press on the brain, it was the pressure of the matter that caused his death, the accident was the existing cause, no doubt. I ascribe the inflammation to the wound.</p>
               <p>MR. JUSTICE BEST. Q. Suppose the man to have received the blow and lived temperately, and not had surgical assistance, do you think the blow would have caused his death - A. The blow of itself would certainly have killed him, if he had no had surgical assistance.</p>

            . I was at the George on this night, between five and six o'clock, and saw the deceased there, like a drunken man. I stopped until seven o'clock. Callaghan came in and sat at my table - he began to dance with some woman, the deceased interfered and interrupted the dance - Callaghan shoved him aside, and a man of Carthy's company stood up, and said</p>
               <p>"D - n me if you are for fighting, let us make a general fight, and side out man for man." A woman said</p>
               <p>"If you don't get out, you will get hurt by these people;" I said for what - I then went away as quick as possible, all the company I sat with went out. Carthy's party followed them out, a row commenced, and I ran to the Black-horse.</p>
               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. What time did you leave - A. Between eight and nine o'clock.</p>

            . I have kept the George since the 3d of July. I have been eight years in the business. I was at home until about seven o'clock, I then went into the City; the deceased had been working for me several days before. My wife sent for me, when I came home I found Carthy standing at the door of the taproom, it was about nine o'clock. I believe he was alone in the house, as the doors had been shut; I remonstrated with him for getting tipsy, saying, I supposed he had caused the quarrel, he said he had not, and immediately left the house - he was very tipsy then. I had refused to serve him about five o'clock in the afternoon; he was drunk the whole of the next day with his friends, and on the Saturday he came and blocked up a door-way for me, he had been drinking then. On the Monday or Tuesday following, when I got up, I found him at my door, he said he had been up all night, and went to sleep upon my table.</p>
               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. Did you see the last witness at your house that night - A. No, I think Callaghan was there. I had seen the deceased ten days before that, he had two black eyes, and his temple was cut.</p>
               <p>MARY M'KENNEDY. I knew the deceased. On the Sunday after this row, I danced with him, there was a large party, more than three dozen - there was a piper, it was in George-yard, New-court, the floor give way under us, and we all fell into the cellar, Carthy fell - I saw him when he came out of the cellar, and I asked him if he felt hurt, he said Yes, in his head a little - the dance lasted three hours.</p>
               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. You danced with him three hours - A. Yes. We took it by turns. He brought the piper into the court.</p>

            . I was at the dance with Carthy on the Sunday after the row, there were about fifty persons, the floor gave way, and Jerry and I fell in together; he was in liquor - he had been drinking with me the whole day, and would not be satisfied until he had a jig. I picked him up - his nose bled, I took him into the George, and asked him what he would have to drink, he said he could bear nothing, that his head and his heart were bruised, and he should never get over it.</p>
               <p>MR. JESSOP. Q. Was his head bound up when he fell - A. No, he was very well - nobody would have thought any thing was the matter with him.</p>

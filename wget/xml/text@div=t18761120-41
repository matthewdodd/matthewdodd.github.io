                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On the afternoon of the 2nd November I was on duty in Brushfield Street about 2 p.m. with Wright, another detec<lb></lb>tive—we saw the prisoner Hart, and followed him to the Nag's Head public-house, Houndsditch—he had this bag with him, empty apparently—when he had been in there about five minutes Bright came along and entered the same compartment, carrying a parcel—he remained about five minutes, and came out without the parcel—I followed him into St. Mary Axe, stopped him, and asked him what he had done with the parcel he took into the public-house—he said he gave it to a friend of his—I said "What is your friend's name?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "What is his address?"—he said "I don't know—I told him I should take him to the station, and he would be charged with stealing from his em<lb></lb>ployer—I asked him where he worked—he said "At Messrs. Teep's, Aid<lb></lb>gate"—I took him to the station, and went back to Houndsditch and saw Wright, who had had observation on the house in my absence—we waited until Hart came out—he was carrying the same bag, apparently containing the small parcel that Bright took in—I had seen the bag before in the bar<lb></lb>room when he went into the public-house—we stopped him, and asked him what he had got in the bag—he said "I have some leather "—Wright asked him where he got it from—he said "I bought it of a man in the public-house "—we took him to the station—we there found a small parcel in the bag containing this leather, done up in brown paper, apparently the same as Bright took in—Wright asked Bright what he had to say respect<lb></lb>ing the leather, and he said "I took it from Messrs. Teep, 10, Aldgate "—Wiggins &amp; Teep is the name of the firm; they carry on business in the name of Downing Carter"—Hart gave his address, 76, Prescott Street, and said he carried on the trade of a bookbinder at Ford Street, Spitalfields—I afterwards went with Wright to Ford Street, and found a quantity of leather cut up for use, apparently for bookbinding—it resembles the kind of leather found in the parcel—I found four and half reams of paper in his room in Prescott Street—Bright's address was correct.</p>

I did not tell Bright who I was when I stopped him—he never asked me—he may have seen me before—I did not caution him—I will swear I said at the police-court that he said he took the leather from Wiggins &amp; Teep's—my depositions were read over to me—to the best of my belief it is in the depositions—I should be rather surprised to hear that it is not—I heard Wright examined—to the best</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). I was on duty with Wolsey—I saw Hart going along Brushfield Street, carrying the bag produced under his arm—I followed him into Houndsditch—I saw him go into the Nag's Head public-house—shortly after I saw Bright go in with this brown paper parcel he came out again in a few minutes without the parcel—Wolsey followed Bright—I went into the public-house, and saw the parcel lying by the side of Hart—I came out again and saw Hart come out, carrying a bag—I said to him "We are police-officers; what have you in this bag? "—he said "Leather "—I said "Where did you get it from? "—he said "I bought it of a man"—"I said "What man?"—he said "I don't know "—I took him to the station and took the leather out of the parcel—I said to Bright, who was in custody, "How do you account for this?"—he said "I took it from my employers, Messrs. Wiggins &amp; Co, 10, Aldgate "—Wolsey was present when he said that and the inspector in the room—Hart was at the station when that was said—the address he gave at Prescott Street was correct—I said to Hart "Don't you go by the name of Skid-more" is not your right name Skidmore?"—Ke said "Yes, I cany on business at 6, Ford Street, Spitalfields, as a bookbinder"—I found some more leather there corresponding with this produced—the other constable—searched the other place.</p>

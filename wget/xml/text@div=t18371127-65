                  </hi>. I live in No. 65, High Holborn, and am servant to Tho<lb></lb>mas Steel. At half-past three o'clock on the afternoon of the 8th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for some half-boots—I took one pair to her, and tried them on—I gave her three pairs to look at—I missed a pair on the left of them, which I had hung over a rail—I ob<lb></lb>served a piece of string, with which they were tied, under her shawl—she then sent me to the window to get some light boots—I went out, sent the boy for a policeman, and when I saw him come back with the boy I packed up a pair of boots that she purchased—she gave me a half-sove<lb></lb>reign—I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change; and when she went out I gave her in charge—the officer found two pairs on her, one rolled up in paper, which she had purchased, and the other pair under her shawl—she said she did not know that she had them, she thought it was her old boots, and that she had had a bad fever.</p>

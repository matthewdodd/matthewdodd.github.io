                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-called</hi>). On 9th June I went, with Whitney and Mr. Napier to Parram's shop in Queen's-road, Dalston—I saw a pony and cart at the door; Parram was loading it—it was a middling-sized cart, rather too big for the pony—it was a little black pony—I saw him put boilers and ovens in the cart—there was a boy assisting him—I received some communication from Mr. Napier, and I spoke to the prisoner—I told him we were officers (Whitney was with me), and, pointing to Mr. Napier, I said, "This person is from Mr. Allan's, in Upper Thames-street; he says this metal belongs to them, how do you account for the possession of it?"—Parram said, "I will show you the bills"—Mr. Napier and I then went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186307130091"></xptr>
               <p>to his house in Hertford-street, close by, and left Whitney behind in posses<lb></lb>sion of the metal—Parram got down three files with bills on them, and took off three from the lot; they related to some small dealings with Mr. Allan; one was for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., another for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other for some small amount—I should not think they exceeded 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—they did not relate to any of the property we had found in the cart or on the premises—I told him that, and said I wanted to see the invoices for the metal he had fetched away that day week—he could not find any other, and we went back to the cart—he said before that that he had not been in Thames-street for more than a fortnight—we took possession of the metal in the cart, and all that in the shed which Mr. Napier identified—I told Parram we had two men in custody, who were coming up on the next Friday, and that he had better bring those receipts and come up to Guildhall, and then he could account for how he became possessed of the metal, and have it back again if the Alderman thought proper—he said—n Here is a person who will be answerable for my coming," alluding to Mr. Tully, who came in at the time—Tully said, "I don't know about being answerable, but as far as I have had dealings with him I always thought him straightforward"—Parram said he would come to Guildhall, and we left—there was an examination at Guild<lb></lb>hall on Friday, when Hardy, Woodward, and Adams were in custody—I did not see Parram there—there was a remand—he did not attend at the remand—I went to his house several times after the Friday, and left word with his wife for him to be there—I did not find him at his house—he appeared, at the last examination, and was taken into custody—we left a summons at the house for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At the time you went on the Tuesday first of all, had you any warrant for his apprehension? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; we simply requested him to come on the Friday—he did not come—you were there, and said he would come next time—he did not come—we left a summons—he then came, and was put in the dock with the other prisoners—he and his wife were both searching for the bills at his house—I never heard anything said about an 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. invoice, it was not produced then—Mrs. Parram brought one invoice down to the shed afterwards—I did not see the two—I did not take posses<lb></lb>sion of any—I have been in three cases this session—I think I have given you a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that happened at the shed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Allan—we load our goods in the front of our warehouse in Thames-street—we have no means of loading in Smith's-ride, and no right whatever to go down there—this letter (produced) is in Hardy's writing—it was sent to Mr. Allan, Glasgow—I have looked at the items of these three invoices, and compared them with our books—Parram's dealings with Mr. Allan are to a very small amount, some<lb></lb>where about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not more—they extend to within the last eighteen months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder—I have known Parram over seven years—he is a smith—I have had dealings with him—this invoice, dated April 18th, is made out by Parram for goods sold to me—they came from his premises, and were paid for—they were fitted up in four houses in the Marlborough-road—I told Mr. Napier where they were to be seen—the amount of this bill is 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it includes ranges, register stoves, and things of that description—here is another bill of 16th May, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I bought these goods of Parram—they were delivered and paid for—some were fixed, not all—I told Mr. Napier where he could see them—there is another invoice of 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a gaoler at Newgate—I received this letter from Hardy, and it was sent in the ordinary way to the party to whom it is addressed. (Read, see page 387).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hardy's Defence</hi>. If the witnesses who have been examined had been there at any other time in the day they would have seen plenty of other carts loading in Smith's-ride. I had no authority to load there. I used my own judgment, and had done so long before Mr. Napier or Mr. Hutchinson came there, to avoid Messrs. Smith's waggons which were in front. On this 2d of June, I think it was, I took a boiler; it might have been that one. It was not whole, and I handed three pieces of metal into Mr. Parram's cart that morning. It was Adam's place to account for it; it was in his department. I merely handed the metal in, and never before but once in my life did I ever load anything into Mr. Parram's cart. I will swear that; only twice. As to the copper doors and other things, I know nothing about them.</p>

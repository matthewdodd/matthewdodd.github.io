It appear'd by the Evidence, That they were both very much in Wine, had been always good Friends, and very respectful to one another: That their Conversation that Night was chiefly in Welch; but the Deceas'd growing suddenly uneasie, told the Prisoner (in English) he was a Puppy, and turn'd him round, which was again repeated; to which he replied, Sir, I know it, and shew'd a Desire to go away; but some time after this, they both drew, and some of the Evidence saw 'em thrusting at one another with the utmost Fury, as they lay upon the Ground.

The Prisoner too was very much wounded. The Deceased desir'd of every body that saw him afterwards, that the Prisoner might come to no Trouble about it, for that it was fairly done; and particularly told one of the Evidences. That Esq. Griffith was his very good Friend; that he heartily forgave him; but since he knew the Laws must have their Course, he earnestly beg'd him to do his Friend all the Service he could upon his Trial.

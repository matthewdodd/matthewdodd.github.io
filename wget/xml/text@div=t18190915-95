            . I discharged the prisoner when I first came up about the bill. About a month ago I saw him at the Mansion-house, in custody. His examination was postponed, that I might go again to Manchester and Carlisle, which I did, and made every inquiry, but could find no such persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you engage the prisoner - A. He came to me at Leicester. He sent me several bills before he sent this. In January a friend made inquiry for me at Carlisle, and wrote me that he thought it was a bad bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then propose to the prisoner's brother to give him a commission to get rid of the bill - A. No; I told him I thought it was bad - he said I might depend upon its being good; I said, then I wished he would take it.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, if he would pass it to any person you would allow him a handsome commission - A. I did not use the word</p>
               <p>"any." I inquired at Queen-street, Cheapside, where it was payable; I found the persons had been there, but were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How often after the prisoner left you, and before July, did you see him - A. Often. He left my service when I complained of his conduct, I did not discharge him.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to you afterwards to assist in some business - A. I had him as a witness in a law-suit about July. I was bail for him since he left me, and he made depositions in Chancery about Hindus's bankruptcy for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you surrender him - A. About a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell his attorney that you thought him honest, though he had acted improperly - A. I said I hoped he was, but that circumstances bore in my mind that he was dishonest.</p>
               <p>Q. And after all that you set him up to give evidence for you - A. Yes, I was obliged, and was bail for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his first examination about a bill for 16 l. 10 s. - A. There was a bill of 16 l. 10 s., which I thought was forged, but Hambridge, of Liquorpond-street, on whom it was drawn, said he would not swear that it was not his writing, as he had accepted bills in blank.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The prisoner was examined for you about Moseley Woolf's business - A. Yes, he had pawned my goods with him without my order - I prosecuted Woolf - this was before the bill was due.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in St. John-street, Smithfield. In November last I was acquainted with one Harrowell, a coachmaker, in Long-acre - I do not know where he lives now. A person named Pearce gave me the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose bill was it - A. I supposed it to be Harrowell's, as he applied to me on behalf of Harrowell. It was endorsed, Laws; I was to lay the bill out in hosiery, which Harrowell wanted. It being some time since, I do not know whether they were to be purchased for Harrowell or Laws. I went to Messrs. Robarts and Curtis, to inquire about Rowland, the drawer, and offered the bill to the prisoner at Wheatley's, in the presence of Reynolds, for hosiery. I left the bill there with the prisoner, and directed him to inquire at Messrs. Robarts and Co. about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive the goods in exchange for the bill - A. I suppose I did as they were sent to my house a week or ten days after I went; I never saw the packages opened. They were fetched away by Harrowell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Perhaps you do not know that - A. No my Lord, nor do I know that they came from Wheatley's - the prisoner's brother went with me to Messrs. Robarts and Co.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any commission for it - A. No, I only did it to serve the prisoner, as he had discounted a bill or two for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where is Harrowell - A. I understood he was in the West Indies - he has not endorsed the bill. I do not know where Pearce is; he was in the leather trade, in Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. I never saw Law.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not odd that a coachmaker should apply to a shoemaker to buy hosiery - A. I knew he shipped a good deal.</p>

            . I am a sworn-broker, and live at Hoxton. I have a counting-house in Lothbury, and am the prisoner's brother. I met Clark in Lombard-street; he shewed me the bill, and I went to Messrs. Robarts and Co. with him to inquire about Rowland - we were satisfactorily answered - also inquired at Queen-street, where it was payable, and received a satisfactory account there, and informed my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prosecutor about the bill - A. Yes, more than two months after he said he had inquired in the country, and did not like the account he had received. I told him I had received a very respectable account of it. He said if I would lay it out for him as a broker, or get goods for it he should prefer it - I declined it as he said the inquiry was not satisfactory. I said if he would endorse it I could get goods for it. He said he might as well keep it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose name was over the door in Queen-street - A. Jones and Company.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Robarts and Co.; I came from Carlisle. I remember inquiry being made about Mr. Rowland. I was sent for, as having lately come from Carlisle - a bill was produced. I knew Mr. Rowland was formerly a timber-merchant, but do not recollect his Christian name - I think I said he was a timber-merchant. I told them he was a respectable man, but I did not know his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Was you asked for C. W, Rowland - A. I do not recollect. I said I knew a Mr. Rowland who was a respectable man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Taylor, and keep a brush and urnery warehouse, in High-street, Whitechapel. On the 11th of July, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was in the back parlour, and saw a man in the shop, across the counter—I saw him run away—I screamed, and ran to the door—my nephew came from the cellar, and ran and secured the prisoner—I found a drawer open, and four combs gone, which were in a paper by themselves—the prisoner was taken in five minutes—he is dressed like the man I taw, but I did not see his face—I believe him to be the man—he said he was not the person.</p>

I live in Fountain-court, Liverpool-street I was at work in Mr. Taylor's cellar—I heard the alarm, got out of the cellar, and met Mrs. Taylor in the alley, by the side of the shop, and the prisoner running as fast as he could—I pursued him to the bottom of the alley, into Castle-street—I missed him for a second or two—I went down a turning, and heard a door slam, and a girl pointed towards the door—I found another door facing me, shut, which led into a dark kind of a wash-house—I there found the prisoner; stooping down at some bricks—I col<lb></lb>lared him, and took him outside—he called to a man by the name of <hi rend="italic">Charley,</hi> and told him not to let me take him—an officer came up, and I gave him to him—we went to the bricks where we had seen him stooping down, and found these four combs there—there was no one running but him, and he was out of breath.</p>

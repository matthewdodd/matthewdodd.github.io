I am landlord of the Tidal Basin Tavern, near the Victoria Docks—about 11.30 p. m., on 13th October, I was sitting in my bar parlour and heard my dog bark and the geese making a noise—I looked out and saw two men in the yard, walking towards the fence—I went down into the yard, followed by my son—I saw the two men getting over the fence—I asked them what they were doing there at that hour of the night—they told me to go and b----myself—I said "You ought to be ashamed <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yourselves, disturbing people in this way"—at that time James Parker, the waiter, had opened the side gate, and was speaking to them—he said "If you want the Docks I will show you"—I said "If you are not off I will set the dog after you"—they made a rush at Parker, and then my barman, Taylor, and my son jumped over the fence—I got over afterwards, and Parker said "I think I am stabbed"—I put my hand to his side, and he was bleeding—the barman was on his back, and Parker was standing up—I said to the barman "He is stabbed, look after him," and I followed the men, who had run away—one of them, a man named Grant, run against a policeman who had just come out of the Docks, and he was given into custody—I sent for a medical man to see Parker.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 123.) I was on duty, on the 8th of January, at the corner of Milner-street, Euston-square, about six o'clock in the evening, about 100 yards from Mr. Key's—I was standing near the enclosure of Euston-square—I saw two men, and directly after I heard tome halfpence fall, and immediately a till—the prisoner then passed me, and dropped a halfpenny—as soon as he passed me he ran away—I called "Stop thief"—he was stopped by an officer, and brought back—as we were going across the road, he put his hand up, lifted his hat, and the halfpence fell down—he said, "There they are"—I then went and fetched the till, and as soon as he saw it, he said, "That is not the thing—I said, "Then it was in a thing"—he said, "Yes, but that was not the thing"—we proceeded towards the station—I thought it best to search him—he refused, and made use of very bad language—we were obliged to put him on his back, and I took 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and one half-crown out of his trowsers pocket—I found at last 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 d. in coppers—the other man made his escape—I took the prisoner to the station-house, and searched him again, and found a latch-key on him—the till is here.</p>

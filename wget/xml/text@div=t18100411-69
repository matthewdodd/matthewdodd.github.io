               <p>Q. Did you lose your table on the 9th of April, or thereabouts. - A. Yes, it was standing in my shop when I went out between three and four o'clock. In about half an hour I was sent for, and when I came home the prisoner and the table were in my shop, my man had brought him back. I know the table to be mine, it is worth thirty shillings.</p>

            . I live at 48, Charles-street Drury-lane. I keep a fruit stand near to Mr. Tolner's shop. About four o'clock on the 9th of April I saw the prisoner take the table from out of Mr. Tolner's shop, he put it underneath the next door, he went into another door, he returned and took the table away. I went and gave information at Mr. Tolner's.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Tolner. From information I pursued the prisoner, and found him with the table on his shoulder. I stopped him. He said a gentleman employed him to carry this table. When I stopped him there was nobody with him. I brought him and the table back to my master's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On last Monday week I had been out in the fore part of the day. Going home at the end of Drury-lane there was a gentleman buying nuts of a basket-woman. I passed by; he said, young man, could you tell me of a porter. I said I could not. He said it was only a light table to carry into Oxford road. I took the table on my shoulder. He said, you had better drink first. I put the table down and went and drank with him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110045"></xptr>and then I took the table, and the person that employed me was a few steps before me. When the man stopped me he would not let me call him back, the gentleman told me he would walk forward, I should see him at the White Lion opposite of St. Giles's.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Bembridge-street St. Giles's. I sell nuts for my living, my husband is a labouring man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known this man - A. I never saw him before the day he was taken prisoner. I was at the Drury-lane corner of Long-acre. When I first saw this man, a gentleman asked me for a pennyworth of nuts, and after I served him with the nuts he asked me if I know of a porter. I told him, No. The prisoner was coming along, the gentleman asked him if he knew of a porter; he said, no, what was it he wanted carried; he said a small card-table into Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow this gentleman and this porter - A. Yes, a little distance behind, they walked nearly together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who walked first - A. The gentleman. I went into the public-house to sell my gingerbread-nuts, and when I came out of the public-house the prisoner was stopped with the table, I did not see the gentleman then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sedgwick the man that stopped him with the table - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you stepped up to speak to him - A. No, I did not, I followed the mob, and he was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at Bow-street you went in and told them what you had seen - A. No, I knew the young woman, that the prisoner sent for his wife the same evening. I stopped in Bow-street; it concerned me, I thought he was innocent. I told several people in the mob I thought he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you step up to the man that had taken him, and say that you thought this man was innocent - A. No, I staid in Bow-street about a couple of hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go in and tell the justice - A. A young woman told me he was fully committed to Newgate for trial. I went to the prisoner, and asked him if I could be of any service. She told me his name, I found him in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever enquire after the gentleman that met him -

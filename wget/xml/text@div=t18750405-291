                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother at 12, Stanhope Street, Deptford—I am 15 years old—on Sunday night, 14th February, I went to bed with the girl who is dead, Mary Ann Simms—she was turned 13—I went to bed about 11 o'clock, the public-houses were closed, her brother and sister and my mother were also in the bed—there were five of us all in one bed—the prisoner afterwards came in and fell down on the floor—I am no relation of his, only a friend, but I went and slept there that night in the same room in which the prisoner slept and lived—he was tipsy, he had been drinking ever since Christmas time—there was a paraffin lamp on a small table close to the bed, it was alight, but it was turned down—the prisoner got up from the floor, and was making a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, speaking to himself, we asked him to go to sleep, and not to wake the people in the house up—he went to the table and turned the lamp up as high as it would go, which broke the glass, and he blew it and set it all alight, it was smoking and in a blaze, he took it in his hand and tried to blow it out, but that made it worse, and when he found it was alight he threw it on the bed where we laid and set it all alight—there was a pail of water under the bed and he chucked the water, pail, and all into the bed, and then walked away and was not seen any more—he made no further attempt to put the fire out—the girl who is burnt was next to the table, and I was next to her—we all ran out and screamed, and fetched Mr. Wood's son and another young man, and they put the fire out—the deceased's night-dress caught fire when the lamp was thrown down—a woman took her into the next room, and we did not think she was burnt so badly as she was, and afterward they rolled her in blankets and took her to a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living for some fourteen years with the prisoner as his wife—the girl who is dead was my daughter, she was the eldest of eight children—she would have been 14 next June—on Sunday night, 14th February, I went to bed with three of my children and Elizabeth Reed about 11 o'clock—I cannot tell how long I had been in bed before the prisoner came in—he was intoxicated and he fell down on the floor, he laid there a short time—I think he intended to get into bed, but he fell—it was almost dark, and he got up and turned up the lamp which was on the table as. high as he could, and then he took it in his hand and the flame smashed the glass which flew all over the table—he said "B----the lamp, I can't put it out"—he blew it and tried to put it out, but he was not capable of doing it, he was too much intoxicated, and he threw it on the bed, it set fire to the sheets—the deceased was lying near the table, and the sheets set fire to her—not having the presence of mind we hallooed out instead of getting away—the prisoner picked a pail up and threw it over the bed, and then walked out without doing anything</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on Tuesday, 16th February, Mary Ann Simms was brought in by the last witness severely burnt on the front and back—the burns were extensive and of a dangerous character—she was treated with every care in the hospital, and went on well for a week, when lock-jaw ensued, which I can trace to the burns and to no other cause—she died on 25th February from lock-jaw.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 102). On 2nd March I took the prisoner in New Cross Road, Deptford—I told him the charge; he said that he knew the child was dead, and he was very sorry he was the cause of the death of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I fetched the lamp to see to make my bed, which was upon the floor, and turned it up to make it burn brighter, and the glass broke. I tried to put it out, and let it fall I never saw anything burn so quickly; all in a minute the bed was in a blaze. I got a pail of water from under the bed and <hi rend="italic">douted</hi> the blaze. I saw that my child was taken to a neighbour's house, and the mother then locked the door and took the other children with her, and I was in the streets four days and four nights, and on the 5th I went to Croydon, as I had no place to go to. I afterwards went to Deptford again and heard she had gone to the hospital. A cattle drover gave me a job, and we took some cattle to Hazlemere. I then went to Guildford, where a man told me that my child was dead, and that the detectives were looking for me. I walked all night to Deptford, where I was taken in charge. I never had any ill will towards any one, and I always loved my dear children, and would sooner be burnt myself than they should be. I have not got that upon my conscience. I have plenty of grief to know that my poor little creature met with such grief by burning; I am in grief all day long about it. Either of these witnesses who are against me might have had the same accident, because the bed and the lamp were close together. I wish to be punished, but not for throwing the lamp over the child. I did not throw it there, it fell there, but being in drink, I do not want this to be an excuse for me; I loved my children too well to kill them.</p>

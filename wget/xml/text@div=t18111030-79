On the 17th of October the prisoner came up to my shop and took hold of the goose, there is a board outside of the shop, part of the goose laid in the shop and part on the board, the prisoner turned up the goose, as I thought, to buy it. A lady came into the shop to settle a bill, in the mean while the prisoner walked away with the goose. I received information that he had taken it, and in about ten minutes the prisoner walked by my shop without the goose, I immediately collared him and took him into New Street and enquired where his lodgings were, we found his room and the goose in his room, he is a near neighbour of mine As we were going to the watch-house he begged for mercy, and said he did it for distress. I am sure he is the man, and I am sure it was my goose, it was a grey goose, I bought it particularly large for a publican to have for dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner's room. - A. The landlady of the house said it was the prisoner's room, that he had lodged there a fortnight.</p>
               <p>JOHN CUMMINS. I came by Mr. Goodwin's shop at the time of the robbery. Mrs. Goodwin gave me the description of the prisoner. I looked down New Street and saw him. I told the prisoner Mr. Goodwin wanted to speak to him. I walked him by the shop to see if they knew him, they all came out and said that was the man. We went into his room, and there was the goose on the table, the landlady of the house said it was his room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never confessed to taking the goose, if it was in my room I did not know it I said.</p>

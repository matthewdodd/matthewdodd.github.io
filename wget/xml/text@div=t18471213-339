               <p>in Paternoster-row, Spitalfields—it is his dwelling-house—the prisoner used to frequent our house—on Thursday, 18th Nov., about five o'clock I was in my bed-room, my clothes and my husband's were then safe—when I felt I locked the door and brought the key away in my pocket—after that in the afternoon I saw the prisoner in our house—he is a bedstead-maker, and works next door to us—there is a back-yard to that house and who to ours—they are separated by some boards—we have a dust-bin close against the fence—a person could get from that into the prisoner's master's yard—about eleven o'clock that same night, in consequence of something I heard, I went to my bed-room and found the door forced open—two drawers were broken open, and a writing-desk and a dressing-case—nothing was taken from them, but from one chest of drawers that had not been locked, were taken two pairs of trowsers, three waistcoats, four gowns, five linen shirts, and a variety of articles, they are all my husband's property, and worth about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards saw the prisoner in our house—his hands were all over dirt—he said persons called him a thief, and accused him of the robbery when there was no one in our in our place that accused him of anything—no one did accuse him—we had then just found out the robbery, and sent for an officer—I do not know whether he knew that—he was tipsy—the police<lb></lb>man came and examined the room—I had not seen the thing since—we found a little cap by the dust-bin in our own yard, and a pair of cuffs—I saw the prisoner at our house again most of the next day—he was taken into custody on the following Saturday.</p>

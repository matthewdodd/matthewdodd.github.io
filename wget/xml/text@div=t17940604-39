            Did you give him any money? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing further? - He muttered something, but I don't know what.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he advance with you? - To the top of Park-lane; I turned off at the top to go to my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again at any subsequent time? - I see him again on the Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Q. What time on Tuesday? - About the same time to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him on Tuesday? - Nearly in the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you then? - He then asked me for money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say? - I then said I should not give him any.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that? - His answer was, you shall be the worse for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing more passed I believe? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - On Friday morning the 23d, I saw him as I was crossing Park-lane, I was going to the stables, my stables are in Upper Bryanston-street, so I am obliged to cross Oxford-road; I see this man then at the corner of Park-lane again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say then? - He then was extremely impertinent; he talked of my having used indecencies with him in the Park, and that somebody had seen me do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him then? - I told him I did not know what he meant, he walked off, and I past on.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday the 24th the next day, did you receive any letter? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you got with you the letter that you received? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the cover in which it was inclosed? - Unfortunately I have lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. I would only ask you one thing which this letter gives rise to, it speaks of some gentleman who was to be known by his walk; have you the misfortune to be lame at all? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. This letter which you received in a blank cover, is directed, Mr. James Rayne, at the Bull and Sun, opposite Poland-street, Oxford-street; and signed by the name of Gough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of this letter so directed, send any note to Mr. Rayne with this direction? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of it? - Meet me at twelve o'clock to-morrow, at or near Grosvenor-gate. I wrote that note on Sunday the 25th.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday the 26th did you go to Grosvenor-gate? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner Rayne? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then mention to him your having received this letter? - He accosted me, made a sort of a bow.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - He then said if I did not give him money, he had it in his power to prove that I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040066"></xptr>used indecencies to him in the Park, and that a third person saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to that? - I was very much struck with the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other person come up then? - Yes, a third person then came up.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - He said that he had seen me use indecencies to Rayne in the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say that he had seen this? - To the best of my recollection he said that it happened on Tuesday the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing further? - Yes; on my observing it was a very horrid charge; he then said that I had great interest with the present government, and that he should be glad of a place either in the Customs or in the Excise, where clerks were employed; I said, to the best of my recollection, that I would apply for him; on which Watkins wished me a good morning; Rayne then said, as I had given that man a certainty, or I had done something for that man, he would have a certainty also; I said, he should; this happened on Monday. On Tuesday the following day, I see Rayne again, near Tyburn Turnpike, between twelve and one; he then said, that he had considered what he would have; I asked him what? he said that he would have twenty pounds in cash, and that he would have a bond for security for fifty pounds annually. I said I could not do it then; but that if he would wait till Thursday I would bring him the money and the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. What said he to that? - He was perfectly satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday the 20th of May, did you see him again? - I did at the same place, Rayne was alone then.</p>
               <p>Q. What past then? - I offered him twenty pounds, but not the bond; he expressed himself much dissatisfied, and would not take the twenty pounds, he would have the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that you went home for the bond? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you see him again, I suppose? - He waited.</p>
               <p>Q. This was very near your house? - close by.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you brought him the twenty pounds and bond? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you give him the twenty pounds? - In nineteen guineas and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the bond likewise? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What said he to that? - He wished me a good morning, and said that he would give me no further trouble, to the best of my recollection.</p>

               <p>Friend Rayne, I have called three times at your lodgings; and you have not been at home; my brother-in-law tells me that you called and borrowed eight guineas of us; which that you are welcome to the use of; but I have a great piece of business to challenge you in; that is, that I saw a gentleman in the Park, arm in arm with you; and I can almost swear it was you; I could swear to him by his walk; and once seeing his face, I see him pull out his privates, and take hold of you. Friend Rayne, don't secret the business from me, as I am partly sure it was you: find out his name and where he lives, and I will make him quit the Kingdom, or give you an handsome settlement for life. There is another young man that saw the same, whose name I don't know; but, I believe, he knows me. Fail not of coming. Your's,

Believe me, he declares he will give me a hundred a year; I told him I knew nothing of the business, I was not there. He would not let me come away without signing my name to a bond, to be there to-morrow morning, one o'clock, as he is determined to put me to my oath, in the presence of a justice, whom he hath appointed to be there, to declare whether I was the person or no; and he says, if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040068"></xptr>do swear he shall be satisfied.

               <p>"Albermarle-street, May 29, 1794. I am rather surprised at not hearing from you since Monday last, as you premised to write the next day. The other person whom I mentioned to you, has called on me several times; he is a man of very considerable property, and lives in Westminster. After I left you on Monday he called and offered me a very considerable sum, if I would discover your name and address; I told him I knew not where you lived nor your name. He called again yesterday morning, and likewise offered to settle fifty guineas a year for my life, if I could find you out. I therefore expect you to settle something handsome on me for my life; I shall leave the sum to your honour, as I have so much respect for your family. I therefore mean to quit my place and go into the country for some time, to get rid of the abovementioned person. Fail not of answering this to night, as the person calls to morrow, to know whether I will accept of his offer; you will please to mention in your answer when and where I am to meet you, to settle the business; and let me know what you mean to settle on me for life, on a bond of security. You likewise promised to get me a place at some office; there are several places vacant; these are the places vacant, a deputy King land waiter, a house and window surveyors, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I shall expect your answer to night, to know your determination. I am your sincere humble servant, David Watkins.</p>
               <p>Albermarle-street, No.24, Thursday morning, nine o'clock."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Prosecutor. I would ask you first of all whether, during the time or any of the times that any conversation passed between you and either of the prisoners, you was under any apprehension from fear to your person or injury to your character? - At first I was, certainly; but the answer I gave the magistrate was, that at the time I gave the money, I did not apprehend any thing, either for my character or person; I said I gave the bond and money under the idea of substantiating the fact, of his having extorted money on this charge.</p>
               <p>Q. So then we have got to this, that you was not under any apprehension of any violence to your person, nor injury to your character; but that you meant it for the purpose of entrapping them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the parting with your money and the parting with the bond to Rayne, was perfect voluntarily on your part? - I cannot call it voluntary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The charge being above made, it occurred to you that it was necessary for you to go to the length of parting with your money and bond, in order to fix the crime? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that at first you was alarmed, but that at the time of giving the money you was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have parted with either your bond or money, if these various applications had not been made? - Why?</p>
               <p>Q. You ask me very naturally, why? Had you any the smallest connections with the persons whom you parted with it to? - I had not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040069"></xptr>Q. Did not you part with it having the hopes it would accomplish their conviction? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp here stated an objection that the parting with the money, under these circumstances, could not amount to a violent or felonious taking it, puting the person in fear, and taking it against his will: which was answered by the counsel for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Court. I look on this to be a transaction that commenced on Monday the 18th, and was not compleated till the bond and nineteen guineas were taken; but all the circumstances must be taken into the consideration. We will go on with the trial, and I will save the point, for the consideration of all the judges.</p>

He then gave me half a guinea to buy a dinner, he told me he would procure a better situation, than that of a gentleman's servant, and that if I would meet him the next day at twelve o'clock, be certainly would give me the situation that he spoke of; with that I met him the next day, and he told me to give him my address, he told me that if he heard of a situation to suit me, he would come to me the next day, and if he did not, he would send to let me know; afterwards he was at the drawing room I was passing, and could not go by for the crowd, and heard the gentleman's carriage called out for, not knowing that gentleman was the same by the name, till he came and stepped into the coach, on which I wrote to him, to acquaint him of this man's meeting me in the Park, this man was waiting for me, and when I came up to him, he said do you know who that was that was with you in the Park?

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Rayne? - I have had a slight knowledge of him for about three years, at his mother's, at Gloucester; she keeps a public house. I was returning from Hammersmith, on the 19th of May, about two o'clock, as near as I can remember; as I was coming through Hyde Park, I saw the prisoner James Rayne, and a gentleman rather of a low statute, in a dark coloured coat; it was as I was returning across Hyde Park, in that walk that leads down to Grosvenor Gate, a considerable way; they were both of them conversing together, under a tree, which joined on to the road almost. I did not know Rayne at the first sight, but as I drew nearer the gentleman in the black coat left Rayne and walked a few yards out of the road; when I came opposite I nodded to Rayne, and he did to me the same; but he appeared very much confused; the other gentleman's face I could not see, his back was towards me at the time I past him. That was all I knew of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at any future time? - I met Rayne in High Holborn; I never saw the gentleman after, and if I had, I should not have known him.</p>

               <p>Q. You write a very decent hand; a clever fellow. When did you see your friend Rayne first after you saw him under the tree in the Park? - I met him as I was going along, a few days after, I suppose it might be three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was as much as three? - I am sure I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was the next day? - I am sure it was not the next day; I think it was three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a good opinion of him? - I had no opinion at all of him; I could form no opinion, neither good nor bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him when you met him in the Park? - Yes, he was telling me of that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Not you him? - I had no idea of such a matter; he told me the treatment that he had experienced from a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the gentleman's name? - I never heard the gentleman's name till I heard it in the papers.</p>
               <p>Q. He was very angry at it, was not he? - He seemed inclineable to say that he meant to bring the gentleman to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there many people passing in the Park at the time that you saw him with the gentleman under the tree? - I did not take particular notice; but I never go through the Park but there are people passing; it was a very fine day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you whether you took any particular notice of the gentleman or of the indecencies? - He asked me if I remembered seeing a gentleman there? I told him I did; and then he told me how he was treated.</p>
               <p>Q. And that treatment was in the open Park at two o'clock in the day? - I see nothing of the treatment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you whether you should know the gentleman again? - I don't recollect that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Mr. Buller Yard's name in the news paper? - Not till last Thursday when I see it in Wednesday's paper; I see him on the 30th in the morning; he then told me that he had received a bond of fifty pounds a year, as a compensation for loss of character, and so forth.</p>

            Did he tell you who the gentleman was? - That was on the 30th morning; he even took the bond out to shew me; he shewed me the witness's name, but concealed the gentleman's name at the bottom of the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you never came to the knowledge of the gentleman's name till you see it in the paper? - I never did; he told me that he had found out the gentleman's name by seeing him get into a carriage, and that he had got his bond for fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that the gentleman had taken down his address in his pocket book? - He told me that, and shewed me them two letters that he had received of the gentleman; but there were no signatures to them; I did not want to know the gentleman's name.</p>
               <p>Q. As far as you collected from him, was there any body that had seen him with this gentleman in the Park besides yourself? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mention any body of the name of Gough? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never used that name yourself? - No other but my right name.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you met with him, you did not upbraid him at all; but he set about it immediately and told you the whole story? - I suppose taking every thing together, that he thought I thought something must be the matter, by his appearing so much confused when I met him in the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. As you seem to know but little how the prisoner supported himself, have you ever been in service? - Never as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. What services have you been in? - Is it necessary for me to give my genealogy.</p>
               <p>Q. I will tell you very fairly why I ask you. I am going to satisfy the jury that they cannot believe one word that you say? - I have told you where I was employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, I have heard of Mr. Mason. Where did you write last for any person? - No. 8, Cornhill, for the same parties.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a hosiery business? - No, a lottery office, a licensed lottery office.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether, when you met the prisoner, you made any reproach to him, about his having been in the Park at two o'clock on Monday? - I could make no reproach to him, because I was a total stranger to what had past.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the Park on Tuesday with any gentleman? - I never did to the best of knowledge; I am sure I never reproached the prisoner Rayne with having been in the Park with a gentleman on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact you never did see him in the Park but on Monday? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know Rayne's hand writing do you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever correspond with you? - I never received any letter from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take that to be an answer? - He never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever read any letter which he addressed to you, or caused to be addressed to you? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that hand writing, and tell me whose writing you take it to be? - Upon my word I cannot form any judgment of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw that letter before? Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever write to him? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Or cause any thing to be written? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lodge on Monday, the 19th of May? - No. 37, Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>The letter read by the clerk, found by Grant in Rayne's possession.</p>
               <p>"Friend Lester, I am very much surprised at your thinking I should ever suffer any man to take that liberty with me, as for your thinking you have seen me in the Park, you are much mistaken,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040076"></xptr>for on Tuesday I was with a most intimate friend of mine, in Albermarle-street, I went there to breakfast, and stopped all the remainder of the day there, for to justify which, all the servants will inform you the same; I must confess I thought you had a better opinion of me, than to think I should ever suffer any such thing; I confess I was sorry I was not at home when you called, to justify and clear myself."</p>
               <p>Prisoner Rayne. That letter this young man Watkins copied for me at my lodgings, I told him of Gough's coming threatening to take me up, I did not tell him Gough's name, and that made me write that name.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Watkins lived with me at this time, he had lived with me about four years, he behaved so well to me, that I have no occasion to reproach him, I meant to make him my upper butler; and it was not a month ago that they applied to have him put on the list as a yeoman, he said, that he had got a friend that could pay the money for him.</p>
               <p>- APPACH sworn.</p>
               <p>I know Watkins, he lived servant with me rather better than a twelve month, about four years and a half ago, I have no reason to complain of him in any one respect.</p>

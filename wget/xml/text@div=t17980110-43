               <p>Q. How do you know she had not gone down stairs, and gone out at the door? - A. We asked her if she wanted to go out any more that night; and she said, no; and we locked and bolted the doors; the other prisoner was the person that gave her a character, we did not know then that she was her mother, she frequently came backwards and forwards to see her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any part of your things again? - A. Yes, some at a pawnbrokers; last Friday week I heard that she was taken up, I went, and found that she had one of my petticoats, a striped dimity, upon her, and a pair of pockets belonging to me, and a handkerchief round her neck belonging to me, but I did not take that, I have the others here; and at Mr. Gaunt's, the pawnbroker's, I found a shift, and other things; I found a round gown at Mr. Townsend's; and a striped muslin petticoat, and two shifts at Mr. Frith's.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Blue Eagle public-house, High-street, Shadwell—I know the prisoner as a customer—on or about the 21st of July, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I saw him standing at a door leading towards the cellar, and ordered him away—I went to bed at half-past twelve—I went round the house, and saw all the doors and windows safe—it was impossible for anybody to have got into the house after that—the prisoner must have got in between half-past ten and half-past twelve o'clock—I had cheroots, cigars, and other things on a board in the bar—the fourpenny pieces were in a tin box on the same shelf—they were all gone in the morning—there were four tills with a few farthings in each—the tills were pulled out and the farthings gone—the cigars produced resemble mine—this show-board is my property—it was only shifted from its place.</p>

               <p>Did you shut the gate after you? - I cannot say, my man turned him in with two more; I keep three horses. I found him on the Sunday, in Holloway-lane, in Mr. Seabrook's stable; a man who buys horses to kill.</p>
               <p>Was your's a dog-horse? - He was not much better than a dog-horse, though he does my work; the man that turned him into the field is not here.</p>

               <p>I live in Holloway-lane. My husband buys old horses alive or dead, to kill.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect buying a horse on Saturday se'nnight? - Yes, I bought a horse last Saturday-week in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Who did you buy it of? - A young man.</p>
               <p>Do you know the young man? - Yes. I do not see him; I do not know his name (looks at the prisoner). I believe that is the young man.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was it? - A brown, very rough and large boned horse, very low in flesh.</p>
               <p>Had he a long tail or a short one? - I did not take notice of his tail, I delivered him to the prosecutor when he came to enquire after it.</p>
               <p>What did you give for it? - Twelve shillings, which is the most we give in common for horses to kill.</p>
               <p>( The prisoner was not put upon his defence.)</p>

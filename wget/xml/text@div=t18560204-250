                  </hi>. I live at No. 104, Royal Mint-street, and am a cheese<lb></lb>monger. On 7th Jan., I went to bed about half-past 12 o'clock—I was the last person up—the house was all safe, the windows were latched, and the door locked—I was roused in the morning between 3 and 4 o'clock, by the policeman—I got up and found the prisoners were there—the policeman had them—the bolts Were taken off the cellar flap—I had seen that fast the night before at half past 12 o'clock—if a person got in at that cellar flap, they could get into the shop by coming up from the cellar—I missed from the counter in the shop a drawer which had contained about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the night before—this is the drawer—I had seen Rush lurking about a day or two before—I only saw him once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Rush. Q.</hi> Did you examine the cellar flap that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I can swear it was fastened—it was locked outside, and bolted inside—I know there was some money in the till.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Tatton. Q.</hi> Was the lock or the bolts broken, or the flap broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I stated that the boy fastened the place, but I looked after it.</p>

I was on duty in Royal Mint-street on the morning of the 7th, about a quarter past 3 o'clock—I saw Rush kneeling on the pavement, apparently doing something to the cellar flap—after he had been there some time, we saw the cellar flap open, and Rush received the till from the cellar flap, and, he, and Tallon; and another man went down Blue Anchor-yard—I and another officer followed them—we apprehended the two prisoners, we did not lose sight of them at all—we found them all three in a court—there is an opening at each end of the court—I ran round—the other constable went down the court after them—when I got round to the other end, Rush was taking money out of the till—directly I turned into the court, I saw Tallon; they were all three together—I am sure the prisoners are two of the men whom I saw at the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's—I had seen them both before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Tatton.</hi> You stated in your deposition that you saw the till passed out and handed to another prisoner, and you believed it was by me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Rush. Q.</hi> Can you swear it was me kneeling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was within about fifteen yards of you, on the opposite side—we had been watching you some time, because you had a pair of lighter boots than you were used to—I</p>

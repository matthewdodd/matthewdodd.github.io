On the 22d of May, he hired a furnished apartment on my second floor; he represented himself as a limner; he paid me for one week. On the 14th of June, after locking up his apartment, he came to me, and said, that he and his wife were going to drink tea with his father-in-law, who was a respectable artist, who wanted a complete case of drawing instruments, and an eye glass set in gold, and asked if I would allow him to shew him a few, and he would return in an hour with them, or the money. I delivered him the articles stated in the indictment - he took them away, and neither he or his wife ever returned; he said nothing about wanting them for himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give them to me to endeavour to sell them - A. Yes. I agreed to allow him five per cent. commission on some goods which he was to try to sell at Rutland - but these were delivered him for the express purpose of being taken to his father.</p>

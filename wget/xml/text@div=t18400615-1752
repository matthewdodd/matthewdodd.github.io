                  </hi>I am a miller, and live at Staines. Grunsell is my wagoner—I sent him to Hammersmith with some flour—he generally took a little hay with him for the horses before they give them water—about twenty pounds of hay is quite sufficient for them to take, and he had his nose-bags besides, with corn in them—he had to go about sixteen miles—he had the care of the hay in my loft—some hay has been produced to me which is very much like mine—there are some mouldy spots in it, where the wet got in—it is the same species of hay, and as far as I can judge, it is mine—he had no right to take it.</p>

In my meadow—other men's hay may have mouldy spots—it depends on letting the wet in—I do not limit him to two or three pounds of hay—I have looked at my hay since—I find it goes off very fast—there is nothing in the binding or making up of this hay that I can swear to—my hay<lb></lb> binder is not here—Grunsell has been in my service five or six years—I thought him honest.</p>

                  </hi>(<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi>177.) On the morning of the 10th of June, at a quarter-past three o'clock, I saw the prosecutor's wagon on Hounslow-heath—Grunsell was sitting in front, driving, and I went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150234"></xptr>
               <p>behind, and saw on the tail-ladder that lets down, two trusses of hay, braced on with a cord—I got on the ladder, and saw a small bundle of hay besides—I got off, went to the hedge-side, and cut two green docks—I put one in each truss of hay—I then followed the wagon, and saw it stop at the White Bear public-house—I observed another constable very near that house—I kept at a distance, and in six or seven minutes I saw the wagon leave the house—I then went down, and met the other constable—I spoke to him—I then went after the wagon, and the trusses of hay were gone, and the tail-ladder was fastened up close to the sacks of flour—I went back to the White Bear public-house, and asked the prisoner, Hopkinson, who is the ostler, to produce those two trusses of hay that Mr. Murrell's wagoner had left there—he said he had left no hay there—I said he had, he said he had not—I said, " He has, and you have taken it in "—(this I stated from what the constable had told me)—I asked him where he kept his hay—he showed me a stable, over which was a loft—I went up, and there was from thirty to forty trusses—I said, " If the hay is here I shall be sure to know it, because I have marked it"—I examined three or foot trusses, but I could not put my hand on it—Hopkinson then left the loft, and thinking it might be in some other loft, I went round the yard with the sergeant, looked into several stables, but saw no hay—I then went back to the loft, and untied a truss or two, and shortly I found one of the docks in one of the trusses—at that time Hopkinson had left the loft—I called him, and said, " This is the mark I told you of"—I shortly after found the other truss, with the mark in it.</p>

"—he said, "A pint of beer,,—they both went into the house together—I went and looked in the wagon, and saw ft bundle of hay in the wagon—I went to the loft with Griffin, and searched—I saw some hay there which he said was just like the hay that had been on the wagon—he then went down into the yard, came up again and found one truss with a dock in it, which he said he had put in, in Staines road—he</p>

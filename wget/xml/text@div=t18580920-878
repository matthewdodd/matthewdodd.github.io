                  </hi>. I am a plumber, of 22, Queen's-row, Bayswater.

I am a carpenter in the employ of Mr. John Scantle<lb></lb>bury—I was at the same work at St. Margaret's, Isleworth, on Thursday, 9th September, I saw the lead produced in a room in the building, which I made a work-shop or store-room—it was safe when I left to go to Richmond—the next morning I went to St. Margarets, about 10 minutes before 6 o'clock; I found the room-door had been broken open, the lock broken, and most of the lead had been taken out—there was a little left, perhaps one hundred weight and a half—I found a crowbar standing against the door, and by the marks I concluded that the door had been broken open by it—I know Walsh; he had been employed there about seven weeks, and left of his own accord on the Saturday previous to the robbery—he was a plumber's labourer—some moulds were taken, what we call running moulds;</p>

                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old, and am apprentice to Mrs. Montague, of Ickenham. On 24th June I was with the prisoner, and a boy named Finch, coming from Ickenham—I had two trace chains in my hand—I put them round the prisoner's legs and round my arm—I caught hold of his legs, and Finch took his arms, and we carried him—the chain was not tight, so as to hurt him—we carried him ten or twelve yards, and he said, "Put me down"—we put him down, but he did not get away, as the chain was round his legs and my arm—he said, "I have got something in my pocket which will make you leave go, you b——r"—he put his left hand in his pocket, pulled out a knife, and cut me across the wrist, round which the chain was—it drew blood—I saw the knife coming a second time—I was not quick enough, and he cut me across the left knee—I told Finch it was a <hi rend="italic">tidy</hi> gash, and that he had cut my knee—he said, "You b——r; and I will rip your b——y guts out when I get up" (he was sitting on the ground with the chain still round me—I was going to release it when I put him down, but he would not give me time)—Finch said, "No, you shan't"—I caught hold, of</p>

               <p>him, and took the knife away; the point of it stuck into my finger, but that was an accident—we walked on together some distance, and were good friends, and Finch gave him back his knife—I asked him to give me a piece of sticking-plaster, and I would say no more about it—he said, "No, I shan't; I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and I shall not give you any"—we all went to his mother's; she strapped it up for me, and told me to have him locked up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old, and live at Ickenham. On 24th June, the prisoner, Cursley, and I were at play—Cursley had some chains, which he put round the prisoner's legs, and round his own arm, and told me to catch hold of his shoulders, and we would carry him—we carried him ten or twelve yards, and when he told us we put him down gently—either Cursley did not let go of him just at that minute, or else he could not get away—he pulled out his knife, and said, "I have got something in my pocket which will make you leave go of me"—he pulled out a knife, opened it, and cut Cursley across the wrist—Cursley said, "This is a <hi rend="italic">tidy</hi> gash"—he said, "Yes"—Cursley then said, "He has cut my knee"—the prisoner said, "Yes, and I will rip your b—y guts out"—his knee bled very much—I took the knife from the prisoner, and said he should have it when he got home—we went to Mr. Treadaway's public-house to see the cut, as it was bleeding—Cursley asked the prisoner for some sticking-plaster; he said, "No, I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and I shan't give it you"—we went to the prisoner's mother's, who gave him some sticking-plaster, and strapped it up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not the prisoner very angry when you were dragging him about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he said, "Put me down," as if he was tired of playing—the chain was half-a-yard between him and Cursley when we had put him down—he was lying flat on the ground, his legs were not higher than his head—the cut in the knee was not while we were taking the knife away—he had had a little beer before this; he had none afterwards, because he was ashamed to come into the public-house to see the cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Uxbridge. I was sent for, and examined Cursley—he had a small incised wound, about two inches long, on the right wrist, and another an inch and a half long on the left knee—I did not ascertain the depth, as it had been plastered, and I did not open it—they were very slight wounds, merely skin deep, or the arteries and tendons would have been severed—he did not go to his work next morning; I advised him to be quiet for a day or two.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If he had intended to have done much injury, he might have done it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; supposing him to be ruptured, the knocking about would tend to alarm his mind, if he had no truss.</p>

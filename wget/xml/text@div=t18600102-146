                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 635). On 12th December last I stood opposite the Bull Inn, Aldgate, and watched about two hours and a half—I saw the prisoner Cook and a lad come out of the Bull-yard with a tilted van with two horses—the lad was with the front horse—I followed the van to Mark-lane in company with Bull, a detective—when we got there the van stopped—we watched it for a few minutes, and, saw Cook undo the back part of the van—we went up to him and told him that we were excise officers, and wanted to search the van for spirits—I got up on the van and saw four sacks of mixture, consisting of chaff, white and black oats, and crushed barley, and some cut clover—on seeing those, we told him that we were two detective officers, and asked him where he got the four sacks from—he said that a man put them into the van in the Bull-yard—we asked him who the man was, and he said he did not know—we told him he must con<lb></lb>sider himself in custody for receiving four bags of mixture—when he turned round to go to the station-house, we told him that anything he said, would be given in evidence against him—he stated that a man asked him to buy four bags of sweepings of a manger, and that he gave 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—we asked him then whether he should know the man if he was to see him—he said, "Yes"—we then took him to the station-house and locked him up.</p>

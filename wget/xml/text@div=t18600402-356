                  </hi>. I am a general-dealer living at 2, star-place, North End, Fulham—On the night of 13th January I went to bed about 11 o'clock—on the morning of the 14th I discovered that my house had been broken into—when I went to bed I had some bacon, some cheese, some cocoa, and some tobacco—I had also the materials for a lady's dreys and about 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper—I missed all these things in the morning—I had seen them safe at half-past 10 the night before, just before I went to bed—the entry had been made by the back-parlour window—a ladder had been procured from next door to us, which is a corner house—they came over the side and then put the ladder over on our side—I found the ladder on our side; and I suppose they got in at the window by that means, and put the ladder back again in making their escape—the ladder was found on our side of the wall leaning against the wall; and the parlour window was left a little way open—I had seen it fast over-night—it fastens by a catch the same as all parlour windows—when the sash is put down that drops over it—the catch was not injured—I can't tell how it was opened, without a knife was inserted up the crack—there were no shutters—a knife between the sashes would have opened it—I think if anyone had got on a ladder they could have reached the parlour window—it would have been high enough—the money was in a cupboard in the parlour—the other goods were in the shop—I am positive the things were safe in the house when I went to bed—the value of the goods is between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I live at 8, Sun-street, Fulham, and am a gardener—I occupy a room next to the one which was occupied by the prisoner—I was up rather late on the night of the burglary; but I do not know whether it was the 13th or 14th—I was up late owing to my wife being taken very ill in labour—it was early in the morning—I can't tell what o'clock it was because I have not a clock—I heard people in and out of the house very late; still that was not an unusual thing—they were in the passage—I heard a young man named Shields, but I did not hear him come up—I was up all night and was fatigued—I heard footsteps come in and out of the passage—there was one flight of stairs to get up to the prisoner's room—that was the nearest I heard him to it—it is only a one storey house the prisoner's room is up-stairs—the footsteps were down-stairs—I am certain I heard Shield's voice—he called out to me and I answered—that came from the next room to mine, the prisoner's room—he occupied the back and the front room.</p>

               <p>THOMAS GOLDTHWAIT. I lodge in Goodge-street, Tottenham-court-road. On the 26th of April, a little before eleven o'clock in the morning, I was going along <placeName id="t18260511-23-crimeloc146">Portpool-lane</placeName>

I called out Stop thief! as soon as I could, and they were taken; I staid there till the people brought the two men back; I had never seen them before. I saw them plainly before they took my watch, and can swear the prisoners are the men; I think Ling is the man who knocked me down; I cannot exactly say which took my watch, but he is the man who knocked me down, and I think him the man who took my watch, for it came upon me all of a sudden. I am certain it was one of those two men who knocked me down - I think Ling is the man who took my watch - it was returned to me by the party who took them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen them before you got to the place? A. Why, I did see them, because they stood at the end of the court; I had no time to evade them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You only saw them just as you came up to the court? A. Yes - one stood on each side of the court; it was the one of the right-hand side of the court who took it. I was struck some little time after my watch was taken. I do not wish to speak positively as to which robbed me, but I recollect their countenances perfectly, so as to swear they are the men, one of whom took my watch.</p>

            . I was about a yard from this court - it is Crown-court - I was standing still, and saw the prisoners come down Portpool-lane, and stand talking to one another - Ling went down the court about a yard; Yates stood at the top. This old gentleman was coming by - Yates rushed against him on purpose, and took his watch; he fell down with the rush; Yates took the watch, and they both ran down the court; the old gentleman rose up, and hallooed Stop thief! I hallooed also, and ran down the court - I lost sight of them for about half a minute - they ran round a corner in the court - Yates returned, and went down a little alley - he came up the alley again, and threw the watch down, and knocked the old gentleman down - I saw him throw the watch down. The old gentleman was just by this little alley; Yates then went on to another gentleman who was there, and threw him down by his legs, as he was going to assist the old gentleman in taking them. I picked up the watch, and gave it to the old gentleman. Yates ran up the court - Kemble ran after him, and caught him; Ling was taken in a privy in the court, by Baillie. I am sure they are the men; I never saw them before. I live in Crown-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. The person who took the watch ran against the old gentleman, and threw him down? A. Yes, and came back again and knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110015"></xptr>him down - he was thrown down twice - I am quite sure of that - he ran down Crown-court when he took the watch; the court is no thoroughfare. The other gentleman who was knocked down is not here - he had as good an opportunity of seeing them as I had; the watch was thrown down at the top of the alley. I had lost sight of Yates for about a minute, when he took a turning in the court; there are about eight houses in the court; he knocked the old gentleman down the second time, just at the head of the court; there are several lodgers in the court - the doors are generally open. I am sure the prosecutor was knocked down twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Ling neither took his watch nor knocked him down? A. No. I had seen them talking together at the end of the court; Ling parted from him about a yard within the court before the gentleman came up. The gentleman no sooner got on his legs than he hallooed Stop thief! I think the outer case of the watch was on when I picked it up, but I am not sure. The privy belongs to three houses in the court, and is for the use of the lodgers.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live at No. 2, Crown-court. On Sunday, the 26th of April, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, I was at work in my house, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I lifted up my window, and saw Yates knock the old gentleman down in the court, right under my window; there was a bit of a scuffle between another man and him. I then went down stairs - they were both on the ground together, and Yates got from him - that man is not here. I secured Yates, and took him to Hatton-garden Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever see Yates before? A. Never; he was on the ground himself - I lost sight of him in coming down stairs; it is a small court - a man could soon run out of it. I did not see Phillips till afterwards.</p>

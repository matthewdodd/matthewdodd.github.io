I was going through the passage into the yard that evening—there is a hole in the passage, and I saw a light shining in the cellar—I looked down, and saw the prisoner drawing the rum into a glass bottle—I called my father, he, and my mother, and I went down into the cellar—this bottle was lying down, and the rum running over a piece of stick—the prisoner's hands were wet with rum, and she was wiping them under her apron—the rum cask was wet, as some rum had been drawn out—I believe this is my father's bottle.</p>

                  </hi> I am a warehouseman, carrying on business in partnership, in Old Change—the prisoner Jarvis was in my employ—on the 13th May we called him up, when the officers were there, into our private counting-house—I said to him, "Jarvis, I think it is right that I should tell you that, besides being in the presence of my brother and myself, you are in the presence of two officers of the police, and I should advise you that to any question that may be put to you you will answer truthfully, so that if you have committed a fault, you may not add to it by stating what is untrue"—I do not say those were the precise words I used, but that was the meaning of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think that was not quite all you said to him, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think that was all, unless you can jog my memory—I did not say to him, "We know you have been robbing us"—to the best of my belief, I did not say, "You had better tell the truth, "that word was put into my mouth when Jarvis was before the Magistrate, but I am as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186707080051"></xptr>
               <p>positive as I like to be of anything that I did not make use of that word "better" at all—I was asked, when the word was put into my month, if I did not make use of it, and I said, "I really cannot say whether I made use of the word, I may have done, but I don't think I did"—I do not think it was at that part of the conversation that I made use of the words we knew more than he thought—I had showed him some papers—I did not follow that up by saying we knew more than he thought; that was afterwards—I did not say it before the paper was pro<lb></lb>duced—I am satisfied I did not say so before he opened his lips—I do not believe that, after advising him to answer truthfully, I said, "Frank, we know more than you think we do"—I think I said it after I produced the paper, not at that time, to the best of my belief—I am as positive of it as I like to be of anything—I do not think I made use of the word "better" at all—I did not say so at Guildhall—the question was put to me by the solicitor for Jarvis, "When you advised him to make use of the words' you had better, "and I said, "I believe I did not say so"—I do not know whether I may or may not have used the words in answer to Mr. Wontner's question, but they were words put in my mouth, not words I made use of myself—I said I may have said so or not, but it was my belief I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>, <hi rend="italic">upon this evidence, objected to any statement of Jarvis's being received: a confession must flow voluntarily from the mind of the person making it; at all events, it must not be the result of an impression created in his mind that he may be benefited by what he shall say; neither would it be admis<lb></lb>sible if made under the impression that he might suffer if he did not make it; there were authorities to sustain both propositions, and, after alluding to the cir<lb></lb>cumstances of the present case, he referred to Reg. v. Williams, 2 Denison's Crown Cases, p. 433; Reg. v. Warring ham, 15 Jurist, 318 j and Reg. v. Gar<lb></lb>ner, 1 Denison</hi>. 329. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Shep<lb></lb>herd,</hi> 7 <hi rend="italic">Carrington and Payne</hi>. 579, <hi rend="italic">and urged that, if the acts and circum<lb></lb>stances of the case were taken in connexion with the observations, there was clearly sufficient in the nature both of a threat and promise to exclude the con<lb></lb>fession.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">is contending that the evidence was admissible, stated that the authorities referred to, were overruled by later decisions, Reg. v. Baldry,</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">Denison</hi>. 430; <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Sleeman, Dearsley</hi>. 249; <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Parker, Lee and Cave</hi>. 42; <hi rend="italic">and Reg. v. Zeigert, Sessions Papers, Vol.</hi> 6, p. 163: <hi rend="italic">the principle upon which these confessions were excluded, was, if any worldly advantage was held out, or any worldly harm was threatened, calculated to lead to an untrue statement; in the present case there was a mere exhortation to tell the truth, which could not be calculated to elicit an untrue statement.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">further called attention to Reg. v. Miller,</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">Cox's Criminal Cases,</hi> 07, <hi rend="italic">and submitted that if the conduct of a person in authority, such as the prosecutor in this case undoubtedly was, was calculated to impress the mind of the prisoner that he would be benefited by anything he could say, that was an inducement of the strongest kind, and sufficient to exclude any statement made in consequence of it. The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">would certainly not exclude the evidence: the only hesitation he had was whether he should reserve the point; it was assumed as a matter of course that a confession was coming, but he could only assume that that was coming which the prisoner believed to be the truth.</hi>

               <p>had seen him since—he told me that he had been to Richard Bulkley's house, and had also been with him to Goode's, on Ludgate Hill—I then asked him if he had ever corresponded with him or written to him—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Supposing I can show you a letter, what would you say then? "and I produced a piece of paper with pencil writing on it—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the piece I showed him—he then told me it was his writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>—"Dear Dick,—On account of circulars, I shall not see you till about sir o'clock to-night. Wait till I come. F. D.") I then asked him whether that was the only one he had written—he said he thought it was—I then showed him this slip of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which had been given to me by the officers—he said, "This is not my writing, it is Richard Bulkley's, it is too good for mine"—I then said, "Jarvis, be careful what you say, for we have compared it with your writing, and we believe it to be yours"—I find I have made an omission, after the first letter I said to him, "Take care, Jarvis, we know more than you think we know."(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">on this renewed his previous objection, but the Court decided on receiving the evidence.</hi>) I told him we had compared it with some of his writing, and believed it to be his, and he said it was his. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>.—"Frank Jarvis—Leaf and Co., 39, O.C") I think I then said, "You have heard of the robberies which the Bulkleys are connected with; now, Jarvis, I am going to put to you a question, Have you robbed us? "—he said, "I will tell you—I have"—I then said, "Of what have you robbed us? but, in order that there may be no mistake about it, I will take it down in writing from your own mouth"—he then detailed to me whet he had taken, fifteen or sixten dresses of moiré antique, and about fifteen pieces of bonnet glacé—I asked him whether that was all—he said, "Yes"—I asked when he committed these robberies—he said before Christmas Day, 1866, and had continued doing so until the early part of April—I then asked him how he got them out of the house—he said he had taken them out sometimes one, and sometimes two pieces at a time in a parcel—I asked him whether he had received any money for them—he said he had—I asked how he had received it—he said he met Richard Bulkley in the street, and received it from him—I believe that was the whole of the conversation—we afterwards went to his room, his box was searched, and my attention was called to a very large quantity of gloves for a private person to have—they were gloves that had been used—I asked him if they had relation to any property of ours—he said they had, that they had been given to him by Richard Bulkley—I asked when—he said when he was living in the house—Jervis has been with us for four years and three or four months—he came on the 1st February, 1863—I think Richard Bulkley was with us about two years and nine months, he left, I think, in October 1866, but I am not quite clear about the date.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the finding of those pieces of paper the first information you received which led to the suspicion of Jarvis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—I should say that was about three weeks before he was called into the counting-house—I had made no inquiries whatever, the officers had, no doubt, during that time—they were doing what they considered right, under no instruction from us at all—we of course knew they had a clue to it—the officers said they would come on the Monday, and I said, "Are we justified in speaking to Jarvis on it?

               <p>that we knew more about it than he thought—there was no arrangement whatever—the officers only said, "Of course when he comes in you will caution him"—we called him in because we believed he was connected with the robbery, and we wanted to know whether he was or not—there was no plan about it, nor any arrangement; any plan we chose to adopt, and the plan which was adopted we believed was the right one—I do not believe I said to him, "You had better tell the truth"—since the exa<lb></lb>mination at the Mansion House I have talked over this matter with my brothers, and if you wish it I will tell you the conversation—it certainly arose out of my being asked whether I had made use of those words—I spoke to them in consequence of not being quite sure but that I had made use of them—I was never under the impression that I had—<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>and quality, that is all I can say—our stock is very largely deficient of bonnet silks; we keep a list of them, and our list is altogether defective—that might arise from their not being marked off; but there is a large deficiency in the total amount of stock—I have no means of knowing what deficiency there is in moire antiques—this pattern is the same quality as the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and the same width—it is similar to these goods—it is one of Kemp and Stone's manufacture—3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard is the cost of this article—I cannot tell whether they have been sold at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With reference to the moire antiques, you say you cannot tell whether the stock is deficient or not, how is that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We do not keep an exact detailed account of every different section of the stock—the bonnet glaces constitute a very large portion of our stock, and we have a list made out to see how certain colours sell and which do not sell, and that list from time to time is rectified by one of the young men in the department, and when we were told we had been robbed we found that list very deficient indeed—the list shows goods that are not accounted for by ordinary sales—the stock generally being deficient, I cannot say whether the moiré antiques are deficient or not.</p>

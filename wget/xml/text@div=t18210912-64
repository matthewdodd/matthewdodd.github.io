            , on the debit side of the account - A. I have no such entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Read the entry on the debit side - A. The last entry here is 30th May, 1820; "O. Y. 86, to J. Bunn, No. 5281, 10,000 l." - this is in my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it all your writing - A. It appears to have been altered since I wrote it - when I wrote it, it was P. Y. to J. Penn, and the number was 1181; the date is affixed to a previous entry, not in my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Read exactly what was written by you - A.20th March, 1821, P. Y. 86, to J. Penn, 1181, 10,000 l. - this was what was written by me on 20th March, 1821.</p>
               <p>Q. Now read the entry as it now is - A. "O. Y. 86, to J. Bunn, 528l, 10,000 l."; without any date - the date is erased I made the entry from the transfer book - O. Y. is the title of the transfer book - 86 is the folio - J. Bunn, is the credit name, and 5281 the number of the transfer.</p>
               <p>Q. It was P. Y. and is now O. Y. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you produce the transfer book from which you made the entry - A. I have been obliged to answer you from memory, in consequence of the alteration, and have made an error; the original entry should be R. Y. the rest is correct.</p>
               <p>Q. Now turn to R. Y. 86. - A. It it not to be found, this is the book in which it should appear, and in which it did appear to me, and from which I made the entry - it appears two pages (that is one leaf) has been taken out, and there appears an alteration in the folio; the following pages to 84 now stand 85 upon an erasure - and the subsequent folios appear to be altered as far as 93 - there is no alteration before 85 - the leaf 93 would not be the corresponding leaf to 85 and 86.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the date of the transfer now in the book on the leaf preceding that which is taken out which is 84 - A.20th March, the date on page 85 is the 20th and 86 the 21st.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. When you speak of the state the entry was when made by yourself, are you speaking from any recollection of the fact - A. No; I speak from reference to entries in other books - I believe those entries are not made by myself; there are about fifty clerks in the office, all of which have access to the ledger occasionally - an entry of the transfer is made by other clerks into other books - each clerk acts as a cheque to the other - the entries are made the same day and chequed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet sometimes a mistake occurs - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. How many clerks are there in your division - A. Eleven; the prisoner was one of those eleven, on the 20th March - the account of Sir R. Peel would be in that division and of Penn also.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there one ledger for each division - A. There are several ledgers to each division.</p>

Y. 86, by R. Peel, No. 1181, 10,000 - I have searched for the transfer ticket to see if I could find any such transfer, on the 20th of March, 1821, but cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain what these transfer tickets are - A. It is a printed ticket for the purpose of having the name written on it - that is the name from whom the stock came, and to whom it is to go, and the sum - no transfer is made without having such ticket - it is necessary to have the transfer ticket examined to see if the person selling has such stock - the transfer may be entered in the book by the same clerk or another - the tickets, as soon as they are entered, are put on a file and kept, and in the afternoon put into the strong room - I have searched the strong room, and the bundle of tickets which should contain it, and cannot find it - there is no account in the transfer book of any transfer from Sir

Yes, the primary is examined at one time, and the duplicate afterwards; we never take the entries from the primary and the duplicate at the same time - it is not our general practice, I have known an instance or two of the kind, I think about two.</p>
               <p>Q. If that occurs, may it not also occur that the writer of the primary recites the entry, and you take it from him - A. Never; we read them in the evening, the duplicate clerk reads, and the primary clerk looks at his book; the primary clerk does not read again, and the duplicate clerk examine - we always read the names and sums.</p>
               <p>Q. Always - A. Previous to the beginning of last February, we had at times omitted it, and only read the figures, but after that, in consequence of a representation from the principal of the office, that was discontinued, and I think never happened again.</p>

            . Q. Are you sure you put down in the duplicate book, what you found in the transfer book - A. I am, most certainly. I can take upon myself to say, that on the evening of that day. I faithfully read over what had been written to the clerk who had the primary.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Navy 5 per cent office, in the division L to R. I turn to the ledger containing Sir R. Peel's account, and find there is an entry of 14,759 l. 1 s. 5 d. on the 12th of April, 1820, it stands so now. The entry I made was, 4,759 l. 1 s. 5 d.; somebody has inserted the figure 1 before it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the original transfer - A. Here is a transfer of 4,759 l. 1 s. 5 d. on the 12th of April, 1820; it was from this that I made the entry in the ledger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. You have been a considerable time in the same office with Mr. Turner - A. I have, and was 95 l. in his debt at the time he was charged with this offence. I had been in his debt a few months.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not called on you to pay it - A. He lent it me at Christmas, it was to be paid at stated periods; the first was in March, which was paid - he had lent me more.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were in the office when the prisoner was charged with this - A. I was in the office when the discovery was made, not when any one was charged with it The prisoner went away at the usual time on that day, between three o'clock and half past three. I know nothing of his going away till the usual time, but when the other clerks went, he was gone.</p>

             a broker at the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Take this receipt in your hand, and say whose writing is the filling up - A. The witnessing is the prisoner's, and I am inclined to think the filling up is the same; I believe so, but am not so confident of that as the signature.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is it not absolutely necessary for a broker to attest identity - A. No; it is the entering clerk's duty to enter the name of the person making the transfer, but it is too often omitted.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person came with a difficult name, would it be at all unusual to leave it to the broker to insert it - A. It is done sometimes, it is often the case that the broker does insert it, where it has been omitted by the entering clerk.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Is not the entry made from the transfer ticket - Yes; the entry in this book does not depend on the second, but is taken from the ticket; the name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120033"></xptr>transferring is in the body of the transfer, and that is taken from the transfer ticket.</p>

            . He was then asked some questions respecting Mr. Penn, who he was; he said Mr. Penn appeared to be about fifty years of age, he had known him by sight two or three years; he had been introduced to him as

            . but he did not recollect by whom or where; he did not know whether he had any transactions in the funds previous to these, and that Smith came to identify Penn as his broker; that Smith had transacted business in the 5 per cents. in his (the prisoner's) book before; that he knew him as a respectable and responsible broker, and he thought Smith was known to Mr. Campbell and Mr. Salisbury, clerks in the office. We then turned to the other transfers from Penn, making together 10,000 l., and on the name of 
               <persName id="t18210912-64-person693">

             signed to them, some of the transfers are blotted over by ink, they are all witnessed by the prisoner and Smith; he was asked as to the blots that were on several of the transfers - he said the blots on the signature of Penn were not there when the book went out of his hands; he had no recollection of any such - had they taken place before the transfers were signed he should have required their being made over again. He was asked if there were stock receipts? he said there were stock receipts on each transfer which were written by him. He was then asked as to Penn's residence, and said he had no knowledge of it except by the description in the account and the transfer, but had known him by the name of Penn, and as a man of good property, but never visited him - he considered Penn as a man who had made his fortune, and who was making the most of his property. He was Smith last week, but could not give any traces to find him. The stock had been standing in Penn's name only a short time; that he did not recollect whether he witnessed the transfer into his name or not. He was then further questioned by the Governor and Deputy Governors respecting Smith; he said I have known Smith four or five years or more, but was never in his company in private. I think Price, Campbell, and Salisbury knew Smith. Smith was regularly in the habit of attesting transfers. I have generally seen Smith in the middle of the Rotunda. He was then asked by the Chief Accountant whether Smith had a box in the Rotunda, as some persons who attend the Rotunda have; he said I think he has not a box with his name on it in the Rotunda. It was then observed to him that the name of

             to several of the transfers was signed differently, that they did not all appear one signature - he said he had observed the variation of signatures by Penn when the transfers were made, but knowing him to be the same individual he did not object to it. He was then ordered to withdraw - but recalled in a few minutes, and informed that he could not be permitted to return home, but could send a note to his wife, and must remain under the care of Foy, a police officer, untill next morning; he sent a note to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see him again - A. This passed on Wednesday, the 9th of May. I saw him again on the Saturday, in St. Bartholemew's Hospital - he sent for me, he was in bed, wounded; I told him I understood he had sent for me, he said, Yes; he had, and that he felt that circumstances, and appearance were very much against him, that he wished to see me, and make some communication to me; I told him, I could not receive any confidential communication from him, and that he knew my situation, and that whatever he stated, I must communicate again to my employers, and also elsewhere if necessary. He then said, that he had been ill-advised, misled, and defraudd, by a set of d - d rascals, by whom he had lost a great deal of money. I said, how can that be Mr. Turner, when it appears you have sold out all this stock, and received the benefit. I am not quite sure whether I mentioned the amount, he referred to Penn's stock; to the transfer. He was anxious he said, to explain the circumstance of the transfer. I said how can that be Mr. Turner, when it appears you sold out all the stock, and received the money for it. He said he did. I then said, what have you done with the money. He said, he paid it to that rascal Penn, I said Mr. Turner you know as well as I do, that there is no such person as

I said Yes, Mr. Turner, it appears by a book found at your house, that you had large time transactions with him, in the funds and that you paid him very large difference; he said, he had; he then urged me to permit him to be removed from the hospital, to his own house. I told him, that could not be; for I was afraid when he was removed, it must be to a place of confinement. I asked what could make him so desperate, as to leap out of a two pair of stairs window, as nothing had been said to him, about being committed to prison, he said if I knew the distress and anguish of mind he was in, I should not be surprised at that.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 9th of May, I took the prisoner in charge and took him to the Bank, and from there to the Crown Tavern, Clerkenwell-green, and arrived there about five o'clock in the afternoon; he was to remain there all night, and occupied a room in the upper story of the house, and I had the adjoining room. I was alarmed during the night, and threw up the window and saw Mr. Turner lying on the pavement in the street; I went down and found him much injured. After that I went into the room he was in, and found the bed clothes off the bed, and fixed to the legs of a chest of drawers; the quilt, sheets and blankets were knotted together and thrown into the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Now turn to the two transfers of the 17th of April, of 2,000 l. and of 200 l. - A. I can only speak to the attesting signature being the prisoners; I know nothing of the signature of Penn or Smith; I know no person of the name of Smith; I have searched to ascertain whether any person of that name has identified transfers previous to the 23d March, and found one which has been identified six or seven months since, but the signature bore no sort<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120036"></xptr>of resemblance to this. I do not know how far back I searched; it is the only identification by Smith that I found. I found it three months ago, but do not know when it was made. I have searched for the transfer ticket of the entry of the 21st of March, in the proper place; I do not recollect whether I found it, but all I found I gave Mr. Norris. I searched for all the transfers of this transaction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Mr. Turner has been in the Bank eighteen years - A. I have been there seventeen years, he was there before me; other clerks may, or may not, be as well acquainted with his handwriting as me. I have seen him write numbers of times.</p>

Gentlemen, you must see that to prove my perfect innocence is not possible, because the only witness who could have done so - the man for whose iniquities I am standing here, has fled from scrutiny; but I can prove to you that all the probabilities are at utter variance with the supposition of my guilt, and that though I may have been careless, incautious, and credulous; I was not a criminal, and ought not to be a victim. During eighteen years I have been a faithful servant of the Bank, and in the riots of 1780, my father, Sir

            , was the means of preserving its treasury from plunder, so that my attachment to the Bank might be said to be hereditary; but I ask no indulgence on that account, it entitles me to none, if guilty. I seek acquittal only on the ground of my innocence. Gentlemen of the Jury, the way in which I was entrapped into this melancholy situation is plain and simple. I was applied to by one of those, who under the guise of gentlemen infest society and prey upon the credulous, for the loan of money, which he had no doubt discovered I had at my command. For this he offered me a valuable consideration, and in answer to my demand of security he referred me to a credit which stood in his name to the amount of 10,000 l. upon the Bank books. He said he had family reasons for wishing it to appear there in his name, at least for a little longer; and described himself as a man of substance resident at Highgate. His account was plausible, his terms liberal, his appearance above suspicion, and without the over cantion of an enquiry at Highgate, I waited until an inspection of the books the next day should assure me of my security. If I had any suspicion, which unfortunately I had not, this inspection was sufficient to remove it. I there found in his name, the actual entry and investment to which he had referred me. I had no doubt of its authenticity - as an original account it appeared regular, and as a new account opened in the stock ledger, in consequence of transfer, as turns out to be the case. I could have no suspicion, because I knew that before any new account could be thus opened the transfer must have been inspected by the clerk who opened it, and that such transfer must have been posted, not by me, but by two clerks under pain of suspension There, however, Gentlemen, stood the credit regularly entered by Mr. Prideaux, in the stock ledger, there it stood in black and white, and I had just as much reason<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120037"></xptr>to suppose that the whole book was a forgery, as that this credit so presented to me was fictitions. I advanced the sum required without any further scrutiny. I could not doubt the evidence of my senses, and thus begun those pecuniary transactions which have ended in this miscreant's flight, and in my most calamitous, but guiltless embarrassment. To no purpose should I detail to you the various devices by which an accomplished swindler, such as he appeared to be, led me into the maze of his money transactions. For some pecuniary advantages which he held out, and, to do him justice, uniformly realized, I became his agent in the sale and transfer of the stock. Gentlemen, if it be asked, why I continued his agent in these sales? the answer is most obvious, I occasionally repaid myself out of the proceeds, the particular sums which from time to time I had advanced to him, and thus enabling me to be my own paymaster. I returned to him whatever there was of surplusage, and this fact accounts for many of the Bank notes which were the produce of the stock sold, being traced to my possession only, and not to his. And now, gentlemen, give me leave to ask you by what right could I have suspected Mr. Penn? When I found his account opened by Mr. Prideaux, the stock in his name correct, his transfers regular, his receipts correct, his remuneration to myself, liberal and punctual, and no taint whatever in his pecuniary transactions! By what right or title could I have suspected him? It is suggested against me that the entry in his name is altogether a fictitious one, because the original transfer upon which it is founded, was in itself fictitious, that such original transfer was forged by me, and that the leaf containing that forged transfer from Sir

             to Penn, was torn out by me. Gentlemen, if the account opened to Penn's credit in the stock ledger had been opened by my hands, there might have been some colour for the accusation - but it was not. It was confessedly opened by Mr. Prideaux, and he could not, or should not have so opened it until he saw that the original transfer on which it is founded had been regularly executed, and in raising the credit to Penn, he must, or should have been assisted by another clerk. This is the strict and imperative rule of the establishment. The book out of which a leaf has been torn, is a public book, a book of constant reference - it was subject to the daily reference of nearly fifty clerks, it was accessible to the whole office. Two months had elapsed from the date of the supposed transfer from Sir

             to Penn, to the day of the discovery; during all this time, with the exception of ten days, I was in daily attendance, and during those excepted ten days, I was on leave of absence on the sea-coast, where there was ample opportunity for escape, if I had been guilty. The imputed scheme had been successfully executed, the transfers had been made, the stock sold, the receipts open, the money realized, and a few hours would have put me beyond all fear of danger. But how did I act? I remained publicly at Hastings during my leave of absence, and then deliberately returned to the Bank - the scene of inevitable detection, had I been guilty. Would not any man who had such a consciousness have profited by such an opportunity? vessels in abundance, the French coast in sight, the imputed plunder safe in my possession. Is it credible that any man in his senses, that any man capable of the deep contrivance which this fraud imputes, would have thus surrendered himself and liberty, and rushed into the jaws of inevitable destruction. Will it be said, that I hoped the case might be kept secret? Secret in a public book! Secret, in an establishment where observation never slept! Try it however by the most unerring test, I was actually, I had almost said, providentially present when the discovery was made. I appeal to every one in that crowded office, was there any thing about me of peculiarity or embarrassment, any change in my manners, any variation in my countenance, any of the unequivocal, unavoidable accompaniments of guilt? did I not remain even twenty minutes beyond my time, I, who if I was guilty must have seen, in the event of discovery, a certain death! But conscious of innocence, I felt no fear. I returned, as usual, to my own well known habitation, and there I remained, accessible, as usual to every visitor. Was this the conduct of a guilty man? Examine my conduct still further. It is alledged that I tore away the missing leaf, and that to this, I trusted for security; why then did I not destroy the other leaves, in which the suspicious transfers were inserted? the leaves which contained the only evidence against me, the leaves which once removed place me beyond the reach of accusation. I, who they say forged them, I who had them in my power, I who trusted as they say, to this method of evasion. But gentlemen, it must occur to you to enquire, had I any temptation to this crime? was I in any pecuniary embarresment? far from it - my income from the Bank, was in itself a competence. I succeeded on the death of my mother, two years ago, to 2000 l. I received with my wife, only last year, upwards of 5000 l., and with this increased income, my mode of living was nearly the same, I remained in the same house, I owed no man a shilling, and three clerks in my department had been for months, and were at the time of my alledged criminality, my debtors to the amount of nearly 400 l.; so that, I, with abundance in possession, with unclaimed money due, without a debt on earth, with temperate and domestic habits, must be supposed to be voluntarily, deliberataly, and causelessly rushing upon infamy and death. You are called upon to believe, that of my own freewill, I avoided escape, and almost solicited detection, and preserved, when I might have destroyed the proofs which would lead to my conviction. Gentlemen, this is one of the cases in which, not general character alone, but particular circumstances, (lending to refute by probabilities, a charge resting on appearances and probabilities alone), must be of importance; and I trust effectually to convince you, that in my previous life, there is nothing to countenance a criminal presumption. Is there a man living, can impute to me dishonesty? In any dealing have I ever incurred suspicion? Has any creditor any unsatisfied demand on me? Had any tradesman occasion to call on me twice for the same debt? I never asked my fellow clerks in the Bank for my own, at the time, when I am said to have been the plunderer of others. I can prove that I voluntarily discharged unliquidated debts of my deceased parents, for one shilling of which I I was not legally responsible. The brokers who purchased this very stock from me (an unconscious agent), know that in my own transactions, they never had cause to be dissatisfied.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120038"></xptr>One of them, in particular, Mr. Harman, has confided in me to the amount of nearly 5,000 l. by taking my draft for that sum, and I always repaid him to the utmost farthing; they all know that in our various dealings, I could frequently have enriched myself at their expence, without the peril I this day stand in; and the Directors of the Bank themselves must know that from my command of the dividend warrants, I might, had I been so disposed, have defrauded them to ten times the sum imputed to me. Gentlemen, the only crime which can he justly imputed to me is, I have not been so cautious as I ought - I have been a dupe, but not a criminal. Gentlemen, when I was brought before the Directors, I gave them the account which I have given you to-day; I gave it on the instant, and without premeditation. Gentlemen, I must now advert, and I do it with great pain, to an unhappy occurrence, since I was arrested - when I found that I was imposed upon; when I found that the Directors of the Bank were determined to drag me thus before the public, and doom me to a trial, under which, even acquittal cannot efface all the marks of disgrace, I did seek to avoid such an exposure; when it burst upon me, that Penn was an impostor, and that I, his duped, his credulous, his unsuspecting agent, was to be dragged to this bar, covered with the most colourable suspicions, deprived by his flight of the only witness who could demonstrate my innocence, my mind became distracted, I knew that the very charge would taint me in Society, and that even acquittal would not purify me in the eye of the censorious - I saw in the spotless memory of my parents, in my own career of unimpeachable integrity, and in the character which my life had acquired for me, only so many sacrifices to this horrid accusation, and scarcely knowing what I was about, and now but imperfectly remembering it, I did in my distraction seek either escape, or what I thought more probable and more welcome; certain death. In this rash attempt, four of my bones were fractured; the agony which I have suffered, has almost unfitted me for a defence; but it has, I hope, made my peace with Heaven, for the impiety of the attempt, and under its mercy, to you, I trust, for that which is only less dear to me, the vindication of my innocence. Gentlemen, I know you will not let this circumstance operate to my disadvantage. I felt. when I sent for Mr. Kay, and afterwards for the Governor and him, all the deep concern which an honest man could feel, upon having been the innocent cause of so large a loss to an establishment I had served faithfully for eighteen years; I beg very particularly to remark, I then (from the four fractured bones) considered myself a dying man - I told the Governor and Mr. Kay, both, I considered myself a dying man, and as such, most solemnly denied all guilt, but expressed the greatest concern that from carelessness, I had caused so heavy a loss to the Bank; for I had then found I had been dreadfully imposed on, I declared, (observe Gentlemen, in these dreadful circumstances, expecting firmly, as I told the governor and Mr. Kay, immediate dissolution) that I was innocent of every crime against the establishment, but the careless credence I had given to a designing villain; and Mr. Kay has done me the justice to say, that from the first I declared I had been defrauded by Penn. Gentlemen, this is a case, as you must see, resting on both sides, merely on probabilities, balance those probabilities, and then say whether I am not entitled to even more than the effect of a doubt - to pronounce me innocent, you have only to believe it possible that I may have been imposed on, that I gave credence to an artful man, and not even that, until I saw upon the Bank books the regular documentary evidence in corroboration of his assertion - but to pronounce me guilty, you must believe that I forged the transfer from Sir

             to Penn, that I did it so as to pass the scrutiny of two experienced clerks as the rule of the Bank requires such transfer to be posted by two persons - that I did it so as to impose on another old and experienced clerk, who supervised it the next day - two other experienced clerks who abstracted it, and the superintendant of the division who had to observe if it was correctly posted. All these six clerks, well acquainted with my hand writing for many years; and you must believe that after a new account had been opened in the stock book, to the credit of Mr. Penn, not opened by me, observe, but by another clerk; you must believe I tore away the fraudulent leaf from the original book, that book, a public book, in the hands of the whole office, daily. You must believe that I not only tore away that leaf, but with my eyes open, the corresponding leaf each of these leaves known to contain three separate transfers in other names, to any one of which, reference might have become at any moment necessary. You must believe, that having forged the name of Sir R. Peel, and having forged the name of Penn, in a book in hourly use, I took upon myself, the sale of fictitious transfers in the common market. You must believe, that with this conciousness, amid the needless ostentation of my own forgeries, I attended regularly and punctually at the Bank, where detection was inevitable, and might have been immediate. You must believe, that having been given leave of absence, being on the sea coast, successful in my scheme, and as they say, with the spoils in my pocket, I chose to return to the very spot, where perhaps detection awaited my arrival. You must believe, that when the discovery was made in my immediate presence, I concious of guilt, with death before me, the witnesses around me, and the whole establishment aroused to vigilence - not only remained there tranquil, twenty minutes beyond my time, but being at large, and at leisure to escape, actually repaired to my habitual residence, accessible even to the visits of a stranger. You must believe, that having committed the forgeries, having personally published them, having realized their proceeds, having avoided escape, and solicited detection; I did all this without any earthly motive, with an ample salary, with 7000 l. in my possession, and with 400 l. due from the very clerks around me, not having asked them for repayment. You must believe, that I did this for the sake of money, which I did not want, against all the evidence of my former life - against all the chances of human probability. That I did it, who have ever shewn the very reverse of avarice, who have paid debts which could not be recovered, who have had thousands in my hands, to the last farthing punctually discharged - who have been often trusted without any security, and who might frequently and safely have defrauded to ten times the amount now imputed to me. Weigh well, I implore you, Gentlemen, all these probabilities - remember my existence hangs upon your breath, for to cases<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120039"></xptr>such as this, after conviction, mercy is a stranger. If you should not even feel assured of my innocence - if you should have a doubt of my guilt - the law gives me - your own hearts will give me the benefit of that doubt. Cut me not off I implore it of your justice, of your humanity, in the very summer of my years. I implore it not for myself, but for the memory of those whose name has been unsullied - for the sake of a character, accusation never stained, for the sake of a home - a happy home, my death would render desolate - for the sake of an innocent and helpless wife, who has bound up her wretched destiny in mine. In his name I ask it, who will not forget hereafter, the mercy with which you may have imparted justice here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, living at present at the Sailors' Home, in Well Street—on 6th September I was at the Crooked Billet, on Towns Hill—there were several women there—I was going towards home, and saw the prisoner, she said she was thirsty and hungry—I said, "Come in here, and I will give you a drink of beer," and I did so, and a biscuit—I there said, "Good night, old girl, I am going home to my tea"—she reached up her hand and snatched away the last 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had—I saw her pass it to her breast—I held her up against the counter, and told her to give it see back—she would not give it me—she took it out of her breast and passed it to another girl, who ran away with it—the prisoner got away from me, and ran as hard as she could—I followed her half way down Rosemary Lane—I did not lose sight of her—a policeman came along, and I charged her with robbing me of my money—she said she did not do any such thing, some other Woman did it—she said there were seven girls with me.</p>

               <p>villas, Hampstead—last Saturday week between 4 and 5 o'clock, I spoke to some one in the neighbourhood of Farringdon-station—I walked a short dis<lb></lb>tance with the man I spoke to, and we met the prisoner—he joined the man who first spoke to me—I did not know either of them—I gave the first man a pint of ale; I went into a public-house with him—the prisoner was not with us then, that was before he came up—I afterwards treated the prisoner and the other man to a second pint between them—I did not leave the prisoner, I remained in his company about five hours altogether—I sat down in the second public-house I went to—I went to sleep, requesting the other man to wake me at a certain time, which he did—I awoke between 9 and 10—I found both of the men there—they came out with me, talking to me—when we got to Fleet-street, I asked them to have another pint of ale, and they did so—at that time I had my watch safe; it was at an oyster<lb></lb>shop, and the prisoner said he wished to have something to eat, as he was starving—I ordered him half a dozen oysters, and the other man the same—I ordered some for myself but did not eat them—we went out, and I hailed a Hammersmith omnibus—the prisoner then put his hand in my pocket and twitched my watch off the guard—I did not see the watch then—he ran away, and I found my watch was gone; the guard was round my neck; it was broken in two—I ran after the prisoner and followed him into Tanfield-court, and he was there stopped by the porter—I did not lose sight of him—I saw my watch the same day—the policeman produced it at the police-station in Fleet-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you were very much the worse for liquor on this afternoon you speak off it I beg to refute it; I confess it was a foolish thing to go and treat two persons whom I had never seen before—I was very much excited—I had had two glasses of stout—I was not drunk—I had come from 8, Crossby-square, my-principal's office, when I met these men—I left there at 2 o'clock, I went into a public-house, and had a glass of stout, and then went with our head-clerk to Farringdon-station, and left him there—I was in his society at different places, on private business—we only visited one public-house—I only had one glass of stout from the time I left the office till I met the men—I meant I was excited after the robbery was committed on me—I was not excited by drink—I asked the man I spoke to direct me to Temple-bar, and to two or three places I wanted to call at—I have been in London seventeen months—I did not know my way from Farringdon-station to Temple-bar—we went by back streets, and I did not know where we were—my reason for remaining in their company and going to sleep was that I had been up all night writing, and I was very tired and I went to sleep—I saw my watch safe when I went to sleep—I did not ask the prisoner to assist me over the road in consequence of my being the worse for liquor—the inspector said I was the worse for liquor, when I made the charge, and I reported him to Mr. Alderman Salomons at Guildhall—it gave me great offence—we were all three close together when I felt the twitch at my pocket—the other man ran through Temple-bar—I did not get into any altercation with a woman who was selling winkles—she did not accuse me of taking her winkles—I did not tell anybody I had lost my watch before the prisoner ran away—after I had lost it I cried, "Stop thief!"—I did not lift my stick to strike the prisoner—I swear I did not say to either the prisoner or the other man, "I have lost my watch"—I never lost sight of the prisoner—supposing he had passed anything to the other man, I think I should have seen it—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I stopped the prisoner—the prosecutor was close to the prisoner's heels—I held the prisoner by the collar, and said, "What is the matter?"—the prosecutor said, "He has got my watch"—a person named Turner, who lives in Tanfield-court, was there—I was talking to him at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember going to Hollingshead, an engineer? A. Yes; I went to him before I went to get the cannons from the prisoner - I did not insist on the cannons being cast with a bore; I made no remark whether they were to be cast hollow or solid - I asked Hollingshead what the boring would come to; he did not tell me they must be bored to render them safe - I had the order for the guns from a young man, named Smith, and after the rejoicing was over, they were all to be put on board a pleasure-boat; I never told the prisoner that some of them were for ornament, and never to be fired, nor did I even tell his son so.</p>

            . I am a labouring man, and live at Brentford. John Webb was out with me on the 28th of August, when these guns were fired - he took the command of the guns, and loaded them; they were fired in Mr. Nichols' brick-fields at first, to be proved - three were proved; Webb then came to me, and said "There is no cause to prove any more of them, we will take them down to the water and fire them;" I had fired three by way of proof; and at Webb's suggestion, we took them down by Kew-bridge, under the wall, on the Middlesex side - Webb loaded one; I gave him the cartridges.</p>
               <p>Q. When you are proving guns, do you charge them beavier than usual? A. Some people do, but I did not; I did not load them to prove them on the river, but in the ordinary way - I fired them; the first I fired by the river side, burst, but not knowing it would cause an accident, I fired two afterwards, before I knew Webb was hurt - he stood as near eighteen yards from me as possible; I did not know the first gun had burst - after I had fired the third, I was called to to cease, and saw Webb laying on his back on the ground - I went up to him; he laid all in a gore of blood, and a piece of the cannon laid close to him; he never spoke in my hearing - he was taken to the Star and Garter; I had known him from a child - his name was John Webb; Mr. Bonny attended him - I was not with him when he died.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the gun which burst been proved, to your knowledge? A. Not to my knowledge; Webb said, "We need not prove more."</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not prudent and usual to prove guns before they are brought into common use? A. Yes, but I did not know how many had been proved; I have fired a good many guns - it was fine powder, but of what strength I cannot tell; it came from Mr. Hughes; I did not know whether any of the guns were for ornament.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the deceased? A. A labouring man.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Brentford. I was present when this occurred, but not near at the moment - I picked up part of the cannon; this is the part, but it has since been broken - it is a white metal - there is some lead in this piece of iron; that must have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060075"></xptr>done to stop up the part of the cannon that had burst - it matches the former aperture in the cannon; I have it here, and the pieces match it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you apprehend the lead to have been? A. At the under side of the cannon, and being placed on the carriage, it was not very visible.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the 29th of August I was called in to attend John Webb, who laid in an outhouse at the Star and Garter, Kew-bridge - he lived till six o'clock in the morning; he had a wound on the right side of his head, about three inches long, penetrating to the bone; there was a great appearance of contusion on the whole of the right side of his head; I examined the body next morning, and found a quantity of extravasated blood on the outer covering of the brain, (the dura mater,) and am full convinced that injury was the cause of his death; it was such an injury as a blow from a piece of cannon would inflict.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Hughes came to me, and wanted me to make him six cannons; I refused more than once or twice - he then went to Hollingshead, as I understood, to know what he could get them bored for out of the solid - he came back to me, and said it was too much money, would I make them hollow for him; my answer was,"Hughes, it is no use my pretending to make them, do you mean to kill yourself? if I make them I cannot warrant any one of them sound;" well, he repeatedly talked to me about it, and I made him four - my son took them to Brentford, and I gave him a caution; I said, "Hughes, be very particular how you use these things, or else you will get hurt;" he told me he would try them in a field, would cover them with dirt, and put wet rangs and lay a fusee to them; I said, "If you don't mind what you are about you will be killed;" he wanted me to do it, but I would not - he said they were for a sailing-boat, two to put on each side; then he came to me, and wanted me to make it up a dozen, and said they were to be sham ones, not to fire at all; I owed him a little money, and he sent me a letter, saying if I did not do them he would put me to trouble - he sent the iron to make them with.</p>

            . I am an engineer, and have been so for ten years - I carry on business in King-street, Long-acre. Hughes came to me about three months ago, and asked what the boring of cannons would come to, and whether it was requisite to have them bored; I told him they must be bored to render them safe - it is quite impossible to make them safe without boring; he said he had got an order from a gentleman, he did not mention how many guns he wanted, he merely asked me the expense; I said it was impossible to say without knowing the quality of the metal, and seeing them; he said he had been speaking to Carr about casting them - he said Carr had not, at that time, cast them; it is not safe or usual to use guns without first proving them; I always understood there was a penalty for so doing.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your judgment, could a person, who founds cannons, tell whether they are honeycombed unless they are proved? A. Not without breaking them to pieces; an engineer, with the greatest care in founding them, could not prevent their being honey combed, provided they are cored - if cast solid and bored they stand a great deal better chance of being sound, and then they are always proved - it is not the founder's business to prove them; he has nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You understand that business very well? A. I do; cannon is cast in either case, but no prudent man would order one to he made hollow; I have been acquainted with Carr some time, and always considered him a good workman, and a man who knew his business; any body, who knew the trade, would know the proper way was to cast them solid, and bore them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say it is the only safe way? A. Yes- casting them hollow is unsafe.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean to say the purchaser and not the founder is to prove them? A. The person, who orders them, should prove them; founders cast them for manufacturers, but do not finish them - if a private person ordered them the private person should prove them; this cannon is not made from the best pig-iron; there may be some pig-iron in it, and the rest what is technically called plate - I should consider there is some pig-iron in it; this lead is, most undoubtedly, put in to fill up what we technically call a blow in it, which is a flaw, a defect caused by the air in the process of casting; it is the common practice of founders to do so.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was it safe to send out cannon with that lead in it? A. According to the strength of it, I do not think it would affect it; but I should not think it a safe cannon to be sent out at all, even for proving; on account of its being cored out instead of being cast solid.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you consider it safe to send out a cannon even for proving, which had such a blow in it? A. I should not conceive the blow would materially affect the strength of it where it is; if there was nothing but this lead in it, I should certainly think it unsafe - I should think the proving would discover whether the defect extended farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you let them take the risk of that? A. We let them take the risk of that.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When cannons are cast hollow, they undergo a process, called smoothing? A. Certainly - the hole cast is not of sufficient capacity for the bore required; it is cut out afterwards, and that would discover any defect in casting - this has never been smoothed; that is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060076"></xptr>duty of the person who orders them of the founder - the founder has nothing to do but to give you a cast from your pattern; I was never present at the process of proving; there appears to me a very slight blow on the under part of this cannon, not where the strength is required - I know what caution should be used to prevent mischief in proving guns; they should be loaded with double or treble the usual quantity of powder, and embanked round with sand or clay, to prevent the fragments flying about, if it burst.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If an oil and colour man orders cannons, should you consider it his duty to smooth them? A. The founder considers he has nothing to do with it - it is his business to cast the wheels, but not to send them home mounted; these are mounted - I have known them sent home on a carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. If these are sent home on a carriage, do you mean the oilman was to expect he was to smooth them after their coming home in this way? A. I do not consider a founder should take orders from an oilman; they are smoothed with a lathe, which is an engineer's business - oilmen do not keep such tools.</p>

            . I have been an iron-founder between fifty and sixty years - I have carried on business in King-street, Long-acre, forty-two years. It is not a founder's business to prove or smooth cannon; he has no tools to do it - it requires an engineer, with a very expensive apparatus; cannon cast hollow should be smoothed - it should be bored, which would prove the imperfection; smoothing would detect it; it is impossible for a founder to tell whether cannon is sound till it has been proved - it might get honey combed with the greatest care in casting; I never heard before of casting them hollow - I cast a great many for different people; they send me the carriages and wheels - I send them home in that state, and hear no more of them - I am in an extensive business; it was the custom many years ago to cast them hollow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It has ceased to be the custom to cast them hollow? A. It has; I would not cast them hollow for any body - I consider it unsafe, and dangerous.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is boring more expensive? A. Certainly; it would cost more to bore them than is charged for these.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is it perfectly known among founders that it is dangerous to cast hollow? A. Yes, if a founders knows his business he must know it, but many founders do not cast cannon; we usually supply gunmakers, who carry on the finishing part of the trade - it is the duty of the person ordering them to get them finished.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever known a case of a person out of the trade ordering them? A. Never.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's son. I remember Hughes coming about these cannons; he ordered them to be cast with cores; my father said he could not make them with cores as they would blow, he would make them solid for him, if cast with cores they would have air holes; he sent my father a letter, which was burnt or torn up - we are not in the habit of preserving letters; my father at last said he would make them - Hughes told him to come down, and he would give him some iron to make them; and before we began them, Hughes said he would take them out into the middle of a field, and have them proved there - there were four sent first; he returned one - three had stood the proof but that one had not; he said they were for a sailing-boat - that there were three good ones, and one, which was his pattern, would make four good ones, which were two for each side of the boat, and the others were for ornament; I am quite sure he said that.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Tell me the difference there is between those you made for ornament and for use? A. I showed them to Hughes when I took them down, and he said he would put a private mark on them; there was no difference in the manufacture - we charged them all the same price.</p>
               <p>Q. If they were for ornament there was no occasion to have a hole in them? A. They were as he ordered them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you do with the one which was sent back? A. I do not know what became of it more than Adam.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that it with the hole plugged up with lead? A. That is it; the hole was filled and sent back to him, because he said they were not for firing - he said, "Send it back if you have it by you;" we sent them home on carriages.</p>

            . I am servant to a gentleman who lodges in Mr. Roberts's house. On the 15th of October, about five minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise and went up stairs. Some little time after, I saw the prisoner with a light in his hand - he had two large prints in his hand - he put the light on a seat in the passage, then opened the door, and took the prints out. I followed him to the top of the street, and then gave an alarm. I did not lose sight of him. He was taken in a few minutes. I am certain of his person; I saw him again in a few minutes. The prints were taken from Mr. Roberts's rooms, one from the back, and the other from the front parlour.</p>

            . I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner walking across the road, with two framed and glazed prints. I pursued, and only lost sight of him while a coach passed. When I came on the opposite side, I picked up one of the prints, and delivered it to an officer; I did not see him drop it. I believe he is the man who carried them, but cannot be certain.</p>

            . I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner on the south side of the Strand, walking. I went after him, and just as I got up to him, he looked round, and as I was going to collar him, he dropped the two prints. He then turned down a court into Holywell-street; he fell down in the court, and I fell on him; he was secured.</p>

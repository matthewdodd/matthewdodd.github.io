             - the prisoner, William Snow, was in their employ for two months previous to the 30th of July, as a <rs id="t18290910-231-deflabel1278" type="occupation">cashier</rs>

On the Thursday morning, before the 30th of July, he got up first, and went down stairs; I got up about seven o'clock, and saw a bundle hanging on a nail in my bed-room - some of our shop-twine was hanging through a hole in it; I took it down, and found some skeins of silk, some cotton, a purse, a half-sovereign, a crown, two half-crowns, and a quantity of my master's property - there was a cheque-book, a number of billheads, and some paper - I called a young man, and we showed them to Mr. Rotherham; in about an hour I was called into the counting-house, and found the prisoner -Mr. Rotherham said to me, "This boy denies these things, and says they don't belong to him;" I said to the prisoner,"It is of no use your denying it, it must be your's, and you took them;" Mr. Rotherham said it was of no use his denying it, he would bottom the affair, and he had better tell the truth; he then said he took them, and he had taken some cotton, needles, and worsted home, and they were in a school-box, in the back-parlour - the officer and I went to his mother's, after he was gone to Worship-street; when we got to the house, the officer asked Mrs. Snow whether she had a son in the employ of Rotherham and Grinsell; she said, Yes; he asked if she had any of their property in her house; she said, No; she then said,"His aunt has been here, and I have been looking into the school-box, and found these two parcels" - Attfield said, "Have you got any more?" she said No; he said,"We must look," and we found two more lots in the parlour, in different places, in boxes and drawers - here is cotton, needles, tape, and silk, such as they have in their shop; the whole amount, I should think, is about 3l.; the cottons have our name on the label, and the needles have our private mark on the paper.</p>

               <p>Cross-exmained by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who are your employers? A. William Rotherham and John Hill Grinsell - I have sold things out of the shop with these labels on them - I sometimes find needles and things about the shop, but these are done up in papers.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the house of the female prisoner, at No. 31, Gloucester-street, Commercial-road - it is about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutors' - she opened the door; I asked if her name was Snow; she said Yes; I asked if she had a son at Rotherham and Grinsell's; she said Yes; I asked if she had ever received any goods belonging to them - she said not to her knowledge - I took her into the back-parlour, and read the warrant - I asked if there were any goods there; she then opened the drawer, and gave out two parcels, which she said she had taken from the boy's box, and intended to take to the prosecutors' - I said, "Is this all;" "I believe it is," she said; I said I must search, and in different parts I found these papers of needles, cottons, and other things - this other parcel I got from Capey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the husband of this woman living? A. Yes, and I believe he sleeps in the front-room, in consequence of this woman's mother being there, and sleeping with her - her husband is coachman to a gentleman in the City.</p>

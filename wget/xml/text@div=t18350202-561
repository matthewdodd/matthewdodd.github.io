                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Goswell-street-road. On the 3rd of February, I received information, went into the street, and saw the prisoner with a bag in his hand—he turned down the first turning, and dropped it—I took it up, and followed him—when he got to the top of the street, I missed him—some person told me to go into the public-house—I went in, and saw the prisoner there—I have no doubt of him—the bag con<lb></lb>tained thirteen pairs of women's shoes, which bad been in pairs on the shelf, fixed against the wail in my shop—they are my property—the bag is not mine—I had seen them safe at twelve o'clock the preceding night; and this was at half-past ten o'clock in the morning—the shop doors were not open until about half-past eight o'clock—the shop was opened sooner.</p>

I was going to look for a situation—I never had the bag in my hand—I went into the public-house for half-a-pint of beer, when that gentleman came in and asked me if I knew the bag—I said no. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not see his face, but I do not think I can be mistaken in him—I did not see him go into the public-house.</p>

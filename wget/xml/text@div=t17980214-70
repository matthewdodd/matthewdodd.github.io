             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen him often, for a month before this transaction happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 6th of November? - A. I cannot be particular to the 6th or 7th of November; I saw him at No. 3, Leicester-street, Leicester-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that day receive any Bank-note from the prisoner? - A. A 30l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note you received from him? -(Showing him a note). - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I wrote my name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive cash from any body for this note? - A. Yes; from a person of the name of King, who keeps the Red-lion in Jermyn-street, the same day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are not certain whether it was the 6th or 7th of November? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You are, perhaps, not certain at all as to the day of the month? - A. I am certain it was either the 6th or 7th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep a house which is, we understand, a gaming-house? - A. I do not; I do not say that I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did at that time? - A. Yes; but not at the house where the note was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose house was that? - A. Cocksedge's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you playing there? - A. No; I attended for Mr. Maitland, who was out of town, to see that every thing was done right.</p>
               <p>Q. You took care of the bank, perhaps? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.This was not a Banking house, I believe, but a Rouge at Noir bank? - A. I cannot speak French.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a good deal of money played for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive many notes for the bank that day? - A. Not of that description; I received a good many small notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the account for the gentleman, whom you represented upon this occasion as keeper of the bank? - A. Not of the particular notes.</p>
               <p>Q.There is a good deal of hurry attending that sort of business? - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. It is all coolly done, is it? - A. Very coolly.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides the notes that are paid into the bank, I mean the bank that we are talking of, not the Bank of England, are there not bets take place at the table? - A. None, but what are on the table, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean the bets between the different individual who are gambling and playing? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never know, in the course of your knowledge of transfactions of this fort, bets taking place between individuals, beside what is played for at the tables? - A. I do not recollect any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that has not taken place within your knowledge? - A. I never knew a thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. My learned Friend asked you if you knew this note, you answered him, that you put your name upon it? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you put your name upon it? - A.In half an hour, or an hour; it was never out of my possession from the time of receiving it, till I got change for it.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do with it when you first received it? - A. I laid it on the table under a lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not more than an hour? - A. I cannot take upon myself to swear the exact time, I think it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the room at play? - A. I cannot say; there might be twenty, or from that to forty.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that there were not fifty people there? - A. I will not take upon myself to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the people that were in the room engaged in playing? - A. I should suppose not; there were frequently several lookers on.</p>
               <p>Q. Those that were lookers on were standing round the table, were they not? - A. Generally so.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they chiesly French, or were they English? - A. They were both.</p>
               <p>Q. Acting as agents for this worthy gentleman, Mr. Maitland; I take it for granted, your attention was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140096"></xptr>pretty much taken up, in regarding his interest. taking care of the bank; and plundering the people? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not the person th whom Mr. King applied, respecting this note, and to know what were the circunstances attending it? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew, unless you could give an account of the possession of this note, you would be liable to be hanged before your time? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was a good thing, you know, to slip, your own neck out of the halrer, and charge somebody else? - A. I do not charge anybody but the person I took it from; the prisoner at the bar asked me to give him change for a 5l. note, and he gave me this 3ol. note; I returned it him back, and said, young man, you are mistaken, it is a 30l. note, and he took it back.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that? - A. He said nothing more at that time.</p>
               <p> Q. At what other time did he say any thing? - A. In about a quarter of an hour after, or it might be less, he put down the note, and said he wanted five pounds on it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what profession of life are you besides being a gambler - what other means of livelihood have you? - A. I am agent to a gentleman in Birmingham, Mr. Betts, in the plared line.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides acting in the important character of agent in a gambling-house - did you not at this time keep a gambling-house youself? - A. I did for about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. No. 34, Jermyn-street.</p>
               <p>Q. If it is not impertinent, I will ask you if you have visited any of the jails of this metropolis - have you been in any of them? - A. I have once, I do not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q.How often? - A. Never, but once.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the charge then against you? - A. As an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. What, you turned stag, you were evidence for the Crown, - in what case? - A. Against a person who had robbed the mail.</p>
               <p>Q.What, the Rotherham mail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You have never been in any other jail yet? - A. No, nor I trust I never shall be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say you received no other 30l. note than this? - A. No other.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been passing a note that you thought was suspected, would you have put your own name to it? - A. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner said he wanted 5l. upon this note, did he agress you in English or French? - A. He asked me to change it in English.</p>
               <p>Q. When he proposed his bets, was that done in French or English? - A. In broken English.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. I am clerk to the Solicitor of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present when the prisoner was apprehended? - A. I first saw him at a public-house near Leicester-fields, I think it is called Sydney's-asley, I understood he had been taken about an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q.Who were then present? - A.Townsend and Carpmeal, two of the Bow-street officers, together with two men that Mr. Shaw had employed to taken him, who knew his person.</p>
               <p>Q.Were any questions asked him by you, or any person present, respecting this note? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he got it from? - A. He did not, till he got to the Magistrate's; I got a coach, and went with the officer to search his lodgings.</p>
               <p> Q. Did you hear him given any account of it at the Magistrate's -</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was not the account that he gave at Bow-street, taken in in writing? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, apply your mind to it, so as to be able afterwards to say that it was not? - A. I understood so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, observe the fact, with a view to give evidence of it hereafter? - A. I took no particular notice of it, for the purpose of giving evidence, but I did not observe that there was any examination taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether it was or not, you cannot say? - A. I really believe it was not; when we came before the Magistrate, the note was produced to him, and he was asked how he came in possession of the note; the Magistrate asked him if he knew the note, he replied he did; the Magistrate asked him again the same question, two or three times over, and he said yes, he knew it perfectly well; he said he had found it, together with a 20l. note, one evening, I think, in Leicester-square, folded in a piece of paper; he was asked, what paper, and how was it folded, whether it was in a letter, or how, he took a piece of paper, that was then lying on the table, and folded it up, describing to the Magistrate how the notes were folded; he was asked, whether that was the fact that he had stated, he said it certainly was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever say what he had done with them? - A. He said that he had put them in his pocket, that he had never told any person that he had found-the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention how he had got rid of them? - A. He was asked If he had not produced it at Shaw's gaming-table, and put it off there, and he said, Yes; he was then asked, what he had done with the other 20l. note, he said he had passed it at a gaming-house kept by one Robinson, in Sussolk-street, Charing-cross; he was asked, how he got his livelihood, he said he received a daily allowance from one of the committee appointed by this government for the relief of Emigrant Frenchmen; I do not recollect that any thing else passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him there again? - A. I think it was the 27th of December he was brought up to Bow-street, for further examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was not that second examination taken in wtiting? - A. No; he was then questioned again how he came by that 30l. note, he said he had received it from his brother abroad, in a letter, I think he said from Altona, I am not certain; they were enclosed in a letter, which, he said, was amongst his papers that I took from his lodgings; the Magistrate asked him how he came to give a different account then to that which he gave upon the former examination, and he made no answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. Did you, amongst the papers found in his lodgings, discover any letter? - A. In consequence of his having said that, Mr. Winter directed me to take all his paper to him in Newgate, which I did, and desired him to point out, if he could, whether the letter that he had stated was amongst those papers; he looked them all over, and found the cover of a letter, a half-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140097"></xptr>sheet of letter-paper, which I now hold in my hand, which he pointed out as enclosing the notes, (produces it); it is in the same state in which I found it. On the day he was brought up for a second examination, I think it was on the 27th of December, I produced to him a letter folded up, and I asked him if he knew the writing of the direction on the back, he said he did; he was asked if it was his brother's writing, he said yes; he opened it, and read a part of it, he looked at the latter part of the letter, and was asked if it was his brother's writing, a second time, and then he said, he did not know whose writing it was, and began to cry; he had read a part of it before that, he had not read the whole.</p>
               <p>Q.From whom did you receive that letter? - A. I received it from Mr. Winter open, and when I received it there was a 25l. note in it; I did not show the note to the prisoner, he knew nothing at all about the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say, when he was taken to the office at Bow-street, he was questioned whether he knew the 30l. note? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, I presume, he was standing at the bar? - A. We were in a private room up stairs, and he was sitting at the same table with the Magistrate, next to the clerk and Mr. Winter.</p>
               <p>Q. The note was shewn to him, and he instantly said, yes, he knew it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He answered that he knew it, before he had taken it into his own hand to examine? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, he had not at that time examined the number of the note, and all the particulars concerning it? - A. He had not then, but it was put into his hand, and he looked at it, and turned it two or three times over.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these questions asked in English or in French? - A. In English, and he answered in English; he speaks English very well, or else I could not have understood him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when he was first apprehended, and first examined, I need scarcely ask you, he being a foreigner, whether he was not under a considerable degree of agitation? - A. He certainly was when I first saw him in the public-house, when he was first apprehended, he was certainly agitated, but I did not perceive any agitation at all before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. After he had turned it over and over again, did he afterwards give the same account of it? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came to the house, what did you find there? - A. She gave me a letter.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that? - A.This is the letter I received from the woman.</p>
               <p>Q.When you had received that letter, what did you do with it? - A. I took it to Mr. Winter, who opened it in my presence, it contained a Bank-note of 23l.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that note? - A.This is the note, for I marked it; I left the letter and the note with Mr. Winter; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not know the prisoner at the bar before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not know that these were his lodgings, but from the information of other people? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was not till after the prisoner was in custody that it was found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it had never reached the prisoner? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after he was apprehended? - A. It might be five or six weeks.</p>
               <p> - WINTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Is that the letter that you received from Rivett. containing the 25l. note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And is that the letter that you gave into the hands of your clerk, Mr. Loaring? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. (To Loaring.) Q. You mentioned that you found some papers, which you afterwards shewed the prisoner, in Newgate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find those papers? - A. At his lodings, No. 10, Wardour-street; I went there, when he was first apprehended, with the officers; he took us into a room, and pointed out what things were his in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Rivett.) Q.Was that the house, No. 10, where you went to, and got this letter? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now, my Lord, I mean to produce in evidence, this letter -(Here Mr. Knapp contended against the admissibility of the letter, the prisoner having been six weeks in custody before it was found, and there being no admission of the contents of the letter, though there was an admission of the superscription.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, (on the same side). My Lord, I remember there were papers offered in evidence in this Court upon the trials of Mr. Hardy, Mr. Tooke, and Mr. Thelwall, for high treason, which appeared to have been found some days subsequent to the apprehension of the prisoners, and though they were able to prove the handwriting of persons connected with the conspiracy charged. and whose hand-writing they had proved in the course of those trials, yet, as they were not discovered till after they were apprehended, those papers were rejected, for this reason, that papers not proved to have existed prior to their apprehension, could not be charged upon them. - To apply that to the present case, I ask how it is possible to say, that a letter that did not arrive till some weeks after the prisoner was apprehended, can affect him? Your Lordship fees this is not seeking to affect the prisoner, by any act of his own, or of any person in connection with him in the conspiracy, but the act of a person residing in a foreign country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashburst. I look upon it it is not an impossible thing that a letter arriving after a man has been arrested, and in custody, may be good evidence, according to the snape in which it is put; as to what may be the case in the present instance, I know not what the defence of the prisoner is, but this I know, there is a letter comes addressed to him, which by possibility may throw light upon the subject; this letter comes to him by the post, it is shewn to him, and he says he knows the hand-writing; I cannot see why that should not be received.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140098"></xptr>Mr. Justice Rooke. Supposing a letter sent after the man is in custody, and it is found upon his person, have you a doubt that that letter would not be good evidence; and where is the difference?(The letter and the Bank note produced.)</p>
               <p>ELIAS BUZAGLO sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Look at that paper, is that your translation of the French letter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a faithful translation? - A. As far as I am competent; and I have sworn very frequently to my translations before the Lord-Mayor, and other Justices.(It is read).</p>
               <p>Addressed Mons. Huet, Wardour-street, No. 10, Oxford-Road, London, dated Altona. 22d Nov. 1797.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for you and for myself that you have met with such bad success in the affair wherewith I charged you; I nevertheless hoped that it would procure me some succour - it is done, it is no more to be relied on. Tell me, then, why they have given 5l. sterling to your friend, having found effects of no value, and in which he had no right, he had nothing to claim; I confess to you that all this appears to me very extraordinary. I have no such goods as you require of me; I have now a pretty considerable quantity left of those, where of you have had samples; I believe that it is actually impossible to dispose of them now, it is only a few of the skilful, who, when they have good merchandize by them, can attempt to make a good stroke; besides, I shall not purchase them, but with money. I am pressed by wants without number, I have extansted all my resources, I am in want of every thing; I hear no news from any person; I know not how to act, or what will become of me. If Mr. Duberdour is in London, you will do well to take out of his hands what I have procured in your name at Brussels. Do you know a Mr. Bray, who is charged with the government of the police of foreigness? This gentleman is from Angolene; he is the son of a baker, he is the brother-in-law of Loton, the attorney; I have frequently seen him at Brussels; if you can see him, and inform yourself of his address; if he is in want of any person, and I can be employed in the Tennis Court, as my countryman, it may be useful to me, perhaps. I am in such misery, that there is nothing that I would not undertake; notwithstanding I am convinced you have not acted sincerely towards me; I still give way to a sentiment, of which I was always the dupe to you. You will find enclosed a bill of 25l. Remember, be very prudent and circumspect in your conduct; do not expose yourself, in making the most of them, whatever be your situation; but do not forget that I am very unhappy, and contrive to send me something. Prove to me that you have a desire to oblige me. I hope that you will not be indisposed at the receipt of my letter, and that you will answer me as speedily as possible."</p>

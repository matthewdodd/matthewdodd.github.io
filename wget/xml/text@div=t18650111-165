He frequently leaves bonds without having a cheque immediately; we may have a large account with a man—the cheque that is received must be a cheque that goes through the clearing-house—a cheque uncrossed would, of course, do as well—the time for the deli<lb></lb>very of the stock is up to half-past 2; it must be delivered by half-past 2—the cheques are cleared before 5—they must go into the banker's before 4—my clerk took this cheque in the ordinary way of business—he did not bring it to me—he paid it in, in the course of business—it was after<lb></lb>wards returned dishonoured.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> urged that the act was to be regarded as simultaneous, that dominion I over the bonds was never parted with until the cheque was received; in the same way as a tradesman would place his goods on the counter before he was paid for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Baker—on the evening of 14th October, I went to the railway-station at Charing-cross—I was familiar with the appearance of the prisoner—I saw him at the Charing-cross station on the 14th October, about six minutes past 8—the mail train for Dover was going at half-past 8—the prisoner did not present his usual appearance when I saw him then—he had taken his beard off, and shaved his whiskers, and he also wore a wig—when I first saw him I thought he was the man, but looking at him a second time, I thought there was some little difference which I could not account for—I got into the carriage where he was, extended my hand to him, and said, "How do you do, Burrows?"—he extended his hand, and shook hands with me—there was a lady with him in the carriage—I said that he had done wrong, and that he must come with me—he said he had done wrong, and he should not make any resistance—he and the lady got out of the carriage—I got his luggage out of the van, and I asked him for his keys, which he gave me—I examined his boxes, to see if there were any bonds there; but found done—the luggage was labelled for Paris—I then took him in a cab to Bow-street—the lady went also—I did not give him in charge then—from there we went to the Great Northern railway-station—he told me that the stock was with his brother at Shenley<lb></lb>hill, about six miles from Barnet-station—we all three went there, and got to his brother's about half-past 10 at night, or a little later, perhaps—his brother was at home—to the best of my belief, the prisoner said to him, "The bonds that I gave you this afternoon to take care of for me, with orders to bring up to the office to-morrow, I now request you to deliver to this gentleman"—the brother left the room, and immediately afterwards came in with a parcel; it contained certain bonds—this is the paper that was with the securities—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "5, 000 Passives, 3, 000 cotton loan, 3, 000 Turkish consolidated bonds, 5, 000 Mexican, 25 Ottoman Bank shares, and 20 Ottoman Bank shares")—the then value of those altogether is stated at 6, 980<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had not carried out the items quite correctly; it was at that time within 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of 6, 980<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had put down the price; but he had not carried them out correctly—the arithmetic was wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose 1 may take it, that Confederate bonds would be very saleable on the continent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt they would—I be<lb></lb>lieve they were originally brought out at Frankfort—I think the prisoner stated to me on the way to Barnet that he had delivered the bonds to his brother to be taken up to the office on the following morning—I believe he said that his Stock-Exchange creditors would naturally call at his office—he did not tell me that his brother had instructions to deliver those bonds to his creditors on the following morning; nothing to that effect—he said that he was going to leave the country, because he did not wish to be declared a defaulter in London—as a matter of fact those bonds were divided amongst the gentlemen who had originally handed them to the prisoner—he did not propose that; he did not oppose it—he gave the bonds up.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was for that purpose; that they should be given to the creditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Realized for the benefit of the creditors; the proceeds di<lb></lb>divided among them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The only case left by the Recorder to the Jury was that of Mr. Heseltine upon the evidence of Mr. Lancey; and as to this, the Jury found that Mr. Lancey gave him, and intended to give him, the ordinary credit of the Stock</hi>

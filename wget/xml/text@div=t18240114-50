            . I am an officer. On the 2d of January, about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, I was fetched. Mr. Barnard sent for the prisoner to come to the counting-house, and asked him if he had any idea of any person having taken silver polishings; he said, No. Mr. Barnard then gave him in charge. I searched him, and found the polishings in his breeches pocket; he said it was his own, that a man gave it to him. I asked, what man; he said,</p>
               <p>"You have taken me unawares, I cannot tell you." Mr. Barnard examined it, and found these tickets, with his initials, among it.</p>

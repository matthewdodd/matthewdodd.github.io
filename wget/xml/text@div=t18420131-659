                  </hi>. I am a. labourer, and live in Rosemary-lane. On the 10th of January, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was on Tower-hill—there was a great crowd of people listening to a man sing<lb></lb>ing—I saw the prosecutrix standing close by me hearing the singing—I saw the prisoner go and lift up the bottom of her gown, put his hand in, and pull out a bag—he directly started, and ran away—I immediately ran after him, and said, "You rascal, you drop that"—he threw the bag down,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. I was on duty on Tower<lb></lb>hill on Monday, the 10th of January, about twenty minutes, or half-past two o'clock—I saw the prisoner running from Postern-row towards Tower-street, and a number of people after him, crying "Stop thief"—I ran, and came up with the prisoner in White Hart-court, into which he turned out of Tower-street—I took him into custody, and as I was taking him towards the station, the prosecutrix and Sadler came up—the prose<lb></lb>cutrix had this black bag in her hand, and said, "This is the money that was stolen"—Sadler said, in the prisoner's presence, that he saw the pri<lb></lb>soner take the bag from the prosecutrix's pocket, and run away—I do not know what reply the prisoner made, but when I first took him, he said he had done nothing—I examined the contents of the bag at the station—</p>

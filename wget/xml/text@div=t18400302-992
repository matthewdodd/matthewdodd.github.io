                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Greenwich-road, the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the habit of coming to my shop. On the 16th of February I missed a quartern and a half of flour—I sent for a policeman—I marked one small bag and one large one—on Tuesday night, when I went to bed, I left one quartern, and fifteen half-quarterns of flour, on a shelf, and on Wednesday morning I missed two half-quarterns, one marked and one unmarked—I sent for the policeman, and went with him to the prisoner's house—I stopped a little on one side—he knocked at the door, went in, and called me—we found the bag of flour here produced—this is not worked, but it is mine—I know it by the doing up of it, and we found some pieces of bag on the floor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 182.) The prosecutor sent for me on the 19th of February—I went to the prisoner's and found this bag of floor—as we were returning from the Magistrate's, the prosecutor said he was not satisfied, we went to the prisoner's house again, and he found this marked bag, empty, in a drawer.</p>

Q.</hi> When you went first to the house with the prose<lb></lb>cutor did you not search to find a marked bag? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I could not—we took the prisoner to the Magistrate—he said the evidence was insuffi<lb></lb>cient, and he would remand her, and before the prisoner got home, the prosecutor went to her house to get the linen she had to wash, and there he found this marked bag in a drawer in the front-room—that was the room in which we at first found the bag of flour—I did not then look where this marked bag was—it was in a drawer of an old chest of drawers, as it ap<lb></lb>peared to me—I did not take notice when I first went, as I saw a paper had been torn up, and I said to the prosecutor, "It is in rain to look for a bag."</p>

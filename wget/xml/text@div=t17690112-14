On Monday the 5th of December, in the evening, between six and seven, I was going from the office thro' the Green-park, towards Lord Bath's gate. A little before I came to the bason of water, at the top of the park, I saw a man coming towards me; and I saw another a little behind him: the first came past me on my left hand, he looked very hard at me, and I at him. I looked over my shoulder to see if he was gone; he was turned back again, coming towards me on my right side; I said, What do you want? he made no answer: I had a small stick in my hand, I struck back at him; it did not hurt him much. He ran in upon me; and while we were in the scuffle, the other man came behind me, and pulled me back in the mirey clay, by the side of the gravel walk: as soon as they got me down, the man that attacked me first, held a pistol to my face, and said, If you make any noise, I'll blow your brains out; they were all the words he said: they pulled my watch out of my pocket, and took out of my pocket a guinea in gold, and 15 s. in silver; I said, if you take my watch, pray don't use me ill. They then made off cross the field towards the Grove; I got up as soon as possible, and found they had got my hat; I called after them, and said, Pray leave me my hat; they threw me my hat again. I went to see for the keeper of the Lodge, but he was not at home. I went then home, and washed myself, being a little bloody; and then went and gave information of it to Sir

On the 9th of December, the prisoner, with another man, brought this watch to me; I should know the other man if I saw him, he was a corporal in the guards. The prisoner pledg'd it as his own property; he said, he had been inlisted but a fortnight, and he had spent all the advance money, and wanted to raise more upon his watch. I then lent him only half a guinea; the next day, they came together again, and I lent them half a guinea more. About a week after that,

I was taken up three weeks ago, last Tuesday, that was eight days after, by one Jones, for a highway robbery; then I directly told Sir John Fielding this story. I belong to the second battalion, and the prisoner to the first. He was quartered in the Tower at the time we did this.</p>

               <p>Rees. No. There were a couple of corporals used to give him leave to go out, and go on this way; and when we had done any robbery, we used to give them four or six shillings. Corporal Hudson used to lend the prisoner his coat, and he has got it on now.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Woodworth, Leeches Alley, Church Street, Greenwich—between 7 and 8 o'clock on the night of 4th August I was at the back of the Ship Tavern, Greenwich—I heard there was a man dying on the pavement—there was a crowd there—I saw the three prisoners close to me—Mahoney put his hands on my shoulders, and I felt Harris catch hold of my chain, it was round my neck, as it is now—I told Harris not to do that again, to keep his hands away from my neck, and the moment afterwards I missed my purse—I turned round to see if they were there, and they had gone—the purse was inside my dress before—I spoke to a constable, and went to the police-station, and saw my purse and its contents, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and four duplicates—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

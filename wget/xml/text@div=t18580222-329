                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then how do you explain the difference between that amount and the 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which you allege as the actual deficiency? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In this manner: if you take down the figures as I state them, I think I may make it quite clear—it has already been shown that the pay of officers charged, and not paid, as we say, is, including hospital expenses, 7,325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; then we take from that the sum that he has overcharged himself, which is said to be 2,605<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not made out the account in that way myself; that leaves 4,604<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. overcharged; then there is a sum that he must have credit for, which is the balance he debits in his first account—I give him credit for 3,049<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the difference is 912<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But what is the balance that he states? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The fact is, that the statement I have made out, is made out in quite a different manner; therefore, you must excuse me if I am not quite clear, but I have no doubt of the general result; he has overcharged a sum of 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, which he has never paid; if you deduct from that 4,604<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he has charged himself with and never received, that leaves 2,630<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his credit; no, against him—there is an essential difference between our claims upon him, for what we have paid him, and what he credits himself with having received in the estimates; we show that we paid him actual bills, drawn by him, drafts to a certain amount, he credits estimates only.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But assuming that he has not paid a farthing of the 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd for which he takes credit, is he then indebted on a balance of account, according to your statement, 2,636<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; whereas, if you have given the figures accurately, it ought to be 1,322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The account is so compli<lb></lb>cated in all its details, and the manner in which it is made out, that I should find it very difficult to do what you require me to do; I can only say that it does not appear <hi rend="italic">prime facie</hi> on the statement.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MONTAGUE CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you first gave him notice that you intended to proceed in the Court of Exchequer to bring him to account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of that—I do not know the precise date at which the matter was referred to the solicitor; in April, 1857, the solicitor was engaged in a correspondence—I now say that our real demand, on the most favourable view of the accounts for the paymaster, is 1,322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as a cash balance—we have not excepted two or three sums which he debited himself with, which has caused the small difference between the 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and the 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—the balance never stood even in any quarter—the last two quarters he was decidedly in excess—at one time, on the face of the account, he was in advance of the public, that was at the beginning of his career—he did not always send in vouchers; a great many were not sent—the audit passed through two or three hands—I was not personally the auditor at the time; it passed through the hands of the juniors in the department to which militia accounts were allotted—when the first quarterly account was sent in I had not anything to do with it, except to record the amount in the books of the office, and the same with the four other accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then nobody attempted to audit or inquire, until after the last account was sent in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they did; a clerk in the War Office, of the name of Stillwell—he is not one of the witnesses for this prosecution—three or four persons were engaged in going through these five quarterly accounts; one of them is here, Mr. Sidney Kirby, a son of mine—the first pay list in March was declared to by Captain De Tessier—the first account which the prisoner signed begins with a balance—I have got the account which Captain De Tessier sent in—the course of business with respect to these quarterly accounts is anterior to the money being paid, to make what is called a monthly estimate of the probably expenditure required during each month—that is the proper mode of proceeding—the monthly estimates are here—three monthly estimates are sent in every quarter, and a supplementary one, if necessary—the army agent sends in a quarterly account to the War Office; we give them a printed form; that is a very different form from these, a very simple form compared to these—these printed forms for the quarterly accounts are supplied from the War Office; there are twenty-eight forms, all bound in one volume—the captain of each company pays the men, and he is intrusted with money by the paymaster to do so at the end of each month; he is bound to balance</p>

               <p>his account with the paymaster, and the paymaster adopts the charges, and introduces them into his pay list—a form is provided for the purpose of getting the acquittance of the captain each month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is a large sum of 7,235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. taken credit for, as having been paid to captains and others, which was never paid; but after all the balance now claimed is only 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; there must have been some over payments made by the prisoner on other accounts, or the balance would be larger. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he over debits himself, as has been already proved, for the drafts under the name of estimates, and that stands to his credit, and is withdrawn on the other side—he did not receive the sum that was to be paid to the officers, it is only an estimate; an estimate is sent in to justify the paymaster in drawing at all—he claimed to a very large, extent beyond what he wanted, therefore he was always in a condition to draw more public money than he could want—he might have drawn much more than he did—he might have drawn to the whole extent of the 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but as soon as his quarterly pay list came in, it would have been seen what a large balance he had—it was in his power to do so, no doubt, for a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see here that he is required to make a statement of sums paid to officers, as shown by the abstracts and monthly pay lists; where do the abstracts and monthly pay lists come from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The officers prepare them, and hand them to the paymaster at the end of the month, and there is an account current between them, which is adjusted every month—he takes the amount from what the officers hand to him, in order to get their receipt—the proper course of business is, almost immediately after the quarterly account is delivered, for some person to examine, and then send to the paymaster what is called an abstract of examination it is very desirable that it should be done as soon possible after the quarterly account is sent in; it is the ordinary practice, but it was very much inter<lb></lb>rupted during the Russian war—the duty of the examiner is, to take the abstract, and to put down his objections—there are printed forms, in order that all that may be done—every single charge that is objected to, is to be entered in the abstract of examination, and then the paymaster, having that called to his attention, is called upon to answer the objections, and to return it, so that it may be seen whether he has answered them, and whether his answers will be allowed—no abstract of examination was sent, in this case, until the receipt of the last pay list; after his last account was sent in, he would receive five abstracts of examination; he would have to go back through all those five abstracts of examination, to see whether he could answer the queries and objections—the burden would be thrown upon him, of correcting the errors in all the five accounts—he would not have to alter the figures in his accounts, but he would have to say yea or nay, whether it was correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose, not being a good accountant, he had entered a sum of money on the wrong side, or entered it twice over, and that pervaded all the accounts, he must make the correction or allowance in all the accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—in the third quarterly account he charges against himself 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for income tax; he debits himself with that amount in the Dec. pay list—he also charged the pay short of that, but in the next quarter he resumes the charge; he corrects it—that is noticed in the abstract of examination; that was after the whole of the accounts were sent in, I am not aware that it was noticed before—his quarterly debits consisted, generally, of the three monthly esti<lb></lb>mates; the estimate is made about the middle of the month preceding, but the money to be credited is not the estimate, but the draft—there is nothing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185802220050"></xptr>
               <p>for estimates but the pay of officers; and there is his solemn declaration that he paid it—he both credited and debited himself upon estimates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want an explanation of this: I see here, "To pay of officers, after deducting income tax, to be accounted for by the agent;" does the agent send in any account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The system, with regard to the pay of officers, is rather peculiar; the agent makes out one annual account, in which he charges all the pay of officers, name by name; that is done to prevent a double charge between the paymaster and the agent—the agent would have to charge and account for the 1,291<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in this first account—in form No. 11, you will find a statement of the stoppages for men in hospital; that is, where he debits himself with stoppages; and where he credits himself, he must produce the account, to prove that he paid it, and if it was a wrong charge, it would be struck out—if there had been time to follow the proper course of business, we should have gone regularly through the account, quarter after quarter, and called upon him to produce his vouchers, and have seen which way the true balance was—he would not have to pay up that balance at the end of each quarter; he would have to carry it forward to the next quarter, as a debit against him or a credit on his side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what I understand you is, that there is a running account between the paymaster and the War Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is limited to a very small sum, regularly; it is limited by taking exception to any charges that appear to be improper, or where there are not vouchers produced—we point out the sums which are incorrect, and he corrects them in a future pay list; the balance goes on from quarter to quarter—I have had a very long experience in these regimental accounts—occasionally, young men go into the army as paymasters; in "the Line," it is usual to have a man already a soldier, an officer; but in the militia, you cannot get that—in the army, they are gene<lb></lb>rally old captains, and gentlemen who have given their attention to accounts; but in the militia you cannot get that, and are obliged to resort to persons who have not had experience; we are obliged to take the recommendation of the Lord Lieutenant of the county, he appoints; we have scarcely any option in the matter, except we know something against the character of the party—I have never seen any account so irregular as this—the agent pays the officers—the agent sends in quarterly accounts—I have compared the defend<lb></lb>ant's quarterly accounts with the agent's; they are usually examined with the pay list; that is done in a branch of the office which I now superintend—these accounts have very much the appearance of having been prepared by a man who does not understand the proper way of preparing accounts—the paymaster is responsible; he may commit it to whom he likes; a pay sergeant might help him—in the regiments of the line, undoubtedly, there would be sergeants more experienced than in the militia—it would be the business of a young man to make himself acquainted with the accounts, if he accepts the appointment—I do not know whether the charge originally made against the defendant, at Bow Street, was for embezzling 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was not there then—I have stated that 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the amount of his deficiency; I have explained the way in which I account for the difference between that amount and the 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he became a clear defaulter in the quarter ending March, 1856; I mean, there was then a balance against him of 1,322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

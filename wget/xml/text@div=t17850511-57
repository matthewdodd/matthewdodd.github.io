               <p>Did you see her throw it away before the candle was put out? - Yes, I called out for assistance and a light, because I had no light with me; a light was brought me by another lodger, she flung away a little jam and skirt, this was all that was done this evening, she told me the things that were taken, and gave me some duplicates; I took her down stairs, she denied it at first, and after a while she confessed she had taken more things, then she said, if I would not hurt her, I should have half a crown a week, I said, I would not do it; she confessed several articles particularly one, I made her no promises.</p>

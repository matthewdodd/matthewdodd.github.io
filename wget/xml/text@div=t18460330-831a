                  </hi>. I went into Mile-end workhouse, on the 12th of March—I found the prisoner there when I went in—I had never known him before—while I was in bed I heard him say he had lost some things—next day I was in the yard and he came up to me, and asked where his things were—I after<lb></lb>wards went to make water—he followed me and asked where his things were—I told him I did not know—he called me a d—d liar, and said, "You b—r if you don't give me my things I will have your life"—he took up the iron key that turns the water on, and struck me on the head, and on the arm—my head was cut about two inches and a half—a doctor has seen it.</p>

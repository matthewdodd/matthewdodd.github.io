                  </hi>. I live in Pell-street. I lived in the adjoining room to the prisoner—on Friday, the 4th of June, at six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner sitting on the stairs crying—she tried to get into her room, but could not, as her door was locked—she went out and came in again—her husband had not returned—he came home at nine in the morning—she came up stairs in a few minutes after, went in-doors, and went to bed—her husband went out again, and returned between five and six in the evening—as he was approaching their room door, she caught hold of him by the collar of his smock frock, and knocked him down—he was intoxicated, and in pulling him he fell on his back in the room—it was on the second floor, at the top of the stairs—I was in my room at the time, and could see what passed—when he was on his back on the floor, she hit him with her open hand on his head—she said something, but I did not hear what it was at that moment—he got up, and they were very quiet for pretty well half an hour—she then went out and brought in a pint of beer—I do not know who drank it—he afterwards came to the door, and stood there about three minutes—she then came behind him, put her two hands to his back between his shoulders, and threw him out on the stairs—he was still intoxicated then—he laid on the stairs—I called for assistance—nobody came—he laid on the first step of the stairs across—his head was to<lb></lb>wards our stairs, on the first step, and his feet towards his own door—he was lying on his belly—he laid against the side of the stairs, not against the edge—he was a short, heavy, stout man—his nose or mouth bled, I do not know which—he fell forward on the side of his face—I saw blood about his cheek—he did not lay there above three or four minutes before the policeman came—I saw him taken up—he was then dead—he was dead before they came—when the prisoner pushed him down, she said she would kill him—I did not hear them quarrelling before she did this—when he came in he never spoke to her—as far as I saw this was done without any provocation—he did not know she was coming—his back was towards her, and his face to<lb></lb>wards our door—he never moved after he fell—he did not fall down any stairs—he fell across the step of the next flight going up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> This person has been quarrelling with me, and so have the other witnesses—she does not know what passed between my husband and me in the room—I had no intention to hurt my husband—I was always too fond of him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> They used to fight very much—I have lived in the house about two years—she has lived there about a twelvemonth—they were always fighting and quarrelling—I lived in the opposite room to them—it was while she was pushing her husband that she said she would kill him, and after he laid on the stairs she came out and kicked him—I never quarrelled with the prisoner—I always obliged her with every thing she wanted, that laid in my power—when intoxicated she has often in<lb></lb>sulted me.</p>

                  </hi>. I resided in the same house with the prisoner and her husband, one story lower. About six o'clock on the evening in ques<lb></lb>tion, I was at home when the prisoner's husband returned—I heard a few words pass between them—I think they were angry words—I heard her say, "I wish you were dead"—that was about half an hour before this happened—they were quarrelling—I was afterwards standing at the oppo<lb></lb>site door to the prisoner's, at work—I could see their room door—I saw the man come to the door—he stood there a few minutes—she came be<lb></lb>hind him, put her hands on his back, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him forward with all her force—I did not hear her say any thing at the time—I was at the door<lb></lb>post—the stairs were between us—I could see distinctly all that happened—he fell with his feet out at his own door, and his head on the first stair of the next flight of stairs—there are four stairs go up each side, and a little bit of landing parts them—he was not sober—he never spoke more—he breathed three times—I did not see any blood till he was picked up, I then saw some, and a piece of bread in his hand—I did not see what part of his face he was bleeding from—he was picked up in less than five minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to this man—I found him lying on the stairs, as described: when I raised him up there was about a pint of coagulated blood upon the stairs; I observed a number of bruises and cuts about the head, which were the consequence of one fall; there was an abrasion on the upper part of the head, a contused wound on the left eyebrow, about half an inch in extent, a contusion on the left side of the lower lip; the bones of the nose were fractured, and the nose was driven on one side; those were the principal injuries which I observed, all of which might have happened by a man falling on his face on one stair—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination in the morning; I ex-amined</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140123"></xptr>
               <p>the throat, and found the cartilages of the windpipe, which were ossified, driven back towards the neck; the seventh bone of the neck was fractured, driven somewhat forward, and a portion of the body of the spine splintered or chipped off, and held on merely by the surrounding soft parts—in my judgment, those injuries were quite sufficient to cause death—the immediate cause of death was the pressure on the windpipe, producing immediate suffocation, the cartilages being driven together, and no passage left for the air—I have not the least doubt his death was occasioned by this fall.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a long defence, stated, that the witnesses were abusing her, and her husband was going to speak to them about it; that she laid hold of his frock, to prevent him, when he obstinately pulled himself forward, and fell.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> She made use of some expression, but I am doubtful as to the precise tenor, I did not pay much attention to what she said—when we went to her room the door was fastened inside—I had known the deceased during his life, and was in the habit of seeing him; when in liquor he was very obstinate, and I think it very probable, having previously quarrelled, he might, on her attempting to pull him back, very obstinately get away from her; I recollect attending him on one occasion under a state of excitement, and he was of a peculiarly obstinate, stubborn disposition—the stairs are very peculiar, almost perpendicular; there are four steps leading to one room, and four to the opposite room, with one four step for a landing.</p>

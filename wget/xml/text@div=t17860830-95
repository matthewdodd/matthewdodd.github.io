               <p>Did you hear either of them say they would fight no more? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the witness Westgarth in liquor or sober? - I cannot rightly say; Harrison was much in liquor; Westgarth not so much; he was not drunk; he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Was Westgarth sober? - I think he was.</p>
               <p>Did either of them appear to be much hurt by this fighting? - I cannot say, because Harrison had been much beat and bruised before he began to fight with Stone; he had been beat in the building; he had been fighting before with one Walters, not with the prisoners.</p>

               <p>I saw nothing of the quarrel; I was up in the buildings; about three I went in at Somerset-house, and I saw the joiner stripping to fight with the deceased, and he struck him several blows on the staircase; the deceased bled considerably.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did the joiner strike the deceased? - About the head and face, Harrison's lip was cut, and his face bloody; he was bruised in his face that was with another man, neither of the prisoners.</p>

               <p>I was at the Coach and Horses the 24th of July; I went in about half after five; I heard they had been fighting; I went into the room; they appeared to have been bleeding, and Harrison had a swelled lip; I staid a little while, and some words arose between Harrison and Stone, and they agreed to fight, and they did fight in the room.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect who began the words? - No, I do not, in a few minutes they were parted.</p>
               <p>Did either of them appear to he much hurt? - Harrison appeared to be hurt the most; his lip was much swelled, and his nose bled a great deal.</p>
               <p>He appeared to be bruised before that? - Yes; after that Mr. Neale and the deceased had some words and they fought.</p>
               <p>Which of them began that dispute? - I do not recollect; they were both agreeable to go to fighting, it was agreed to fight in the court.</p>
               <p>Did they? - They did go out into the court; I stopped in the house six or seven minutes; I would not go out; I went out then; they were fighting; I left them fighting; I saw no particulars; I was fourteen feet from them; I saw no more, and who began the quarrel I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>I live in the court; when I first went up; the noise brought me out; I saw two men fighting; Neale and the deceased; Harrison appeared to have been down; he staggered, and bled at the noise; his lip was thick; he appeared to be fuddled, or badly beat, or both; the prisoner Neale and he, as far as I can remember, closed together, and fell down, and I think Harrison was undermost; the prisoner then turned, and was on his hands and knees, and seemed bleeding much; I know Neale; I knew the other by sight; it was not Stone; they wished the man to get up again; and asked him if he would fight any more.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - I think he said, yes; I said, he should not; I thought he was fuddled, and would be killed; I wished to take him away, but the other people said, he should not; I do not remember hearing either of the prisoners open their mouths; I took him up, and was taking him to the pump to wash him, and he fell down, but whether he was struck down or pushed down, or tripped up, I cannot say, but he fell from me, I cannot speak with certainty by whom; it was behind me, he fell down; I believe they asked him if he would fight any more, and I think he said, yes; I cannot speak with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300143"></xptr> any precision afterwards; my wife hearing there were some words, between the other joiner and me, she endeavoured to get me away, and I endeavoured to push her away, and I asked them what they would do with the man, as I understood they had been beating him before.</p>

               <p>I live in the court, I saw them coming into the court, and the deceased seemed to be very much beaten, or very much in liquor, or both; as he came into the court, he was either pushed down or fell down; I did not see distinctly; I saw Neale and Harrison come into the court stripped to fight.</p>
               <p>Did they fight? - They did; the deceased seemed very incapable of fighting, either by being very much beat, or by being in liquor; I saw a great number of unfair blows struck by Neale, striking him when he was down, and coming behind, before he was ready to fight.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you saw him strike him when he was down? - I am sure I did; I was at a one pair of stairs window all the time; I had been exceeding ill for three or four days, and I asked my wife to let me go down, but she locked the door for fear I should get into any trouble; I could not bear to see the foul play; I saw the man after, he had many blows; Mr. Rutherford went to attempt to take him away, but he could not; I saw one of the joiners or carpenters strike at Mr. Rutherford; but he did not strike him, and his wife came and got him away; then the deceased came up the court, holding his hands before his eyes, and Mr. Neale came behind, and struck him, and knocked him down in the court with a very violent blow; he had a very violent fall backwards with his head to the ground; I said to my wife, the man's scull is fractured, let me go down, but she would not; the others said, Mr. Neale, you seemed more to blame than him.</p>
               <p>Who were the others? - I know none of their names.</p>
               <p>Was any blow struck after this blow? - I do not think there was; the man got up and went to the bottom of the court, and rested his head, and bled for ten minutes before any body came to him; the deceased fell with his face to the ground by that blow; there were several women that saw the same, and said, it was a shameful fight as ever they saw.</p>


               <p>Mr. Silvester. Are you a bit of a boxer yourself? - I do not know; I do not like fighting; it is rather too hard work; but if I am too much imposed upon, I do not like that.</p>

               <p>I am an apothecary; I saw the deceased on the Friday following this affray; I was called to him on the Wednesday first; I did not see in what state he was on the Wednesday; I understood he was under the care of some young man, some sea surgeon; on the Friday I was called to him, and attended him to his death.</p>
               <p>What state did you find him in on the Friday? - He was in a very violent delirium and fever; a very strong delirium.</p>
               <p>Did you examine whether he had any wounds or bruises, or what that fever had been occasioned by? - The next day I had his head shaved in order to apply a blister to his head; that was on the Saturday; I examined his head, and there was a slight wound on the back of his head, but there appeared no considerable bruise, but one near his eye; there was some blackness; extravasation, but of little consequence; the wound did not appear to me to be dangerous; for my own satisfaction as well as for that of the deceased's friends, I called in a surgeon of eminence, Mr. Minors the father was called in, who examined his head with me; I was rather of his opinion before; that strengthened my opinion.</p>
               <p>What was the opinion you formed of that man's case? - My opinion is very doubtful, as to the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Are you of opinion that the fever and the delirium were occasioned by the wounds and bruises he received? - That is doubtfull to me; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300144"></xptr>Have you any clue to lead you to any other cause of the fever? - Only what I understood from the friends of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Did you examine whether there were any other considerable bruises about his person? - I did not.</p>
               <p>The man was not in a state himself to give you an account of his complaints? - Not at all, from the time I saw him he was very delirious, and continued so.</p>
               <p>When did he die? - On the Monday following, I think.</p>
               <p>Have you a real doubt in your mind what that fever was occasioned by? - There is a probability it might be occasioned from intoxication, from passion, from anger; or it might be from the falls he received; it is very doubtful to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I take the case to be that the cause of the death must be proved and drawn from a variety of circumstances; the Court are to form their judgment from the evidence they have heard, and if they are of opinion that the death arose from the ill usage given by that prisoner at the bar, certainly the fact is proved; the fact is to be proved from the result of all the evidence, duly weighed and adjudged upon by the Jury, the Jury are to judge for themselves; suppose a surgeon was to say, where it was manifestly clear that the injury was the occasion of the death, that he was of opinion it was not; is that to blind the Jury? they are not to be hood-winked or blinded; though not persons of professional skill, they are endued with common sense; therefore if they, on the whole of the evidence, are of opinion that the death arose from the prisoner, there is the proof of the fact; the charge in the indictment is certainly murder, but as to the mode of proving it, there is no certain rule laid down in that case any more than in any other; it arises from the whole of the evidence, upon which the Jury are to exercise their judgment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. I am very happy to have the opinion and assistance of one of the most able and experienced judges of the law in England; I have no doubt that that fact or any other, may be collected, either from positive testimony, or any other evidence; for instance, if a man is knocked down, his scull fractured, and his brains coming out at the time, I want no surgeon in such a case.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to have Mr. Minors here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Surgeons are called only to assist your judgment, they are not the people to determine this or any other case; you are to exercise your own judgment.</p>

               <p>I knew the deceased Harrison; I was very intimate with him.</p>
               <p>Did you know him on the 24th of July? - I lodged in the next room to him; he was as well as ever I knew him to be; he appeared to me to be in perfect health before that day.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to see him at all, in the morning of the 26th of July? - No, Sir, I did not, he went to work at six o'clock, but the day before, he was in good health, I did not see him that evening, but I saw him the next morning.</p>
               <p>In what condition was he the next morning? - Most dreadfully bruised and cut.</p>
               <p>Where did he principally appear to be bruised? - In his face and head; on the Friday morning following he was taken with a delirium, between two and three in the morning; it was on the Tuesday morning I saw him; I saw him once or twice after, but not to ask him any questions.</p>
               <p>Did he from the Tuesday morning keep his bed? - Yes Sir, he was never out of the room to my knowledge, from the time he came home, till he was carried out.</p>
               <p>When did he die? - On the Monday evening following.</p>
               <p>When you saw him first on the Tuesday morning, were several bruises visible then?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300145"></xptr> - Several, particularly about his body; I had an opportunity of seeing his stomach, when his shirt was open, and he was very cruelly bruised.</p>
               <p>Did the bruises that were visible about his head and face, disappear before his death? - No, Sir, they looked worse and worse, he looked abundantly worse when he was dead than before; I was present when Mr. Gadd was there; I called Mr. Gadd; I was present when his head was shaved; it appeared to me that his wounds were the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>I want to ask you the facts that you saw; Mr. Gadd tells us that he saw only one wound upon the head, and one bruise on his face; was the appearance the same to you? - There was one wound when the head was shaved, that was not visible to me before, on the back of the head; I think there was a bruise under one of his ears, and one of his eyes.</p>
               <p>Were there any other bruises visible? - His lip was cut very much.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Gadd. In the examination of his head, you spoke only of one wound? - There was a wound on the back part of the head, and a contusion on the temple near the eye; I do not recollect seeing any more wounds; I did not examine the body at all; his head was not opened in my presence.</p>
               <p>Court. From that blow, though the outward wound might not be mortal, may not a violent blow produce a concussion of the brain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not the back part of the head, a likely place to produce that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does not a concussion of the brain frequently remain for a considerable time after the blow happened, without any dangerous symptoms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then is not the first symptom, that of a strong delirium? - There are generally some lethargic disposition, by the pressure on the brain; he appeared to be sensible on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>In case of a concussion of the brain, would he be likely to be free from those symptoms, from the Monday to the Friday? - From the blow I have heard described, I should hardly think it possible.</p>
               <p>Was there any lethargic symptoms on the Friday? - He was so exceedingly delirious, there was no forming a judgment.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Berry. Do you know whether the deceased slept much from the blow till his death? - He did not appear to sleep sound, he appeared as if he were asleep, but at the same time he could listen to every thing that was said, though not sensible to give an answer to the questions that were asked him.</p>

               <p>Did you make that examination? - I did.</p>
               <p>Relate in what state you found the body? - I was called in on a Friday, he died on a Monday.</p>


               <p>Court to Mr. Wilson. When was the day of examination? - On Wednesday the 2d of August, the surgeon was called in then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vickery. I do not recollect the day.</p>
               <p>In what state did you find the body of the deceased then? - I found several bruises on the back part of the head, and one wound quite through the scalp of the scull.</p>
               <p>Was it a large wound? - Not very large.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any other bruises about him? - There were some on his neck and back.</p>
               <p>Any on his face? - I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Did you observe or examine his breast or stomach? - There were none; the wounds and bruises were on his head.</p>
               <p>Did you examine and search for any fracture of the scull? - There was no fracture.</p>
               <p>Did you make a compleat examination of the scull? - No.</p>
               <p>Why not? - I cannot assign any particular reason why I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300146"></xptr>Is not it necessary in order to ascertain whether there had been an inward concussion of the brain that occasioned the death, to open the scull that would ascertain the fact? - Not always; it may.</p>
               <p>Then from the exterior and superficial examination that you made could you collect the cause of the man's death? - From having heard the previous symptoms -</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You must speak from the appearance? - From the appearance of the head, and my own observation, I should have thought it very probable that the man died of those blows, had I not heard of one symptom.</p>
               <p>But not certain, none of them that you could pronounce mortal? - Certainly not; oh, no! surely not.</p>
               <p>In addition to the inspection, the man having taken to his bed from the morning he received these bruises, and being seized with a strong delirium early on the Friday morning, joining these symptoms in addition to your inspection, what opinion should you have formed, as a medical man? - The very same opinion I had at first; that they were conjunctively a very probable cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You said something of one symptom? - If I had not heard any one of the previous symptoms, from the inspections merely I should have thought they were the cause of his death; I heard that he was delirious; I never saw him alive; I knew nothing more than what I heard from the man that keeps the house; my opinion is not altered by any symptoms I have heard, but rather confirmed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This case differs from that; in the dispute between Stone and the deceased, it does not appear that Neale was there; how then can he be aiding and assisting, if the Jury are of opinion that Neale gave the blows and not Stone; they appear to be in evidence two compleat separate and distinct transactions; then the question is, whether the blows and wounds charged to be given by Stone in this indictment can be transferred to Neale; or whether the blows given by Neale, Stone not being present, occasioned the death.</p>

               <p>What passed with Harrison? - Harrison called them a parcel of thieves; and through that a scuffle ensued between him and Stone; they had two or three falls, and Harrison kept Stone down by the hair of the head till he was released; then they got up again, then they were down again, till the matter was settled, and they left off fighting, then they sat down and drank together.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300147"></xptr>Did you see Neale and the deceased fight when they went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The deceased was pretty severely beaten by Neale, was not he? - No, I wished them not to fight; Neale was not able to stand against such a man as Harrison was.</p>
               <p>Was not Harrison in liquor? - They were all in liquor; Neale was in liquor; Neale was obligated to fight him, or else he would have licked him.</p>
               <p>Mind what you say? - My account is authentic, and the real truth; Neale did not wish to fight him; he would fight after the gentleman's servant had offered twenty guineas to fight; they said they would fight in another room.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that Neale did not beat Harrison very much when they fought without? - No, Sir, he did not beat him, what was hurt was through falls.</p>
               <p>Did not Neale strike him? - Undoubtedly, when they were fighting; he would have fought again; he never struck him to hurt him; I do not think he did; his hurt was through falling.</p>
               <p>Who gave him those falls? - Neale and he in scuffling fell down together, and he held down Neale by the hair of his head, and apparently would have smothered him; the blood gushed out of Harrison's face; that was through the falls I look upon it; when they fell there was no knowing which would fall to the ground first.</p>
               <p>Which had the better of the fight? - Harrison was too strong for Neale by much; if it had not been for the tumbling, and nobody knew which would fall first.</p>

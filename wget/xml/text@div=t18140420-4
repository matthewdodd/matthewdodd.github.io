               <p>Mr. Alley. Are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Mr. Ashley - A Yes, I have seen him write frequently. At the time I paid the bill of exchange I supposed it to be his hand-writing, but since I have altered my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at it now, suppose the bill had remained in your desk and you had not heard that it was a fraud - A. Why then it is possible that I might have paid it.</p>
               <p>Q The imitation is so correct, upon your looking at it now, if you had not heard it was a fraud should you have thought it to be his hand-writing - A. Yes, and I should have paid it.</p>

               <p>"received, Ann Sinclair," and then I left the bill with him, and then I returned to the coach Phobe was waiting in the coach for me. I then went back to my house in the coach. When I got home Mr. Botterill was in my house. I then gave the money to Phoebe Evans, and Phoebe Evans took the money up one pair of stairs to Mr. Botterill.

               <p>Q. Had you been to that banking-house before - A. Yes, I had been there before; and on this day when we got to the bankers at Charing Cross, Mrs. Sinclair got out of the coach, and I remained in the coach, and when she came back we went home, and when we got home she gave me a roll of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a large roll - A. Not a very large roll.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it like bank note paper - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not like bank paper - A. I believe it was. Mrs. Sinclair said she had changed a bank note on purpose to pay the coachman, she said, after she got home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got home what did you do with this roll of paper which you received of her - A. I laid it on the table in my own room. Mr. Botterill was there; I had left him in my room; he took it up.</p>

             SIR,</p>
               <p>"Excuse the liberty a wretched being thus takes in presuming to address you. I dare not address any one else. I suppose you have heard that I am discharged from prison. I am afraid that it is of no use, as I am sure I shall be pursued. Do, for God's sake, inform me what will be likely to be my fate, if you know. Excuse me by sending her; let her see Mrs. Ashley; she is not to blame; it is me. Remember me jointly to all my friends, and believe me you will oblige your troubled friend,</p>
               <p>"W. H. BOTTERILL.</p>
               <p>"Would to God I had never known writing. If you think it best I will throw myself upon the mercy of Mr. Ashley and the bankers."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley, Q. to Phabe Evans. It was a great many days after the bill was written that you received that letter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. 
               <persName id="t18140420-4-person102">Knapp, Q.</persName>
             to Mr. Voss. Do you know on what day you received that letter - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you give it to Collingbourne - A. I believe on the 29th of January, the same day I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Collingbourne. On what day did you receive that letter - A. On the 21st of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Collingbourne, you are an officer of Union-hall - A. I am. I apprehended the prisoner twice. The first apprehension was on the 19th of January. I apprehended him in Baron's-buildings, at Mrs. Sinclair's. Mr. Ashley was present; he told him he was apprehended for this bill of exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything about this bill of exchange - A. He did, on the second examination. I took him to Union-hall the next day, and then he was discharged. I afterwards apprehended him on the 28th or 29th, at Woolwich. When I apprehended him, he said I had him. I saw him pass; I ran after him; he put out his hand to me; he said, Collingbourne, you have me; it is the happiest moment I have in my life. He then told me that he had it in his mind to come to me, and had actually come to the corner of the street where I live. He began to tell me. I cautioned him that what he said to me I should be obliged to tell upon oath. He told me the way he get the check was visiting Mr. Ashley; he was in the room alone; the check book laid in the room; that he had taken several checks from the book; he went to a coffee-house in the City, and filled several of them up before he filled up one to please him, and he believed the one presented was the worst executed.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Ashley. Take that in your hand, and tell me whether you believe that to be, or do you know it is not - A. Most assuredly not; the letters are not made like mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, very well; he has been at my house occasionally. I have known the prisoner a twelvemonth; he being an acquaintance of my brother's. I once gave him a check for a trifling sum of money. When I paid him this check I left my room and my check book on the table, by the side of my writing desk, and I left him in it. I was going in the country that night, and during the time I was in the country this bill was forged.</p>

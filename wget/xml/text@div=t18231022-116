On the 23d of September, he came to ask for provisions. I thought he had had enough for himself, and said I could not let him have it to sell; he then asked for 1 s. - I refused, but told my daughter to give him some bread and butter; he followed me into the back room, and insisted on having two 5 s. papers of penny pieces that were on the drawers. I insisted on his leaving the room; he went out in half an hour, and in about ten minutes, I missed a paper of penny pieces, told an officer, who took him in a quarter of an hour, and found three penny pieces, and 2 s. 6 d. in silver on him - he had a clean shirt and handkerchief on, and before that, he had no shirt on - nobody but him could have taken them.</p>

               <p>Did you buy this wood together? - We did, the wood was bought by me, by the desire of Porteous, we were to buy it and sell it on our joint account; I have had it five or six months; I know nothing of the prisoners; but at the justice's, one of them said he found it.</p>

               <p>How did you know the wood? - I knew it at the justice's, there is no mark on it, but being such a quantity of wood as that, I had not a doubt before the magistrate, and there is not a doubt remains with me; there was three thousand three hundred pounds weight of it, I had taken it in different lots.</p>

               <p>You are not the only man that has logwood in this town? - Not by many; I am sure the prisoners brought it to me, they were with me an hour at the least; I did not pay for it, nor bargain for it; they left it to me to give the worth of it, they knew I was a judge of it; I told them they had it out of my warehouse, and I sent, and the warehouse was broke open, and the wood missing. Before the magistrate, Innis said, he found the wood, the other said something, but I cannot tell what.</p>

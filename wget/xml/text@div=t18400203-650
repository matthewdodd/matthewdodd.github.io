               <p>January, I went with tome officers to No. 10, Bowling-street, St. John's, Clerkenwell, at a quarter-past three o'clock in the afternoon—the outer door was shut—I put my shoulder against it and pushed it open—I went up to the attic on the third-floor, which is the only room on that floor—the door was shut but not fastened—on opening it I saw the prisoner in the room, sitting on a box, before a clear fire—she got up—I caught hold of her, and she dropped something white on the floor, which I suspected was a mould—it parted, and she set her foot on part of it, and said something, but I could not distinctly hear what—I pushed her away, and picked up part of a mould complete, and some pieces—it has been put together since—there is the impression of a counterfeit shilling on the mould, and 1 found a counterfeit shilling, with a get to it, which dropped out of her hand, with the mould altogether—it was hot when I picked it up—I afterwards searched the room, and found eight counterfeit shillings in front of her in a saucer on the bed—I produce them—they appeared as if just made, and all appear to correspond with the one dropped, and with the mould—I saw White, who was with me, take a short tobacco-pipe off the fire, with fluid metal in it—I found nothing on her—I asked who the room belonged to, the said to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to her Majesty's Mint. This is a plaster-of-Paris mould for the casting of counterfeit shil<lb></lb>lings—the shilling found with the <hi rend="italic">get</hi> to it corresponds with the im<lb></lb>pression in all respects, and has been cast in this mould, I am perfectly sure—all the shillings produced have been cast in this mould—there are fifteen—the tobacco-pipe contains white metal similar to the counterfeit shillings, and would be used to pour the metal into the mould—two of the pieces of metal appear to have come from the get of the mould—here is part of a Britannia metal spoon, which the shillings are made of—plaster-of-Paris is what the mould is made of—the files might be applied to re<lb></lb>move the surface metal off the shillings, the roughness of the casting.</p>

Q.</hi> Do the files appear to have been used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do—the shillings are not quite finished—they are just as they came out of the mould—they require the roughness of the edge to be removed by a file, and the <hi rend="italic">get</hi> cut off.</p>

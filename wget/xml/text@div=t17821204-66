               <p>Had you this money in your pocket before? - Yes, I had felt it in my pocket not ten minutes before I met her.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - I was as sober as I am this minute; I had been drinking, but not at all disguised; no further than would do any person good.</p>
               <p>You never saw her before? - I have seen her about that corner; it is her beat, I knew her by seeing her thereabouts; the next night I saw her at the very same spot, she was fighting with another girl; I let her have her battle out, and then I charged the watch with her: I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the same girl.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. You hear the evidence gentlemen: to be sure there is one remark that occurs, which is, that as the man's breeches were unbuttoned, the money might fall out.</p>

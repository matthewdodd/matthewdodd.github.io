             Foy, the captain, he immediately ordered all hand to be called on deck, to be mustered, to give an opportunity of seeing the person; in a few minutes, before half the people could get on deck, Mr. Franklyn came on the quarter-deck, and North, the waiter, exclaimed, that is him; whether Mr. Franklyn heard the exclamation or not I do not know, but he immediately went down below; Sir Francis then called to the master at arms to go and secure Mr. Franklyn, I also followed below; the master at arms went one way, and I went the other, and he got to Mr. Franklyn first; I then asked Mr. Franklyn which was his birth, which he very readily pointed out to me; I then asked him which were his trunks or boxes, he also readily pointed them out to me; I then asked him for the keys of the boxes, and he gave them me out of his jacket pocket; I think then, before I opened either of the boxes, I asked him if he had got any Bank-notes; he replied, none but what I should find in the trunk; I opened the trunk, and in searching, I found a purse containing small Bank-notes to the amount of one or two and twenty pounds, and some gold, the gold I returned to him, and kept the notes at that present time; I asked him afterwards what he had done with the five hundred pounds worth of Bank-notes that he had brought from London; he hesitated a little, and at length replied, that he had no other; I had some further conversation with him which I do not immediately recollect; I told him he must go on shore with us, that I must take him to town; he then sat down on his trunk to dress himself for that purpose; I again asked him if he had not got some more Banknotes; he then says, yes, I have, and I will tell you where they are; but before he could tell me, Rivett came with the parcel in his hand, and said, I have found them; that parcel contained Banknotes, they are here, they amounted to four hundred and fifty pounds; we, as soon as we conveniently could, brought him on shore, and took him to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Four hundred and fifty pounds was the whole that Rivett found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had asked him before what he had done with the five hundred pounds worth of notes? - A. yes; I took the notes I found in the trunk to the Bank, and had them examined, they were good; I have since returned them to a friend of the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any examination of him taken in writing? - A. I believe not.</p>

             sworn. - I was in company with Mr. Lavender, on board the Hydra frigate; Mr. Lavender stated to the captain the circumstance of our coming there, and in consequence of that, he ordered the boatswain to pipe all hands; the prisoner at the bar came upon deck, and immediately returned below again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to go below again? - A. I do not know; the captain desired the master at arms to secure him, and I went below and searched the prisoner's trunks, but there was nothing particular found; in the place where I supposed his bed would be, in searching a locker, in the prisoner's birth, a little place like a cupboard -</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked? - A. NO, it was not; it had a place to sit down upon it, and behind some old biscuit bags that were in the locker, I found a pocket handkerchief rolled up, and in that handkerchief there were some Bank-notes, they amounted, I think, to four hundred and fifty pounds; I immediately called Mr. Lavender into the birth, and told him I had found these notes; I kept them till we got to town, and then I gave them to Mr. Lavender; I marked them all before I delivered them to Mr. Lavender.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the apparent value of them? - A. The lowest, I believe, is fifteen pounds, and the highest one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had found these notes, where did you go? - A. I told the prisoner I had found these notes in the place that I supposed was his birth; he made little or no answer at first; sometime after, he said, he had received them from a man who had robbed him, and we then brought him up to town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, in point of fact, you understood the prisoner had not been on board the Hydra till within a day or two? - A. Something of that kind.</p>

               <p>Q. You said properly, you supposed it to be his birth? - A. I could not know it myself, and the prisoner did not chuse to tell me; he said he had no birth, or something of that sort; I have no birth; where is your bed, or your cot, says I; he told me it was upon deck; I then went to the first lieutenant, and asked him, and he shewed me the birth.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was his cot upon deck? - A. Yes, it was; as I understood it was not in the birth, I asked him where his birth was, and his bed; says he, my bed is upon deck; says I, where is your birth? I have no birth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Then he referred you to the cot which was upon deck? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he had no birth, did he not add, that he had no birth particular to himself, that other persons occupied the same birth as well as he? - A.Certainly, I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he added nothing more than that he had no birth? - A. I do not recollect that a word passed more than that he had no birth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know, that the birth that you afterwards found this locker in, belonged to five other persons? - A. I understood there were some other young men that messed with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now, that he had only come a day or two before - A. I understood so on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was not at the birth when you went down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The locker was open? - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. The notes you found out were behind some biscuit bags? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The biscuit bags had the appearance of having been there some time? - A. I cannot tell how long they might have been there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. He told you he had received these notes from a man who had robbed him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. In point of fact, a man was taken up, and examined at Bow-street, upon a charge of that kind? - A. Yes; he certainly did complain of being robbed some days before he was taken up, and came to Bow-street to make his complaint.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I was waiter at the George-Inn, at Rochester, in October last.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the young man at the bar? - A. I recollect the prisoner very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the arrival of Lavender and Rivett at your house? - A. Yes; I think it was on the 5th.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with them on board the Hydra frigate? - A. I did; I saw the prisoner there; it was intimated that I knew the man, I knew him the moment I saw him, I said, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q.Then what became of him after? - A. He went down below immediately, upon that I staid upon deck.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him before, in what place had you seen him, so as to know that he was the person? - A. At the George, at Rochester, on Wednesday the 27th of September, to the best of my knowledge; he came to our house in the evening, he enquired of me for a place in the mail-coach to London, that very evening; he had a sailor with him at the time; he ordered supper, a roast fowl and some other things; he eat his supper, drank two bottles of Lisbon, and then a bowl of punch; he then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060006"></xptr>came out into the kitchen, and said, he had got some notes in his pocket, and a pocket-book that he had had the misfortune to drop into the sea coming from abroad, the leaves of the pocket-book were edged with green, which had stained these Bank-notes; he asked me if I could give him cash for a note or two; I told him that I could not; he asked me, if my employer could do it, I told him, I would enquire, and then I told him that he could not; he afterwards paid me for his supper in cash, and he had in bulk, as near as I can imagine, thirty guineas in cash.</p>
               <p>Q. That was, he had asked you, if you could exchange him a note? - A. Yes; he afterwards came to the bar, and asked it as a favour to give change for a note; I told him he did not want cash, for he had got plenty of cash; I told him, that when he took the place in the mail-coach, probably the book-keeper might give him change for it; he afterwards appeared much disguised in I quor, and about half-past eleven o'clock he desired to go to bed; I told him it was of no use to go to bed, for the mail-coach would be in about half after twelve, and he would have very little time, if he meant to go with the mail-coach; he said. he would go when the mail-coach came in; the chamber-maid went to call him, he slept in a double bedded room, when the chamber-maid went up, he had his coat off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you happen to see any thing of him afterwards? - A. He did not go by the mail; I was desired to call him at six o'clock, I called him about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person in that room when you called him? - A. No; he ordered coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come down out of his room when the coffee was ordered? - A. Yes; the coach came to the door, and I put the things in; there was a bundle tied up in a white handkerchief, a brace of pistols, and a hank whip; when I had put them in the coach, he came running back, exclaiming, that we was robbed; I asked him what he was robbed of; he told me, that he was robbed in cash and notes, to near the amount of forty pounds; I said, possibly, as you were very much in liquor, you might have shook it out of your pocket; and he desired I would take the things out of the coach, for he would not go on; then the things were taken out, and put into the room again; I begged of him to go up stairs with me, and to shake the bedclothes, I called the chamber-maid up with us, and we shook the clothes, and took the bed off the bedstead, but could not find any thing; he said, he would advertise, and a suspicion fell upon two men that had slept in that room the night before; he staid till near two o'clock in the afternoon; some time after he made himself very easy, he said, it would not ruin him, and he should make himself easy till he got to London; when Mr. Lavender and the other officer came, I went with them on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. All this part of the conversation, about the notes, was after they had drank two bottles of Lisbon, and a bowl of punch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what propostion of the liquor they had had? - A.After the second bottle was in; and, I believe, three parts of it was by that time drank.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the punch in too? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>GARNETT TERRY sworn? - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are all engraver, employed by the Bank of England? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that parcel of Bank-notes, are they, in your opinion, printed at the Bank of England? - A. NO, they were not; these are forged prints; here is not one of them that was printed at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been engraver to the Bank? - A. About two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that ten pound note? - A. This is a forged note; I have no doubt but they are all of one manufactory.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You seem to have some difficulty; you took some time to look at them? - A. You saw the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Having take some time to consider whether they were good notes or not, they might quite as easy come into a sailor's possession without his knowing them to be forged? - A. Yes.</p>

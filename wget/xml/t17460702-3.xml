               <p>Court. Then you did not see the Boy take it?</p>
               <p>Gardner. No, my Lord, I was out of Town that Day , but the Prisoner said he watch'd my Wife into the Parlour; then he, with one Cutosh , did it, who was concern'd with him in the Robbery. The Prisoner own'd to me, that when my Wife<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020007"></xptr> was in the Parlour, they took an Opportunity to press down the Glass, but they could not get the Watch out readily. Then they went and got a Nail and crook'd it, and with that they haul'd the Watch out, and he whipt it into the others Bosom. They could not get their Hand in, but with a crooked Nail haul'd it out, and, as I said before, deliver'd it into the other Boy's Bosom; they then cross'd the Way through Aldgate, and turn'd down Crutched-Fryers , and upon Tower-Hill; there the Boy gave this the Watch again, and he put it into his Fob or Breeches, and they went to a Jew's in Rag-Fair to sell the Watch, but he was not at home. They went then to Rice Jones's Wife in Long-Lane, West-Smithfield, who keeps a Chandler's Shop, and sells Small Beer, and they sold it for Two Guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Watch worth?</p>
               <p>Gardner . Seventeen Guineas, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Age this Boy is?</p>
               <p>Gardner. He said he was 14 Years of Age. He came the second Time, and said he saw a fine Thing the Ladies use, but my Wife missing the Watch, took Care of the Glass; he said he came to get the Thing that the Ladies put in their Ears, or another Watch; that is what he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by this Boy?</p>
               <p>Gardner. I advertis'd my Watch Five Guineas Reward: There were two Men that make it their Business to take up these Boys, they with the Constable brought him to my Shop; they said they took him from between a Couple of Whores.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it that he acknowledg'd it?</p>
               <p>Hawkins . At the Paul's Head Tavern facing St. Lawrence's Church, there he confess'd that he, with another Lad, one Cutosh, did take a Gold Watch out of Mr. Gardner's Shew Glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in what Manner?</p>
               <p>Hawkins . In the Manner Mr. Gardner has expressed, by drawing of it out with a Nail.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he disposed of it?</p>
               <p>Hawkins . He told me after they had taken it out from thence, they went into Crutched Fryers , and so to Rag Fair, to a Person there that buy's stolen Goods, but the Man was not at Home. Then they went to Long Lane in Smithfield, to Rice Jones's, where the Woman gave him Two Guineas for it. They gave Six-pence to a Person to carry it out to enquire whether it was Gold or Metal, and they said it was Metal. He said there was a preety Thing in the Glass, which were Bar-Ring, that he wanted, if not another Watch .</p>
               <p>Court. You know nothing further ?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Nothing further, my Lord, than acknowledg'd.</p>

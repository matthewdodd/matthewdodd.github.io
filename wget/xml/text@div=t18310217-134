Shortly before Christmas, 1828, he called on me, and said he would seize our goods - I offered, a little before Christmas, to give up the house on condition that I should have a quarter's rent, in consequence of having new roofed the house - he would not listen to any proposal, but said he would follow me up close when the rent became due; I had my father-in-law and two other lodgers in my house; I carried on business in the general line, but Tubbs opened against me, because I turned my hand to other things; he lived next door but one - I did not propose to give up my house till he abused me, and broke the locks; after he refused to enter into any terms about the house, my father-in-law's goods, and what I could spare, were removed to Greek-street, to his master's, for the purpose of raising money to pay the rent - previous to Christmas-day I took a lodging on the opposite side of the street, because my life was in danger; I shut up the shop occasionally after I took my lodging, and put up two bills to let it for nineteen years - on the 25th of December the quarter's rent was paid on my father's goods; I did not pay any myself - I had not time; he took care to seize the goods; on Monday morning, the 26th of December, the rent was paid, and I came out with the receipt in my pocket, which was written by Mr. Scates' young man - this is it; I received it from Mr. Flint, who paid the money to save our goods - the name of Mr. Scates' young man is down on the receipt, but I did not see him; I got the receipt about eleven o'clock - Tubbs and his wife came to my house, and broke the door open while I was in town; we had left to go to town between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - we had left plenty of goods to pay the rent; we returned in the evening, and our goods had then been all taken away, to the amount of 8l. or 9l. - I am now speaking of the lodging opposite the shop; I missed a blanket from there, but that was not at that time; there were more robberies after that; on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170092"></xptr>23rd of December I employed Scate to get a lodger out of the house, and he entered another room with a false-key and stole these things; he stole the large blanket, bed-furniture and sofa-cover; it was near a fortnight after that, that Tubbs and his wife broke in and got over the wall - I cannot say whether Scate was in every respect connected with them on the 26th of December; no article in this indictment was taken from me on the day after Christmas-day; Tubbs and his wife were on the premises on the day I employed Scate to get my lodger out - Tubbs' wife was at the door on the 23rd, abusing me and raising a mob about the house, and Tubbs was up and down stairs; Scates took the blanket, bed-furniture, and sofa-cover - a man was brought to seize my goods for the water-rate, and they brought a cart to the private door and took them; I did not see Scate take my goods.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often, since this transaction, have you been drinking and carousing with Tubbs, and his wife? A. Never, to my knowledge - they did, unfortunately, coax my husband out of his house; the only day I drank with him was on the day we took him, and then he offered me some money not to come against him - I have never drank with his wife, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have Tubbs and his wife been living in the same street ever since? A. I cannot tell whether Mrs. Tubbs has, but he was found there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Tubbs summon you to the Court, and make you pay 9s.? A. Yes; there were some little items, and my husband paid 9s. into Court, I believe; that was a very short time after we left Portland-town - it did not suit us to take them into custody then; we had not got all our witnesses - we got an assault warrant; it was not dismissed, but we got leave to quit the Court, in order for him to offer us a sum of money - I had them before Mr. Rawlinson, and I have the officer here; I did make a charge of robbery against them then, but, while I was talking to the Magistrate, Scate and my father both tried to get me down; the Magistrate said,"What is the reason she is not allowed to speak;" he said he liked to hear female complaints, but they took me away, and said it was finished; no money was ever given to my father - when I went again his Worship said he would not listen to the complaint; I should have staid before - at that time Tubbs lived in Portland new-town - he is a Policeman of Westminster; I do not know where Mrs. Tubbs lived - they say he lodges down in Westminster.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they continue, for a year and more, in the same house after this transaction? A. I cannot account for that - I took steps to have them apprehended, shortly after they broke in and took the things, which was shortly after quarter-day; I took them before Mr. Rawlinson.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to tell my Lord, that, when these persons were before the Magistrate, you charged them with the robbery? A. I certainly did.</p>

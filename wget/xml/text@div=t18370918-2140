                  </hi>. I am servant to Edward Sherman, the coach proprietor—he has a great number of men—Ansell was one—I am foreman on the western line—I received information, and watched in a stable adjoining to where Ansell worked, where the horses stood that he looked after—this was Tuesday, the 13th of September—about half-past nine o'clock at night, I saw Manning come and speak to Ansell—I knew Manning—he is ostler to Martin, of the Green Man—they spoke to each other—I could not hear what passed—he went out and came in again, and Manning took up a pail—Ansell was then in the stable—the corn, and chaff, and beans are kept in a bin, in the stable—Ansell has the key of the stable and the bin—I went out of the stable I was in and took the pail from Manning, in the yard, and found in it oats, beans, and chaff—I did not ask him how he came by it—I took it home to my own house—I said, "Bill, what are you going to do with these?"—he said nothing—he never spoke to me—these are my master's beans and chaff.</p>

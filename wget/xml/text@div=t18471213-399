                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defense.</hi> I fell in with a friend who I had not seen for a long time; he asked me to have something to drink; we went, and stopped in a house two or three hours, that made us rather foolish; as we came home, I got on this place; some man said, "Come down!" I was coming down, and fell on my back; I was steamed, and when I came to my senses the police-man had me.</p>

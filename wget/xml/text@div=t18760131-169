I am the prisoners wife and live at 37, Cannon Street Road—on 27th December, he came home at 1.20 in the morning—I was at home—he asked me to give him his old coat and waistcoat for he should go out again—I asked him how long he should be—he said he should not be long—he went out, and about 1.30 I went out after him—he returned about 3.20 a.m.—I was then in my landlord's parlour away from him—I let him alone till I thought he had had his supper and gone to bed—I then went up to my bedroom and he was lying with his head on the table—I let him be some little time thinking he would go to bed, but he struck me with his hand—he got a poker and I turned my face in the bed to save it being marked with the poker, and he struck me across the back with it—the poker dropped from his hand on the boards, and he dragged me round the room by my hair and beat me severely with his fists—I went down stairs and he followed me and dragged me back again, and threw me down and kicked me and jumped on me—he tore my dress off and my jacket was covered with blood—he tore a good deal of hair off my head, and it was lying on my jacket—I was so exhausted with being beat that I could not put up with it, and I went to the window to open it to call for the police, but I did not see anybody and he put his arms round my waist and threw me clean out of the window; I fell on the cellar flap and recollect nothing more till I came to my senses at the London Hospital, at 3.40 on Saturday night—my head was very severely cut, and I was injured on my shoulder bone—the window is fifteen feet high from the sill, a chair could stand between the floor and the window.</p>

               <p>standing outside a door, he said to me "Here is a <hi rend="italic">row"</hi>—I heard the prisoner say "Corne upstairs" and afterwards I heard a noise on the stairs as if it was the woman's head knocking up against the stairs, and then I; heard footsteps going upstairs, and the noise ceased for five minutes, and I heard the window slide up—I was standing by Carter in the road—I then saw the woman standing in front of the window, and the prisoner with his, arms round her waist, and she came out at the window head first, and after she fell I culled the police—I only saw half of her body at the window—he seemed to me as if he was throwing her out—I saw him after she fell with, his hands on the sill looking out—he then came down to the door—while she was down stairs I heard her say "Ryan you will kill me" she did not call out when the window went up—when he came down he said "Did I throw you out Sarah"—I said "Yes, you did."</p>

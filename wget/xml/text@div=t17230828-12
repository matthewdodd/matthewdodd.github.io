The Substance of this was also depos'd by the Constable. That afterwards he did light of Gibbons in the Mins, and that Gibbons did own, he himself took the Tankard, and carried it away in his Apron; and that Thomas bid Wynne go after him, (Gibbons) for he had taken Mr. Toney's Tankard, and they should all he hang'd; but Wynne said he would not, if he had it let him keep it.

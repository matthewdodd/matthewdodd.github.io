I went from lamp to lamp, and followed them over the fields, to the last lamp in Marybone-Fields. I look'd at the measure, and found he did not put in half the quantity that he should have done. When he had done the last lamp he put the ladder up, and the other pull'd out a bladder to put the oil in. As they were putting the oil in I went to detect them, and the other man ran away. I took the prisoner to the Round house that night, and the next day before the justice, where he confessed he had sold our oil to

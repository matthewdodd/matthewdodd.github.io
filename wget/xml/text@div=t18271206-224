               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any conversation with him about this? A. Yes, about this and other sums; I mentioned there were two sums, amounting to 7l. for freights, which he had received from Messrs. Rucks; but I cannot recollect whether I stated that it was composed of two items - I charged him with receiving 7l., this was on the 1st of December; I showed him this paper - the conversation began with himself - he said, "I am very sorry my accounts are deficient" - I then put this paper into his hand, which amounts to 98l., which I took from the cash-book, not from his book - I said I had discovered various sums, amounting to 98l., and I feared it was to a much greater extent - he said he did not know the exact amount he had received - I put this list into his hand, and Mr. Ruck's 7l. is two of those items - he said, "He thought he had taken about 70l. more than was due to him as salary:" my partner had told him he had better give an account of all he had received.</p>

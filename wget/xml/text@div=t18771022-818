                  </hi> (14 <hi rend="italic">Borough of Gravesend Police</hi>). At about three o'clock on Sunday morning, the 8th July, I was at the Canal when I saw two men in the attitude of getting into Mr. Farmer's window—another man stood by—I was about ten yards, I should think, from the two men, and they were about this far into the window (<hi rend="italic">pointing to his waist</hi>). It was a sash window—as soon as they saw me they ran away, and I gave chase and followed them as far as Mr. Brown's wharf—I had a clear view of their faces—then they went into Mr. Butcher's wharf, and I lost sight of them—I ran outside of Mr. Butcher's wharf—I looked over the" fence and saw the prisoner and the other men coming alongside—I climbed over Mr. Butcher's fence, and chased them back to Mr. Brown's and to Mr. Farmer's, where they started from—they ran away again, and I saw two of the men going away in a boat, and I caught the prisoner, who was running when I arrested him—I told him I should take him into custody for attempting to break into the house of Mr. Farmer—he told me he had had a "shove down" in a sand barge, and he was going to Clap-creek, where he had some friends, and he was going back to London that tide—I went in company with another constable and roused the inmates of Mr. Farmer's house, the Shades, and found that the glass of the window was broken round the catch so that it had been unfastened—this blind was five or six feet outside the window—it had been inside—the sash was up as I had first seen it—I searched the prisoner, and found;' on him four bargeman's keys, a box, a lighterman's licence, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—I am positive the prisoner is the man I saw.</p>

               <p>was not prepared to take anybody into custody I saw running—he had taken a circle right round by the wharf—I had to run him round twice—I took the prisoner into custody on the other side of the Canal to that he started from—not far from the original spot they started from—it was the other side of Mr. Butcher's foundry—I could see the other two men, but not so as to identify them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I lost sight of the men all three ran into Mr. Brown's wharf first, and from there into Mr. Butcher's—then I went outside—they went inside, and I looked over the fence and saw the prisoner and the other men coming up inside—I climbed the fence, and chased the prisoner till I captured him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Albion Shades—I locked up the house the night before the occurrence in question, and saw that it was secure—about four o'clock on the Sunday morning I was aroused by a police-constable stating the house was broken into, or rather the window in the basement at the side of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> house was open—it had been closed the night before—there is a small passage at the side of the house—the glass was cut the size of a penny to admit anything to uncatch the window—the inside blind was broken, and was outside in the street—there were none of my goods removed—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

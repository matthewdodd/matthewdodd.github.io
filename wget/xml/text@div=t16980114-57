             were arrested in a Fob-Action, by virtue of a Writ of Middlesex, at the Suit of one Mr. Wilcox. 'Twas deposed that at a Tavern in Holborn the Prisoner proposed to him a Match worth 500 l. which proved the young Lady's Maid, Mary Brand, into whose Company the Prisoner procured Admittance, with a Design to have the more easy Access to the young Lady; and that afterwards the Prisoner proposed to the Evidence, that if he knew of any Gentleman of his Acquaintance, she had a Lady in view of a great Fortune, to whom she could get him matched, giving her a Reward; and that he having proposed the said John Michel, the Time and Place of seeing the young Lady was proposed. He also deposed that he was imployed by the Prisoner to desire a Bond of 500l. from Mitchel, as a Reward to help him to the Fortune, who said he would not be against it. Another deposed that about 12 Months ago the Prisoner came to him to serve an Instrument of 400 l. as a Reward she was to have from Mr. Mitchel for procuring the Match with Madam Loverain; whom she was to get carried off; at which he showing his Detestation, refused it. Another deposed that he was in company with Mitchel, when he went to prove the Will of the Lady's Father, who was a Merchant in Barnstaple, and that afterwards he went to a Meeting with the Prisoner and another Gentlewoman, where it was again proposed to carry off the Lady, and a Reward of about 500 l. to be given to the Prisoner.

She further deposed that the Prisoner had brought one of the Evidence to come and see her, and proposed a Match betwixt them. Another deposed that he had to arrest the young Lady and her Maid: that Mitchel had been with him, and prest the Arrest, which he put in execution. The Coach-man deposed that Mr. Mitchel told him he was to carry off a young Lady, who was willing to have him in Marriage. Another Evidence heard the Prisoner confess that she had been at several Meetings, in which she proposed to procure Mr. Mitchel to be married to Madam Loverain, for which she was to have 400 l. Reward. The Prisoner called several to her Reputation and to prove her being elsewhere that time of the Arrest.

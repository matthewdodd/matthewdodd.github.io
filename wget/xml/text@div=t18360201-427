I live I King's-terrace, Bagniggewell's-road. in the dwelling-house of William Sweet, I have known the prisoner Ansell about four months—his grandmother was my cousin—he is about twelve years old—he was at my house on the 5th of January, about five o'clock in the afternoon—I was sitting in my bed-room—I had a gold watch and guard in a watch-bag handing by the side of the mantel-piece—I am sure it was there when he came into the house—he staid about five minutes, and then went down into the kitchen, and took tea—I also went down, and he was sent up to the drawing-room with a message, by the mistress of the house—I saw him come down again, but did not see him with the watch—I missed it about eight or nine o'clock in the evening—there was a small key, and a worsted guard to it—it was valued at the police-office at about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but when my brother purchased it, it cost 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw it again at the police-office, Hatton-garden, several days afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 5th of January, I was in the service of Mr. Jeffries, of Guildford-place. I saw Ansell at a quarter-past six o'clock on Tuesday evening, in Guildford-place—he had a large gold watch in his possession—I asked him where he got it from—he said he had found it in a square—he came up to me, and said, "Young woman I have found a watch, do you want to buy it?"—I asked him what he wanted for it—he said, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I had not 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would take any thing for it—he would take a few halfpence—I walked a little way with him—till we came to Mr. Cockburn's shop—I took the watch in my hand—it was going—it was a quarter-past six o'clock by it—I went with him to Cockburn's shop—he keeps a snuff-shop in Guildford-place—I said to the boy, "come in here"—I had the watch in my hand—he said, "No, I do not think I shall, I will take the watch home to my mother"—I took him into Cock<lb></lb>burn, who was in the shop—I said to him, "This boy says he has found a watch, and he wants to sell it"—he asked him where he found it—he said. "In a square"—he said, "Are you sure you found it?"—he said yes, he found it in a leather bag, with the guard twisted round it—he asked him what he wanted for it—he said he did not know, he would take any thing for it and he gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—Cockburn ex<lb></lb>amined it—he opened the case of it—there was some name at the back of the case—I asked him what name it was—he said it was nothing—the boy took the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went out of the shop—I asked Cockburn if the watch was a gold one—he said no, It was only a Bartholomew-fair one—I went out of the shop then—I said to Cockburn. "The boy was all of a tremble when he came up to "—he made no remark at that—Cockburn was present when the boy said he would take it to his mother—the boy said he would rather give the watch to the owner, if he knew who it was, than have the money—he said, the money was no good to him—I said to Cockburn, "Your wife will wonder where you got the watch from"—he said he would not say any thing to his wife—it would do for his little girl to play with.</p>

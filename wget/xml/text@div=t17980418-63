             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are one of the clerks in the Discount-office in the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of February last, had the prisoner a discount account at the Bank? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill, and tell me whether, on the 22d of February, this bill was discounted? - A. On the 22d of February this bill was discounted by the Bank of England, with others.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the course of the Bank, when bills are presented to them, for persons to leave a list of the bills that they bring to be discounted? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the list which accompanied that bill, when it came for discount? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a bill signed by Mr. Wilkinson? - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Mr. Wilkinson? - A. Very well; I have seen it often.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that list, which bears his signature, written by him? - A. I believe it to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bill, do you believe that to be the writing of the prisoner? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the endorsement, David Wilkinson, at the back? - A. I believe that to be the handwriting of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he paid the value of that bill, abating the discount? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that, and tell me if that is the draft of the prisoner, and whether, upon the credit of that and the other bills, he obtained any money, and what? - A. Yes, 639l. 18s. I have an entry that I made at the time of the transaction, as a warrant for him to go to the Drawing-office, in order to enable him to draw off the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the draft? - A. This draft appears to be the hand-writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q.Where do you take that entry from? - A.This is the regular mode of doing business.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The bills come to you, you discount them, and in order that he may have the consideration of his discount, you give him a warrant, which goes to another officer, by which he gets credit of the Bank? - A. Yes; it is a warrant made by me in the Discount-office, taken from the bills themselves, which I pass to the Drawing-office, as their warrant to permit him to draw to the amount of those bills. The amount of the bills was 639l. 18s. and the discount for that day 4l. 19s. 10d.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that other paper, and say if that is a draft upon the Bank in consequence of it? - A. Here are two drafts, one for 544l. and the other for 91l. making together 635l. drawn by him on the Bank, and paid to him on the 22d of February.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. Do you mean to say, that you took these papers from the bills themselves, or from any copy of the bills, or any entry of the bills in any book? - A. That warrant is taken from the bills, and signed by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make this copy yourself? - A. No; but I sign them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see the bills when you sign those warrants? - A. I must have seen the bills, or else I could not have entered them in my book, for which I sign that warrant, as a voucher.</p>
               <p>Q. Who makes this copy from the bills? - A. One of the clerks in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not sign this paper upon the faith merely of that clerk having made a copy? - A. No; because I signed that paper upon the faith of having seen the bills themselves, and entered them to the amount; and the discount being properly done by another clerk, I then sign it, as a voucher that so much may be carried to the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever examine the bills before you sign them? - A. There is no occasion to examine them; I had made an entry of those bills in my discount book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is there any entry that you have made yourself from the bills themselves? - A. The entry that I have made in my book is the clear amount of the bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Wilkinson write? - No; I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you only mean to say, that the handwriting upon that bill is something like the handwriting of Mr. Wilkinson? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself ever transact any business. with Mr. Wilkinson? - A. Yes; in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person of the name of Wilkinson, who has a discount at the Bank? - A. I do not know of any other person of the name of David Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there any other person of the name of Wilkinson? - A. There are several Wilkinsons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q.Whatever other discounter there may be of the name of Wilkinson in the Bank, are you sure that you have transacted bu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180051"></xptr>siness with the prisoner upon the subject of discount? - A. Yes; frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. And, from the knowledge you have had from that circumstance of his hand-writing, you believe that to be his hand-writing? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>ISAAC WILSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am clerk to Smith, Payne, and Smith, bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you paid drafts of his? - A. Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with his character and hand-writing? - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the body of the bill, and the endorsement,

               <p>Q. Look at these drafts upon the Bank? - A. I believe these to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. Have you ever seen him write? - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his writing perfectly? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Look at the acceptance upon that bill, whose hand-writing do you believe that to be? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>William Bousfield, sen. called. - Mr. Serjeant Shepherd objected to the competency of Mr. Bousfield's testimony, upon the ground that, thought there was a release to the acceptors, there was still a claim upon the drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. The first person they have to resort to, is the acceptor, and if they give up the first person, and admit that he is not liable to pay, they cannot resort to the second.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Cewell.) Q.According to the course of business in the Discount-office, are the bills, proposed to be discounted, left the preceding day? - A. Bills to be discounted are brought on the Wednesday, and they have an answer to them on the Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see him? - A.Yesterday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he confined to his bed? - A.Partly, not wholly.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his disorder? - A. A rheumatic fever.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, consistent with his health and life, it would be fit that he should attend in this Court to give evidence? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. My Lord. There are three partners in this house, all concerned in the business; two of them say it is not their handwriting, but the third partner is said to be in a situation in which he cannot appear as a witness, and on account of whose absence they might have put off the trial; but though it may not be the handwriting even of that third person, it does not follow that it may not be the hand-writing of some person authorized by Mr. Favell to accept bills in the name of the firm of the house; and, in cases of forgery, nothing can be evidence against a prisoner, but the man whose name purports to be forged, swearing that it is not his.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a case in which the prisoner has a very important stake indeed, that of his life, and I know not difference in the application of evidence between a civil and a criminal case. I do not believe that any gentleman at the bar would have made an objection of this kind in a civil case. The rule of law does not require impossibilities; and if the person who could give the best evidence, is prevented either by illness, or even by necessary absence, as in the case of deeds executed in the East-Indies, it has been decided that you need not bring the attesting witness; if you bring a person to prove the hand-writing, it is sufficient: and if that is so in a civil case, I know no difference between that and a criminal case.</p>
               <p>As the very learned Counsel, for whose opinion I have great respect, has made this objection, I know not whether his opinion goes along with it, but I am extremely happy in this case, a criminal case of the greatest importance, that I have the best assistance that can be afforded on the bench, to confirm me in the opinion that I shall give. I am clearly of opinion that there is no ground upon earth for the objection. This objection comes in a very odd fashion, because it is not many minutes ago that the learned Counsel, who now makes this objection, objected to the admissibility of Mr. Bousfield; if that objection had prevailed, the door of Justice must have been for ever shut, and however numerous and aggravated cases might be, taking both these objections together, there would be an indemnity in future in all such cases. It is said, that it is not conclusive, the conclusion is for the Jury to make, but here a person is afflicted by the hand of the Almighty, and it is in the ordinary course of the administration of justice to permit those to give evidence, who have seen the handwriting of the person. I have never heard such an objection before. I am clearly of opinion that the evidence is admissible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Hotham. I perfectly concur in my Lord's opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. So do I.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury. Painful as is the situation in which I am placed - a few days since a merchant of this city, respected like yourselves, and now standing at this bar to answer a capital charge; incalculable: as my anxiety must be at the reflection that a wife and five children are, at this moment, in the most dreadful suspence human nature can admit of; painful, I say, as this situation is, it admits of no small alleviation from the circumstance, that the verdict, which is to determine, not only on my life, but, on what is still dearer to me, my character and reputation, is to be pronounced by a Jury of merchants and tradesmen: no other class of men could from so just an idea of the grounds of defence I am about to lay before you; for the degree of trust and confidence I have placed in an individual, would, to any other than persons conversant in trade and business, appear improbable, as well as imprudent; whilst to men engaged in commercial concerns, not only its possibility, but its probability will be apparent. You, Gentlemen, as merchants and tradesmen of this city, have been bred in the very bosom of commerce; by your education and habits of life, you must therefore be aware of the wonderful extent of confidence and credit, that not only exists, but which necessarily prevails between man and man, in the various transactions of commercial dealings; and, therefore, will the better comprehend the facts I shall presently state as the ground of my defence. Confidence most extended, trust almost implicit, and unbounded credit in the mutual transactions of each other, is the very basis and foundation of the vast system of commerce, by which our nation is supported; and to such confidence alone (unfortunately misapplied) am I indebted for the situation in which I now stand.</p>
               <p>I would not willingly, Gentlemen of the Jury, trespass unnecessarily on your time, or that of the Court, and shall proceed to lay before you such a state of facts, as will enable you to apply the evidence I shall produce, to the general outline of my defence. I will but just observer on the necessity of my doing this, on account of the law not allowing a man, in my situation, the advantage of a Counsel's abilities in addressing you, or in stating my case in the advantageous manner, which, by art and elocution it might be placed; but I have more than one consolation, which counterbalances all the disadvantage of my being unpracticed in public speaking - the one is, that my case is a plain state of facts, which needs but a simple statement to be understood; and the other is, that the indulgence of our laws gives a man, in my situation, the claim to the assistance of the Judges who preside here, and the urbanity and humanity of those Judges before whom I stand, ensures me the exercise of such right, in applying, and in calling your attention to the application of such parts of the evidence, as through my inadvertence, or inability, I may neglect to place in a proper point of view.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, let me call your attention to this point, that no fort of evidence has been produced, to shew or lead you, for a moment, to suppose that forgery was committed by me. The only charge against me, to which any evidence, on the part of the prosecution can be made to apply, is that of uttering such forged bills; and here let me six your attention to this point, on which my defence will wholely rest, namely, that to constitute any criminality, in the uttering such bills, I must be proved to have known them to be forged at the time of my so uttering them; without establishing this fact, I confidently appeal to my Lord, whether the prosecutors can be said to have made out any case against me. Of my being so apprized of the forgery, at the time of my discounting the bills, no shade of direct positive evidence has been produced. It has been proved. and I admit the last to be so, that I discounted such bills at the Bank, and there the evidence for the Crown rests. No separate independent collateral facts, arising from my conduct at the time of so discounting the bills, or at any subsequent period, have been proved to shew, or to infer, my knowledge of the forgery; on the contrary, as far as any inference may be drawn from my conduct, both at the time, and posterior to my having discounted the bills, it is presumptive evidence of my being wholly ignorant, as I call God to witness I really was, of such bills being forged. However, I cannot but admit, that my appearing, on the face of the bills themselves, the immediate drawer on the person, whose name appears to be forged, does, till that circumstance is explained, afford that fort of implication, that I was privy to the forgery, as calls on me to explain and account for.</p>
               <p>A very few circumstances, which I am about to state, will, I trust satisfy your minds on this head. It is now about two years since a partnership concern, which had previously existed between me and Mr. Joseph Adamson, whose name you have heard in the course of this trial, was dissolved; public notice of such dissolution was inserted in the Gazette. As we parted on good terms, and had ever been in the habits of friendship, our wishes to serve each other (at least I speak for myself) still continued. Sometime after we separated, he being about to go to Manchester, respecting his business, requested me to give an eye to his servants in his absence; and particularly to attend to the payment of such bills as would become due during his absence, and for which he left out checks on his bankers: this I engaged to do, and, for this purpose, part of a desk in his accompting-house was allotted me; and as our friendship for each other continued from that time to the period when this forgery was discovered, I continued in the use of such part of the desk, to the period of his apprehension. But it will be in evidence to you, that such desk was constantly left by me unlocked; and, therefore, no inference of private transaction being carried on by me, at Mr. Adamson's accompting house, can be drawn from the circumstance of my having the use of such desk.</p>
               <p>It was sometime after Mr. Adamson's return from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180054"></xptr>Manchester, that on account of the increasing extent of his business, he stated to me his frequent embarrassments for want of cash, and his consequent want of an encreased discount; and suggested to me, that as on our dissolution of partnership, the discount-account with the Bank of England, which, during our partnership, was only one joint account, by being now separated and divided, might, with my assistance, give him the advantage of a double discount account with the Bank. I need scarcely mention to you, Gentlemen, that the Bank of England, in their discounts, confine the account of each individual, or firm, to a certain extent, which they will for such individual, or firm, on no account exceed. That such is the practice of the Bank is notorious to every commercial man; and it must occur to you, how great an advantage Mr. Adamson would derive, if, by my means, he could have the benefit of such second discount account with the Bank in my name. The mode proposed by him, to which I readily acceded, and which was accordingly afterwards adopted, and for a long time carried on without interruption, will account for the from in which the bills, mentioned in the indictment, are drawn, and will open at once to you, the nature of my defence. It was this -</p>
               <p>I knew that his connections were numerous and extensive; and he stated to me that he had much extended them; and this I believed to be true, from the encreased business I saw going on at his warehouse, He mentioned having a variety of houses, on whom, in the course of business, he had a right to draw to a much greater amount than the extent to which his discount account, at the Bank, was usually limitted; he therefore proposed that I should assist him, by drawing bills on his customers, in my name, though, in reality, on his account; and for debts due to himself, payable to my order; by; which means, his name would not appear on the bills so oftensibly drawn by me, though, in reality, his own; and would, therefore, be received and discounted at the Bank on my discount account; and, by this means, he would have the advantage he wished to gain by a double discount account with the Bank; the one in his own name, the other in mine. This mode was not, however, always adopted, as he sometimes brought me the promissory notes of his customers, payable to my order.</p>
               <p>On a consideration of this proposal, and being convinced that it would of course give Mr. Adamson the advantage he stood in need of, and that without injury to any one, I assented, and transactions, in this form, have been carried on with the Bank to a considerable amount.</p>
               <p>You will please to observe, in this transaction, there was nothing bordering on criminality; it was no more than the well known usuage, the avowed practice of merchants of the first respectability, that of accommodating each other by the loan of their names to negociable paper.</p>
               <p>It was evident to me that I was essentially serving Mr. Adamson by this accommodation; and I confess I did not foresee the possibility of any further hazard or risque on my part, than that of the failure of the persons on whom I thus drew; and satisfied as I was of the solvency of Mr. Adamson, that risque I was willing to run in his service.</p>
               <p>The persons on whom I thus from time to time drew on Mr. Adamson's account, being, as I was informed, his customers, some were of course unknown to me, and their signatures of acceptance, consequently, could not be by me suspected. The mode in which I drew on them was by having the names and sums furnished me by Mr. Adamson; and when I had drawn the bills, they were sometimes given, sometimes sent by me to Mr. Adamson, for him to procure the acceptance; and then they were returned to me to be sent into the Bank on my discount account; and when the amount; discounted, thereof, deducting the discount, was sent or given by me to Mr. Adamson, by draft on the Bank of England. In every case, I was furnished with the acceptance by Mr. Adamson; and in no case had any communication with the parties on whom the bills were drawn, and whom I always supposed to be the real customers or friends of Mr. Adamson.</p>

               <p>Circumstances of this nature, being in their principle founded in private confidence, it would not have been very surprizing if I had stood here on this simple statement, and called upon you for a belief of what I am now asserting, without a possibility of bringing any fort of evidence in support of this case. But most fortunately, I can prove, by several witnesses of respectability, that such was the nature of my transactions with Mr. Adamson. Several witnesses will be produced, who were in reality of the description I supposed all the persons to be on whom I drew for Mr. Adamson. These witnesses will tell you, that they dealt with Mr. Adamson, and were in the habit of accepting bills on his account, and for his use, which were drawn on them by me, without the name of Adamson appearing thereon; and that the reason of their so accepting my bill, though they held no connexion with me, was, that it was at Adamson's request, with a view, as they understood, to facilitate and extend his accommodation.</p>
               <p>In addition to this evidence, which establishes the general ground work of my defence, I shall be able to prove, that I paid over to Mr. Adamson, by my drafts on the Bank, the whole sums of money produced by the discount of the bills, which are the subject of the present prosecution; and also, that I was in the habit of paying to Mr. Adamson the amount of all the sums I so discounted at the Bank, in my own name, for him, which must remove all doubt of my guilt, since I can scarcely be supposed weak enough to incur the punishment of a capital offence, without receiving any emolument. The clerks and servants of Mr. Adamson will likewise be called, and will prove, in further corroboration of this case, my being in the habit of receiving bills from Mr. Adamson-sending them to him to procure the acceptance-and receiving them from him, when accepted, to get them discounted at the Bank. One very material circumstance will be proved by them strongly confirmative of the fact, that the produce of such bills, so discounted by me at the Bank, was received by Adamson, and not by me; it is that, in several instances, when I have left bills at the Bank for discount, and I have left town (my residence being at Bethnal-Green), before the time the Bank's answer could be received, I have left a blank draft on the Bank, at Adamson's ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180055"></xptr>compting-house, to be filled up by him, in my absence, according to the amount of the bills, which the Bank might have discounted, and which he received accordingly.</p>
               <p>These general proofs will, under the circumstances of this case (which you, Gentlemen, will bear in your minds, was a case of private confidence), be more than could, in common probability, be expected; and, in themselves, would, I trust, be sufficient to convince you of the true nature of the transaction, and consequently of my being innocent of all knowledge of the bills being forged.</p>
               <p>But fortunately for me, I am possessed of evidence, respecting the very identical bills on which this indictment is founded. A witness will be called, who will prove their being in the hands of Adamson before they were endorsed by me; that Adamson admitted they were drawn by me, at his request; and that I received them from Adamson, for the purpose of getting them discounted for him at the Bank; and that I afterwards gave the amount of such bills, when discounted, to Adamson.</p>
               <p>These facts must convince you, Gentlemen, of my being the ignorant means of procuring the discount of these bills, without any knowledge of the forgery; this is not circumstantial evidence, but positive and direct; and when added to the character of respectability and credit I have ever borne, and which nothing but the situation in which I stand, could induce me to mention, will, I trust, obtain me a verdict of acquittal.</p>
               <p>Conscious as I am of my innocence, and supported as my defence is by positive evidence, I feel a fort of unwillingness to attempt the strengthening my case by the observations I am about to make; but the duty I owe to my family, requires me, perhaps, to leave no circumstance unnoticed, which is worthy your attention. I would therefore, for a moment, draw your attention to my conduct, subsequent to the apprehension of Mr. Adamson on the charge of forgery. That I was shocked and alarmed at the intelligence, I confess; but such alarm arose from the ruinous consequences it was likely to produce on my affairs, if the outstanding bills, which I had discounted for Mr. Adamson, were not genuine, knowing my liberality as the discounter, to make them good; the steps I immediately took must convince you that this, and this alone was the ground of my alarms; for I immediately went to my attorney, and after stating the circumstance, went to the accompting-house of Mr. Adamson (the last place I should have gone to had I been conscious of guilt), where I found he was detained at the Bank on the charged of forgery. An accomplice would have flown, and that I had the opportunity of doing so, is evident, since I that night slept at home, and on the following day returned, with my attorney again to Adamson's accompting-house, with a determination to obtain what I could by way of indemnity, to the responsibility which attached to me on his account. I there, in the presence of his clerks, opened his bill-box, and actually brought away the contents, under the claim of a right so to do, by way of indemnity. What inference can you draw from such conduct, Gentlemen, but that I was acting under the consciousness of innocence, and on the idea that, having accommodated Adamson with my name as drawer, I had a right to seek and secure an indemnity. Among the bills in the box were two that had my endorsement on them, as having been most likely returned from the Bank, and refused discount; and knowing I should he liable, if they got into circulation with my endorsement, for the amounts of those bills, I erased my name, and left the bills in the box. And here I must remark, and press it as a point deserving your particular attention, that if I had had the most distant idea that those bills were forgeries, I should certainly have taken them away, or destroyed them; and not, by leaving them behind, furnish evidence against myself, which might at least subject me to the inconvenience of explaining how my name happened to appear on them.</p>
               <p>I did more, Gentlemen of the Jury, I left word with Adamson's servants, if I was wanted by any one, where I should be, and at which place I accordingly waited sometime, and afterwards went home, where I slept that night as usual. On the following day, I received a letter from Messrs. Winter and Kay, to attend at their office; I did attend accordingly, at that time, and at two subsequent meetings before my actual commitment, was anxious to enter into an explanation of the transaction, and pledged myself, if allowed to inspect my checks an the Bank, and refer to certain books I described, to clear myself to their satisfaction; but, unfortunately for me, my entreaties were not then attended to, or I should have rendered my standing before you unnecessary: for I cannot believe that, if I had been allowed to state and prove to them, what I have now stated, and am about to prove to you, any Magistrate would have thought it right to commit me.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall now only observe, that the attention of the commercial world has been a good deal engaged on the subject of the charges brought against myself and Mr. Adamson; and some rumours may have come to your ears, or some statements been seen by you, in the public papers, which may have engendered a prejudice against me. However, Gentlemen, I am confident, that you will, under his Lordship's direction, not forget that it is your duty only to attend to the evidence produced before you, and to discharge your minds from any such prejudice.</p>
               <p>I fully rely upon the candour and impartiality of a Jury of my countrymen; and, conscious of my innocence, have not held back from this public investigative, but voluntarily came forward as soon as I was sent for.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a linen-draper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, at any time in February, carrying any bill or note to Mr. Adamson? - A. No; I was in Mr. Adamson's house in February, almost every day; I saw Mr. Adamson throw some bills across to Mr. Wilkinson, and desire him to go to the Bank and get them discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what they were? - A. I did not; but I heard them converse about what they were; one of them was upon Favell, Bousfield, and Company; and another was upon Mr. Howell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see it afterwards, or hear what became of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I take out one bill, and say, that that bill had been in before, and had been sent back, and that I did not like to send it in again, and that was this very bill of Mr. Favell's? - A. I don't know whose bill it was; I recollect the circumstances perfectly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Do you know much of Mr. Adamson's transactions? - A. A great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. The bills that he brought were bills ready made? - A. Yes; he threw them to Mr. Wilkinson out of a case.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH KING sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Adamson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Wilkinson? - A. Yes; I told Mr. Adamson I should want a bill renewed of 297l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Conversation with Mr. Adamson certainly is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible for me to receive it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What did you do in consequence of that conversation? - A. Mr. Wilkinson drew the bill, on the 20th of September, 1797, for Mr. Adamson, (produces the bill); Mr. Adamson was in the country.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I suppose Mr. Wilkinson had funds in your hands to answer this? - A. None; he renewed the bill for Mr. Adamson at my request.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had Mr. Wilkinson any demand upon you? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You had accepted a mere accommodation bill? - A. No; I wished it to be renewed, Mr. Adamson was out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Wilkinson, who had been his partner, transacted business for him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore Mr. Wilkinson drew upon you another bill, which you, the acceptor, accepted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. I have no conception how this sort of evidence can possibly apply, there is nothing upon earth in it.</p>
               <p>- LUSH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. Do you know the prisoner Wilkinson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of the circumstance of Mr. Adamson being detained by the Bank upon a charge against him? - A. Only from hearsay.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any message being sent by the Solicitor of the Bank to Mr. Wilkinson, after it was notorious that Mr. Adamson was in custody upon a charge of this nature, and that he went to the Solicitor of the Bank? -</p>

In consequence of information which I received, I directed Smith, the watchman, to notice him; from the information which he gave me, on the 18th of October I examined two fire-places, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and discovered a bag containing about 6 lbs. of indigo in one fire-place, and in the other two pieces of cream of tartar, about half a pound each, worth 9 d., and a piece of soap. The indigo was of considerable value - they were concealed there. I marked the soap and cream of tartar, and replaced them there. Next day, when the prisoner was leaving work, Armstrong searched him in my presence; he was asked if he had any thing about him belonging to his master? he said, No, twice over. Armstrong found the two pieces of marked tartar on him, but not the soap. He begged for mercy, and said it was the first he had ever taken. I went to the bag of indigo, and found near half of it gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You found it in the fire-place on the 18th - A. Yes, and found it on him on the 19th - it was worth 5 d. He afterwards said he took it as a medicine for his son. I did not know his son was ill. He had no business to take it without leave.</p>

            . I am a watchman, employed by the prosecutor. On the 18th of October, about ten minutes after six o'clock in the evening, I was on the premises; I went into the back shop, heard the prisoner overhead, called to him twice, but received no answer. I then returned from the further end of the shop, and at the top of the ladder, which leads into the drying room, I saw the prisoner; before I could speak to him, he said he wanted to see me concerning his blue vat.</p>
               <p>Q, Were the men allowed to be in that part of the premises at that time of night - A. No; I followed him into the dyehouse - he had a dark coloured bag in his hand, with something in it. When he was in the woollen dye-house he attempted to put it down on the left hand side; he then took the bag up, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will go and see if the fire is out;" in about three minutes he returned without the bag, and went away. I told my master. I went with my master and the clerk to the stokehole, where the prisoner had been, and found the cream of tartar and soap - I brought it up to my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever know a man stop after that time - A. Certainly.</p>

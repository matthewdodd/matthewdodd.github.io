On the 24th of July, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Belgrave-place, Pimlico, about two miles and a half from Walham-green; he had two coats on and two pairs of trousers - I went and asked where he was going; he said he had got up rather too soon, and was going to Jew's-row, Chelsea, to awake a friend to go to Coventgarden market; I asked where he lived - he said at Fulham; I told him he was going the contrary way - he said he came through Knightsbridge for a walk, being up too early - I took him to the station-house, and found this shawl, handkerchief, and stockings, all stuffed in the crown of his hat; he said he had bought them at a large linendraper's at Putney, at nine o'clock in the morning before; I asked if he bought them for his mother or sister, he said No, for his girl, and that he lived at No. 6, down the Almonry.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of stealing the goods, or breaking into the house - I bought them at a pawnbroker's, as I told the Policeman when he took me; I defy any body to say they saw me go near the house, or come out of it.</p>

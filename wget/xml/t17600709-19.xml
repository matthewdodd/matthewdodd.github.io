I knew the wages and prize money would amount to upwards of 60 l. I then told them they must administer for upper value, that is, to exceed 60 l. I saw no more of them after this for some days; then they came and brought an administration, and desired I would apply to Mr. Dixon to receive this prize money, as an agent for the prisoner, to receive the prize money only.

               <p>Dixon. When the books come home, we have them examin'd at the Navy office, to see what men are dead; and the dead men are paid by administration, and the living by letter of attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any difficulty of paying the money?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I do not remember I did; I remember 2 or 3 days after, when Mr. Moxey came, I bid him take care how he brought himself into a scrape; I think he said he would have nothing more to do with them.</p>
               <p>Jol. Robins. I was apply'd to by Mr. Farrer's clerk, named Jones, to attend for Mr. Farrer as proctor for him. I attended with Mr. Jones at Doctors Commons before Dr. Ducarrel, with a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know him?</p>
               <p>Robins. I cannot be certain to him, I never saw him only last sessions and now; since, if it is he, I went with a person there, and he swore himself brother by the half blood to the deceased, and by that means obtained letters of administration; I was present, and attested it as a notary public.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this.</p>
               <p>Robins. (He takes a writing in his hand) This is my attestation, and here is Dr. Ducarrel's hand writing (pointing to it.)</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Farrer, a Proctor in the Commons; the prisoner came with 2 women to the office; I ask'd him if the deceased had made a Will; he said no. I ask'd him how near a kin he was to him; he said he was a brother by the half blood, and that he did not know any other kin he had.</p>

               <p>Q. Look about the court, do you see any body here that sign'd it?</p>

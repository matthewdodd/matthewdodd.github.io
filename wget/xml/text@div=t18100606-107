             rose about six o'clock in the morning, he left the room and returned several times between six and eight, and every time he came into the room he made it his business to speak to me, I answered him every time but the last time and then I heard him at the foot of the bed where my clothes and the money lay, I believe that was the time that he took my money, I still thought that he was at the foot of the bed, but when I looked he was gone; I did not see him again till about ten o'clock, he came and placed himself by the side of me and asked me how I did; I called him to the door, I said, now you know what I want to speak to you about, and if you have taken it in a joke you should not have kept it so long from me, he said, he did not know what I meaned, and if I had lost any money or property it was nothing to him, he said, there were other people in the house, he had seen a soldier in the passage brushing his gaiters, he denied having the money, I charged the watchman with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not any body else come into the room - A. Not from the time that he got up till I got up. A soldier came to the door and bid me good bye, he did not come in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came unfortunately to this house to sleep, he challenged me with taking the money; I told him I knew nothing of the money, I got up at six o'clock, went out and got shaved and came in again, I asked the landlord who was in the room with him; the landlord told me his comrade that drank with him last night, I heard the soldier in the room with him. They came to me in prison, and asked me if I would give up the money I had upon me and they would not appear against me; I told them I would not, I would be tried by God and my country.</p>

               <p>Did you see any other person running in the street? - My Lord it is so clear, and I believe Red-lion-street is well known in this court, I saw no man in the street, I could see from the top to the bottom, I had not been I suppose half a minute while I was struggling with him, before the boy and the other people came up, and the boy said give me my watch cases, give me my watch cases; the prisoner said nothing to my recollection, only said he had not got them, several people came round and wanted to search him, and one of the persons that came first up, that laid hold of him with me was accused of picking a gentleman's pocket, or his hand in his pocket, or something of that sort, I therefore thought I was in a situation I did not much like, and I desired they would send for a constable, and that somebody would assist me, and nobody would, I then said to the prisoner, friend as the boy says you have taken his watch cases, I will take you to the magistrate myself, I then rather exerted myself, and took him to Justice Blackborough's; when we were there they proposed to go back to the place to look for the watch cases, and while we were there a message came that they were found in Dr. Haines's entry.</p>

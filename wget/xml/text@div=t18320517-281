I missed this money from my box about two o'clock on the 9th of April; I had seen it safe on the Saturday fortnight before - it was in a green purse; I have three beds in my room, and let them out; my wife kept the key of the box: on unlocking it the purse and money were gone, with my marriage certificate, which was in the purse, between the silver and gold; it was all enclosed in a white silk stocking - the prisoner was taken up on the 18th; she slept in my room till then - my marriage certificate was found in her pocket, but only 1d. in money- four persons besides her slept in the room; the prisoner said the devil a farthing should I ever see again; she went out drunk on the Friday before, and was out all night, and on the Sunday night she was drunk.</p>

            . I kept the key of my husband's box in my pocket. On the Friday before the money was missed, I left the room to fetch something for my husband - I left the key in the box; the prisoner was sitting in the window, and there was an old woman, who was very ill, and unable to get out of bed; I was out about five minutes, and when I retuned the key was still in the box; I had seen the money safe that day - I did not examine the box till Monday: when I told the prisoner the money was missed she said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>JOHN SUTTON. I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner on the 18th of April, and found Keefe's marriage certificate on her; Mrs. Keefe directly said, "Oh, Sullivan! you are guilty, for that is my marriage line" - the prisoner replied, "The devil of a farthing of the money will you ever see again;" she was rather forward in liquor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They were fighting on the Monday, this man, his wife, and brother-in-law - the wife took up the box and swore in a most desperate manner she would never live with him another day; she threw the box about- he took his clothes out of the box, and said, "You may go, but shan't have the money;" he then looked, and said,"Oh! I am robbed of all my money" - next day they went to a fortune-teller, then got the Bible, and turned it on me- as to the certificate, she knew I had got it, for I picked it up with some papers which the prosecutor tore; she told me to take care of it - the woman who slept in the room is not bed-ridden.</p>
               <p>MRS. KEEFE. I never saw the certificate loose about the room - it was between the gold and silver in the purse- the woman could not get up without help.</p>

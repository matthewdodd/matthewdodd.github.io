                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines at Woolwich—I know the prisoner—he has been in the habit of coming to the barracks to see a companion of mine—on Tuesday, 9th April, I missed from my room two coat slings—they were two separate straps, used for the purpose of fastening the coat on to the knapsack—I had seen them safe on the Monday—the prisoner had been in the barracks on the Sunday, and also on the Tuesday—he was in my room on the Tuesday—the strap I lost was marked on the wrong side, and there were two or three bayonet marks on it, a spot of grease at the end, and a prick with a penknife—the straps are usually marked with black paint—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my strap—after missing my strap, in consequence of information I received, I went to a brick—field at Woolwich—I saw the prisoner there—he had my strap on him—I did not know then that it was my strap—I accused him of it—I did not examine the strap then—I told him to come home, that he was wanted—nothing else passed between us—I saw a strap taken from him—I examined that strap—I found marks upon it by which I identified it as mine; the marks I have mentioned—I identified it as the one I lost—allow me to look at this strap again (<hi rend="italic">examining it</hi>) this is the strap; here are the marks—the black paint mark has been scratched out—this is marked on the wrong side, as my strap was—these are the bayonet marks—I made the holes for the tongue of my strap to go in—those marks would not be in an ordinary strap—the prisoner said he had bought the strap in Petticoat-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am colour-sergeant in the Royal Marines—in consequence of information I received I went, on 15th April, with the prosecutor to a brick-field, and saw the prisoner at his house—I asked him if he had a belt on him—he said he had—this is the belt—he handed it to me—I do not know whose belt it is—I know it to be a military coat sling or belt such as a Marine wears—they ought to be marked with each man's name on the inside—I know that when this recruit joined the service his belt was marked on the wrong side, and it appears that this has been marked on the wrong side, and then the name erased—I know that he was served out with two coat slings, and that one of the two was marked on the wrong side—it is usually marked in black paint—I asked the prisoner where he got the belt—he said he bought it in Petticoat-lane—I handed it over to Castles, and asked if it was his, and he said yes, he was certain, it was his by the bayonet marks and the penknife mark at the end, and the spot of grease—these slings are often missing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose they sometimes get lost, or the soldiers dispose of them for drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are cases of that description—the prosecutor said at once that he was confident it was his belt by its being marked on the wrong side, by the bayonet stabs, the mark of the penknife, and the spot of grease, and also by the way in which he had cat the end of it, which he ought not to have done according to the regulation of the service—the names of the men are put into all the belts that are served out to the men—they are marked with wooden type, which is served out to every man in the service—I happen to know that the prosecutor's belt was accidentally marked on the wrong side—I remember finding fault with him for it on parade—the other part of it has not been found—the prisoner did not say when he had bought it—he was wearing it round his waist underneath his jacket—I could not see it, his dress went over it—he handed it to me immediately.</p>

I am a private in the Marines at Woolwich—on 9th April I saw the prisoner in the barracks in our room—on Monday evening, the 15th, I saw him at Greenwich and had some conversation with him—he said he had picked up a small piece of belt which would do for a razor strap—he did not show it to me—he did not state where he had picked it up.</p>

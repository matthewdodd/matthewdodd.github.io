                  </hi>. The prisoner is my wife. On Saturday night, the 12th of October, I came home between five and six o'clock—I had some words with her that night—we had an altercation for some time—she put herself into a great rage, took up the poker, and said she would dash my brains out—she struck me with it several times, and made my arm very bad—I went out, thinking her passion would cool—I afterwards came home and went to bed—I got up before seven o'clock in the morning, and as I was dressing I thought she was asleep—(I slept in the same bed with her,) but after I got out of the room she came out in a rage, and swore she would murder me—she took up the chamber-pot with the contents, came after me in a rage like a bear, and struck me with it on the head and side of my face—it cut me very much—I bled profusely—she only struck me once—it broke the pot all to pieces, and cut me on the cheek, just below the eye—it stunned me for a few minutes, and then I recovered myself<lb></lb>one of the lodgers came down and endeavoured to stop the blood—a po<lb></lb>liceman was sent for, and she was given in charge—I became an out pa<lb></lb>tient of the London Hospital—I am not quite recovered now—I lost a deal of blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at the London Hospital, I saw the prosecutor on the 13th of October—he had a severe wound on the left cheek, which was bleeding considerably when he came—it required a ligature to be put on the artery, which was divided—he must have lost a considerable quantity of blood before I saw him, which was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I considered him in danger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for about two o'clock on the Sunday to take the prisoner into custody—she was using very abusive threatening language then towards her husband, and swore she would break his d—old head, and also his legs before she slept—I took her to the station-house, with the assistance of another constable—she was very violent, and was not sober at the time.</p>

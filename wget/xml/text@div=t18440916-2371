                  </hi>. I live at Marsh-gate, Richmond, Surrey. The pri<lb></lb>soner and his wife lodged at my house—on a Thursday, in the middle of Aug., they were up stairs in their room—I was ironing below—his wife came run<lb></lb>ning down to me—in consequence of what she said I unfastened her clothes, and saw she was bleeding very much—the blood was on her stays on her left side, and on her linen—she went out to Mr. Hopley's, and was brought home with Mr. Lomas, the surgeon.</p>

On Thursday, the 22nd of Aug., I was in a room of Mrs. Stacey's house, up stairs—my husband was at home—we had a few words, very trifling, and I threw some tea in his face, and then he struck me with a knife on my shoulder—we were at tea at the time there was bread and butter on the table, for which he would use the knife—I had my working dress on—I had been out at work—he struck me. under the arm—I did not see the knife—I did not see him take up the knife at all—I was standing at the side of the table—he did not say anything when he struck me—I ran down to Mrs. Stacey, and then to a neighbour's house, and Mr. Lomas was sent for.</p>

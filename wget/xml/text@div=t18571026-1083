                  </hi>. I am clerk to the directors of the poor of the parish of St. Pancras. The prisoner was the cook at the workhouse—he was paid a salary by the directors—he had a room appropriated to his use in the workhouse—he did not sleep there—on 21st Sept., I went with some other persons to his room—it was locked; I obtained the key from the master—I found a brown paper bag on a table, and two cupboards locked up—I left them locked, and sealed them up—there was a locker locked up, which I sealed, and the window was sealed also; I locked the room—on 23rd, I went again with the prisoner—I opened the room, and the cupboards and locker were just as they were left—the cupboards and locker were unlocked by the prisoner, he had the key—in the locker was a quantity of loose sugar, and a broken basin, which was all over sugar—the sugar was left there; in the cupboards was a large bag of sugar which was afterwards weighed, and which weighed, I think, 40 lbs.—I think the sugar in the locker was about the same weight, and there was a lump lying by the side, about the size of my two hands—the prisoner said he should wish to explain as to the sugar, as the storekeeper might get into some trouble—he said it was sweepings, and had accumulated for two years and a half.</p>

A Yes; Mr. Young was present—the prisoner said it was quite necessary to send for the storekeeper, and for him to make explanation—it was almost immediately after he said it was sweepings—I went on the 21st, and sealed the place up till the 23rd, from Monday till Wednesday—the prisoner was suspended on the 15th, and he did not return to the workhouse till the 23rd—he was desired not to do so, and as far as I know, he did not—the directors meet once a week for general business, and other times for standing committees—it was said that the directors dined there once a week</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not one of the directors say he would not work without he was paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe there was something of that—the meat for the direc<lb></lb>tors comes out of the ratio—Mr. Young is a director—he never dines there to my knowledge—up to the time the prisoner was charged, he bore a very good character—he has been there since Aug., 1849—I have no doubt he bad a good character when he came.</p>

I am storekeeper at the workhouse; it was part of my duty to supply the prisoner with sugar—I supplied him daily, and also weekly—the weekly supply was on Wednesday—I daily supplied him with 26 lbs. in two cans of 13 lbs. in each—his duty was to supply the kitchen, and to sweeten the tea of the paupers—the whole of the tea was put into a copper—the Wednesday supply was nine bags of 28 lbs. in each—that was to be weighed out in half pounds to a certain class of inmates who were allowed to sweeten their own tea—the quantity fixed was to be deli<lb></lb>vered out by him—I have seen the bag found in the prisoner's room—it was the same kind of bag as those which contained the sugar I supplied—I was sent for, and saw the sugar found in his room—it was the same kind of sugar as I supplied to him.</p>

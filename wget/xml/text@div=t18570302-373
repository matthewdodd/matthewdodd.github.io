                  </hi>. I am waiter to Mr. Benjamin Poole, of the Wine Shades, London Bridge. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon of 13th Feb. I saw the prisoner—he came into the wine room, and asked for a glass of sherry; I</p>

               <p>served him, and he paid for it—he sat down and drank it—I retired into the lobby—I afterwards went down stairs to serve another gentleman that came in—the prisoner then began to come across the room and walk out; I left off serving my customer, and got upon the stairs and watched the prisoner through a glass door—I saw him take a coat off a nail in the lobby—it was my master, Mr. Benjamin Poole's—he threw the coat over hit arm, and walked deliberately into the street; I allowed him to go out into Thames-street, and then caught hold of him by the collar—he wanted to know what I was going to do with him; I said, to give him in charge of the police; he begged me not to do so; he wrestled with me a little while, but finding he could not get away, he begged me to take him inside, and he would give me any money, which I refused to take—he appeared to under<lb></lb>stand me perfectly when I spoke English to him—he threw the coat down, and I believe my fellow witness Rhodes threw it into the passage—I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

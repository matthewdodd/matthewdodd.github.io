                  </hi>. I am a waiter at his Lordship's larder, 111, Cheapside. On Wednesday, 30th Nov., in the latter part of the day, the prisoner came there and took some refreshment in one of the boxes—I do not recollect whether he had a great coat on—he sat reading the newspapers for about two hours in the same box—he then asked one of the waiters if it was raining still, and got up, went outside into the street, and came back again in a moment, but did not go into the box in which he had been sitting before, he took a</p>

               <p>seat in the middle of the room, and remained there about ten minutes reading the paper, he then deliberately got up, took a great coat off a peg where he was sitting—he then walked up to the desk where money is received, and as I suppose, settled; he then bade Mr. Jones, the proprietor, who was in the desk with the cashier, good night, and went away with the coat—I afterwards heard Mr. Hutchings making inquiries respecting his coat; he pointed out to me the nail on which he said he had hung it—that was the same nail from which I had seen the coat taken; there was no other coat on that nail—I know the prisoner by his being in the habit of coming to the house, and have no doubt he is the person who took the coat—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of His Lordship's Larder, dining rooms for the middling classes. On Wednesday afternoon, 30th Nov. about 4 o'clock, the prisoner came in—he had no great coat on; he never were one—I had seen him two or three times a week for the three months preceding—I swear distinctly that he had no great coat; he had on the under coat which he has on now; I never saw him with a top coat—I did not take any notice of him while he was there; nothing occurred between the time of his coming in and the time he left—when he went away he simply bade me good night—he had a great coat thrown across his arm—he had, on a previous occasion, introduced himself to me as an author, and asked me to subscribe to a work of his, which I did, and on the Saturday evening after this matter happened I went to the printer of the book, Hodson, of Castle-street, Finsbury, who referred me to the binder, and he accompanied the prosecutor and me to the lodging of the prisoner, in Cavendish-street,</p>

               <p>New North-road, and found him there (I took the poem I had purchased, in my pocket; it is called "The Lost Chief; an Epic Poem on the late Duke of Wellington")—I told him he had stolen a great coat from the larder, and he must go with me to the station house—he said he had not stolen it, and he would not go; but in a few minutes he consented to go with me—the prosecutor was waiting outside, and gave him into custody of a policeman, who was waiting also—on the road to the station he threw the duplicate for a waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) into the road—I afterwards returned to his lodgings with the prosecutor and two officers, a search was made, and we found this pair of gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) between the bed and the bedstead—at the time the prisoner left I had just relieved the cashier; it would have been his duty to take the money—the cashier went away instantly—the prisoner did not pay me the money for his dinner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the London and Westminster Bank, and live at Alder-terrace, Camberwell. On Wednesday, 30th Nov., I went to His Lordship's Larder; I took off my great coat, and hung it on a peg, on a pillar, in the middle of the room; my wrapper and gloves were in the pockets—that was a place where I had been usually in the habit of hanging it—I then had my dinner, and afterwards missed my coat from the peg—I immediately told Mr. Jones of my loss—these gloves are mine; I am certain of them—I know them by a hole in the thumb, and a particular strip or seam of leather on them, and also by three slight marks outside the little finger—on the Saturday I went with Mr. Jones and the policeman to the prisoner's house, and saw my gloves, found between the bed and the sacking—I have no knowledge of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a paper hanger; we live at No. 43, Cavendish-street, New North-road; the prisoner lodged there. On Wednesday, evening, 30th Nov., he came home, and I let him in; he had a great coat on, and looked very warm—he had not been in the habit of wearing a great coat; I had never seen him with one before, and have never seen it since—it was not the coat he has on now.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here ready as follows</hi>: I have one thing to state, that Mr. Jones is decidedly wrong in saying he saw me enter the room that day without a great coat; Mr. Jones is very seldom in the room in the daytime, and was not there when I entered it; Mr. Jones states also that I did not pay him; very natural, Mr. Jones had just come from above, and I had previously paid his clerk at the desk, which is his office; I went out to see if it rained, and I found it did, and returned; I sat there a few minutes; I took down my coat, and went to the desk; seeing Mr. Jones there, I said,' I have paid; I do not think it rains so much; I shall bid you good night;' he bade me good night, as also the clerk; with respect to the gloves which have been sworn to, they are my own property; I can prove where I purchased them, three years ago, in my native town; as to their being under the bed, it is a matter of very little moment; if one has a room he can put his things where it is convenient; I have nothing more to say than that the charge made against me is decidedly wrong.)</p>

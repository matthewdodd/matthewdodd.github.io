               <p>I am servant to Mr. Bolt, on Wednesday the 21st of Nov. about half past three in the afternoon, I was coming up <placeName id="t17921215-29-crimeloc174">Dice Key gateway</placeName>

I followed him, and came to him, and clapped my hand on his knee, and I found there was some sugars; I asked him where he was going, he said he was going for some tobacco; he attempted to get away, but I held him, and asked him to come and shew me where he got the sugar from, I found the sugar concealed inside his trowsers; I took him down to the counting house, and sent for the constable, and had him searched. I took nine pounds of sugar from him, raw sugar. The warehouse belongs to

            ; when I had sent him with the constable, I went up in the warehouse to see where he had got the sugar, and I found one of the hogsheads with the head knocked in, and there appeared some deficiency in the sugar; with that we weighed the hogshead, and there was a deficiency of about fifteen or sixteen pounds, we had taken a sample out of it, we supposed to be two or three pounds.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. Was I at work at the sugar warehouse that day, or the day before? - He was at work that day, I did not employ him, but one of my fellow servants employed him, he had just had 4 d. for his hire; he was employed in the warehouse among some men.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to the Custom-house, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody; he had a pair of callico trowsers under the other, and the sugar in these callico trowsers about his knees, and some of it at the back part; the trowsers seemed to be made on purpose, they are here, I have kept them from that time to this.</p>

I had been at work that afternoon at that warehouse, and earned 2 d. and did not find out any more work all the blessed afternoon. I was going home, seeing another man on the Keys, says he, there is a small bundle of hoops to light my fire; stooping for his bundle of hoops, please you, my Lord, there was a man lay with something wrapped up in it; says he, here is a prize, he unfolded this mat, and in this mat there was sugar; with that there says he, the second blunder is as good as the first. I thought no harm in it, and I takes this quantity which was found about me, and the other man whether he took the remainder or no, I cannot say; so coming up the gate, I turned to go home, and there was this gentleman standing by the door, I walked up farther, and was going for a halfpennyworth of shag tobacco; he says, where have you been at work? I said, no where; says he, you have been at work in the warehouse; says I, I have been in the hemp warehouse, and have earned 2 d. Says he, come back to me, I told him I would after I had bought the tobacco; there was the King's watchman walking under the gateway, who certainly would have told whether I went up in the sugar warehouse and come down; he could not miss seeing me; I have no witnesses but God Almighty.</p>

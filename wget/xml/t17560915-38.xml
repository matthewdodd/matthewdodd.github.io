I took hold of the pot and drank to the man of the house, he drank to Clark, and Clark to the prisoner, the prisoner drank it up, and bid the landlord till it. Then the prisoner went and sat down by the right side of the prosecutor, sat there some time, and sang a song or two; at last he removed from thence, and sat at the corner of the box; after that he came and sat by me, Clark and I being drinking together in the opposite box. The prosecutor got up, and feeling for his watch said. I have lost my watch. The prisoner went out directly. Clark had some suspicion of him, as he lodged in the house and had never seen the prisoner there before, so went out after him. [He was obliged to go into the country next morning, so we are destitute of his evidence.] I went out soon after, and then the prisoner was at the door again; they were arguing who should go in first. Clark said, I lodge here, and can come in when I please. I asked what was the matter, and the prisoner saying he would not go in, I took him by the collar, led him in, and searched him. Then Clark said, he has been up a little further, let us go and see if he has not left the watch there. We went, and there I saw the watch lying under a bench by the side of a door, about a dozen or 14 yards from the house where we were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Clark go to him to the place where you found the watch before the prisoner came in?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, he did not, but stood at the door and call'd to him, and he came to the door; nobody went thither till after we had brought the prisoner into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Clark been out of the house before you went out ?</p>
               <p>Williams. I believe he had not been gone above a minute or two.</p>

               <p>Q. What day did you lose these things - A. On the 6th of August the prisoner was to bring me a nurse child, she told me I should have eight shillings a week, I gave her a cup of tea, I went to my box and brought some half-pence out to buy some fresh butter, and this money I had in my hand, when I went out I left my money in a black silk glove in my box, two notes, two shillings, and a gown and a silk handkerchief were also in my box, I left her in the room when I went out and no one else. I returned in about ten minutes, I found her there, she had two cups of tea poured out when I came in, then she asked me for her to go the yard, she did not drink any tea. She went out and never came back.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she take with her. - A. Two one-pound notes, two dollars, two shillings, two gowns, and a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered any of these. - A. No, I am sure they were in the box when I took the money out, I had the money in my hand before I went out for the butter, and my gowns and handkerchief I saw in the box, and there was no one in the room but herself. I missed them in four minutes after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was there, I know nothing of the money or the gown.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Chaplin, of 7, King-street, Blackheath-hill, about twenty yards from the prosecutor's stables, opposite—from my window I can see the stables—on Saturday, 14th October, about half-past 2, I was at my back window, and saw two pieces of meat pass through a grating in the wall of Mr. Gattey's stables—the prisoner Bowen received them—I could not see who was inside the stables—she took the meat indoors to her own house—it was a piece of mutton and a piece of beef—I cannot see the stable door, only the grating.</p>

Bowen, her husband, and stoop down, and Mr. Bowen put his thumb up and pointed to the house—Martin came into the house, and I saw him take a piece of meat from under his coat and give it to Mrs. Bowen—she is married—I was at the top of the stairs—she smiled and took the meat—about a week before that she told me that if I was not a fool, and kept my counsel, I could always have a good joint of meat—I told her I thought she was very foolish, and she had much better not do anything of the kind—on the Saturday she brought me a piece of meat that I saw come through the grating, and I told her then that if I saw anything more of it, I should go and tell Mr. Gattey—she called me foolish—she is the landlady of the house I live in—I lodge with her.</p>

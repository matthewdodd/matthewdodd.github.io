I went down in a hurry, and left the key upon the chest in a mistake; I forgot myself; I went down stairs, and did not recollect the key till a man came in for change for another guinea, about an hour, or an hour and a half after; I felt in my pocket for the key, which I always carried on the right side of my breeches; I immediately recollected I had left the key upon the chest; the room door was locked, I opened it, and as soon as I opened it there lay the key, at the top of the chest, as I had left it; I opened the chest, and took 20s. more out, I locked the door of the chest, and the door of the room; I had no thoughts of the girl taking any of the money; I had no notion she had robbed me; I was rather busy; I did not go up stairs till we went to bed; I happened to be unwell; next morning I made my wife get up before me; when the brewers came, early in the morning, they waked me; I recollected I had put up thirty guineas, having to pay my brewer; I opened the chest, and counted my money immediately; the first thing I did was to count the gold, and I threw it down upon the table, and there was only twenty guineas in it instead of thirty; I opened a little bag that had thirty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020062"></xptr>shillings in silver in it, I missed five; I then counted the halfpence, ten pound, made up in 5s. papers; I missed two papers; I then came down stairs, and enquired for the girl; she had absconded; she had been away between two and three hours; I went in search of her; I enquired, and found out where she was; I found her over the way at a neighbour's house, up stairs, among some of her old acquaintances; I came and told my wife she was there, and we fetched her over to our house; we took her into a room where the money was taken from, and I sent for a neighbour that keeps a chandler's shop, and told him of what had happened; he questioned the girl, I was by at the time; she denied at first, but I locked the door and left him with her, and sent for Treadway, the constable; she told him she took the money out of the chest; she said, she took the money to a woman in St. Giles's; the constable then took her, and I went with them.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did she say how much money there was? - A. Yes; she said she took 5s. of silver, she mentioned the halfpence, and as for the gold, she said she took a piece of paper off the table, and put it on the floor, and took out of a purse some guineas; she did not know how many; she put the guineas into a piece of paper, lapped it up, and gave it to a woman in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take the prisoner with you to this woman in St. Giles's? - A. Yes; when we came to the place where she said the women lived, we could not find the woman; we took her then to Bow-street; and when she came there, she said she had robbed me of my money; On the Sunday evening she was sent out for pots, and came home very much in liquor, and my wife was obliged to put her to bed.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Q. Did she ever return you any part of the money? - A. No.</p>

               <p>JOHN HILL, JUN. I live in Lower Frederick-street, Connaught-square. On the 14th of June I went to <placeName id="t18310630-77-crimeloc421">Shepherd's-bush</placeName>

               <p>JOHN GANNON. I am a Police-constable. I received information from Hill - I went to the prisoner's father's house, I saw his sister at the door - I asked her if she knew any thing about her brother; I thought from the description that he was the boy - she said he had run down Wood-lane; I was not satisfied, and went to the back of the house, where I found him concealed behind a door in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300058"></xptr>a back room - I asked what he did with the money which he took out of the gentleman's pocket: he said he did not take the money out of his pocket, but he found 1s. by the side of his waistcoat - I searched him, and found on him 9d. in copper, and a knife; the lads who were with him are not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not rob the gentleman - I found 1s. 6d. by the side of the clothes.</p>

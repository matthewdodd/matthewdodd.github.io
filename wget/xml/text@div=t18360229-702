                  </hi>. I am Receiver of fines and forfeitures in his Majesty's customs, and was so on the 27th of November, 1834. I do my business in the Custom-house—there is an outer office, called the receiver of fines office, and I have an inner room to myself—this plan of the place (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) appears to be tolerably correct—the entrance from Thames-street and other place are accurately described—in November 1834, there was a considerable sale of property at the custom-house—the produce of the sale would come into my hands as receiver of fines—a few months before that, there had been another sale, upon which the amount was considerably less, which would leave a less sum in my hands—on the 27th of november, 1834, the amount of money in my hands was 4292<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. belonging to the Crown, and about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think of my own, and Mr. Billings had given me 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take care of for him—that was all in the chest on the night of the 27th of November—the property was principally in Bank-notes—on the morning of the 27th I had sent a great</p>

               <p>quantity of gold to the Bank, and received bank notes for it—there were two of £300 notes belonging to the Crown, and one in particular, which I remember besides those—I have a list of all the notes here—I made the balance myself—another person entered the figures—I counted the notes over at the time—there were four of £300, one of £200, eight of £100, ten of £50, two of £40, five of £30, fifteen of £20, fifty-three of £10, twenty-eight of £5, and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and cash 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that might be silver and copper—there was more money belonging to the King, about £200 in notes, 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that makes up the sum I first mentioned—there was a £10 and £5 note among my 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Billings' money was four £100 Bank-notes—this money was put into the King's chest, which is in my own private office, in the inner room—it was secured by two padlocks, and there was another lock to it—the key of that lock was out of order—it is called the stop-lock—the keys of the two padlocks were kept, one in my custody, and the other by the Accountant of petty receipts—the chest could not be properly opened without the concurrence of us two—I occasionally kept my key about my own person, and occasionally locked up in a drawer in my office—my office is private, and separate from all other business of the Custom-house—no body should come there except my two clerks, and the Accountant of petty receipts—when persons come on business, they come from a door facing me—there is not any separation between me and them—the door commu<lb></lb>nicates between the inner and outer office—persons who buy goods at the Custom-house sales, come to me to deliver their tickets and pay money—they come into the inner office—I was at the office on the 27th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, 1834, till about twenty minutes to four o'clock, as near as I can recollect—I left the money all safe in the chest, and the chest locked—I left my own key in the drawer, where I usually put it, when it was not about my person—I went to the office next morning at a few minutes after ten o'clock—(I was not the last person in the office that night)—when I came in the morning there was a rumour or clamour about what had happened—when I entered my office I found two persons present—I found the Ac<lb></lb>countant of petty receipts padlock to the chest was violently broken—my own was locked, and the key in my drawer—the drawer was broken open—it had been forced open—all the notes I have mentioned, and the money, were gone—I had some private bonds which were left—they were foreign securities—they remained there—they must have been touched—the cash-box was of considerable weight—there were three cash-boxes—the money belonging to the Crown was in one cash-box—Mr. Billing's money was in a private cash-box, and my own also—they were all gone.</p>

I believe—I should have to give change for the note, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a catalogue</hi>), T.C. Jones bought that lot—I do not know in what name it was cleared, as the book is destroyed, by the leaves being taken out in which it was entered—I believe these three 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes to be part of the property stolen that night (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I know them by the date and number—I have not any memorandums of my own of what the numbers were—there is nothing of mine written on the notes—I do not see any memorandum of mine on this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—my office is in the parish of St. Dunstan-in-the-East—the warehouse is part of the Custom-house—Miss Kelly, the housekeeper, lived in the Custom-house—she lived and slept there as servant of the Custom-house—you can go from my office to any part of the Custom-house at all times within office hours—it is part of the Custom-house.</p>

as he called them—he said they were both experienced <hi rend="italic">cracksmen</hi>; but afterwards, on inquiry, Seale found Newsom was not in this country, having gone to America—Seale told me so;

and it was taken arranged that we should meet at Jordan's house a few evenings after they had inspected the place, (the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures, and the King's warehouse in the Custom-house,) the situation of the place was described by Mott—we met again a few nights afterwards at Jordan's house—Jordan and Suillivan said they had inspected the place, and they considered it would be a very easy matter to accom<lb></lb>plish the fact—meaning to rob the place—the subject then spoken of was, which was the best way to accomplish it—Sullivan said, he thought the best way would be to fit the locks of the door, provided they could get im<lb></lb>pressions of the keys—that was the door going into the King's warehouse from the esplanade—the outer door—the esplanade is on the south side—Mott was not present at this meeting, only Seale, Sullivan, and Jordan—I said I would mention the circumstance to Mott when I saw him, and find whether he could get imperssions of the keys—I met Mott the next even<lb></lb>ing, and told him what had passed—he said he could get the impression of one of the keys, mentioning the large key; but the impression of the key of the padlock he was fearful he could not get—I communicated this to Sullivan and Jordan, and appointed for us all to meet the following evening at Jordan's house; and we all met on that occasion there—Mott on that occasion pro<lb></lb>duced the large key of the door leading from the esplanade, which he said he had taken from the chest of Mr. Bunnett, a clerk in the same office, in the King's warehouse-keeper's office, and that Mr. Bunnett at the time was absent on sick-leave from sickness—an impression of the key was taken in beeswax at the time by Sullivan—Mott brought the key down, rolled up in a piece of paper of paper folded at the ends—I think it was white paper—after the impression was taken, the key was put up in the same paper, with the intention of returning it to Mr. Bunnett's desk the following morning, when he returned to duty—Seale asked if they would not require the assistance of a third party to effect the robbery—Jordan said, he thought they would, and Seale then mentioned the name of William May—it was merely proposed on that occasion that he should be employed to as<lb></lb>sist them—we then made an appiontment to meet again a few evenings afterwards, which we did at Jordan's house—Mott, Seale, Jordan, Sullivan, and myself were present, and May was introduced—a skeleton-key was produced by Sullivan which was made from the impression which had been taken—they then stated that this key they had tried at the Custom-house—Jordan and Sullivan said they had tried it to see if it would fit—they described that it would partly fit; but it being rather weak in the shank, they were afraid to force it, and they said they would make another key on a stronger principal—at that meeting Mott produced three small padlock keys, and said it was likely that one of them would fit the padlock outside the door leading from the esplanade—an</p>

               <p>impression was taken of those three keys in beeswax, and an appoint<lb></lb>ment made to meet again a few evenings afterwards, which we did—I was there—Seale, May, Jordan, and Sullivan—Mott was not there—we all met but him—May, Sullivan, and Jordan said they had tried these small keys, and none of them would fit, and they mentioned, that they considered the best way of doing it was "<hi rend="italic">stowing away</hi>," meaning one of the parties to conceal themselves in the Receivers of Fines and Forfeiture's Office—May volunteered to <hi rend="italic">stow away</hi>—they then spoke about which was the best way of effecting this object, and mentioned that they would go and inspect the place again, for that object, to see which was the best method of doing so—we met again at Jordan's house—we were all six present—it was then coming very close to the King's sale, and Jordan said, they (Sullivan, Jordan, and May) should like to know whether the money was actually in the chest or not—and it was spoken of how they should find out whether the money was there or not—it was proposed that one of the parties should purchase a lot at the King's sale, and by so doing, they would have an opportunity of paying for it in the Receiver of Fines' Office, and would have an opportunity of seeing the chest and the contents of it—Mott said he had purchased a lot, or a friend had purchased a lot for him, of twenty gallons of rum—he desired me to tell Sullivan and Jordan so a day or two afterwards, and I told them—he said he would give the ticket for the rum to Jordan, and he could go and see what the contents of the chest were—he said the Custom-house agent had bought the lot for him—he gave me the ticket, which I handed to Jordan, to pay for the lot—I gave directions to Jordan to take it to the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures, to present it to the Receiver, and pay for the lot—he then said, he had better first go and see the Receiver, to get a knowledge of his person, with the intention of following him into the office the first thing in the morning, before he could have change in his pocket or drawer, to give him for a large note which he intended to present him for payment—an evening or two after<lb></lb>wards we met again—Seale, myself, Jordan, Sullivan, and May—all but Mott—Jordan said he had seen the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures, and had procured a note, which he meant to present next morning to the re<lb></lb>ceiver—he said it was a £50 note—he mentioned some circumstance at the time, about having some misunderstanding with the banker, on receiv<lb></lb>ing the note that day—we met, I believe, the following evening, which I think was the 26th of November, at Jordan's house—he described that he had watched the Receiver in, the first thing in the morning, a few minutes after nine o'clock, followed him right into his office, and put the ticket down for the fifty gallons of rum, and the £50 note—that the Receiver felt his pocket and opened his drawer, and had not change (as he anticipated)—and then the Receiver went to the strong chest and opened one padlock, but the other did not open, because the key was kept by another party—I think he said he was obliged to wait a moment or two before the party came with that key—that the chest was then opened, and the Receiver took the large cash-box, with both hands, and it was as much as he could do to lift it up on the counter, with both hands; and, from the quantity of gold, and notes under the gold, there must be upwards of 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he also described, that he wrote his own name on the back of the note, or the front, and gave his own address—he went wnt at that time by the name of William, Sullivan, but his right name is Leary—he said he wrote the name of Leary, No. 4, East-lane, Kent-road and Mott at the time said it was bad judgement to do so, for he said the book in which they kept the numbers of the notes, and the addresses of</p>

               <p>the parties who gave notes, on looking at it, would lead to certain detection; and it was then agreed that the leaves of this book should be cut out, or torn out—it was arranged that night, that on the following day, a little before four o'clock, William May should conceal himself in the office of Receive of Fines and Forfeitures, behind the door, that he should go a little before four o'clock, (about seven or eight minutes,) accompanied by Jordan and Sullivan, and at the time of the confusion and bustle of the different officers and clerks leaving the department of the King's warehouse, May should take an opportunity of walking into this office, and standing behind this door, which was left open all night—the door of that particular office is left open all night—it was also arranged that on the following morning, at nine o'clock, (which is the legal hour for the different officers to attend,) at the time the door was open, that Sullivan and Jordan should be in attendance on the esplanade, and three or four minutes after the door was open, and after the watchmen for the night had taken their lamps, and walked through the passage leading by the Receiver of Fines Office, Jordan and Sullivan were to walk through, and give May a sign to come out, and Mott should assist them as much as possible, by detaining the parties in his office who went in to sigh the appearance sheet—it was also arranged that night that we should meet on the morning of the 28th, at Seale's house, at New Peckham, to divide the money—we then separated for that night—I was absent from duty on the 27th—I had been unwell, and was absent four or five days by a sick note—about half-past four o'clock, on the evening of the 27th, Seale called on me at my lodging, No. 17, Trinity-terrace, on his way from the London-dock, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards Jordan and Sullivan called—they told me May had been safely lodged, and described the manner in which it was done—they said that about ten minutes before four o'clock, the clerks in the Receiver of Fines and Forfeitures Office left their office, and two or three minutes after, they, (Jordan, Sullivan, and May,) walked into the passage leading from the espla<lb></lb>nade throught the Custom-house, to Thames-street, and took the opportunity, by opening an umbrella, to cover May, and give him an opportunity of going into the office unseen by any parties who stood about—they said they stood about on the esplanade for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, till all the doors were locked for the night—they said Mott was one of the last parties that came out of the warehouse, that he, on seeing the doors locked, and the man safely lodged, gave a sort of jump for joy—Sullivan and Jordan stopped at my house about half an hour, and went away, appointing to meet us the next morning, at seven o'clock, at the Lord Nelson, Old-Kent-road, to walk across the fields, to show us Seal's house, at Peckham, where we had agreed to meet the following morning—Seal stopped with me till about half-past six o'clock—he and I then went down to the place appointed, and met Jordan and Sullivan close to the Lord Nelson—we walked across Peckam fields to Seal's house—Seale pointed out the house, and we separated—I stopped with Seale a short time that evening, at the Duke of Sussex, at Peckham, Which was close by, and from there went to the Castle in the Old-Kent-road—On the morning of the 28th of November I left home about half-past eight o'clock, and went down to Peckham, where I was to meet Seale on the Canal bridge, a short distance from his house—I went there, and went into the Waterman's Arms there, and had some tea and ale, and about in hour afterwards I saw Seale close to the Waterman's Arms—I opened the window, and he came up-stairs to where I was sitting, and we there sat till we saw May, Sullivan and Jordan coming across the Canal</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the sum you had allotted to you on the morning of the 28th of November? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the sum my lot amounted to—Seale did not count his money that morning, but I counted mine—Mott and Seale gave me their parcels, and requested me to keep them for them, which I accordingly did, with the intention, as they said, of getting an opportunity of disposing of the notes.</p>

I met him at a house opposite Astley's theatre, kept by Procter, and there gave him the notes; and a few nights afterwards I met him again, and he gave me the gold for them—I gave Seal his share, and Mott's share I kept for him—the rest of the money I put into a parcel, in a tin case, and concealed it in Camberwell church-yard, where it remained for some month, buried in the ground—I had changed my residence shortly after time—a few months after this, Seale told me we had better try and get rid of the remaining part of our notes; and he said he knew a man who was trustworthy, who would go on the Continent and circulate them—he mentioned his name, Henry Mor<lb></lb>rison—he said he know where he lived, and would take me to him—I went with him to Henry Morrison's house, and saw Morrison—Seale mentioned the subject—Morrison said he would consider of it, and give us an answer in two or three days—we appointed to meet him in two or three days, at the Leopard coffee-house, near London-bridge—we met him there, and it was agreed that we should give him part of the notes, and allow him 30 percent for circulating them on the Continent—I brought him part of the notes a few nights afterwards to his house—I brought him three of £100, two of £10, and a £5 note—he was absent about ten days on the Continent, and brought the gold to my house for the notes—I was then living at Peckham—I gave Seale his share of the gold, and kept Mott's for him till he required it—I used frequently to meet Mott on the subject at the Duke of Sussex, and he frequently called at my house—I still kept the remaining part of the notes for a few months—in September last I had another transaction with Morrison, of the same description—Mott and Seale were privy to that—it was by their consent; I gave Mor<lb></lb>rison more notes, and he brought me gold for them from the Continent—I then had three £300 notes left—I was then living at Walworth—I con<lb></lb>cealed those notes in a cup-board-door, at my own house—I bored a hole with a centre-bit in a part of the door, near the hinge—I there placed the notes, putting a cork on the top to them, first tying them round with a bit of white tape and paper—I put the cork into the hole, and puttied it over, and then painted it—I believe this is the cork and string, and it was such paper as this (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I was taken into custody four or five weeks ago—I am not married—a woman lived with me as my wife—she knew I had something concealed there, but did not know it was Bank-notes—the three £300 notes were still concealed there when I was taken into custody, (<hi rend="italic">looking at some notes</hi>.)

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the whole plan arranged there, or was it only just suggested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared as if the conversation was an old one between Mott and Seale—Seale proposed breaking open the chest to me—I was rather willing and acquiescing in it—I cannot recollect whether I hesitated about it or not—I did not say I would not mix myself up with it—it was all that time in contemplation till November—we have frequently been seen to<lb></lb>gether at the Duke of Sussex, kept by Mrs. Gurney—her son-in-law has seen us there continually—I do not know whether he is here—he acted as landlord—I do not recollect his name—he used to bring liquor into the room—we took care that nobody should hear our conversation on this subject—Peck keeps the Royal Mortar—he waited on the customers, and knew as very well, and also the man who keeps the Castle—we occa<lb></lb>sionally met there as well as at other houses—Mott was not present at all the meetings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> did you give the account to save yourself, or for the purposes of justice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My object in doing it, was for the purpose of saving Mr. Rowan from blame, which might be attached to him for his friendly conduct towards me; and, in the next place as a sort of justice to my father and family, for the disgrace I had brought upon them—as to myself, I said at the time I should have no mercy, for I should be transported for life—my family first knew of it when my father came to town—that was about the 19th of January—my father knew nothing of it from me till I was taken up—he was on his way here, and came to town the day I was apprehended—I made a full confession of every thing at the time, and Mr. Rowan took it down in writing—he took a note of it, and I afterwards gave it to Mr. Hobler and Mr. Walford—Mr. Hobler took down the whole of it from the beginning to the end, as near as I can recollect—I told him the same as I have repeated here to-day, as near as I can recollect—Jordan and Sullivan came to me at my own house on the 27th, and remained there half an hour—Jordan, Sullivan, and May came to me at the Canal-bridge on the 28th—we then proceeded to Seale's house—we had to go about 100 yards from the Canal-bridge a woman waited on us at the public-house, before we went to Seale's—I have not seen her since, to my knowledge—there was nobody in the house but Seale and myself—we sat in a room below, and when we saw the other parties coming across the Canal-bridge, we came out and met them—I saw nobody but Seale when we got to his house—I did not see Mrs. Seale, she might have been in the house, but I did not see her—Seale went on before, and had the door opened—Seale told me he did up the parcel that was sent to Leicester—Mott had a portion of the money—on my coming back from Leicester in February 1835, with the parcel, it was opened, and the seals broken—that was at Mrs. Godfrey's in Trinity-terrace—Mrs. Godfrey did not see it done—Seale, Mott, and myself did.</p>

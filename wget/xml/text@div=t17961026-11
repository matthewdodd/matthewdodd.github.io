               <p>Q. Did you find, at the office, all the lead that was taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260016"></xptr>quainted with Mr. Watts? - A. Yes. I have been in his company.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Watts is not here? - A. I cannot say, I have not seen him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Hearne.) Q. Do you know that these were Mr. Watts's premises? - A. Yes, because I have got men to work upon his premises; Mr. Comber acts as his agent.</p>
               <p>Comber. Mr. Watts was in partnership with me five years, therefore I know his name very well.</p>

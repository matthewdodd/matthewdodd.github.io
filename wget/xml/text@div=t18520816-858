                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Ellis, who lives in Cavendish-road, St. John's Wood. On Friday, the 2nd July, I arrived at the London bridge terminus, from Hastings, about 8 o'clock—on my arrival, when the train stopped, I knew I had my purse and money safe—I had between three and four pounds in my purse in gold and silver—on leaving the platform I gave my luggage to a porter, to go to a carriage with it—I took notice of a man and a boy who followed me from the platform to the carriage—I believe the prisoner is the boy—the man had dark eyes and dark hair—they both had coats or capes on their arms, and appeared to have arrived from a journey like myself—I followed the porter to a carriage, and not finding my own there, he offered to call a public carriage—he got one, the door was opened and I was about getting in, and the man and the boy were close to me, and wanted to get in it—I remonstrated, and said it was mine, and I must get in it—I did so, and the door was shut—I ordered the man to drive me home as fast as possible—I saw nothing more of the man and boy, only their being on the platform, and then seeing them at the carriage, I thought it was extra-ordinary —I had only been a few seconds in the carriage before I missed my purse and money—I gave notice to the driver, and in a few minutes after<lb></lb>wards I saw the boy in custody, and I was shown this purse—there had been a half-sovereign in it—when the boy was brought I had no doubt of his being the boy I had seen before—I identified him directly, I had no doubt.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday evening, 2nd July, I was in Wellington-street, in the Borough, between 8 and 9 o'clock. I saw this boy jump out of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and run across the Borough up York-street, which leads to the Borough Market—I followed him—he ran round some baskets, and a police<lb></lb>man caught him—he had a coat, or a cape on his arm, and a stick in his hand—I saw a man jump out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, on the other side of it—he had a coat, or a cape on his arm; he went towards the boy—they both went up York-street, one on one side, and the other on the other—I saw the boy taken in custody—I did not lose sight of him, from the time he got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> till the policeman took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hackney carriage driver. I remember Mrs. Ellis getting in my carriage on the evening of Friday, 2nd July—before she got in I noticed this boy (the prisoner) and a gentleman—the gentleman pushed the boy towards the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Mrs. Ellis had a little boy, and she was putting her little boy in, and the man was in the act of putting in this boy—the man and the boy then passed and got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> behind mine—I drove off with Mrs. Ellis—the other <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went off first, and I followed—Mrs. Ellis told me she had been robbed, and told me to drive after the other <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I afterwards saw this boy in custody of the policeman.</p>

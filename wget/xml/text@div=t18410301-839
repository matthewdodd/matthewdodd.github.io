                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Creed, and live in Edward's-place, Crawford-street—the prisoner lives in the same house. The prisoner had told me she had written a letter to the clergyman of the Spanish Catho<lb></lb>lic Chapel, in Spanish-place, saying she was in distress—last Saturday fort<lb></lb>night she told me that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bad been given her—she came down into my room, and said, "Put on the kettle, we will have some tea"—we had some tea and half a pint of rum—I told her I would be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. towards it when I got my husband's wages at night—I got 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my hus<lb></lb>band, and gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. towards the tea and rum—her husband took me out, and I got the worse for liquor—in the evening the prisoner came into my room, and said, "Come out, and we will have some liquor"—she brought me out, and when I came home I missed 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my pocket—the prisoner undressed me, and put me to bed, as I was so drank—in consequence of what my daughter told me, I sent for the prisoner into my room on Monday morning, and asked her bow she came to take the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my pocket—she made me no answer—we had no more words about it till Friday—she then said if I would not say any more about it she would pay me part of it on Saturday—about half-past eleven o'clock on Saturday evening I went up to her room, knocked at the door, and she opened it—I said, "I will thank you for some of the money to<lb></lb>night"—she said nothing, but went and brought the chopper, and gave me a blow with it on the forehead—I have the mark now—and after that she struck me once in the head and once in the hand with a poker, and I should have been no more, if it had not been for Ann Taylor, who came to my assistance—my face bled a good deal from the blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The night she says she lost her money, two men carried her home drunk—when she missed her money she accused me of it, and accused me of it all the week—on this night she came to my door quite tipsy, and said to my husband, "It is your b—w—of a wife I want." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not—her husband was in the room—I did not make use of any bad language—I said I should have some of the money, that is all.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 134.) I went to No. 8, Edwards'-place, on Sunday, the 21st of February, about half-past twelve o'clock at night—I found Mrs. Creed in bed, bleeding profusely from the wound in her forehead—I went up to the prisoner's room, and knocked at the door—she said, "Is that Mrs. Creed?"—I said, "No, it is a policeman"—she let me in, and I asked her why she cut Mrs. Creed in the head so—she said Mr. and Mrs. Creed had come up and broken her door open, and then she did it in self-defence—I examined the door—there was not the least appearance of violence having been used—I asked the prisoner what she struck her with—she said, with a chopper—I found the chopper on the landing, about two feet from the prisoner's door—I asked her, was that the chopper she struck her with—she said yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Western General Dispensary. I went before daylight on, Sunday morning, the 21st of February, to Edwards'-place, to see Mrs. Creed—I got there about two, o'clock—she was in bed, with a wound on the right eyebrow and the right side of the nose—it was a clear cut wound—I found a contused wound on the upper part of the scalp—she was not in danger at any time—the incised wound was about two inches long, and penetrated to the bone on the brow, about a quarter of an inch deep—I think one part of the chopper now produced would have inflicted the cut—the bruise was about half an inch long—there was nothing particular about that—it was a blow from a blunt instrument, not given with particular violence—I should not think the bone was at all injured—there was blood about it, but not being serious, I dressed the wound, and she went on perfectly well—she did not appear in the least intoxicated—she answered quite rationally—I did not suspect that she had been intoxicated—she did not smell of liquor—I saw no danger at all likely to arise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick Taylor, and lodge in the next room to the prisoner. On this night I was coming home from market, and found Mrs. Creed on the landing-place, bleeding—I asked what was the mat<lb></lb>ter—she said Mrs. Berry had struck her on the bead with the chopper—Mrs. Berry's door was shut, but they had several words between the door, though it was shut—they were speaking to each other, but what was said I do not know, for I was so flurried—they were not speaking very good language, you may depend—I believe they were both equally abusive to each other—I do not know which was the worst—Mrs. Berry then came out with the poker, and struck Mrs. Creed on the head—I did not see the striking with the chopper—I wiped the blood off her with a towel and cold water—she was aware that her head was cut—I tried to get her from the door—she said she would not come till she had got her money, and then the prisoner came out and struck her—she accused the prisoner of having picked her pocket—I afterwards saw the chopper found by the po<lb></lb>liceman on the landing—I had not noticed it there before.</p>

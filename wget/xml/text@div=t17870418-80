               <p>Court. Where did you stand to see all this? - Looking out of the window, as I generally do, after I have eat my dinner.</p>
               <p>How far from your window might this White Hart be? - It lays to the left visible enough to distinguish, with the windows open, into the tap room; I saw both the prisoners employed in it.</p>

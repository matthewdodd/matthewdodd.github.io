I locked the bed-room and stable doors, and put the key of the bedroom on the bannisters of the stairs ready for my husband, and took the key of the stable with me, as there was another key at the house which my husband could get. I returned before five o'clock, went up stairs, and did not notice any thing wrong then. I went out again about five o'clock - it was not quite dark, but the lamps were lighted. I put the key on the bannisters as before, locked the stable-door, and took the key with me. I returned a little after eight o'clock, and found the key on the bannisters as before, and found the stable-door locked as I had left it. I unlocked it, and observed nothing at first; but having occasion to go out to market, I went to a little box which stood on the table and missed it. I thought my husband had returned. I went into the adjoining room, and found his box taken off the table and put on the bed, opened, and all his clothes and mine gone - it had not been locked. I did not miss the knife till it was produced to me.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. George, Hanover-square. On the 4th of February, about a quarter past three o'clock in the afternoon, I apprehended the prisoner in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square, and took him to Mount-street watch-house, searched him, and found a knife on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180013"></xptr>him, which the prosecutrix claimed, and on the Saturday following, I asked him where he lived; he said he had no place of residence. I asked where he slept the night before I apprehended him; he said no where, for he had no money to pay for his lodging. I found 3 s. 7 d. in his pocket when I took him. I asked where he slept on Monday night; he said, in St. Giles's, but could not tell in what street. On the Thursday following, I heard he had sent a letter by Charles Serjeant, for the prosecutor and prosecutrix to come to him at Tothill-fields. I reported this on Monday at Marlborough-street, and Ballard was sent with the prosecutrix to him; and on the same day I accompanied Ballard to his lodging; we went into the room he had slept in, and found two bundles which contained a coat, three pair of breeches, and a quantity of property claimed by Child.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was desired by the Magistrate, on the 9th of February, to accompany Mrs. Child to Tothill Fields, to see the prisoner. I said to him</p>
               <p>"You have seat for Mr. Child, what have you to say to her." After a little hesitation, he said, he wanted to know what Mrs. Child had to say - what promises she had to make to him. I told him she was not come to make any promise, for she could not be allowed to do any thing of the sort, that she was come in consequence of his having sent for her, and he might say what he liked, and if not, we must go back again, for she could make no promise; he then said he should like to see Mr. Child; we both said he could not come, and if he came, the Magistrate would not allow him to see him, unless I was present; he hesitated a good deal, and repeated again that he should like to see him. I said he could not, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say anything, if not, we shall go;" after a little hesitation, he asked for pen, ink and paper. I said I had a small memorandum book and pencil, which I gave him, and at the same time told him no promise could be made whatever, his statement must be voluntary; he then wrote in this book (reads)</p>
               <p>"That part of the things were at his lodgings, at Mrs. Patterson's, a public-house in Oxford-street, and one coat at a pawnbroker's, named Stonestreet, in Oxford-street" In answer to a question put to him, he told me in what part of the room the things were, and which was his room. I went and enquired where he directed me, and they did not know him by name; but I described his person, and the room he said he lodged in. I was shewn into a bed-room, and found all this property, which I produce, except one coat, which I found by his direction at a clothes shop, at the corner of Chandler-street, and David-street - not a pawnbroker's. I have had the property ever since - it was claimed by Child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not Mrs. Child say she would not prosecute me if I made a confession - A. She said nothing of the kind in my presence, and I was not absent.</p>
               <p>MRS. CHILD. Before he was taken to prison, I said if he would confess where the things were, I would not appear against him if I could possibly help it - this was on the 4th of February. I think I said so more than once.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The constable brought me word, that if I would confess where the things were they would not prosecute.</p>

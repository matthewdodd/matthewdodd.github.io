On the 29th of October I received information from a woman, and went out - I saw the prisoner carrying this roll of flannel on his left shoulder; I called out Stop thief! and he threw it down, but I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Then you lost sight of him? A. Yes, but only while he turned a corner, and threw down the flannel; I saw the prisoner about two hundred yards from the shop, with the flannel; I took him, and gave him to the officer - he was hurrying towards me when he was taken; there was no other person there - I can only identify him by the size of his person; I was behind him, and did not see his face - there was no other person in the street but a woman, who was coming promiscuously towards me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say "Is this the man you saw with the parcel?" A. No - to my knowledge, I did not say any such words; I did not say any thing to him about the prisoner's identity; it was two or three hundred yards from the prosecutor's - it was about ten o'clock at night; I saw the parcel picked up about three yards off.</p>

               <p>I am a widow woman. On the 6th of March, I was robbed, I keep a house at <placeName id="t17940430-74-crimeloc397">Mill Hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see them after you missed them? - Not till they took the prisoner. I went to the bottom of the yard, and I saw him with the things under his arm, going across the field from our yard, I hallooed out to him, you have got my shirts, and some people ran after him, and he was taken; I lost sight of him before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was in your sight, had he the things or had he parted with them? - He had not parted with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. You say you hung them out about seven in the morning, and you missed them about nine; then they must be taken in that interval of time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your yard adjoins to the field? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that your yard is considerably above that field? - No, the bank of the hedge is higher than the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the yard is on a level with the side of the bank? - Not quite, it is almost as high.</p>
               <p>Q. Still the yard is higher than the field? - No, not higher, the yard is rather the lowest</p>
               <p>Q. There is a path way over that field? - No, only a gap, which people make where the hedge is broke down.</p>
               <p>Q. People do pass and repass, otherwise how could he have seen your linen? This was the 6th of March, Friday, I think windy weather? - It might have been windy.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean at the time that you lost these handkerchiefs? - It might have been so.</p>


               <p>Q. And these things might have blown off this hedge? - I cannot say but they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever, at any time missed any things that you hung on this hedge? - No, not before.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that these things were hung on a hedge or on a line? - On a line.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. Might not these things, by any possibility, be blown out of this yard, by the wind? - They might.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Leech? He acted as headborough when this man was taken, I believe? - He is out of his office now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Craig? - He was the first man that was after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any difference between Craig and the prisoner? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Court. When the prisoner was going across the field, what pace was he going, was he walking or running? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. You lost sight of the prisoner before he was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw nothing of the prisoner, you saw a man passing with some linen under his arm? - No more.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that you don't know that was the man that you saw with the linen on him? - That<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300124"></xptr>was the man that had the linen on him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. What distance might he be from you? - About half way across the field.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see his face when he was walking across the field? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>I work along with one Mr. Tinder, in digging ballast and gravel; when I took the prisoner he lay in a hedge, with his belly on the linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that field near the woman's yard? - No, it might be fifteen or sixteen poles off, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the linen out of the hedge? - I know not, the linen was given to me at the time; I have got the linen; the woman has kept it till now, I gave it to the woman, I brought the linen here from Mill Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. Did you give the man the linen that was brought back to you? - Not till he came on last Thursday, I did then. It is what I took in to wash; there is W.B. on two of the shirts, and Jones on the other; the cotton handkerchief is marked L. I have no doubt of the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

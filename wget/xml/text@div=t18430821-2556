                  </hi>. I am servant to Capt. Hugh Manley Tuite, at the barracks, at Woolwich—on the 16th of Aug., I had three table cloths of his safe in No. 29 quarters—I missed them that afternoon, between ten and twelve minutes after seeing them—these now produced are them—I do not know the prisoner—I saw him that day about one hundred paces from ray master's quarters.</p>

               <p>said, "No," there was one in Air-street, but they were shut up—he offered me these table-cloths for half-a-crown—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—he told me his wife was very ill, and he wanted to make some money of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was formerly in the dragoons, and went to the bar<lb></lb>racks frequently, to see some comrades. I was very kindly treated, both by officers and men; they subscribed for a suit of clothes for me, and told me on the day in question, that if I went to the tailor, I should get them, and also some money. I was about getting into the police again; and it is not likely I should take these things, after such kindness. As I left the barracks a woman met me, gave me the clothes, and told me to say I had them from my wife, and I was to pass the night with her—she was a stranger to me; she told me to go to this shop.</p>

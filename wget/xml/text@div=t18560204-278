I am servant to Mr. Steer, of the Retreat, Lewisham On Monday morning, 21st Jan., about 11 o'clock, I was cleaning the parlour windows which look to the road, and saw the prisoner Biggs pass the house, and go up to Mr. Woodham's kitchen window, which is the next house—I looked out, saw him coming out at the kitchen window, and ram to the door</p>

               <p>with my fellow-servant—Biggs then came up to the window, and asked if I wanted any writing paper—I said, "No"—he had a parcel in a blue hand<lb></lb>kerchief in his hand, like this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he walked away, and then I saw Skate waiting eighteen or twenty yards from the kitchen window, and looking towards it—they both went away together—the prisoners were brought to me on the 25th by a constable, and I identified them at once.</p>

I was in my garden at Perry-vale, Sydenham, and saw the prisoners pass along the road—in conse<lb></lb>quence of something I had heard, I followed them about half a mile, when they sat down by the side of the footpath—as I came up to them they were sort<lb></lb>ing over some writing paper which they had in a parcel, and another bundle lay before them—I was in plain clothes—I told them that I was an officer, and they must go with me—they wanted to know what for—I said, "On suspicion of stealing some silver spoons"—Skate said, "I know nothing about it; how many times are we to be taken into custody on suspicion of stealing <hi rend="italic">them</hi> spoons? we were taken into custody yesterday, taken to the station, the parties were sent for, and we were not the men, and were sent off about our business"—Biggs said, "That is true, so help me God"—I took them to the station at Sydenham, and then to Mr. Woodham's house—I asked Hannah Nash if she knew anything of them—she said that Biggs was the man who came out of the kitchen window, and that Skate came up to the door with some writing paper—I do not recollect Biggs saying any<lb></lb>thing, but Skafe began to insult her very much, and said that he was at Gravesend on the Monday that this occurred, but did not say the time—he threatened her that if he got seven years, he would serve her out when he came back—I produce this bundle; it contains two parcels of writing paper, a dozen pencils, and a few memorandum books and envelopes—I took it from Biggs.</p>

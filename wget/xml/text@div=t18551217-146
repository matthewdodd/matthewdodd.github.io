                  </hi>. I am sexton of St. John Church, Stratford, in the parish of West Ham—Robert George Augustus Hilliary and Richard Symons are the churchwardens—there is a copper lightning conductor to the church—I missed about five feet on it on 2nd Dec.—I had seen it safe a fortnight before—the Rev. John Abel Ram is the minister of West Ham, and Mr. Wilton, Mr. Dames, and Mr. Vause, are the church wardens.</p>

On Monday, 3rd Dec., in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I went to Joseph Shea, a marine store dealer at Stratford, about a quarter of a mile from St. John's Church—from what Shea told me, I took the prisoner near Stratford Railway station, and told him the charge—he, said, "I did, not take it; a boy named Johnson gave it to me, and I sold it at Mr. Shea's"—he told me where to find Johnson, and I saw him afterwards, but have, not seen him lately—I believe he has ab<lb></lb>sconded on another robbery—I tried to subpoena him, but his father said that he had turned him out of doors.</p>

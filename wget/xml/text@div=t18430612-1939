                  </hi>. I live in Little Chapel-street. The pro<lb></lb>secutrix, who lodges with me, came home with the prisoner at half-past ten o'clock that morning—I went down to expostulate with her—I heard some sovereigns on the table and heard them quarrelling about putting them into the box—I went for a policeman, and during that time the prisoner went out for change by the prosecutrix's order—she returned and went down—I then listened on the stairs—I never heard her give her the change—she then came up—I said to her, "Do you know that woman?"—she said, "Yes, for some years"—I said, "Give me your address"—she said, "Mrs. Wood, Oxford-street"—the policeman then came, and we let the prisoner go—we then went down, and saw the prosecutrix—I asked if she had lost any money—she said no, she had got eight sovereigns in a box—we looked, there was only five,—the policeman ran after the prisoner, brought her back, and she was quite drunk and very abusive—there was no silver found in the prosecutrix's room, although the place was well searched directly.</p>

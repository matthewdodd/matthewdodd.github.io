                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, residing with my brother in Old Brentford—the deceased Richard Stannett was an apprentice to my brother. On Tuesday morning, 12 Oct., about half past 10 o'clock, the prisoner, the deceased, and I, were in the shop—there was some joking going on between the prisoner and deceased—the deceased began joking the prisoner, and in a playful manner he got up and went towards him as he sat on his seat—he got up and they caught hold of each other by the arms, and straggled and twisted about—the prisoner got into a terrible rage, and told Stannett that unless he sat down he would stick his knife in him—I saw the prisoner take the knife off his seat, and I caught hold of his hand, and told him I would not let his hand loose until such time as he promised to put the knife down—he would not put it down at first, but after a short time he agreed to put it down—he said be would put it down—I believe he did put it down, but I could not swear that he did—I saw him make a thrust at the deceased with the knife—Stannett had before that given him a slight tap on the face as he was loosing his hold—it was immediately afterwards that he stabbed the deceased—he stabbed him at the bottom of the stomach—the deceased staggered back and cried out that the prisoner had done it at last—I accom<lb></lb>panied him to Mr. Baker'e, a chemist, and then I went off for a surgeon—this was a knife that the prisoner was in the habit of working with—it was a regular shoemaker's knife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

In consequence of information, I west to Mr. Baker's, a chemist, at Brentford, and there found the deceased—he was wounded in the belly—I went to the place where the prisoner was, and took him into custody—I told him I took him on a very serious charge, for stabbing Richard Stannett—he said, "Have I hurt him much, I did not think I had hurt him?"—I told him he had stabbed him in the belly, and it was a very serious job—he said he was sorry for it, that he aggravated him, and that drove him to do it—I asked where the knife was, he said it was on his seat, and it was an old knife—he said they had aggravated him, and he had picked up the knife, but he did not think of hurting him, only to frighten him—I found the knife where he said, and have produced it.</p>

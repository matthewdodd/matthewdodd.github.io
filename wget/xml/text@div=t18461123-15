                  </hi>. I am assistant to Edward Martin and Henry Martin, woollen-drapers, High-street, St. Botolph, Aldgate. I believe the roll of cloth now produced to be theirs—it is very much like the cloth I put at the door early in the morning of the 13th of Nov., and the ticket produced I know was on that cloth when I put it at the door—the cloth corresponds in appearance, quantity, and quality, and is worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I placed it in the lobby of the door—I had gone out about three o'clock, and believe it was at the door then—it was missed about five o'clock.</p>

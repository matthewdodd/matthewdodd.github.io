I did live at No. 10, Green-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road—I got my living a fortnight since by attending gentlemen who are of unsound mind—I live now at No. 11, Liverpool-street—on the 25th of Feb. last I left Norbiton, in the afternoon, and went over to Hampton-court, and walked over the Queen's palace, looked at the pictures, and walked into the gardens—while I was looking at the pictures, I entered into conversation with a female and two males—I was invited by some persons to go into the Canteen—we had some meat and beer—a sergeant in the room challenged me to play a game at cribbage—I took it up—the other persons went away to tea, and said they would call for me, and we would all go to</p>

               <p>Kingston together—I went to the other side of the table, to a game of cards, expecting every minute this party to return and call for me—that threw me into conversation with the prisoners, and from that arose an appointment for Belfrage to walk with me to Kingston—I stopped at the Canteen until about half-past six, and they left—they were going to stable duty—Belfrage said be would rejoin me after stable duty was over, which he did—we left the barrack—room about a quarter to eight, and on the road stopped at the King's Arms public-house—a pot of ale was ordered, which I paid for, but did not partake of—we left Greening at the King's Arms, and Belfrage started with me on the road to Kingston—after we had got some distance, Belfrage wanted to go back to where we had left Greening, we went back—Belfrage had some conversation with Greening which I did not bear, but after we all got again some distance into the park, Belfrage said, "Don't walk in that pathway, let us turn aside"—we had got some distance, when he called out, "<hi rend="italic">Bill, Bill</hi>"—in consequence of that, Greening came up—one came on one side of me and the other on the other, and demanded money of me—I cannot say which of them, but a demand of money was made—they were both together when it was made—I said I had no money to give them—in consequence of that I was knocked down—I received several blows, one on my nose and another cut just here (<hi rend="italic">on the head</hi>), and then they knelt on my chest—after some time I said, "Well, if you will let me get up, I will give you some"—I put my band into this waistcoat pocket, and took out a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and gave it to one of the prisoners—I did not know which it was at that moment—it appears it was the prisoner Greening—that was not suffi<lb></lb>cient, and they made another demand—I said, "What do you want more?"—Greening said, "Half-a-crown"—I said, "I cannot or will not give you that"—I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket, and gave him that, and then after I got out of his hands, I ran out at the park—gate, to escape further violence, for they kept threatening me—I made for the door of a butcher's house, who I knew, the first butcher's on the right hand side of the park—I was at that door when the policeman came up—I gave Belfrage in charge—I did not per<lb></lb>ceive Greening at that time—I said I had been robbed and assaulted in the park by two soldiers, and pointed to Belfrage as one of them—the policeman took us both to the station—Belfrage made a charge against me, that I had taken indecent liberties with him—there was no mark on the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I had it a very short time in my possession—I made the observation that it was a very smooth one, and when the sergeant took the charge, I said it felt very smooth—I am quite sure I mentioned the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece at the station—Greening was not there then—I afterwards went to the barracks, and identified Green<lb></lb>ing—he was in bed—it was between ten and eleven at night.</p>

               <p>point—at starting into life, I was in a merchant's counting-house—after that, about the year 1823, I was clerk to Messrs. Storey and Company, of John-street—I was there about nine months—they did not get rid of me at all—I left because there was something unpleasant occurred, some little misunder<lb></lb>standing between me and my mistress in the house, and my master said, "I do not think anything at all about it, but women are particular; I wish you to receive something more out of the house; you shall have more money"—after that I went to my father, a solicitor, at several places at Spitalfields and at Brighton—after that I went to learn the Lancaster system in the Borough-road, and I staid there from three to six months—I then left and went to the office of Mr. May, a solicitor, in the Bethnal-green-road—I staid there two years—I went next to the office of Mr. Pixen, a solicitor—I was taken ill, and left there—I was ill for twelve months, and then went back to the office of Mr. May—I next went into business for myself, as a general dealer, for nine months, at No. 6, William-street, Green-street, Bethnal-green—I was indebted to my landlord, Frederick Summers—he was in the habit of not only letting his house, but of lending me money, and sending me in goods on credit—I was indebted to him in 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods and rent, and as an honest man, I wished to repay him—I gave up my business, furniture, and all the ready money I had in my possession—never mind where I went to next—you must think I have a very excellent memory—I next went to Mr. Luke's, a coal-merchant, of Rotherhithe, as collector and clerk—I do not know in what year that was—I was there twelve months—I think after that I was some time out of a situation—I cannot tell how long—the next thing I did to get an honest living was to go into the Docks as a labourer, and no disgrace—it was the London Docks, I think; no, it was the St. Katharine's—I do not know how long I was there—I cannot say what year it was, you are so quick and hasty—I had a very good character—after I left the Docks I was in the habbit of serving my friends, and any connectios I might meet with, with tea—it is more than ten years since I began dealing in tea—I continued tea-dealing amongst my friends more than a year—I cannot say whether it was two years—I think after that I went to the St. Katharine's Docks, and to the London afterwards—I was there one or two seasons, about twelve months, and then advertised, and got a situation with Alderman Farebrother's brother, as clerk—that was in 1836—I remained with him one month—I left because my father was taken seriously ill—I consulted with Mr. Farebrother, and said I had a wish to go to see him before he died—he gave me leave to go to Horsley to see my father—I staid some time, till my father died—when I returned Mr. Fare<lb></lb>brother had made up his mind to do with one clerk instead of two—he said he was very sorry; he liked all I did and all I said, and gave me his advice to have a quarter's writing lessons—after that, in consequence of an advertise<lb></lb>ment for a religious person and a teetotaler, I got a situation as keeper at London-house, Hackney—the first time I staid there six weeks—I was then out of a situation six weeks, and then went to Dr. Oxley's—I was there six months, and left because I did not like the situation—I next went to Whit<lb></lb>more-house, Hoxton, an asylum for lunatics—I staid there between three and six months—I was uncomfortable there—Miss Binfield said if I went out so often I must leave—I gave notice to leave—they gave me six weeks' wages, and I left—one Sunday evening a little boy came and said a medical gentleman wanted to speak to me, and sent me to a medical gentleman at Clapham, and be agreed to give me a guinea a week and my board and lodging, and in a few days I went to the Westminster-road—I stopped six months there, felt myself uncomfortable, and gave notice to leave—I was then twelve months at Grayton, and after that I was at Northumberland-house—I</p>

                  </hi> I keep a beer-shop, 107, Ratcliffe-highway. Keyser and Van Der Deyl came to my house that night and slept there—Van Der Deyl went to bed at nine or half-past—he was very much intoxicated, and was carried up to bed—Keyser remained, and went to bed about twelve o'clock—next morning Van Der Deyl was up first, and asked me to get him some drink—I said it was too soon, it was only half-past five—I asked him if Keyser was up—they afterwards walked away—I knew Keyser, and have never heard anything against him—I did not hear him go out after Van Der Deyl had gone to bed—Keyser was neither drunk nor sober—he paid for what they had—they slept together.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you know what the wax is upon them for. - A. To take the glare off, to deaden the white.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I now put into your hand the shilling that was found in her pocket. - A. This is also a bad one, it is very much like the others.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the effect of this wax, or whatever it is, that is put upon the surface of them. - A. It takes off the bright appearance from the silver, and makes it appear to be in a state of circulation; I particularly noticed it on them when they were first examined, and there is some on them now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (read in court) My lord, I humbly beg your lordship will take these few lines into your kind consideration, of the hardships of an unfortunate orphan, for so I may call myself, having no mother, and my father having left me to God and the wide world, for when I went to him thinking to find a home, he cruelly told to go on the town and to get my living as I could; unfortunately for me, when I was turned from his door I met with a gentleman who gave me twelve shillings, which to my misfortune were bad; having no gown but one I had borrowed, I thought I would buy one with the money he had given me; I bought the gown of the shopman, the master was not there, after I gave him the money he took it to some gentlemen that were in the back parlour, and after that he took it to the others that were at the door; I hopeyour lordship will take pity on my tender age, and my being entirely inexperienced in the world, and my great distress, being entirely without friends; upon my bended knees I humbly beg you will shew me mercy, and save me from utter ruin.</p>

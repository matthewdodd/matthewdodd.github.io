                  </hi>. I am an engineer in the service of Thomas Fowell Buxton and others, brewers in Brick-lane. The prisoner was in my em<lb></lb>ploy as a carpenter, and was at work at a public-house in Petticoat-lane—in consequence of information, on the 28th of November I went to a house in Wentworth street—I found there a deal board thirteen feet long—I took it to a house in Petticoat-lane, where the prisoner was at work, and compared it with two other boards there which were cut off the same plank, and found they corresponded both in the knots and in the cut—I asked how he came to take the board to the house in Wentworth-street, instead of bringing it to the job—he said, "I dont, know"—I gave him in charge—this is the board—I do not know whose house it was found in.</p>

I had three guineas in my pocket. I had been up almost all night, because I follow chair-work; I left the three guineas there for fear I should lose them and drawed four shillings. The prisoner was there; we went out together; she persuaded me, because it was a strange house, to go back and get my money. I went back and got it; then she told me she would take me to a place where I should be used well and taken care of:</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor? - Yes, a little matter, not much.</p>
               <p>Did you go with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where to? - I do not know the name of the place, nor the house; it was a little way from thence. She shewed me a bed and put me to bed; she sat by the bedside; before I went to sleep I felt something stirring under my head. I had put my breeches under my head; I felt in my breeches pocket, and my money was gone. She sat on the bed the whole time; there was no body else in the room.</p>
               <p>Was she in the room then? - Yes; there was a guinea and a half lay on the bed close to her; when she got up I charged her with having it; she began to swear and use me very ill, and said she knew nothing about it. I got up directly and went to the office in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Can you tell how much money you had in your pocket? - I had three guineas when I left the King's Head.</p>
               <p>What were the pieces? - Two guineas and a half, and the rest in silver. I lost a a guinea and the silver.</p>
               <p>You went and complained to a magistrate and had her taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she searched? - Not that I know of; I staid at the office till they brought her there. There came a parcel of women up stairs when I got up, and I was afraid of my life.</p>
               <p>What did she say before the justice? - She said very little.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much in liquor? - Not very much.</p>
               <p>She said she would take you to a house to be taken care of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had not you a home of your own? - Yes, but I did not care to go there till I was better.</p>
               <p>How do you know you had your money when you was in the house? - I counted it before I went to bed, because I had a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Could it not drop out of your breeches when you put them under the bolster? - Not without somebody took them out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Whether there was not another woman in the house besides me?</p>
               <p>Hughes. There was nobody in the room but her, till after I missed the money.</p>
               <p>Did you look at all behind the bolster where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120040"></xptr>you laid your breeches, to see if the money was dropped out? - I did look, there was none.</p>
               <p>- MACARTY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman. I have seen the prisoner several times picking up men; I know nothing about this money.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the house is your room. - A. The lower room; I returned about seven in the evening; when I opened the door the bottom sash was flying out of the frame, I found my box open, and all my things was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discern how the lodgings were broken open. - A. It appeared as though it was done on the inside by something opening the lock by a false key.</p>

             sworn. You are a constable. - A. I am; in consequence of information I received on Sunday the 23d of November, I went to Mr. Spencer's lodgings, and up one pair of stairs I found the prisoner sitting in a chair, her husband was in bed, and these things were laying upon the table, which the prosecutor said, in the presence of the prisoner, he had taken out of a bed belonging to the prisoner, up one pair of stairs higher; understanding there were more lost, I asked her what she had done with the other property, she said there was a bundle throwed over the yard facing the door, which are these things, that not being all the property, I asked her where the remainder of the stolen property was, she said the remainder was in a yard next to her house, I got over the yard and found this property; I searched her, and took a variety of duplicates from her, she told me that the remainder of the property that I had not found was among the duplicates pledged at Mr. Dexter's; I asked her how she came to commit such a robbery upon her husband's fellow servant.</p>
               <p>Q. You used no threats nor any thing to intice her to tell you. - A. No, they were both fellow servants to Mr. Liptrap, she said that it was nothing but extreme distress that drove her to it; she said she got in with a key that she found, and that she had given the key to the prosecutrix; and that she broke the window to make people believe that the thieves had come in at that window; she told me that she did it at one o'clock when she came home at dinner time; I pressed her very hard, to know if her husband was any ways concerned, or knew any thing at all about it; she told me no, that he was at work with the other woman's husband at the time.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take the things; as the woman came to my house, and told me that she had got a key that would open the door; I said, I would not try it, she took the key from me, and said I was foolish, she would do it, I went up stairs, I had nothing to do with it, nor did I know what the woman did with the things.</p>

            ; my child is seventeen months old. On the 20th of September I was at work at my sister's in Widegate-street. About half-past eleven o'clock in the morning I sent my eldest boy down to mind the child; he returned in half an hour, ran up stairs to me, and said a woman had taken the child away. I ran as far as Shoreditch church to look after her, turned back, and when I got to Widegate-street the neighbours were all out. A person directed me to Rose-court, Spitalfields saying she had seen a child there that was lost. I went there and found my child there naked, with a white towel round it. A young man had picked it up in the ruins near Bell-lane. As I returned my boy came and said he had found the woman who took it with the clothes on her - they were the articles stated in the indictment, which it had on when it was lost. The shirt and spencer were left on it.</p>

            . I am ten years old; the child is my brother. I took him down by the pawnbroker's shop in Bishopsgate-street, and was holding it in my arms, the prisoner came, and asked to have a kiss of the child, I said she should not. She said,</p>
               <p>"I will take it away;" I said</p>
               <p>"You shan't, I will go and tell my mother." She pulled me back, knocked my head against the step of a door, pushed me down, and ran away with the child - she gave a boy a halfpenny to hold me down. I am quite positive she is the woman. I ran home, told my mother, and found the prisoner myself up an alley. I asked her where the child was? A lot of boys held her while I went to my mother. She said she had left the child with a woman while she cooked her husband's dinner.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Widegate-alley. There was an uproar in the street, I ran out; Mrs. Scott said she had lost her child. Soon after, the boy came and said he had found the woman, the child had been found then. I went with the boy, and saw the prisoner in Angel-alley with the clothes. We took her to Bishopsgate watch-house - she said she would smash my eyes out.</p>

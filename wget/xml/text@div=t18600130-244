                  </hi>. I live at 15, Broad-court, Bow-street, and am a plumber—on Thursday, 8th October last, I was going along the Strand, and met the prisoner Burns—I was standing at the corner of Agar-street, looking at Punch and Judy—he came and stood alongside of me and got into conversation—he wondered how the Punch and Judy men got a living—I made a remark to him and said, "Oh, I suppose sometimes they get a good deal given them"—he then told me that he had got bis business settled in London; he had got a suit in Chancery, and he had got his other brother's share, who died in the Crimea—I had just returned from the Crimea—I left the Crimea on 23d August—he did not say exactly how long he had been in London—he said he was stopping at the Great Western Hotel, and he expected to get his business done on the Saturday following—this was on the Thursday—he said he had not been in London since the Exhibition of 1851—as soon as Punch and Judy was over he spoke to me about having a glass of ale—I told him I did not know any place about there where we could have a good glass of ale—we then went down into Hungerford-market; going along he spoke to me about an ice-house there—I said, the last time I was in Hungerford market there was something of the sort, if it was not shut up—we walked into it, looked round, and then we came out—we had nothing there—we then walked down to the bottom of the market, at the corner of the bridge, to the Dolphin; we went through the coffee-room and on to the balcony in front of the river—we had one glass of ale each, and I then went into the coffee-room to light a cigarette, and when I came back another man came, who is not in custody; he appeared something like a gamekeeper, and Burns and him commenced talking about shooting—Burns said he could put the bullet in the bull's-eye eighteen times out of twenty at a distance of forty-five yards—they tried to make several wagers about the shooting; at last they came to a conclusion to shoot for three new hats, and he induced me to be umpire—I told him I did not know of any shooting-gallery at all about there—he said he had a friend in London, it would not take long to go there, however, we would have a cab, and soon have it over—we drank up the ale, and came out—in coming along Hungerford-market Burns asked me could I give him change for a sovereign or two half-sovereigns, as he wished to tie the bet—I pulled out my purse that my money was in, and I gave him two half-sovereigns for a sovereign—there was three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the rest in gold; making up a total of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pui'so—when I pulled out ray purse to give him the two half-sovereigns he conld see there was other money in it, because it was a kind of a pocket-book as well as a purse—there was an elastic bana on, but it got broke off—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)the half-sovereigns were in there with the notes—he then shook hands with the other man; whether ho gave him the half-sovereigns or not, I do not know, and the other man said, "I will go for a cab"—he went for a cab, aud Burns then said, "Come along, we will go and have another glass of ale while he is fetchiug the cab"—we went into another public-house there—I do not know the name of it—I pointed it out to the officer afterwards—we went in front</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001300083"></xptr>
               <p>of the bar, and while the ale was being drawn, I turned away to the other side of the place altogether, to light another paper, or cigarette, and when I returned the ale was drawn, and standing in front of the beer-engine on the counter—Burns was standing next to it—no one was in the public-house but us two then; the other man came running in, and said, "Come on, the cab is ready"—I drank up my ale all at once, and we all three came out together—when I came outside I began to feel myself quite stupified—I remember getting into the cab, and I became quite stupified altogether—I have drunk three glasses of ale before in the course of my life; I had only had two then—two glasses of ale never had any effect on me before—when I came, to myself I found myself in a skittle-alley, in Cross-street, Newingtou—I had my purse in my hand, and the prisoner Kinghorn was rustling me up in the corner, and took the purse out of my hand—I saw him take the contents out and hand them to another man who in not in custody—that was not the man who went for the cab; it was another one—I asked for my money, and Kinghorn put his hand over my mouth and told me to hold my noise; he called me a b—fool, and told me if I did not hold my noise I should get them all looked up—Burns then came forward and called me by my name—he had asked me my Christian name before, and I had told him—he said, "Look here, George, I have got your money,"—showing me my money in his hand—"It is all right, hold your noise; don't get us into any row"—I still kept asking for my money—Burnss said, "Throw the ball up and try and knock the skittles down"—I said, "I will have nothing to do with it; I know nothing at all about skittles; I never played a game of skittles in my life"—I then found out what company I was in, and I thought if I went to play skittles I might keep them together and get out—I went to the bottom, just got hold of the ball and threw it about half-way up the alley—Kinghorn and another man were stood sentry at the door to prevent me going out—I made one attempt and they pulled me back—the other man was quite as tail if not taller than Kinghorn—the other two, the smaller man and the other tall man, then went out, leaving Kinghorn and Burns in the ground with me—Burns wanted me to go and fetch him some brandy—I told him I would not stir till I had my money; then they both went up to the tap together—I went towards them, they seemed as if they were quarrelling the one with the other—but I did not understand their language, and I think it would puzzle anybody eke—I then went out through the front into the street to see if I could see a policeman—I had scarcely got out, looked round and could see nobody—I turned back again and found the door open that went from the back of the house to the skittle-ground—I looked through and saw Kinghorn in the act of getting over some palings at the back—I followed him, but he got into the street and I lost him—I could not see Burns—I expect they must have both got over together—the skittle alley would prevent my seeing if they both got over together—I did not find Burns when I went in—I then found an officer, went back to the public-house, and asked the landlord if he knew them—I gave a description of the men to the policeman—I next met Kinghorn about ten days or a fortnight after in the Strand—I forget the day of the month; it was on a Monday—I went up to him, he saw me and turned away—I collared him; he wanted roe to go round into King William-street with him—he called me a b—fool again, and said, "Come along round into King William-street and let us settle it," or something of that sort—the officers had just gone away, for a man had just stolen a carpet bag, so there was no officer about there—I took him up to South<lb></lb>ampton-street</p>

               <p>by myself before the officers came to me—I gave Kinghorn into custody then—before he said to me, "Let us settle it" I said to him, a You have got away from me once, but you will not get away this time"—I saw Burns afterwards—I met him on the Friday before Christmas day, the 22d I think it was—I had been making some inquiries about one of the notes that had been paid into the Bank—I met him in High-street, Bloomsbury, along with three other skittle sharpers; they were coming towards me—as soon as Burns saw me he ran across High-street and across Oxford-street—I ran after him and caught hold of him at the corner of Tottenham-court-road—he was very resolute and wanted to get away, but the officer was close to him, just across the street, and I called him and delivered him over to him—when we got to the police-station he wanted to persuade the inspector that I had not got the right man—the inspector said he did not think so; he thought I had got one right for he had known him a long time—while the officer was putting the handcuffs on, he said he would make me pay for it if I cost him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I was before the Magistrate a paper was put into my hands by the attorney for the prosecution, that was on the last day; we had them there when they were committed—I had been before the Magistrate four times, and this was the last occasion—it was a paper with writing on it; it was not in my hand-writing—the last time I saw the paper, it was in the Hon. G. F. Norton's hards; that paper, whatever it was; was not in my handwriting—I do not know personally what became of it—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the document that was handed to me; it is not my writing nor did I write the signature—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "This is to certify that I have played at skittles for </hi>40<hi rend="italic">l. and lost </hi>40<hi rend="italic">l., and further I agree to play for the like sum of </hi>40<hi rend="italic">l., my opponent taking my word of honour for the like sum of </hi>40<hi rend="italic">l.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. I believe he had conducted himself in a very satisfactory manner? A. Yes, so much so, that I had entrusted him with a very important walk - he had six or seven other bills to receive, but he made various excuses; he had twelve or fifteen bills on the 5th of May, but I have no recollection of receiving above 1s. that morning - in the afternoon I believe he brought me in 10s. or 12s. from different persons; I was not present when he was taken, but he told the officer he had lost as much as 11l. out of his pocket; but he never received more than half that at any one time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he stated to you that he had lost it? A. No; he ran away on the 14th of May - I told the Magistrate he had been very careless for a few weeks, and I wished him to have some punishment for it.</p>

               <p>have about twenty men in my service, employed in repairing clocks—in the upper part of the house there is a shop in which five men are employed, of which the prisoner was one—he has been in my service five or six years—he was employed from nine in the morning till half-past seven, and his wages were 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he had no authority to get wages from anyone else—previous to 15th March, my attention was directed to the work coming from the five men—the shop did not pay—I called the prisoner down, and spoke to him with reference to a self-registering compass—I desired him to stay in my lower shop till his work was brought to me—he did not stay, but in the hurry of business he got away—I went out of the shop for three or four hours, and on my return I found him in the workshop—I asked him for the machine—he said, when my manager's back was turned he had got it away to his own house—I said, "Why, do you mean in my time; you take goods out of the house. For whom did you make it?"—I had some difficulty in getting an answer, and then he said, "No, I have not taken it to my house, but I have taken it to Captain Albini's, for whom I have made it"—he is connected with the Italian Embassy—I had not heard from the prisoner at all that he was doing work for Captain Albini—I then sent for the officer, Cheshire—I had told the prisoner that unless he gave me the machine on which he had been at work I should give him in charge for stealing my property—he then left with the officer and returned in about half-an-hour, and brought a box with him—I demanded to see the contents of the box, and I found it contained the self-registering compass on which he had been at work for Captain Albini—this is part of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the other part was taken away the next morning by another workman—when the box was brought back it was left upstairs—these are some of the internal works—there was also part of an electric clock, and a piece of material on which he was at work for me, some pieces of metal which correspond with metal I have in my establishment, and a pinion collect—I had not given him any authority to remove any of my materials—I asked him to account for having made this for Albini, because it must have taken two or three months to have made—I think he said it was made in his own time—I said, "How could that be, when you left at half-past seven in the evening, and left all the machine behind you"—then I said, "About the materials; where did you get the materials?"—he said, "I got the framework where you get your frameworks, from a man in Clerkenwell," and he showed me a receipt for which he had paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the rough frame—I then said, "How about all the other wheels, and the escapement"—I think he said they were made with his own materials—I at once looked at he material, and found it to correspond with mine, and I told him that it was not so—of course I cannot swear exactly to brass—I then said, "How do you account for taking the electric clock"—he said, "Oh, I bought that of Mr. Baines"—he is the patentee—I said that I knew better, because I knew where the clock had come from—one of the other workmen told me, in the prisoners presence, that the clock was taken from a cus<lb></lb>tomer in Camden Town, for which I substituted a clock of our own make—I had substituted an ordinary movement for the electric movement—when I said they were my materials, I do not think he made any reply—these three thermometers were brought to me the next morning by the detective—they are such as have been in my stock—there is one with the name of French on it—I succeeded Mr. French about six years ago—and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was he given in custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the evening that I detected it—he was not charged with stealing the thermometers—they did not appear until the next day—I did not direct the constable to take him into custody—the constable asked him to accompany him to his house—he was not taken into custody at my establishment; I left it to the constable—the officer said, "Have you any objection that I should search your premises" and he went with the officer—he was brought back to my house with the box—I afterwards learned from the officer that the box was not found at his lodgings, but at a tobacconist's—my establishment is very large; a ball falls there by the time from Greenwich—the prisoner did not assist me in making improvements on the ball—he did some work on the machinery, I kept him for the purpose—I don't think he repaired it at a great saving of expense—he made some suggestions on it—he was a very excellent workman, and I put him on the most delicate work—he has shown me machines which he said were his own invention—he offered to lend me a clock with a one-wheel movement—I do not think I put it in the Exhibition—I will not swear that I did, or did not—I do not know what became of it—I know he showed me a thing that was worthless, I do not know whether it was in the case or not—I am not able to answer what was in my case—I should not exhibit a worthless thing—if he, as the foreman, were to put it in the case, it would have been done—Captain Albini is not here—he refused to come—I asked him, and he said he would take the privilege of the Embassy—he said that to me, at the Mansion House—I afterwards found he was paying for the defence, and I charge him with having surreptitiously employed my man—I have seen a receipt of Captain Albini's for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made the charge about the clock on the remand, that was about a week after the robbery—I don't think I charged the pieces of metal at the first remand—but I think I did the thermometers—I felt most wronged in the making of the machine for Captain Albini, and being robbed of my time—I did not first instruct Mr. Sleigh in this matter; I met him in a railway carriage, and we got into conversation, and he told me he had been instructed, but that he had not time, he was so engaged that he could not give proper attention to the case—he did not say he would not prosecute in a case like this—the value of the pinion collett is about 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the price of the thermometers is about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—the one with the whales would have to be repaired before it could be sold—it has been exposed outside the shop—it is good now—it would not require as much to repair it, as it would to make a new one.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 5th March, about six o'clock, I went to Mr. Bennett's place, in Cheapside, and saw the prisoner in the work<lb></lb>shop—I said, "I have seen your master, Mr. Bennett, and he tells me that You have taken away a box containing a machine and some clock move<lb></lb>ments"—he said, "Yes I have, it is mine"—I said, "You have taken it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186804060035"></xptr>
               <p>away in a secret manner, which leaves your master to suppose it is his property; where have you taken it to?"—he said, "I have taken it to a friend of mine, Captain Albini"—I told him that Mr. Bennett had sent round to inquire about that, and had found he had not sent it there—he then said, "Well, I have taken it home"—I asked him if he had any objection to my going with him to his house and fetching it—he said, "No"—we then started to go to his house, 23, Arthur Street, Peckham—after going some distance towards London Bridge, he said, "It is not at my house, but I will tell you where it is; it is at a tobacconist's shop, in Queen Street, Cheapside: come with me and I will show you"—I went with him to the shop, and he asked for a box he had left there, and this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was handed to him—I took the box to Mr. Bennett, the prisoner going with me—it was opened in the prisoner's presence, and he said that everything in it belonged to him—I then asked him if he had any objection to my going to his house, and he said, "No; I will go with you"—I went there with the prisoner, and one of Mr. Bennett's shopmen; and in the front room I found two thermometers hanging up, and one in a room upstairs—I said to him, "These have got Mr. Bennett's name on; how came you in possession of them?"—he said, "They were given to me by a shopman named Rolls, at Mr. Bennett's"—I asked him if Rolls had any right to give them to him—he said, "No"—I told him he would have to go to Bow Lane Station with me—we went there, and I there charged him with stealing—these three thermometers, part of the electric clock, the three pieces of brass, and the copper were shown to the prisoner before the thermometers were found—he said they all belonged to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he not have a conversation with Mr. Bennett about everything in the box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He made his replies to Mr. Bennett, not to me—I heard him say he had bought the clock of Mr. Baines—I don't know where he is to be found—it was on the night of 5th March I found the clock, after he had been spoken to about these things—I went and searched his house the same night, and then took him to the station from there—one of Mr. Bennett's men, named Mean, went to the house with me, and also to the station—I signed the charge sheet myself—Mean did not give him into custody—he said he had no right to have the thermometers, and I charged him with stealing them—I let Mr. Bennett know the next morning—he was not charged with stealing the machine at the first exami<lb></lb>nation, but it was mentioned—my charge was for the thermometers—he was charged with stealing the electric clock on the second examination, and it was further gone into on the third—I cannot say whether the prices of metal were mentioned at the second examination—the pinion collett was gone into the third examination—the pieces of metal were mentioned, but I don't think they were charged—he did not object to my searching his house—he went with me voluntarily—he was not in custody then.</p>

               <p>No, ten or twelve—they are cast in sand, and as soon as the metal is set, the sand is turned into a tub and they are picked out—I used up the others for the job I made them for—this was on stock—it would be used now for anything it would come in for—it is worth about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and was made about eighteen months ago—it was then put in my drawer under my bench—I did not see it again till it was shown to me—I gave information to Mr. Bennett about the machine, and he sent for the prisoner to know what machine he was making—I have not since been made foreman—I am just the same as I was before, and I have the same wages.</p>

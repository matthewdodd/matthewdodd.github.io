                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On the 17th of March Daley was brought to me—he had two wounds, one on the upper, and on the lower lip—one front tooth was knocked out, and the gums severely lacerated—he had received a severe blow in the mouth—it is possible that this jug might do it—he represented, at first, that it was a saltcellar—it seemed more likely to have been cut with glass than earthenware.</p>

I did not want to hurt the man if I could help it.</p>

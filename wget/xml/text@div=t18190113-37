            . I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner is my half-sister. I have known her from her infancy. We took her into the house on the 28th of October, she remained six weeks with us, and conducted herself in a becoming manner. On Sunday, the 13th of December, I went to chapel with my husband, leaving her at home with my child, which was between ten and eleven months old. I returned, found the child on the bed, and the prisoner gone - nobody else was in the house. I missed a great deal of wearing apparel, with my watch, a 5 l. note, and other things. Next morning I heard she was in custody, and saw my things before the magistrate.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 14th of December I received information, and apprehended the prisoner about ten o'clock in the morning; I asked her if she had not lived in Fleet-street? she said, Yes. I then asked her if she did not leave her master on Sunday? she said Yes. I told her I took her on suspicion of robbing him. I took her into a room, and proceeded to search her; she opened her right hand, there was two 1 l. notes, and 17 s. in it. I asked her where she changed the 5 l. note? she said at Mr. Pound's, the Royal Oak, Pitfield-street. I then asked her where the other property was? She put her hand into her pocket, gave me the watch, and said she would go with me to her grandfather's, who lived at the Royal Oak, and there was the rest of the property. I went there with her, and found her grandfather lived there. She delivered all the property up to me there that was lost, except the rest of the change of the 5 l. note. She had given her grandfather 8 s. Pound said he changed the 5 l. note for her - I took her to the office. I have the 5 l. note, the candlestick, watch, spoons and a purse. The rest of the property was delivered up before the magistrate.</p>

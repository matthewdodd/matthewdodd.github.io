                  </hi>. I live in Plumber-street, City-road. The prisoner was in my employ eight years, on and off—my watch hung on a nail, in my workshop on the 5th of August—I went out a little while, and when I returned the prisoner and the watch were gone—I met the prisoner in the afternoon, and charged him with stealing the watch—he said it was not pawned, but the party it was with had made away with it; and if I had not acted as I had done I might have had it again.</p>

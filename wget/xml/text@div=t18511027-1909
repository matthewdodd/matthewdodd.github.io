                  </hi>. I am fireman on board the <hi rend="italic">London</hi> steam-packet; it plys from Hull to London. I was on board it on 24th Sept., between 10 and half-past 10 o'clock in the evening—the vessel was then on the open sea, about forty or fifty miles from Hull—I saw the prisoner in the fore-cabin, and Hockney, a recruit, was lying in the upper bed-berth, with his feet towards the prisoner's head—there was another recruit lying with him—Hockney appeared to me to be asleep, and everything was quiet for twenty minutes before that time—the first thing that drew my attention was, the prisoner raised himself on his elbow, and made a motion that some one had hit him on the head—I could not tell what he said—he spoke to some one, and he reached himself over to some person lying underneath, who gave him a knife—after a short interval, the prisoner, with his hand, made a back<lb></lb>handed stroke at Hockney's foot—Hockney made a very sudden start, pulled his leg up, and said, "That man struck me; he stabbed me right through the foot"—he turned over, got out of his bed place, and pulled his boot off—it was full of blood, and the place was covered with blood running through his stocking on the floor—the master came down, and I saw the prisoner hand the knife to him—I was standing close by—I took hold of the blade of the</p>

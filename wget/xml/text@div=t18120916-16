               <p>Q. Was this Alderman Coombe's dray - A. No, I was coming up the King's Road. I saw the dray standing on this side of James-street. I saw Isaacs under the dray; he went from the dray and looked down James Street; he came back to the dray again under the box, and took five papers of halfpence, and on his running into Theobald's Road, he let one of the papers of halfpence fall, he took it up, and put it into his hat; I pursued and took him, just before he came to Green-street. I said you have been robbing this dray. He had one paper in his hat, and four papers in his bosom. I made him take them out of his bosom, and put them into his hat. I took him back to the dray. He took a spike out of his pocket, and threw it among the people. He was never out of my sight from the time he took them out of the box until I took him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I don't know what the articles you charge this man with are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Did you find some baize, canvas, leather, silk, worsted and cotton lace, some skeins of thread? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find these things? - In the prisoner's house; I was present with one of the men of Hatton-garden office; it was on the 9th of September.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now about these things. Did you miss them at all? - We missed a skin of leather, which led to a discovery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that you missed? - No, we did not find that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you missed nothing but that skin of leather? - We missed green baize about a week or a fortnight before we searched his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. A month perhaps? - I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Or a year? - Not so long back as five weeks, I cannot say to a day, but it is not more than a month or five weeks; I don't know particularly that we missed any other articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever know that you have lost any thing but a skin of leather and some baize, and the skin of leather is not in the indictment? - It is not. We have sometimes lost so much as half a hide of black leather.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of the public office, Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you employed to search the prisoner, and to search his house - I was. I found these things in his house; here are some candles marked with a particular mark, which Mr. Lucas identities, marked with a red string; here is thread, an hussiss, lace, and some bits of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. These you found in the prisoner's house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was the prisoner at home when you searched his house? - No; his wife was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. She is an ailing woman, is not she? - She is.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a daughter, I believe? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you was astonished to find some thread in the house of a man that had a wife and daughter? - There was a deal of thread.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope, if you are a married man, we shall not find any thread in your house? - Yes, you might undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. In short you found a great deal of what you would consider as mere waste and rubbish? - Mr. Lucas said it corresponded with some that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not answering my question.</p>
               <p>Court. The jury will judge what they are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Only they are brought in to make weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Amongst the great many things you found, some of which are of very little consequence, tell us whether you can identify them? - This lace I can, it is a crest lace of Mr. Whitmore's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you tell me when it was in your possession? - It was in our possession about two months before we found these things in the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110006"></xptr>Q. What may be the value of it? - It is of no great use.</p>
               <p>Q. When you have made your carriage then these bits are throwed about the shop? - They are about the workmens boards.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you fix any value on it? Would it sell even for a penny, at the piece broker's? - I should imagine it would; it certainly is worth a penny if it is worth any thing; it would make a pin-cushion, therefore it is worth something.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not any workmen have leave to take away such things as that? - If they asked for it, they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose they did it without leave? - We should reprimand them for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you suppose they took a pin? - I don't say that. Here is another crest that was for Sir

               <p>Q. Is not such as this laying about your workshop? - Yes, about the board of the man that trims the carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. What value is it? - It is of some value.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me when you had it in your possession, how many years ago? - Not a year ago.</p>

               <p>Q. You serve Mr. Leader, I believe? - Yes, Mr. Leader and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at the candles that lay there, and tell us whether these are the candles that you delivered to Mr. Leader's house? - Yes, they are the same, I know them by the cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they different to those that you fell in the course of your business? - Yes, they are particularly marked; I have some of the same in my pocket, which, I believe, will march; we sell none of that sort to any body else; there should be eleven threads in the largest ones, that is ten white and one red; and the smallest ones seven threads, six white and one red.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can you positively say that these were made by you, for Mr. Leader? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you tell me how many threads other tallow-chandlers put in their candles? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that you make no other of that kind, but for Mr. Leader; but your neighbour tallow chandler may make others just of the same sort? - He might; but I believe they will match in size, length, and every thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. They are a common size for candles? - No, they are made of a particular size, and particular length.</p>
               <p>Q. Which any other person may make as well as yourself? - Yes, if they have orders for them; they are never made except for some manufactory or some brewhouse, it is done particularly as a check for a manufactory where there are great many workmen.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know when you made these particular candles? - Yes, in March last.</p>
               <p>Jury. But should this man, or any other of Mr. Leader's, come and say to you, pray let me have some of the candles, such as my master has, would not you let him have them? - No, I would not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to say they were delivered to Mr. Leader in March last? - No, they may be belivered some of them in May, and I have delivered some of them later.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const to Lucas. Do you happen to know whether there were any can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110007"></xptr>dles lost? - We have so large a quantity that we cannot miss them; they are kept in a large box, in one of the counting houses, which this man bath access to; we deliver every, man a candle night and morning, and the pieces that are left we get up every night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Lucas. Pray who was the partner of Mr. Leader in March last? - Mr. John Coilingridge and myself.</p>

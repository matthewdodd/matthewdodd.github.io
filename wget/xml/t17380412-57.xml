Then she told me, there was a lusty Woman at the Door, (who is the Evidence here) and I might see how I lik'd her. Upon this the Evidence came in, and the other (I believe the Prisoner is the Woman) jump'd out of the Door at once. The Prisoner having sat with her Leg in my Lap, I suspected she had robb'd me; and upon searching for my Purse, I found it was so. I immediately complain'd to Mrs. Arnold, that I was robb'd, and went to the Door, where the People in the Court told me, that 'twas

Upon this we went to Mr. De Veil for a Warrant, and when we came back, we found Arnold and the Evidence in the House, with a Woman crowded all on a heap, with a Pipe in her Mouth. The next Morning I was inform'd, that the Woman thus disguised was the Person that robb'd me Upon this Information I took up the Evidence, who discover'd the Prisoner. I am sure I had the Money when I went into the Room; for I took it then out of my Breeches Pocket, and put it into my Waistcoat Pocket, as the safest Place. When I carry'd the Prisoner into the House, she was dress'd very gay, in a velvet Hood and Manteel; but when I came with the Warrant, she was wrapped up in Rags, and had a Pipe in her Mouth.</p>

             and I, agreed to walk together at Night. Between Fetter-lane and Middle Row, in Holborn, I stopp'd to speak to a Man, and while I was talking to him, she pick'd-up Mr. Pullen. I miss'd her, and judg'd she was gone to Mr.Arnold's with him, So I follow'd, and Mrs. Arnold told me, Lydia had carry'd a Cull up stairs. I went up to the Chamber Door, and Lydia cry'd, here's a fine large Woman, see &amp;c. &amp;c. - and immediately she jump'd up, and ran down Stairs. The Man complain'd at that Instant that she had robb'd him, and I bid him follow her. He went to the Door and we fastn'd it upon him. Upon that he made an Out-cry, and Mr. Oatley and Mr. Holley came to his Assistance, and demanded the Door to be open'd. We refus'd; and knew they had no authority to break it open; they knew the same, therefore they resolv'd to leave some body at the Door, while others went for a Warrant, because the Neighbours had declar'd, that the Prisoner was hid in the House. While they were gone for the Warrant, one Mrs. Dunckley who was then in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173804120020"></xptr> the House, was frighted, and insisted upon being let out, before the Warrant came; so we open'd the Door, but the Persons who kept Guard on the outside, would neither let her go out, nor suffer us to shut the Door again. So when they return'd with the Warrant, they found the Door open. When the Prisoner jump'd out of the Room from the Prosecutor, she did not go out of the House, but ran into the Cellar, and when the Street Door was shut upon him, she came up with an old sort of a stuff Purse in her Hand, and 'twas spotted with black and yellow, had long Strings, with Tassels at the Bottom. The Prisoner told 35 Guineas out of it, into Arnold's Lap, and she put it into a Bag, and hid it over the Kitchen Door. I saw the Money, and remember a crooked Guinea in particular. Then they burnt the Purse, and the Prisoner undress'd herself, and put a double Clout about her Head, and ty'd an old Handkerchief and a colo r'd Apron about her, and sat down with a Pipe in her Mouth, that she might not be known. When the Prosecutor return'd with the Warrant, the House was search'd, but they did not find the Money, or know the Prisoner in her Disguise. When the Hurry was over, I went home to my Lodgings, and in about half an Hour, the Prisoner and one Mr. Clark (that she lives with) came to me, and said, they had got all the Blunt, meaning the whole 35 Guineas; and he told it over before me and her. They wanted to lye with me, but I refus'd it; so they talk'd of going to Lawyer Grimes's. When I was taken up, I insisted upon Mr. Clark's returning the Money, and it was return'd to Mr. Pullen - all - except a little that was allow'd for Favours; but 'twas upon Condition he should not Prosecute.</p>
               <p>Mr Chamberlain gave an Account, that Mr. Clerk return'd 30 Guineas of the Money, and that the Felony had been compounded, had not he prevented it, and caus'd the Money to be paid into the Constable's Hands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, carrying on business in Piccadilly. On 29th July, last year, I had a sale of timber and goods in Whitecross-street—the prisoner attended the sale, and he bought some lots, amounting altogether to 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave his name and address as William Law<lb></lb>rence, John-street, Hackney—on the following day, one of my clerks at<lb></lb>tended to give out the goods, and he gave me this cheque as having received it in the course of his duty—the cheque was not paid—I obtained a warrant for the prisoner's apprehension, but he was not taken till lately.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Guildford-place, Clerkenwell—I remember a sale of timber and goods which took place in Whitecross-street—I had known the prisoner about three months before that—I had not seen him above three times. On 29th July last year, I was at his mother's house, which is down a cab-yard—I saw him there—he asked me if I had anything to do to-morrow; I said, "No"—he said he would give me a job, and asked me to meet him the next morning in Old-street—I did so, and we went into a public-house together—he desired me to go down to where the sale was, and he gave me a card in the name of Lawrence—I went and got the account and gave it to the prisoner—he was then at the top of Whitecross-street—he told me to go to his mother and get a horse and cart, and get money to pay the man—he rolled up the account in something, and I gave it to Mr. Woods the clerk, and this cheque was in it—before the prisoner gave me this cheque, I saw him cut this small piece out of it with a penknife against the wainscot—I heard the prisoner ask the landlord for a pen and ink—the prisoner did not tell me what this was—I took it to the</p>

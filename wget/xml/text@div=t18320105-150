            . I had two or three sacks of coals, and was to pay for them by weekly instalments; I had them on the 14th of June, and on the week following I paid the prisoner 1s. 6d. - I think the last I paid him was on the 9th of August; he said he could not write - I am sure I paid him 7s. 6d. by 1s. 6d. at a time, in five times, after the 14th of June - I paid him on his own account, but Mr. Brown's name was on the cart.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. The prisoner never paid me one farthing on account of Mrs. Warren.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the habit of paying you any sums without stating from whom he received them? A. Yes, when he sold for ready money, but when he debited the coals, I made inquiry who the persons were, and where they lived;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050080"></xptr>he booked Mrs. Warren, of Shepherd's-bush, three sacks of coals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. What is the value of three sacks of coals? A. 10s. 6d. - I accounted with him every night; I never kept any running account with him except when he got drunk, and could not give any account of it - this is a receipt (looking at one) for 1l. 4s. on the 9th of August, which was the last day he was in my employ; he came home very tipsy, and there was money he could not make up, when I discharged him; I have a person named Westbrook in my employ - he may in one or two instances have received money of the prisoner when he has come home drunk, and it was too late for me to see him, but he never accounted with the prisoner; I always did that.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. He had accounted to you for 1l. 4s.? A. That was on two or three different nights, when he came home short of money - it had nothing to do with this charge; when he went out in a morning, he loaded a certain quantity of coals, and it was his duty to come to me in the shop every night, and give me a correct account of them all - I put it down at the time; I understood he could not read or write - I was very particular, and generally repeated what he said; I took down the account of the 14th of June, from his month, and am quite certain he has never accounted for any money received from Mrs. Warren since that time.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner in the course of the summer; I had three sacks of coals of him - I paid him half a sovereign and some silver; I think it was 6d. - he came to me again in November, and I said, "There is a mistake between me and Mr. Brown, for he has sent to know if I owe him any thing;" he then asked if I would take 15s., and pay Mr. Brown over again; I said I was very sorry, and would do any thing on his behalf, but I had given my word that I had paid the money, and I would not take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he ask you to take it on his own account? A. He said, "Take it and pay Mr. Brown over again;" this case was heard at Brentford, and I think the prisoner was dismissed; I would have taken the money, but after passing my word, I could not do it; I did not state that before the Magistrate -I was not asked, and I kept it back, in hopes the prisoner would get his liberty.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN re-examined. Q. Do you remember the prisoner debiting Mrs. Leek with this money? A. Yes, on the 7th of July, for three sacks of coals, and on the 21st of July one sack, amounting to 15s.; he said they were not paid, and desired me to book them - he never paid me the money.</p>
               <p>- WESTBROOK. I am in the service of Mr. Brown. The prisoner's wife brought me 2l. when he was at the tread-mill, and she requested if my master sent me to any person where he had booked coals, to pay it, and when I saw the prisoner, he desired me. if I was sent to any of the persons to whom coals were booked to pay it out of the money, and not let Mr. Brown know a word about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been in the habit of receiving money of the prisoner? A. In one or two instances; I have taken it to my master, and he has put it on the shelf and come and cettled for it - I never was engaged as a clerk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you receive this money for? A. To pay in part of any thing he had received without telling my master; my master never kept a running account with him; the prisoner was apprehended in November, I believe; I had received the money before he was charged with embezzlement, and I was to pay it as if it came from the customer.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. BROWN. Q. Would that sum have made your book right? A. Oh! certainly not.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

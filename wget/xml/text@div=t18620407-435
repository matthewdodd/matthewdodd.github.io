                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at East Acton—I am in the habit of frequenting the Askew-arms public-house—I was in there on 25th March last, about 8 o'clock at night—the prisoner came in, called for a pint of beer, and put down a shilling—the landlady, Mrs. Kemp, took it up, and gave him some change—he drank the beer, and went away directly—I made a communication to Mrs. Kemp, and she showed me a shilling, and, in my presence, bent it nearly double—on 27th March, I had just gone in there again to get my half-pint of beer, and saw the prisoner come in—it was near 3 o'clock in the day—I recognised him—he had a pint of fourpenny beer, and put down a shilling which he took out of a tobacco box—(he had taken the one on 25th March out of the tobacco box)—the landlord gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, change—I spoke to the landlord who detained the prisoner—I fetched a constable, and he was given in custody—Mr. Kemp then pro<lb></lb>duced a shilling, and the prisoner snatched it from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Kemp, and keep the Askew Arms, in the Uxbridge-road—on 25th March I served a man with some beer, in Allerby's presence—I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man—he gave me a shilling, which I put in the till where there was no other shilling—I gave him change, and he left, and then, from what Allerby said to me, I looked in the till and found the shilling which I put there—it was bad—I afterwards gave that same shilling to my husband.</p>

The last witness is my wife—on 27th March last the prisoner came and asked for a pint of beer—I served him—he gave me a shilling, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—Allerby was there—I laid the shilling on a recess, over the till, by itself—there were no other shillings there; only a few farthings—after that Allerby said something to me, in consequence of which I looked at the shilling again, and found it was bad—I told the prisoner it was bad, and he asked me to let him look at it—I held it out, and he snatched it from me—I asked him for it again, and he tendered me a good shilling, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I then detained him, and gave him in the costody of the police-sergeant—he held out a good shilling afterwards—on 25th March my wife gave me a bad shilling, which I marked and laid on the shelf in the parlour—I ultimately gave it to the same sergeant—when the sergeant took the prisoner in custody I told him that the prisoner had taken a shilling from me, and he searched him in my presence and found a bad shilling in his coat pocket—the prisoner said it was the same at that he gave me; that he had not any more.</p>

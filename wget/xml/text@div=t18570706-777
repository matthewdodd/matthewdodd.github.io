On 25th June I was with Brett, a detective officer, and Evans, at the East India Company's stores, Leadenhall Street, and saw the prisoner come out about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I followed him to No. 43, Plummer Street, City Road, and saw him enter a house—I waited about an hour, and he came out with this handkerchief in this condition—I followed him to a brass founder's, William Olney's, in Ratcliffe Row—Evans and I went in, and I asked the prisoner what he had got in the handkerchief, which was still in his hand; he put it on the counter, and said, "It is only little bits of copper wire which fell off the wagon; I did not think there was any harm in it, having seen a great deal of it swept to the dust heap;" that he worked at the stores of the East India House, Leadenhall Street, and that was where he got it—I weighed it, and there was 2 1/2 lbs.—I took them to the station.</p>

On 25th June, Ratcliffe and Evans came—the prisoner was there, with this bundle of copper wire in his hand—I knew him by sight, he had been there several times—I did not buy it—the officer asked me to weigh it—the market price for old copper is 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the East India Company, at No. 108, Leadenhall Street. The prisoner was employed in the same ware-house—strips of copper are stored in that warehouse, which are bound</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185707060017"></xptr>
               <p>together with this wire, which is not removed from the stripe—I have been employed by the Company about three months—no one has a right to remove copper from the premises—I never saw strips of copper swept away—I have seen the prisoner wrench the wire off the bands with an instru<lb></lb>ment within four or five weeks of this time; he threw them down by the side of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are the strips of copper removed from one place to another? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are removed from the wagon into one room, and again when they are sent down for shipment, but they are put into cases first—it is very seldom the case that the wires are cut by the bundle of copper bars in moving, and tumble off; I dare say it does occur—I have seen them broken sometimes, but nothing like this quantity; perhaps I may say that once a week I have seen one or two small pieces, such as you hare in your hand—different numbers of men are engaged at different times—I did not take notice whether the instrument the prisoner used was a chisel or a knife—I thought it was a very improper act, but did not wish to get the prisoner into disgrace, and did not mention it; I mentioned it to one man, but not to my superior officer—I mentioned it to Ratherbee—the prisoner came there after me—I did not know him before he came into the service—when he wrenched the copper off men were working in the room, a man named Anderson was there, and Dale; I believe they are not here—I said before the Magistrate and before the Grand Jury that I saw him wrench the wire off with an instrument—I cannot say whether I said so before I went before the Magistrate—the prisoner has said that I picked up the bands and appropriated them to myself and I wish him to prove it; it has never been suggested by anybody else—Ratherbee is outside.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the employ of the East India Company at Leadenhall Street, in the same warehouse as the prisoner, and on the floor where these strips of copper are stored—I do not know how long he has been there; I have only been there a month or five weeks—on Wednesday, 17th June, I saw him wrench off some bands of copper from the bundles, and place them in his pocket—nobody had any right to take copper wire off the premises—I have never seen any of it swept away as waste—the bundles are never severed; they are tied up with four bands, and they leave the warehouse in the same condition—when I saw this I made a communication the next morning to Mr. Rodney, the inspector of stores.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had any person made any communication to you about the prisoner, previous to your seeing him wrench off the wire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but afterwards, on Tuesday, the 16th, Howell told, me about it going home—the prisoner wrenched off the wire with a kind of little crowbar or iron chisel—that was done in the upper room—a man named Rose was present, and other persons; I do not know their names, as I have not been in the employ long—there is nobody here to-day who was here on the 17th—I did not tell Mr. Rodney a word about a crowbar or instrument having been made use of—I said at the Mansion House that the prisoner wrenched them off—it was similar to a crowbar, but smaller—I never mentioned</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

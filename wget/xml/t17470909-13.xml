I said, he had taken some Money out of the Till, and he said, so I have, but 'tis a Queen Anne's Shilling; and he puts back the one Shilling, and went out with the two.</p>

I ran out after him, and said, I desire you would come back again, and answer for what you have done. I brought him back again, he had his Handkerchief in his Hand, and he said, What do you accuse me with? She said, You Villain, you have robb'd the Till. He said, Madam, you may have dropp'd it, and he dropp'd his Handkerchief down by the Bar side, and said, Madam, I have no other Money than what I wanted to change with you. He dropp'd his Handkerchief down and pick'd it up, and said, Madam, here is one Shilling.</p>

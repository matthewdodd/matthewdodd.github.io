I have the shop and back parlour. On the the 24th of January, at half-past seven o'clock, I was in the shop; it was quite dark; my goods were exposed for sale in the window. A young man was at work at the window with me. I heard a noise as if somebody had knocked against the window as they passed, but did not break it, but immediately afterward the window was burst through. I saw a large glass in the center crashed; it is twice as large as the others. Supposing something was gone I immediately ran round to the door, and could not get it open, it was tied. I forced it open and found this handkerchief (producing it) tied to the handle and the rail. I was not many seconds getting it open. My house is at the corner of a court leading into Hart-street. I was directed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170039"></xptr>down the court; saw somebody running; pursued him up Bird-in-hand court and along Hart-street, but lost sight of him at the corner of James-street. I returned to the shop, a mob had collected round the window; the pane was broken quite out. I looked at the window outside, and found several seals on the window and the mob picked up about twenty off the pavement, and brought them in. I examined to see what was gone, and missed more than five gold seals, six gold rings, a gold key, and a gold pin. I have not recoverd them. I am sure I saw them in the window before. The witness, Blackman came into the shop with others, and gave me information. The light falls only on the bottom of the window; a person of the prisoner's height could not be seen in the face so as to know him again, unless he was stooping down. I did not see him.</p>

            . I am fifteen years old. On Monday the 24th of January, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in Long-acre, by Mr. Crouch's shop. I was going after a situation to Newport Market. I saw the prisoner and his companion looking about the prosecutor's window. I went on a little way, and crossed over by Long-acre chapel, and saw the prisoner's companion tying the prosecutor's door with a handkerchief; the prisoner stood close by the window at the time, and I saw him shove his hand through the pane of glass - break it, and snatch at the seals; and I think he took some out, but I was too far off to be sure of that; they both ran up Bird-in-hand-court. I immediately called Stop thief, and followed them. I lost sight of them at the corner of Hart-street. I ran back to Crouch's and described the prisoner to him. I was sent to the officer in Phoenix-alley and described him; he is not here. On the Friday after the robbery, I was sent for by Mr. Crouch and taken to Bow-street; the prisoner was in custody. I saw him taken out of Covent Garden watch-house, and said directly that he was the man; nobody was with him. I am perfectly sure of him. I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not come into a public-house with the officer where I was sitting, and say you did not know me? A. I went to a public-house with the officer, but he had another dress on; if it was him he had a Scotch cap on. I said I did not think it was him. I did not see his dress then except his cap; this was before the Friday, but when I saw him in Covent Garden watch-house, I was sure of him, as I saw his dress then. I think the person I saw in the public-house was not him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said at the office you were sixteen years old? A. No; I said I was fifteen; the Magistrate did not object to swear me.</p>
               <p>MR. CROUCH. Blackman had described the prisoner's person and dress to me. When the prisoner was taken, his left hand was cut at the knuckles. When Blackman saw him he immediately recollected him, and his dress corresponded with the description he had given. He said at the office that he was fifteen or sixteen years old, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the play at the time with two young men, who will be here at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BLACKMAN re-examined. There was a good light in the street, I do not think it was gas. I could see his face. I saw him on the same side of the way, and then crossed over. I was about a quarter of an hour observing him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler at the King of Den<lb></lb>mark in the Old Bailey—I purchased that house from Mr. Watson Ansell on 23 July, 1877—I paid him part in cash and part in three bills, two of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and one for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the first was a three months' bill, and the second six, dated 23 July, 1877, the day of the change—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was afterwards cancelled, and I gave another for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was, I believe in Mr. Ansell's possession—that was cancelled about 6th March last—on that day I think I saw the prisoner at my premises—the form of a bill for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out on that day—Ward drew it up—no name was put as the drawer—I accepted it in Ward's presence—he drew the bill for Mr. Ansel who was busy at the time—nothing was said about any name being put as the drawer of the bill—Mr. Ansell gave him instructions what he was to do with the bill—he said, in my presence, "Take care of that bill for me, and keep it in your safe"—I heard nothing else said as to what was to be doner with the bill—I did not hear anything said about the drawer's name—Mr. Ward took the bill away with him—the name of Josiah Ward now upon I was not on it at the time I accepted it, or at the time Mr. Ward took away—it was not put on in my presence—it is not in the same ink as the rest of the bill—an account was made out at the time the bill was drawn up between Ward and me—he drew it up for Mr. Ansell, showing the state of the account between Ansell and me—I did not owe Ward any money at that time, I never owed him any—the hill was presented to me the day it became due, by Trenchard and Smith, and I paid it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say that the bill was fraudulently signed by Mr. Ward with his own name instead of Mr. Ansell's—I had no knowledge of that at the time I paid it—I saw the bill, of course, with Ward's signature on it when I paid it—my banker told me that I must pay it—it was payable at the bank—I did not make any excuse for not paying it—I was</p>

               <p>ill the day it was presented, I was not present, I was in bed—I stated in my sworn information at the police-court: "Since that I have, under the threat of legal proceedings, paid the said money to Messrs. Trenchard and Smith, who presented the bill in company with Mr. Morris, the defendant's manager and clerk"—I am not the prosecutor in this case, Mr. Ansell is—he was out of the room at the time I accepted the bill—he was in his own office—he had not been into the room that morning at all—Mr. Ward drew up the bill, and I accepted it—I believe he brought the bill to my place and drew it up there—I don't think it was ever in Mr. Ansell's possession—he never had the bill—he was not in the room when Mr. Ward made out the account—it was not an account between Ward, Ansell, and myself combined—it was between me and Ansell, it had nothing to do with Ward—I can't say whether Ward wrote down the amount of his commission for discount<lb></lb>ing the bill—I don't recollect—this (<hi rend="italic">produeed</hi>) might have been the account that Ward wrote out at that time—I can't say—I say it was Ward who wrote out the account—I did not write it—this is the account against Ansell—that is my writing "26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. six months' rent, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., interest 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I wrote that at the time—I don't know who had the interest—that was written when Ansell was out of the room—I don't know whether Mr. Ward was to have the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his security—I am sure Mr. Ansell's sigrature would have been worth the paper on which it was written, if he had signed the bill—if he had put his name to it it would not have prevented the bill being dis<lb></lb>counted—I did not know that he had undertaken to pay a composition of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound in a fortnight, and that he failed to carry it out—I heard of it in Court a week or two ago—I do not know that a demand in bank<lb></lb>ruptcy was made against Mr. Ward in reference to this bill—I never heard of it—I do not know that Mr. Ansell made a demand in bankruptcy on 12th September last year for the payment of the debt on this bill—Mr. Ansell and I carry on business in the same premises—he calls himself a carrier's agent—I never heard of this document: "The following are the particulars of the demand of Ansell against Ward, amounting to 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being the amount of money received by you from Lamplough as trustee or agent for me in discharge of the balance due on a bill of exchange for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I have no recollection of it, it might have been shown, or I might have been told, I don't recollect—I can't say the date when proceedings were taken against Mr. Ward at Guildhall Police-court—I don't think it was so early as the latter end of last summer, or the beginning of autumn—I know that proceedings were taken against him—I was a witness—I think I filed an information—the charge was dismissed—I have not been here before.</p>

I am a carrier's agent at the King of Denmark in the Old Bailey—I have known the prisoner some years, I don't know how many—I think I handed him the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill to take care of about December—I am not certain—I gave it to him at his place I believe—he kept possession of it till the beginning of March—I gave it him to take care of for me as I had no banking account, I had to carry it about in my pocket or leave it at home, he had an iron safe—Ward brought back the bill to the Old Bailey at the beginning of March—I don't know the day exactly—Mr. Lamplough was there—I was not there when the bill was delivered to Mr. Lamplough—I saw Ward after he had been to Mr. Lamplough—he handed me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think it was—that was for the interest of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to that date—that came from Lamplough—I owed Lamplough 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Ward, it might be five or six years or eight or nine years, not twelve or fifteen; he has not been a very great friend to me that I know of; he has cashed a bill for me before—I was summoned for keeping a betting house, but I never kept it, and the charge fell through—Ward was my bail for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in 1877 I owed him something like 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know the exact figures—he went to a meeting of my creditors—I believe he voted for my paying my creditors a composition of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound in a fortnight; I don't know, I was not there—I have no doubt he did—I never had the paying of it; my solicitor had the money to pay; I don't know whether he paid him or not—I don't know that it was never paid; I never had the accounts rendered to me, and' never saw them—I think the amount of my debts was something like 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 2,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was secured—there is an account between Ward and myself now; he has done repairs for me, but I have never had the account—I should not think it was as much as 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he built a little place for me—I have never asked him for the bill—he did not tell me that he would do further work for me on my promising that he should be paid the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in full, and pay him for the future work he was to do; that I swear—I sold the King of Denmark to Lamplough—there were three bills, two of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at three, six, and twelve months—I had a cheque for 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about 24th December—that was on account of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was exchanged in March—I had several amounts in cheques from Ward; 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—on 24th December I had a cheqde for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 11th February, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 18th March, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 27th April an acceptance for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not have a truck from him on 1st March which was charged 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I swear that—he paid some small sums for backing horses for me—I had no gold from him after the second bill became due; that was about 26th February, I think—I took proceedings at the police-court before Mr. Alderman Knight, and the</p>

               <p>charge was dismissed—that was about November, I think; I am not certain—I believe I had leave to be bound over to prosecute—I never gave Ward a bill of sale—there was one drawn up, but he never had it; I was to have had some money of him, but I never had it, consequently the bill of sale was never handed over to him—I don't know whether the bill of sale alleged that I owed him 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I never read it—I don't know whether it was filed in the Court of Queen's Bench; my solicitor handled it, and did what he liked with it—I very likely signed it; I think it was done in anticipation of my having some money, but I never had it—Ward knew I was going to give the bill of sale if I had the money of him to pay an action, but it was never wanted; I should certainly have read it if I had handed it over to him, but there was no necessity; he never had possession of it—an action had been brought against me in the Mayor's Court by the South-Eastern Railway Company; his lordship overruled the South-Eastern Company, they applied for a new trial, and they beat me there before Mr. Brandon, but they have never asked me for the money—there was no execution out against me at the time I signed the bill of sale—my solicitor served Ward with a demand in bankruptcy for the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; we endeavoured to get the money civilly if we could, and if not we tried to get it this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Ward was to let me have the money on the bill of sale to pay the South-Eastern Company, because he said I could not have any on the bill; he said no one would discount Lamplough's bill, but it was not required, and the bill is now in my solicitor's possession; I saw it this morning—the cheques that have been spoken of were on account of the second 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was not discounted for me—now and then I would go to a race meeting with Ward; perhaps once a month—I believe there was no account between us on racing matters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and am acting as solicitor for the prosecution in this case—I was acting for Mr. Ansell in the second action brought against him by the South-Eastern Company—there had been a previous action before his lordship, in which, under his ruling, Mr. Ansell gained the verdict; the South-Eastern Company went to the Court of Common Pleas, and obtained a new trial—after several postponements by the South-Eastern Company it came on per proviso in March—I told Mr. Ansell that it was necessary to have Queen's Counsel in the matter, as important points of law were raised, and I must have some money to pay them with; he said "My fried <hi rend="italic">Josh</hi> Ward will let me have it under a 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill if I give him a bill of sale as collateral security," and acting on those instructions I executed the bill of sale, and it was executed and dated, fancying we should have the money that day—no money was obtained under it to my knowledge—several appointments were made for Ward to let Ansell have the money; it went on till the last day for tiling, and I filed it on that day, and I have held it ever since.</p>

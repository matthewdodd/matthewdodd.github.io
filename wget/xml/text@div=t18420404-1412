                  </hi>. I live at Frogmore, near Wandsworth, Surrey. Be<lb></lb>tween nine and ten o'clock on the 29th of March I was walking along High-street, Wandsworth, and met the prisoner—she said, "Holloa, old boy, how are you?"—she gave me a <hi rend="italic">shove,</hi> and pushed me up against the wall, and began feeling me about—I said to her, "<hi rend="italic">Go</hi> along, you hussy,</p>
               <p>I don't want any thing to do with you," I parted from her all in a moment, and found <hi rend="italic">my</hi> trowsers were undone—I put my hand into my pocket, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was gone out of a little bag which I kept it in—the bag was left, but it was open—the money could be easily taken out—I had before this taken out a sixpence, and changed it at Wandsworth—I went up the town again, and met the prisoner on the other side of the way—I said, "You hussy, you have robbed me <hi rend="italic">of</hi> my money"—she said,</p>
               <p>"Here," and returned 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "You have got a crown-piece and some shillings; give me back my crown-piece, I don't want to get into any bother, I have a wife and family at home"—she began abusing me "to all eternity," and said, "Give me in charge of the police"—up came four po<lb></lb>licemen—I was wrangling with her about the crown-piece—I was going off, thinking it was better to lose the money altogether, as there would only be hell upon earth at home with my wife—I went down the town—the prisoner followed me, and tore my shirt nearly asunder, and began abusing me—the policemen took her, and asked what they should find on her—I said, "Four shillings and a crown-piece"—she was searched, and a crown-piece and four shillings found on her, which was the money I lost—the crown was greasy with putting my hand into my pocket, being in the soap line.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I heard a wrangling on the 29th of March, and saw the prisoner with the prosecutor in High-street, Wandsworth—the prosecutor said to her, "You have robbed me of 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I did not hear what she said—he said, "You have only re<lb></lb>turned 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I don't want to get into trouble with you; return me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I will say no more about it"—with that she assaulted him—she did not say any thing to that—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is what I said before the Magistrate—it is true—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"she denied it"—the pro<lb></lb>secutor said, I will let you go, and say no more about it if you will return me the money.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Arnold - we live in the parish of Willsden. On the 28th of June, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I went out hay-making - I left my room all fast and secure, and nobody in it; I locked the room door with a padlock and another lock - I returned about eight in the evening, and found the door forced open; the staple was drawn; I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 4l.; the house is let out in tenements - we rent two rooms up stairs. Between four and five o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner Johnson and Elizabeth Allender laying by the side of the road, when I went down for some wood to light my fire; they were about one hundred yards from the house. Ann Allender lodged in the back room of my house, down stairs - before I went out Elizabeth Allender came in, and went out with Ann, who is her mother, and had lived there about two months. Elizabeth did not live with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who keeps the house? A. Mr. Wilson, who lives in town - he has no room there; an old lady has the front room below; Elizabeth Allender and Johnson cohabited as man and wife; I heard the mother say they were going to be married. Ann had a key of the street door, to let herself in and out; the robbery was committed between six o'clock in the morning and eight at night; my husband went out before me; he had no key - I had it in my pocket. The property was all safe in my room when I went out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many rooms are there? A. Four - we occupy the two up stairs; Ann Allender had the back room ground floor, and lived there with a man - another person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140065"></xptr>has the front room; it was my room door that was broken open, not the street door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You only believe she pawned them? A. It is the firm impression of my mind, that she did - I will not positively swear it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Junction-terrace, Edgware-road. On the 28th of June the prisoner, Johnson, pawned a silver watch, the maker's name Collet, for 1l. On the following Monday he brought two men, and sold them the duplicate - they redeemed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have not seen it since? A. No. Johnson came again in the afternoon, to pawn a waistcoat and a pair of shoes, but he behaved so rude I would not take them in. I have seen Collet's name on other watches.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a seal to it? A. It had a steel chain, a gilt key, and a small silver coin, such as a 3d. or 4d. piece to it - that is not an uncommon thing.</p>

I apprehended Ann Allender on the 29th of June, at Paddington, with a gown and handkerchief, which she said she was going to pawn for a woman; the prosecutrix said it was not her's. I took her to the office; she was discharged, with orders for me to take her again if the other parties were found. I had seen the three prisoners in company together on Wednesday, the 28th of June, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, at the Green Man, public-house, Alsden-green, Willsden, and a little after nine o'clock that morning I was on a coach coming to town, and saw them all three together in the Harrow-road, coming towards town, about two miles and a half from the prosecutrix. I am certain of them - Elizabeth Allender was behind the other two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You only saw them as you passed? A. No - I knew she lived in the same house as Arnold. Ann gave her name at the office as Allender.</p>

On the 28th of June, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I came down for my milk, and went to Mrs. Lee's room, which is the front room on the ground floor of Arnold's house; Elizabeth Allender came in there with some fea; Johnson came in his shirt sleeves, and without his shoes, outside the house, and looked round the corner of a brick wall into Lee's room; he then went into Ann Allender's room; I saw no more, but I heard her singing in her mother's room, and dancing a child about; next morning, the 29th, I saw that Arnold's door had been forced open, and went with her and the constable to take Ann; she was afterwards liberated, and, on our way from the office, we found the bundle of clothes at Traill's, and, on going home, I met Ann Allender at the Red Lion public-house, Harrow-road; she said, "You and Mrs. Arnold had me locked up to day, and I had not so much as half a pint of water, but now I have got half a pint of beer;" I said, "You deserved to be locked up, for you knew of the robbery; I have found the things at Traill's;" she laughed, and said,"Ah, and you think to find the watch, don't you?"

            . My husband works for Mr. Staple, of Paddington. I live next door to the Paddington watch-house; the watch-house keeper's wife was very poorly on the 29th of June, and I went to help her wash; I went to take in her clothes, which hung directly over the lock-up place! I had seen Johnson and Elizabeth Allender put in there that afternoon, and when I was taking in the clothes, I heard them talking, but could not see them nor they me; I was on the leads - I heard the man say to the woman, "We are done at last - I am a dead man; for the pawnbroker will do me;" the woman answered,"Yes, and if they find out where the gown and shawl is, I am a dead woman;" she said, "Never mind, we shall both go together, and, I hope, we shall meet together again;" she said "If we could let mother know, it would be all right enough," but she could not; he then said, "I put a shirt down the necessary;" she said he was to blame, but said "Never mind, it won't do us any harm."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the watch-house-keeper's wife here? A. No; she is not well - she has been here two or three days, but was not examined at the office, and thought she would not be wanted - the leads are directly over the lock-up place - they were separate from each other, and were looking through a trap door talking; they were talking when I went out there - when I heard them talking I listened - my husband has been a watchman - he has 14s. a week, and I have a mangle - I never heard of the parish giving a reward on conviction of house-breakers - I should not have come here if I was not obliged; they were in different cells opposite each other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they locked in separate cells? A. Yes - with a passage between - about six feet a part - their voices would be heard on the leads, as the passage between the cells is open at the top, and they speak through trap doors - about nine inches by eight.</p>
               <p>MARY ARNOLD. All these things are mine - my husband's watch was silver, and had a steel chain with a 3d. piece to it, and the maker's name was Collet.</p>

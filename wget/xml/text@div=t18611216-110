On Saturday, 25th November, I saw the prisoner and Thompson in the Marylebone-road—I was with a constable in plain clothes—I told him something—I told Thompson in the prisoner's presence that I should follow him and take him in custody—they ran away, and I halloed "Stop thief!"—I followed Thompson 100 yards—Carpenter turned round and took Pink by the throat—I caught Thompson, and he caught me violently in the privates two or three times, and said, "You b—r, you shall never take poor <hi rend="italic">Alf.</hi> back to do his time"—I succeeded in keeping him—I believe he has some complaint to make against me.</p>

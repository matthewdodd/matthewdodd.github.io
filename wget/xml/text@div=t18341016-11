            , SEN. I am a proprietor of cabs, and live in Paradise-place, Lower-road, Islington. On the 5th of September, I was in the neighbourhood of Finsbury-square, talking to Jolly - the prisoner came by on a mare, and asked if we knew any body who would exchange this mare for a pony - Jolly said he thought he knew a man who had a pony to part with - he produced the man to him - I followed him soon after - the prisoner looked at the pony - they did not agree about the exchange; and after that, Jolly asked him the price of the mare, as he thought he knew who would buy it - he said, about 15l. - I thought her cheap, and afterwards said, "If you will buy the pony, I will buy the mare" - I at last bought the mare of the prisoner for 13l. - I was met with the same mare, driving in a cab, by Mr. Boutall, afterwards - the prisoner said he had her from a gentleman named Windle, and had had her six weeks - this was on the 5th of September - in consequence of suspicion I afterwards entertained, I only paid him part of the money - he was to come for the rest on the Monday following - he gave me the name of

            , ESQ. I am a magistrate. I acted as magistrate when the prisoner was examined as to the charge of stealing the mare - I do not recollect the prisoner, but this signature to the examination is in my handwriting - it was read over in my presence, and taken from the prisoner's mouth - (read) - "The prisoner says, 'I bought the mare, on the 4th of September, at the Cock, at Kilburn, about eleven o'clock in the evening: I gave 12l. for her. The man I bought her of was a total stranger to me: he told me his name, but I forget it."</p>

I said, "I have a great objection to any shopman of mine selling hats so, but if you have any friends, let them come here, and you shall have half the profit - I brought two charges against the prisoner at Bow-street, and have prefered two others since; I should think he has sold about 10l. worth of hats to his friends I have one shop in the Edgware-road, and one at Hammersmith; I was in difficulties in the early part of April, and compounded - I did not state that I had lost a great many hats, but could not tell how; I did not give any account on paper - I swear that no hats were found nailed up in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270045"></xptr>any particular part of my premises; it was a long time before that I had allowed the prisoner to deal - I had not directed him to nail any hats up, and to conceal them - I did direct him to nail up a place, but it was because there was no button to the door; my creditors were not there at that time, nor for three weeks before - they were only nailed up for about one day, they were not there when my creditors came to take stock; I had none concealed at that time - there was not a drawer, which was not open to their view.</p>

            . I am a superintendent of the Police. I took the prisoner on the 20th of April - I found on him two duplicates; one is for a hat, on which 8s. had been advanced; I asked what this duplicate related to - he said it was his own.</p>
               <p>MR. PERRING. This hat is my property - it has a mark by which I know it; there is nothing particular in the mark, but the hat is particularly light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose the mark would have been there whether it was sold or not? A. Yes - the prisoner knows my mark as well as I do; if it was wetted it might have been taken out.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you able to state that this hat was in your shop between one and two o'clock on the 17th of April? A. It was in my shop previous to my going out - I had had it in my hand.</p>

            . I am a hat-trimmer, and was employed by Mr. Perring - the prisoner also employed me to trim hats for him; the prosecutor has seen me trimming hats, and asked me who they were for - I said for Mr. Helsham; he made no objection - that was not a month before I left his employ; he never complained of the prisoner employing me - I know the prisoner sold hats on his own account; I have seen cards, which he distributed - they were like this,"John Helsham, hatter, No. 85, Strand;" I saw such a card as this three months before I left - I used to work at the prosecutor's shop; I have seen hats which have been marked by the prisoner and by Mr. Perring - they were very much alike; they were only chalk - their best hats were marked W. P., their guinea hats A., and the 18s. hats

            - I never could distinguish the difference between the prosecutor's mark and the prisoner's; I remember when Mr. Perring's creditors came to see his stock, but I had left before that - there were some orders given in preparation for that.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You were a trimmer of hats? A. Yes - it is two months since I was turned away - he found some trimming at my house, which are generally trimmers' perquisites, but he had discharged me before he saw them to gratify a base character of a woman.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was her name? A. Mrs. Flood - she was under Mr. Perring's protection; there was not a bit of new trimming among those he found at my house - they were old trimmings; it is a part of my duty to strip off old trimmings and put on new - he had one trimmer to each of his shops; he did not take me before any Magistrate; they were not worth 2d. - I generally have them to sell to a Jew.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the mark that was in it? A. S+2 - I mark all my hats S+1, 2, and 3; I could not swear to the hat I gave the prisoner - I serve Mr. Perring with the same sort of hats, and marked in the same manner; I made the prisoner a present of one hat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you swear you gave him this hat, when you do not know it? A. I cannot swear to this hat.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you give the prisoner a hat? A. The latter end of April, and I sold him one about the middle of March; I do not know the size of either of them - I am sure the one I made him a present of was the latter end of April; he required a bill, and I made out a bill for two hats bought of me, though I gave him one of them - it is about a fortnight since Mrs. Helsham came to me for the bill for two hats, and I gave it her; I made him a debtor for both the hats.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you sold him a hat in March, and gave him one in April? A. No - I gave him one first; that was some time in March, I think - I did not keep an account of it; I had both given and sold these hats before the 23rd of April; I have sold such hats as these to Mr. Perring - I think I had sold him some in January, February, and March; I had sold him some about April- I did not know that the prisoner dealt in hats; my manufactory is in King's Bench-walk, Borough.</p>

               <p>J. S. THOMAS re-examined. I got the duplicate from his fob on the 21st of April; I questioned him as to the hat - he said, "It is all right, it is my own property;" Mr. Perring was in the shop at that time, and we were in the back parlour - the prisoner did not produce the duplicate himself; he said before the Magistrate that Mr. Perring knew he dealt in hats.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an architect and surveyor, of 2, Robert-street, Adelphi—I have known the prisoner since 1858—he has been in my employ since September 9—his salary was two guineas a week—his employment was to superintend certain buildings in Bennett-court, Drury-lane, in December last—he told me in December that the joists of the houses were in a very ruinous condition, and wished me to come and inspect them; he said that they must be reinstated directly with new joints—I went and looked at them, and came to the conclusion that the joints must be entirely reinstated, and gave him instructions to estimate what the timber would be which he should want to finish the house: he handed me this statement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in his writing—he said he thought it would come to about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I cast the amounts up and thought it would, upon which I sent him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 6th December, for the purpose—it is crossed—I gave it to him with the understanding that he was to pay it to Mr. Putney, of Elm-street, Gray's-inn-lane—he told me he had been there and looked at the stuff—this is his signature on the back of the cheque—he called on me the same evening; and said that he had paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than the amount of the cheque—he produced the invoice, and I gave him the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him whether the goods were delivered, and he said that there was some sawing to be done, but he could not tell what it would amount to, and the following week I was charged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the cartage and sawing, which I paid—I kept the invoice—it is the same date as the cheque, and is now in exactly the same state—he told me that the timber was delivered, but I have since ascertained, by information, that it was not—I do not know of my own knowledge; I took his word that it was.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he, on 14th December, ask you to lend him some money to pay Mr. Putney for some timber that he owed him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that he owed him; that he intended to buy of him—I did not, at the time this was bought, take an I O U of him for this cheque—I positively swear that—he has not paid me money of any kind—I have paid him—I went through the Bankruptcy Court in 1859—the prisoner was not my petitioning creditor for so much as 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think it was 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I cannot swear—I do not know anything as to the state of the affairs—I was informed by the solicitor's clerk that there was a considerable sum in hand over and above what the creditors claimed; I understood the debts proved were 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that the cash in hand was 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I mean to say that not a farthinghas been paid yet—I think the prisoner's debt was 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear it was not 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there was a debt of about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. also—I had been insolvent before that—I did not make inquiries whether I paid anything then—it was in 1855 or 1856—I am forty-two—I commenced business about 1840 or 1841—I still do not know whether anything has been paid or not, though I have been told that there are plenty of assets—I really do not remember whether I have had any other insolvencies or bankruptcies—I do not remember any dates or any particulars—I have also been in business at Oxford—I had a very good business there, and I have a good connexion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270055"></xptr>
               <p>there now, but I had a better business in London—I left Oxford in 1851 or 1852—I never was in Birmingham in business—I was many years con<lb></lb>nected with the London and Birmingham Railway—I did not take the benefit of the Act in Birmingham, nor did I compound with my creditors there, or in Oxford—I have not that I remember, compounded with my creditors besides my bankruptcy and insolvency—there were not half-a-dozen times besides that I am aware of—I have on a great many occasions been at plaintiff or defendant, in some of which I have been worsted, and some the reverse—I did not once have my books and papers detained in Court by Lord Campbell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> is a very careful reporter; does not Brown mean you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and Bradley was a man who had given me a bill to get discounted—I brought an action upon it for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I have no doubt that I swore on that occasion that I had paid Bradley 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that bill—I will not swear whether I produced the receipt or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that that document could have been produced by you, and disbelieved by the jury, and impounded by the Judge, and you have forgotten it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what I produced—I produced certain receipts from Bradley, to show that I had paid him money; I will not say upon that transaction—I got into the box and swore that they were genunine—I produced my books and documents—I got all my books out of Court—I had a bill of exchange, and I think there were one or two receipts, for which application was made to be impounded—I think Lord Campbell tried the action—there was an application made to impound them, and I know that they were impounded, but I did not know it at the time; I was informed of it afterwards—I never heard till to-day, that the jury, after inspecting the documents, said that they were evidently concocted—I did not hear Lord Campbell immediately give directions that I should not leave the Court—I was not charged with forgery in 1855, nor in 1854—Mr. Hawkins preferred a charge, and the inspector would not take it—I think it was in September, 1856—I cannot remember that of which I have no knowledge—I never asked Mr. Hawkins for any paper signed by Mr. Parkes except bills of exchange.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell Hawkins that you had paid money to Parkes upon those bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not choose to answer questions upon that matter, because at the present time I am plaintiff against Hawkins in an action for that very matter, and therefore I shall not answer—I was discharged by the Magis<lb></lb>trate, who said that he did not believe him upon his oath—I remember that because it only happened on 13th January this year, and he gave me in custody for the sole purpose of prosecuting this man,—the inspector would not take the charge in 1856—I have been charged twice by Hawkins, three, four, or five times on the same document—I brought an action against Hawkins in 1857—I do not know whether Hawkins said that it was true that I had committed forgery—he got out of the way, and turned up in Whitecross-street prison—I do not know whether he said that I had committed forgery—I do not know what pleas were put into my action, I am not a solicitor—I believe we gave notice of trial, I am only stating my belief; if Mr. Lewis, the solicitor, was here he could tell you more plainly—he would not let the matter go as an undefended action, and it was set down in the Secondary's Court, and he took out a summons to show cause why he should not be allowed to appear—he obtained leave to appear; by saying that it was the fault of his attorney, Mr. Clark, of Bedford-row; I will not be too positive; and having been served with a declaration, I believe they took out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270056"></xptr>
               <p>about nine successive summonses to obtain leave to plead, under the plea that there was a material witness absent from the country—they obtained leave, and when we were ready to try the case, Mr. Hawkins was not to be found—I know nothing about what the pleas were; I knew nothing about them—although I know of things about the summons and the declaration, I mean to say that I do not know whether this man pleaded that I had com<lb></lb>mitted a forgery—the action has never been proceeded with, because Hawkins went through the Insolvent Court—I think he has made four charges against me since upon the same document, and the last time Mr. Mansfield ordered him out of Court, and ordered me to be discharged; and I had to appear against him on the 13th, at the Middlesex Sessions—I know Mrs. Bennett, I lodged with her—I charged her on November 9th, 1855, with stealing some of my things—she was taken before the Magistrate—I cannot remember whether the servant appeared as a witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she not say on the second occasion, when cross-examined, that she had been induced by you to make the charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never remember hearing her make such a statement, nor did I ever hear of it till two years ago—I know the servant was a witness in the case; and she was taken by Mr. or Mrs. Bennett and kept for a whole week, and then contradicted on the second statement, what she had said on the first—they never brought any action against me for false imprisonment—I had not been through the Insolvent Court then—I went through in 1856, but that is not 1855—I know the girl made some statement—I only read a report of it afterwards, in one solitary newspaper—I do not know that the girl made that state ment; I only know I saw something of that sort in print, that I had induced her to make that statement against the landlady—I do not know that I have done a very great deal in bill transactions—I have done a very little—I do some sometimes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And occasionally you have disputed them have you not; a bill in 1861 drawn by Bragg, and accepted by you: and upon Mr. Pullen, the attorney, making a request for payment, did (you tell him that that bill was a forgery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told him no such thing—if you will give me my bag I will show you what I did say—my chambers were at 2, Maddox-street Adelphi, at that time—I am going to read from a letter addressed to C.

                  <hi rend="italic">objected to the contents of the letter as irrelevant to the case</hi>)—I told Mr. Pullen that if he had any bill of mine dated 3rd July, for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was a forgery, for I had never accepted any such bill—I disputed the bill, and an action was brought—I did not ultimately pay the bill and costs—I have never paid the plaintiff a shilling—I insisted upon having a bill of 5th July—I did not before the trial was coming on, pay the amount of the bill and costs to anybody, net upon any bill of 3rd July—I agreed to pay some<lb></lb>thing for the costs—there was no such bill as that due, upon which Mr. Pullen brought the action, and they withdrew the Record, as one of the endorsees had advanced the money—I paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I agreed to pay 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I only paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not paid any costs—I demanded the return of my acceptance; it was for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know Mr. Gale, a baker, personally—I never called a cheque of mine for two guineas which he held, a forgery; it was dishonoured because it was obtained from me by fraud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After it was dishonoured did not he bring it to you and demand the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember ever seeing Mr. Gale in my life—I do not remember anybody bringing it to me—I had a letter from a solicitor saying that if I did not pay it they would commence proceedings against me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270057"></xptr>
               <p>I never thought, or hinted, or said that it was a forgery; I could not—I believe a person called upon me about it, and I said, "That cheque was obtained from me by fraud, and I shall not pay "—I charged the prisoner first with obtaining money from me by fraud, charging more wages than he paid—that was investigated by the Magistrate, and after that I preferred this charge—I did not know of it at the time—I believe the Magistrate after that admitted him to bail—I do not know that while he was out on bail, he com<lb></lb>plained that I had forged his name—I never heard him—I mean to say that I do not know that he went, when he was out on bail, and applied for a summons against me for forging the document that I produced—I heard he made some statement of the kind to Mr. Henry, who refused to entertain the charge—I did not, after he had made that charge, prefer the charge of forgery which is to be tried—it was long previous to the man getting out on bail—I knew of the forgery first—I cannot answer the question whether I preferred the charge of forgery against the prisoner after he had been to Mr. Henry to prefer a charge of forgery against me, because I do not know at what date he went to Mr. Henry—it was preferred after I heard that he had been to Mr. Henry, but it was being investigated long before by me—I do not remember the date that he was given in custody for the forgery—if it was 8th January I knew of it on 30th or 31st December; but I did not give him in custody on the charge of forgery, because I was advised not to do so, until after the indictment had been preferred at the Middlesex Sessions—the indictment was preferred on the Tuesday—I am architect under the Society for Improving the Dwellings of the Poor—it was about 16th or 17th December that I first knew of the other charge I preferred against the prisoner, of demanding more wages than he ought</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I have your deposition before me, and I know what you stated. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You have no deposition of a previous date, you ask me when it came to my knowledge, and I tell you exactly, it came to my knowledge on Tuesday, 17th December; I can now speak positively, I knew nothing whatever about it till 17th December about noon—I swear that Mr. Bosanquet called me into his office on 17th December, and then I found that the prisoner had been falsi fying his accounts the whole time he bad been with me—it was not until 17th December that I knew anything about his obtaining money by fraud—it is not true that on 2nd November J spoke to the prisoner on the subject, saying that he had charged more than ha had paid the men—I spoke to him on 18th December, and asked him what explanation he could give—it is not true that I spoke at all about it in November—I knew nothing about it till December—I receive from the Society the money that I pay to the prisoner—I have not got it, because I have always received money from the Society as I have asked for it, and I hare paid him myself—I claim the money I expend, from the Society—I am not aware that the Society is prosecuting in this ease; how can they prosecute the man for embezzling my money?—Mr. Bosanquet spoke to me about it—he is one of the Directors, and the Secretary—when he told me of this fraud I said that I had that high opinion of Brittain that I did not believe there was a word of truth in it; but when he produced eleven instances I said I should let the police interfere—I gave the man in custody for stealing my things, but not for stealing the Society's things, which they alleged that he had done—Mr. Bosanquet's charge was two-fold; first, for stealing old bricks and stones; and also for falsifying his pay-sheets, and thereby getting money by false pretences—I have heard that the Society are, at this moment, assisting in his defence; but I can show you a letter from Mr. Bosanquet, saying that if the prisoner or his wife have said such a thing</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked about the writing on the back; just tell us under what circumstances those names came there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went with Sergeant Holmes, in consequence of information of the non-delivery of the timber at Mr. Putney's yard; and there made inquiries of Mr. Dolling, who is Mr. Putney's clerk; and these are the names of Mr. Dolling, and Mr. Allum, Mr. Putnay's carman—I took their names and addresses down on the back of the invoioe, in consequence of information I received at Mr. Putney's they are the witnesses in this case—Mr. Hawkins preferred a charge of forgery against me about 7th December, 1856—the inspectors would not take it either at Bow-street or Marylebone-lane—I was not summoned upon it—I was walking up the Strand and he met me—I think it was 7th Decem<lb></lb>ber, and he said, "Are you going to pay those bills?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Well; I mean you to pay them; I said, "I shall not; I have been discharged by the Insolvent Court, and shall do nothing of the kind; "he said, "I will charge you with forgery:" I said, "Do if you like" and at the corner of Catherine-street and Exeter-street we met a policeman; he said, "Take this man for forgery;" I walked to the office, and the inspector refused to take the charge, I walked out and he followed me, and gave me is custody again, took me to Marylebone-lane, and preferred the same charge against me—the inspector told him to get his witnesses; he got two witnesses who swore that the writing was not in Parkes hand; but in the mean time Superintendent Hughes came in and said to the inspector, "No charge can be sustained on this; let the man go;" and I was discharged—be did not apply again; but he followed me and hounded me through the streets—I had an action against him then for fake imprisonment—he went out of the way, and I never saw him again till he turned up in White Cross-street prison, two yean afterwards—he brought a charge against me on the 11th of this month; be fetched a policeman and gave me in custody on the same charge which he had made in 1856; I was walked through the streets from Lincoln's-inn down to Paddington, and incarcerated for forty hours; and the Magistrate, Mr. Mansfield, ordered me to be discharged, ordered the documents, to be impounded, and ordered him out of Court, saying that he did not believe him on his oath—that charge was preferred against me after I had brought this charge against the prisoner, and he said he would spend 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to transport me before I should convict the prisoner—I do not know that he is a friend of the prisoner's; but he has been active in getting up his defence—Mr. Bosanquet engaged me in February or March last as an architect in reference to this property, and the prisoner was employed under me—I first obtained information as to falsifying the accounts on 18th December—Mr. S. Bosanquet, the secretary of the Company, and his cousin, Mr. C.T. Bosanquet, gave it me—they made an appointment with me to be at their chambers; and he said he did not know whether I was aware that some of the men had made charges against the prisoner for falsifying the pay sheets, and also with not supply<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>them with refreshments which he had allowed; and that he had charged for it without their receiving it; and that ha had had a quantity of goods manufactured out of materials supplied to me, for the purpose of office fittings, and they had been fixed in some office in Bedford-row; and that a quantity of bricks had been removed, and stoves also—I replied that I did not believe there was a word of truth in it—I began, in consequence, to make inquiries—I did not summon him to the police-court—I gave him in custody two days after the conversation with Mr. Bosanquet—I spent those two days in making inquiries, and had the assistance of the police—his desk was broken open after this charge—I charged him with falsifying his accounts, charging me so much a day, when he paid less—three cases were gone into at that time—he was remanded—he was sot represented by an attorney at that time—after the remand he was committed to take his trial—Mr. Bosanquet attended with me at the police-court—I have brought an action since against Mr. Bosanquet—that accounts for his being on the other side now—it is for conspiring with Hawkins and causing me to be arrested on a false charge—I think it was the day after the prisoner was committed on the charge of false pretences that the desk was opened; no, it was after he was given in custody, before he was committed—I went to pay the men, and asked who had got the keys; the sons said they had no keys, and I ordered somebody to break the desk open—it was after he was given in custody that I discovered about this case; but I was not quite sure of the facts till after he was committed—I made inquiries of Mrs. Putney and found what I have told you—I first ascertained the forgery on 30th or 31st December—that was after he was committed—that was investigated before the Magistrate, and the prisoner was remanded twice—he was not represented by an attorney, and the Magistrate sent it here—when I was first of all applied to, to pay a bill ac<lb></lb>cepted by me on 3rd July, I declined to pay it, not having accepted any bill on that date—my reason for not paying the cheque for two guineas to Mr. Bragg, was because he had defrauded me of a sum of money amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I never gave it to him in my life—the cheque which was said to be dishonoured is one which I did not pay because it was obtained by fraud—the fraud was that Bragg came and obtained a bill from me for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. saying that if he had that bill he would give me back a bill for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not do so, and I sued on it, and refused to let him have the two guineas—I did not give him in custody for the forgery—I believe he was given in custody by the direction of Mr. Mullens, solicitor of the Banker's Association—Mr. Abrahams is, I believe, clerk to Mr. Atkinson—he is my attorney in this case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Putney, timber merchants—I have known the prisoner some little time—he came tome in the early part of December and asked whether I had some twenty-four feet battens—he said he wanted them for some joists for Mr. Osborne, of Notting-hill, I think—he did not tell me who he wanted them for, or who sent him—he pur<lb></lb>chased twenty twenty-four feet battens, and three seventeen feet ones—the amount of the invoice I gave him was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—something else has been added here since I gave him the invoice—he paid the money—I am not certain whether it was in cash or a cheque—it was not the cheque produced—he paid me in cash—he never mentioned any name for whom they were wanted—I am positive of that—he bought them in his own name—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I recollect receiving some timber by Dolling's directions—I delivered it at Notting-hill—the prisoner was not there—I forget the day of the month that I had orders to take it away—it was a Saturday morning about three weeks before Christmas—I took twenty twenty-four feet, and three seventeen feet yellow battens, and delivered them at Mr. Osborne's, St Katherine's-road, Notting-hill.</p>

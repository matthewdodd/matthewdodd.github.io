                  </hi>. I am a foreman of labourers in the Victoria Docks—on March 22nd I was on board the steamship California in charge of four gangs—the prisoner was one of the men—about 11.30 I went down into the hold where the men were at work, and ordered the prisoner to certain part of the ship to trim the bunkers; he did not go, and I took him by the arm and pointed in the direction in which he was to go—he stopped a little while and picked his pipe, and put some tobacco in it, and came up to me with a shovel similar to the one with which he was trimming coals, and holding it in both hands, struck me on my cheek with the edge of it, having aimed a murderous blow at the top of my head—he cut the flesh from the bone, and I fell senseless—I lost a great deal of blood, and have been suffering ever since, and am still—I have not been able to go to work since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at the Victoria Docks—Saville came to my surgery on 22nd March at midnight with a very large incised wound, extending from near the angle of his mouth in a semicircular form to near the angle of his ear, very nearly severing his cheek from his lower jaw—I had to put six or seven stitches in it—this shovel would produce it if struck downwards with the edge—a considerable deal of force must have been used, as the shovel is blunt—the wound stopped short of a dangerous position—the upper end was by the temporal artery, and the lower end by the facial artery.</p>

I live at Buxton Terrace, Canning Town, and am in Mr. Elliott's employ as engineer's boy—on 22nd March, at 11.30, I was in the bunkers on board the California—the prisoner was at work—I saw Saville speak to him, but cannot say what he said—he gave the prisoner a shove, pushed him on the face, and the prisoner picked his pipe up, and struck Saville with the shovel on his cheek—he fell, and I went out of the bunker.</p>

I am in the employ of Thomas Howes and others, drapers, of 19, St. Paul's Churchyard—on 16th July, 1858, a person came and presented this order, saying, that it was for Haynes &amp; Co., of Leicester-square—I communicated with Mr. Mead, junior, the son of the second partner, and let the person have the goods—(<hi rend="italic">Order Read: "Gobby, Haines &amp; Co.</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> 3, <hi rend="italic">Leicester-street, Regent-street.

I took the prisoner on 16th July, 1859, near his father's door, in Rupert-street—I said, "Elphinstone, I want you, for obtaining various articles from Mead's, in St. Paul's Churchyard,"—he said that he did not obtain it, but another young man, named Clifton, gave it to him, and told him to pledge it for 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Mr. Brown's, the pawnbroker, in Rider's-court—I took him to the station, went to Mr. Brown's, and found the cloth pledged in the name of Butler for 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

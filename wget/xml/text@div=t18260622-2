            . On the 13th of June, about two o'clock, I was in George-street, and saw General Burr - he said he was robbed. I saw the thief run up an alley; the prisoner is the man - he had the seals in his hand - I knew him before; he was always out and in at the house where I lodge - he went straight up George-street. I had known him for a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he ever live in the same house as you? A. No - I never said so; I have said his name was Tim Donovan and Pope, as he went by those names.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Giles's. On the 13th of June, in consequence of information from Thomas and another person, I went on duty in High-street, about five minutes past two o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner and five or six more coming out of Mr. Clark's wine-vaults, at the corner of High-street; I went to him and said I wanted him, as by the description I had he was the man who had robbed General Burr of his chain and seals - he denied it; his companions surrounded me, and kicked me about, and rescued him; about half-past four o'clock I found him again, in Bain-bridge-street, dressed in a different coat and waistcoat; he resisted, but we took him by force - he said he had not seen me before, but afterwards said I had taken him in an unmanly manner - I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was he disguised? A. When I saw him he had no coat on, but when I took him he had, and his hat was over his eyes. I think he had a hat on when I first saw him.</p>

            . On the 13th of June, about two o'clock, I was in George-street; the prisoner ran by me very quick, and turned up Ivy-lane, and in about half a minute I saw General Burr following him, quite out of breath - he had a hat on, and a light coloured sleeved waistcoat, but no coat; I did not know him before, but am positive he is the man who passed me; I saw him run the length of the street. I saw him in custody next day, and am certain of him.</p>

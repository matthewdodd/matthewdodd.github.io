             depos'd, That the Prisoner being a Lodger in her House, and she missing the Goods mention'd in the Indictment, had a Suspicion of the Prisoner, and what, she said, confirm'd her in this Suspicion was, she found her lac'd Handkerchief about the Prisoner's Neck, and Part of a Check Apron she found in the Prisoner's Room, which she knew to be her own by the Bosom Mark, for it was made of an old Shirt.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said in her Defence, That the Piece of a Check Apron with the Bosom to it was given her Child by the Prosecutor's Husband, to make a Doll of, and for the lac'd Handkerchief, she had those in Court who could prove both the Lace and Muslin was given her, tho' the Prosecutor pretended she knew the Handkerchief to be her's by a Hole in one Corner being darn'd, and by the Muslin being too long for the Lace at one Corner.</p>

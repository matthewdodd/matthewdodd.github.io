On the 13th of May the bell rang - I opened the door, and found the prisoner there; he asked me what time Dr. Scudamore saw patients - I told him this was the time, but he was then engaged; I asked him in, left him in the hall, and went to the butler to ask how long it would be before master could be seen, and in about two minutes we heard a scuffling by the door - the butler ran up; I followed, and the prisoner was gone: the door was open - the butler went out, and I missed the clock from the hall, off a bracket, about seven feet from the ground; I saw it safe when the prisoner was there - I went out, and saw the butler bringing the prisoner back, with it under his arm, about ten yards from the door - I did not see him stopped; he was brought back.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. At what hour did you let me in? A.Half-past twelve; you remained in the hall about two minutes - no other person came in: there was no knock at the door after I went down stairs - the noise was your going out and opening the door; I brought the clock back into the hall - I did not swear I saw the butler take it from you ten yards from the door; I swore you brought it back yourself, and laid it on the hall table.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the office about one o'clock, with a clock - he was desired to sit down on the form - he opened the office door, went in, and fastened the door; I went in, and found it fast - I ran through the clerk's office, and found him going out at the street door, in front; I brought him back - Mr. Rawlinson asked him where he was going; he said to make his escape - I afterwards searched him, and found a silver watch, two seals and a key, a purse, with six sovereigns and a half in it, and two snuff-boxes, one of which has been owned.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I went to the house to consult the Doctor - I had not been there a minute before a person knocked at the door, whom I let in; he took the clock down, and went out with it - I did not know but he might be a clock-maker; seeing him alarmed, I went out with him, as he run in a flurried way - I suspected something was wrong.</p>

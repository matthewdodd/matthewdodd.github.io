I am a coal porter at Hackney Road—I was near the Horns public-house a few minutes past 11 p.m. on Good Friday, 11th April and Went into the urinal opposite Shoreditch Church—the public-house was shut up; I had just come from the railway station—while coming out of the urinal I was struck on the nose, and knocked down by Davis—there was a lamp there—the plaster on my head is where I was kicked while down by several men—there were five or six others—I identify Ardren as one of</p>

I was on duty on Good Friday about 12 p.m. in Hoxton Street, Shoreditch and saw Nunn and Davis—I heard Nunn say "If I see a policeman I would lock you up"—I went up to them, and Nunn gave Davis in charge for robbing him—Davis said "I had just come from Homerton to Shoreditch Station, and was going home, when I met the man in the urinal"—I saw Nunn next day at the police-court, and in consequence of what he said I went with him and saw Ardren occupied as a shoeblack near Shoreditch Church—I charged him with being concerned in the robbery—he said "I am innocent, and know nothing about it"—on going back to the urinal on the night of the robbery I found marks of a struggle and a quantity of blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer of No. 1, Henry Street, Bromley. On Friday 15th Jan. about 1 o'clock, I was at the New Cattle Market, with a mare and cart, which was marked with chalk "For sale" at the back and the side—shortly after I had been there Hunt asked me what I wanted for the horse and cart, I said, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he bade 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I ultimately agreed to take—heleft me to find the man who wanted it—after the market was over, Wedge and Hunt came to me together, and Hunt said that he would take me to the man's house that wanted the horse and cart—he jumped up into the</p>

               <p>cart, and we all three went on—on the road Wedge said, "You stop here; I will buy your horse and cart of you"—he told me to stop at a public house about a mile from the market, and said that he would buy it, if I would give him a stamped receipt for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would give me the rest of the money when he got home, but I refused—he drove on again to the Cranes public house, I do not know the name of the street—he wanted to pay me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there, and gave me a stamped receipt, and wished me to drink, but I declined, and we all three drove on—he then said that, if I went back to the Cranes, he would buy it of me—we went there, and Crawley left the house, and said he would bring somebody who would buy the horse and cart—we all three went in, and left the horse and cart outside—Hunt then went out, and said he would bring somebody in who would buy it, leaving Wedge and me together in the public house—he returned in six or seven minutes with Flinn and Crawley—Crawleycame to me, and said that he would buy the horse and cart of me—theyall went out together to look at the horse—Crawley offered 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if I would give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. discount, which I agreed to—he wanted me to take a deposit and bring the rest of the money in the morning—Hunt said it was all right, that Flinn and Crawley were cattle dealers from the country—Flinn said of Crawley, "He is my brother," and that he lived at Stamford Hill, and could not go there for money, but I was to come in the morning—I did not agree to that, and was going to leave with my horse and cart, and Hunt said that he would take me to the man that wanted to buy the horse—we all went to Union Street, Bishopgate—the man he took me to there looked like a Jew; he bade 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I refused that—Crawley and Flinn said that they would buy it, if I went back to the three Cranes—we all went back there, and went inside; Wedge and Crawley went out, and left Hunt, Flinn, and me in the house—Flinn said that he could not get the money, would I give him my direction, and he would come down to my house in the morning for the horse—he borrowed a pen and ink of the landlord, and asked some person to write the direction as I could not write—my direction was written down, and Flinn took it—I was going home, but was stopped at the door by a party who <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me in, and when I did get out, the horse and cart were gone—Huntand Flinn remained, but I saw nothing of the other two after that—I ran out and made a communication to Policeman, H 105—the cart was found in the Green Yard, but I have not found the mare.</p>

I met Flinn at the Three Cranes public house, Brick Lane, Spitalfields—I called him out, and said that he was charged, with others, in stealing a horse and cart, last evening—he said, "I know nothing about it; I never saw the man before"—Liall, who was with me, said, "Yes, you were in the public house with me last night; you were one of the four"—I took him to the station—on Sunday evening, the 17th, I took Wedge, in Wentworth Street, and told him the charge; he said, "Very well, I do not know any thing about it"—I took him to the station—I was with him at the police office; his father, who was sitting in the same room, said, "Now, George, if you know any thing about this horse and cart, you had better speak the truth; it will be better for you"—Wedge said, "I was at the market with one of them, and rode to the Jew's, and the horse and cart are over the water"—I was in the same street on duty that afternoon, and saw the horse and cart standing at the Three Cranes, about half past 6 o'clock—thecart was marked, "For sale," in chalk—it was a dark brown horse, about fourteen hands high—Liall spoke to me when he came out of the public house—I have seen the cart since, at Mr. Bastable's green yard, in the Borough—Itook Lyall to see it, and he said that it was his.</p>

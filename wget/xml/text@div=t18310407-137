               <p>FREDERICK TYRRELL. I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WRIGHT. This is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Is there any thing particular about it? A.There is no mark on it, but it was wet at the time - I had a very bad cold; I had just such a handkerchief as this in my pocket - there was a great crowd there.</p>

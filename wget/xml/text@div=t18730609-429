I am assistant to William Bowman, a draper, of Ilford—on 16th May, a little after 1 o'clock, something was said to me, and I went to the door and missed a coat Which I had seen hanging outside shortly before—I saw the prisoner running away and no one else near but the little boy who told me—I followed the prisoner, but could not catch him, there were two more with him—Clark, another assistant, was with me, and the prisoner threw him down—I was then within 2 yards of him.</p>

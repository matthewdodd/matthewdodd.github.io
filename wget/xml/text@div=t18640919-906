                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bailey, of Trafalgar-grove, East Greenwich—on Wednesday, 14th September, I was on my way home, and just as I got to my house, a young woman spoke to roe, in consequence of which I went to the Man in the Moon public-house—I saw the prisoner and his wife there, and two or three women—the woman that called me struck me—the prisoner, who was sitting down, said "Take that, my money will pay for that"—I thought it was beer which was thrown over me, and escaped; my dress turned yellow, and my jacket red, and it burnt through in holes—the prisoner threw it once, and as I turned to the door, another dash came over me, but who threw it I cannot say—it never touched my flesh—I know the prisoner, and we have quarrelled, but we have been very quiet for the last five or six weeks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were you in the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not think more than two minutes—one of the women who struck me was next the door when I entered—I do not know who threw the second—the prisoner was not further than the width of this table from me when he threw the first—I saw his hand, but cannot say what was in it, or whether it was shut or open—the stuff did not touch my skin, but it burnt every stitch of clothes I had on, even my under garments—I do not use it for cleaning purposes.</p>

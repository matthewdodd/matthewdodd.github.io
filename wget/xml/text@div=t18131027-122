I saw my two pigs hanging up in the shop, quite dead. I am sure they were my pigs; I had them ever since they were a month old. I told him, they were my pigs. Elworthy said, she bought them of a strange man, he agreed to give four pounds for them, he gave a three-shilling piece earnest; the man was to come again for the money. I left a man there to see whether the man came I took the pigs away. Bye said, he was a bricklayer, he only came there to do a job; he only helped to get the pigs in.</p>

I asked her the reason she was not up sooner (her usual time was at six;) she said she had been extremely ill all night; I said, if she was ill, it was better for her not to get up, I would get up and do her work for her; I got up and left her in bed; I observed something in the chamber-pot gave me some suspicion of something more than ordinary; she told me she had been at the vault. I went into the house-keeper's room, and told her what I had seen (which was blood;) she desired me to get a candle and look down into the vault, which I did; I saw a great effusion of blood by the vault upon the ground, and I saw an after-birth in the vault; I took it out with a pair of tongs, and put it into a pan of water. The housekeeper went and acquainted Mrs. Hop of it; then an apothecary was sent for:

               <p>Q. If she had the pains of labour upon her before she departed the room, should you not have heard her?</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Lydial; I was sent for on this occasion to Mrs. Hop's, on Sunday the 8th of June, about eight in the morning; I was taken down stairs and shewed an after-birth; I made the servant that shewed it me acquainted with what it was, and desired her to let Mrs. Hop know, upon which I was desired to go up to her; I told her what I had seen below; my lady desired I would step up to the girl; I went up, not being willing to slurry her too much, I first asked her how she did; she made answer she was indifferent, or something to that import; I asked her whether she had any thing come away from her more than what I had seen; she said no; I told her she could not think to deceive me, there certainly was a child somewhere; she made answer, she was sure it was dead, that she had not felt the child move for two months; I told her the child must be concealed about the bed some where, or where the after-birth was found; she said it was there; I went and acquainted my Lady Hop with what she had said. I went away, and was called there again about three o'clock, and was shewed the child; I examined it, and found no marks of violence upon it; I attended her daily till she was removed from my Lady's.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say in what manner she was delivered</p>
               <p>Harness. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child full grown?</p>
               <p>Harness. It was.</p>

               <p>Jos. Ferdinando Gellio. I am pupil to a surgeon. On Monday June the 9th, I was sent for on the Coroner's inquest, and was desired to open the body of a female infant, in order to inform them whether it was still-born; I did, and tried the usual experiment; I took the lungs out, and put them into a bowl of water; they swam.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you infer from that?</p>
               <p>Gellio. The inference I infer from that is, that the child had breathed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been at its full time?</p>
               <p>Gellio. It did.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen this experiment tried?</p>
               <p>Gellio. I have frequently, and have tried it myself; the lungs are specifically lighter upon the water by having been inflated.</p>
               <p>Q. Will they swim when they are putrid?</p>
               <p>Gellio. They will.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, in your opinion and judgment, the unfortunate woman at the bar might be delivered of this child as she sat on the vault?</p>
               <p>Gellio. I believe there is a possibility of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the child might have dropped from her as she sat on the vault?</p>
               <p>Gellio. I do.</p>

            . On Sunday the 8th of June I was desired to go to Arlington-street, to Lady Hop's; I went into her fore-parlour, there I saw Mr. Spinage and another gentleman; they told me what had been, and that the child was down in the hog house: they desired I would get people in order to search after the body; I went and got a master bricklayer and his man; they went to work in order to search; I believe they found the body of the child about three o'clock. I saw it found; I believe it might be got down four feet into the soil; by raking, it might get lower down than it would have done, had the soil not been disturbed; I desired them to put it on a bit of a board, and get a pail of water, and wash it clean; after that, I sent for the apothecary to search the body, to see if there were any marks of violence upon it; he came, and did not find any; then I went and acquainted the Coroner of Westminster of it.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the prisoner living with Mrs. Grant? - Yes, very well. I had only lodged three days in the house when she robbed us. I had been out on Saturday; I came home about a quarter after ten; I knocked several times but could make nobody hear; I went away and came again after eleven o'clock; then Mr. Grant said the maid was gone. I went up stairs and missed a bundle of things (repeating the things charged in the indictment as her property).</p>
               <p>You are sure they were in the house when the prisoner was servant there? - Yes; I missed them that night. On the Sunday morning Mr. Grant told me he had found them at the other prisoner's house. I saw them before the justice.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of May Mr. Grant came to Sir John Fielding's office to lay an information against the prisoner Fitzpatrick; he told me she lodged in King's Head-court; I went there and was informed she was in Jackson's-alley, in the house of Mrs. Field. We went there; I saw a woman come out; I asked Grant if that was the woman; he said no. I then entered the house and asked for Rose Fitzpatrick; they told me she had walked out. I went up stairs to look for her, and I went into the yard, but could not find her. I then saw a door between the room and the stairs which went into the coal-hole; I opened that door and there I found Rose Fitzpatrick; Eield had denied her. When we first went in we saw a bandbox on the dresser, facing the door, which Mr. Grant said he knew very well.</p>
               <p>What room was that? - The ground-floor; there is but one room in a floor all up the house. There was a bundle; we asked Mrs. Field whose it was; she said it belonged to Rose Fitzpatrick. I took the spoons out of the bandbox; the other things were of no value; I gave them to her again.</p>
               <p>Grant. I know the bandbox to be her's.</p>
               <p>Field said the bundle was her's? - No, that it was Fitzpatrick's. She did not deny any thing Fitzpatrick brought into the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280133"></xptr> only when she was in the coal-hole Field denied her.</p>
               <p>Did Field claim any property in any of the things? - No, none. She said they belonged to Rose Fitzpatrick, and when we saw the box she said that was her's likewise.</p>
               <p>FITZPATRICK's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My master came in directly as my mistress went to market on Saturday night, and made me a present of these things; it was by his means I came away. I sent for no witnesses, the people told me it would be of no service to me.</p>
               <p>Grant. I am a taylor; I was at a publick-house paying my men, from eight o'clock, and did not come home till eleven.</p>
               <p>FIELD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Rose Patrick came and asked me to give her a night's lodging. She saw the man come up the court; she ran into the coal-hole and desired me to say she was not there. I did say so. The man took the key out of her pocket, and opened her box, and found the things. I said you wicked woman, how could you bring any body's property into my house.</p>
               <p>Grant. She did say so.</p>

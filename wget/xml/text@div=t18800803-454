                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">In Custody</hi>). I am under sentence of five years' penal servitude in Pentonville—I was tried here and sentenced with Henry Harbord at they January Sessions, for stealing drugs of the pro<lb></lb>secutors—after my conviction I communicated with Inspector Phillips and saw him in the prison and made a communication which he took down in writing—I afterwards saw Mr. Fryer, of the firm of May and Bate, and made a statement to him—in October, 1877, Henry Harbord and I were working together at Pink's pickle manufactory, Long Lane, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey, and the following January I opened a coffee-stall at Dock" Head, Bermondeey, and kept it till September—I was then living at 81, Eupert Street, Bermondsey—I was then single, but engaged to be married to my present wife—Henry Harbord came to my wife and asked her to make some money—I said, "In what way?"—he said that he had a friend who could get any kind of chemicals, red precipitate powder and calomel—I said, "What is the use of getting them if you can't sell them?"—he said, "I can sell them, I have sold tons of them"—I said, "If you can get the chemicals and sell them, why don't you do it your<lb></lb>self?"—he said, "I am so well known about there, it would get to the governor's ears if I went about there, "meaning the premises—he told me that he worked at Baker's 7 years—I said that I would consider of it—I afterwards got married, and in December I saw him again; he asked me what I thought of it—I said that I would go down with him any time he liked to May and Baker's—he said that we were to meet Tom King the night watchman at May and Baker's—I went there with him the Saturday before Christmas, 1878, at 12.30 in the day, and we met the prisoner King in the street—he and King walked on and I followed—when they had got about 10 yards we all three went together and Harbord said, "This is my <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>"—King said, "Is he a sound one?"—Harbord said, "Yes, you could trust your life in his hands"—King said, "I shan't do anything this side of Christmas. I hare bad leg and it is awkward to get about"—we made an agree<lb></lb>ment to go down the first Monday in January at 9.30 p.m.—King said that would be a quiet time to go as the police were charging duty—Henry Harbord and I went to William Harbord's house, in Hope Street, Battersea—I left him there as arranged, with King, and went to May and Baker's; I <hi rend="italic">got</hi> there at 9.30 p.m., and found King waiting for me at the small gate—he asked me inside and asked for the bag—I gave him two bags which I brought with me, and went with him and saw him fill them with red precipitate powder—we went through</p>

               <p>three doors, up a flight of stairs—I took 70lbs. of red precipitate; it was taken out with a scoop—Henry Harbord and I took it to my house, Bells Court, Bermondsey Street—we had an arrangement with King to meet on Tuesday night; we went at the same time—King let us in, and asked whether we wanted calomel or red precipitate—I said, "It does not matter"—he said, "We will have lumps to-night, as there is not much calomel there"—he gave me 60lbs. of red precipitate in lumps; he weighed it—I told him Henry Harbord wanted powder—he said, "Come on Thursday night"—you must wear a white smock and carry a tea bottle in jour hand, and you then can pass anyone, the people will have left work—I went at 9.30 on Thursday, with two bags and tea bottle with me—King let me in and we came to iron doors—he opened them, rent in, and got 25lbs. of powder out of a box marked B. T.—I took it to William Harbord's house, and told King it would be easy to draw on Friday—he said, "That is right, I want some money"—I took it to my house, and Henry Harboard came at 9.30 next morning—he said, "I will take some samples, I am going to my old pal—I said he had better sell it—he went away, returned at 12.30, and said he could not find him—he then said he would go to the man who had bought the spirit of him, Mr. Freeman, Chemist, of Kennington Park Road—he returned at 180, and said, "I have had a bit of luck, I sold 14lbs., one of white precipitate, one of calomel, and some bismuth"—I said, "That's no good, there is no red calomel and no white precipitate"—he said he would take ten of red precipitate and one of bismuth, and get money for them—I waited outside the shop; he came out in 20 minutes and said, "This party cannot buy much red precipitate powder, he wants dry chemicals; he says he bought bismuth at three shillings a pound, and red precipitate at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.t and he gave me a sovereign"—he said "You have Men working at chemical works, have you not any pals? "I said, "No"—On next Wednesday I met Henry Harbord, and he said, "I have met my pal, and have sold the powder at a low price," and he was to take it to the Old George public-house, Tower Hill—I went there with him the next Thursday, and met a man named James Clark, who paid six sovereigns, and I had two—we met King again the same night as he left his work, and saw three sovereigns given to him near the police<lb></lb>office—he said, "I can't do anything this week, there are Some men at work, meet me at the same time next week"—Harbord gave me four boxes on Monday and I gave them to King, and went to William Harbord's house—I stopped there till 9.15 p.m., and then went to May and Baker's—King let me in—he had four bags, weighing 120 lbs.—I said I could not carry the whole of it at once—he said, "Leave two and come back again"—I took it to my place, and next morning to William Harbord's house—he said, "I can't allow you to make an accommodation of my house unless I get something by it"—Henry Harbord said, "We will give you something"—John Clark bought it of us at a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound, and we gave William Harbord 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to the factory three times a week, and generally five times—we always sold it to the same person, and gave William Harbord 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the use of his house—on our way from the factory, in June, 1879, with the calomel and bismuth, Serjeant Francis stopped us, and I told him it was whitelead—we were both taken to the station, brought before a magistrate, and remanded on bail; we were subsequently discharged, and the property restored to us at Greenwich</p>

               <p>Police Court, and we sold it to Clark—I did not go to the factory again till 1st July—I then got the same kind of thing—that continued till the end of August—King said that Mr. Fryer had been looking about the premises, saying that there was a thief, and he would catch him—I told Harbord, and we did not go again for a month; wo then returned and continued doing the same till November—all the stuff we took in October we sold to Cross (about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth) between the three of us, King, Henry Harbord, and myself—we took very little in November, because Clark told me he could not sell any till after Christmas—in December I was being trained for a running match by a man named Carpenter every morn<lb></lb>ing at 10.30, and I told him we should like to sell some drugs, and gave him two or three samples which I got from Henry Harbord's house—on 4th December I god 981bs. of calomel from May and Baker's and left it all night at William Harbord's—next morning I fetched it from Waterloo Station, and the officers took me in custody—I said that it was whitelead—they said, "That tale won't wash this time"—William Harbord was called on my trial to prove that it was whitelead, but the Jury convicted me—he swore that it was the same stuff as the Greenwich stuff—when I took the lumps home I reduced them to powder—I was living in Arthur Street, Walworth, and the landlady told my wife she would not let me the place if I did it at home—we used to get a sheet of paper and lay it on the table and roll it with a bottle—Henry Harbord was not there; my wife has been to his house with me from time to time—I once saw a man on May and Baker's premises who King said was Old Ike, a <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of his—Henry Harbord said he became acquainted with Clark through <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> Smith; that Clark used to work at May and Roberta's, and they both lodged at <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> Smith's, and that his first transaction with dark was 10 bottles of quicksilver, for which he got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that they were worth 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I formerly worked at a druggist's in Alderagate Street, when Mott was in their employ, and in March, 1879, I met him in a coffee-house in Newington Butts—he was then working at Morson's, in Southampton Row—I told him that Henry Harbord and I were getting calomel and selling it—he said, "What is the use of that?"—I said, "We are selling it on the <hi rend="italic">cross.</hi>—he said, "I should like to make some money myself"—I asked him to bring Henry Harbord, and meet him up Holborn next day outside the music hall—I did so, and we went into the Ship public-house—Henry Harbord and Mott had a little talk, and an agree<lb></lb>ment was made how he was to bring things out from Morson and Sons, and a great quantity of things were brought from there every week which Henry Harbord sold to a man named Freeman—the money was evenly divided between me and Mott and Harbord—Bennett worked in the same firm, Mott introduced me to him—he brought hampers of chemicals out of Morson's in July, which he delivered to me, and they were sent to my house by parcels delivery; one parcel contained 321bs of tartaric acid, and another 301bs of bromide of potassium—and another contained some brown liquid—that was in September, it was addressed to me and sold to a man in Finsbury Park Road—the profits were shared equally between me Bennett, Mott, and Harbord; the highest profit we made was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one day—I discussed with Harbord what they were paying us, it was some-where about one fourth and somewhere one third of the value—I used to meet Friar at Holborn with Mott; he was called Little Harry—he said to</p>

               <p>me in August, "I can see the little game between you and Mott, and if you do not sell something for me I shall <hi rend="italic">round on you</hi>"—I said that I would sell anything ho brought out, and he brought 100 ounces of morphia—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and sold it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Harbord and I divided the profit—Mott said in October that Morson's had missed a lot of goods, and there was a bother about it, and we had better be quiet for a month or two—on 3rd December, Mott said that he had been searched by the police—when I went to May and Baker's, King said, "When the gas is not alight, never come down to the factory."</p>

The prisoner King has been our night watchman since 1876, at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.a week—Henry Harbord was in our service up to September, 1876—we had every confidence in King; he had access to all parts of the premises which were not locked at night—he had access to the red and white precipitate and to the lamps—they are kept in boxes and in pans—I saw Stevens in prison—you go up six steps as you enter the office, and there are three doors and then another flight of steps, and that gets you into another part of the premises where the lamps are kept—there are some iron doors as you turn to the right, one door sliding horizontally and the other lifting up—that is where the precipitate is dried and kept—there is a shed in this corner on the left leading down to the river—King's hours were from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 a.m.—he used to come on duty on Saturday at midday—on 5th or 6th December Inspector Phillips showed me two baskets containing about 281bs. of white powder, which was produced here in January. I examined it carefully; it was white calomel—we sell it wholesale; it was not completely manufactured; it was such as we were manufacturing in November and the beginning of December—it is our property—there are peculiarities in each person's manufacture—I immediately spoke to King who said that he had not seen Henry Harbord since he left the service, I think, but I am not quite sure; I know it was a remote time—I recollect</p>

               <p>King having a bad leg in May, 1879—I know the date because I wrote an order in the order-book for some sarsaparilla—we had a man named <hi rend="italic">Old I ke</hi>; and James Smith was in our service—white calomel was worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb. then, bismuth from 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb., of which there were on the premises some cwts.; and red precipitate, of the value of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb. at that time, but it has been as high as 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if a person could sell it it 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I should consider it very cheap—we missed calomel, bismuth, and red precipitate during 1876—the lumps could be rolled and sifted, and then it would be saleable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. H. AVORY</hi>. Thomas and James Smith were in my service at the time Henry Harbord was there—King worked there a year and a half before we made him watchman; everybody knew that—men worked at night on an average three or four nights a Week—King's duty was to look over the premises generally, he had access everywhere—the entire property covers 2$ or 3 acres—King's duties would be all over the works—the premises open to the river on one side, but a wall 13 feet 6 inches high has existed for 12 or 15 months, and before that there was I fall cutting off the old shed—there perhaps would only be 2 feet 6 inches of wall in a very high tide—the gate at the chief entrance is 11 feet high, it has been altered more than 12 months—King had not charge of the keys of locked-up places—he also had the special duty, shared in by the other hands, of making mercury corks—I have known that to take eight hours, but the duty is not continuous—the fires have to be looked after constantly—we had the most implicit confidence in King, or we should not have left him there—before Stevens was tried in January, I mentioned to King a report I had heard about somebody being at the premises the night before; he said that somebody had been down inquiring for me—I heard nothing more about it—I have visited the plice at night over and over again, but I never found the gate open, a suffcient time always elapsed after I rang the bell for anybody to come; I heard his steps and he came from the right quarter as a rule—I always found King at his post—he had no intimation when I or my partner were coming—King was called as a witness for the proseoution on the former charge, and I heard him say on his oath that he knew nothing of the property being carried away, and never gave any away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Henry Harbord.</hi> I took stock myself in January with regard to the mercurials—I did not swear at Southwark that I took stock on 10th December, and missed 100 lbs. of calomel, nor did my partner—I took stock in January, 1880, and the profits were considerably short—I lost a great deal more than 3 lbs., or 8 cwt.—probably none of us were the better for the making of antimony, and I suffered with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After the police took possession I examined the stock, and missed about 103 lbs. of calomel, value 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that has been going on ever since November—you can get from our place by rail to Waterloo station—I did not go round the works before post time, but I have been at 10, 11, and 12 o'clock, and again at 2 or 3 a.m.—the men came on for night duty at 6.80, and came back from supper about 10 o'clock.</p>

               <p>them into bottles, and Fryer's to cork them and label them when they came down on the floor—Bennett was a partner—he had access to all the goods—at the end of September or the beginning of October I missed some opium, and about 100 ozs. of morphia were missed during October—Mott was stopped and searched in October, but nothing was found on him—I had missed nine ounces of morphia that day—we took stock every year—at the end of June and from 30th June to 25th October something like 200 ozs. were missing, and 60 or 70 lbs. of opium, but the opium extended longer back—I saw on the last trial the bottles taken from Stevens' lodging; one was pepsine with our label on it, and there were two empty pepsine lozenge bottles—they were our property—in consequence of a communication from Fryer's mother I went with her to the House of Detention and saw Fryer—she spoke first, and then he said "I know I have done wrong and I am willing to suffer for it, but I do not think I ought to be punished for what others have done—I did not take one-tenth part of what is mentioned—I asked him what he had taken—he said "Morphia, opium, iodine, and a small quantity of quinine," and that he had given them to Stevens—I asked him if he knew what Stevens did with it—he said he believed he sold it to a man named Freeman—I asked him if he worked with the others in taking the things out—he said "No, what he had done he had done on his own account"—he said that he did not go to Stevens in the first instance as Stevens had said, but he met him in a public-house—Mott was left alone on the first floor where the things are kept while the other men were at dinner, and Fryer and he on the ground floor, but not alone—the police shewed me a hamper with our private mark on it which they got at Stevens' lodging.</p>

I am a shorthand writer—I was present at the trial of Henry Harbord and William Stevens before the Recorder, in the ad<lb></lb>joining Court—before the case was closed the counsel for the defence called William Harbord—he was sworn, and said, "I live at 53, Hope Street," &amp;c (<hi rend="italic">See Vol.</hi> 91, P. 426)—Thomas King was called for the prosecution, he said "I am night watchman," &amp;c.

I never paid him a halfpenny in my life, or asked him to steal anything for me. I took samples of calomel to my brother for him to sell. If I was robbing May and Baker should I take samples of their traveller and know tell the article can no more be sworn to than a miller could swear to a handful of flour. I am a worker of chemicals. Every particle of what Stevens has stated is wrong; I said I would not have anything to do with anything that was <hi rend="italic">on the cross.</hi> Baker said "I mean to get up something for somebody," and when I saw the rules in the cell at Pentonville I thought he meant to write to the Home Secretary; I did not think he meant to bring innocent men into it If I had anything to reveal against his character I would do it, but I won't convict an innocent man. Mott was a bosom friend of Stevens, and the other man I have never seen in my life They swear to a bottle without a string or paper upon it They found chemical apparatus at my place; I can cheat the public and the revenue, but where I make 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., May and Baker make 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."</p>

I called at a public house one evening to see Mott play at bagatelle, and Stevens came in; he left with me, and asked where I worked, and pumped me to see if there was half a chance of getting me to do wrong. He said 'Your people keep opium?' I said 'They keep a small quantity.' He said 'Can you get me some?' I said 'Certainly not.' Previous to that such a thought never crossed my mind, but he talked me over, and I yielded to the temptation to bring him one or two pounds of opium. He gave me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 1 1/2 I got him several other little things, and got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him. I admit I did wrong; I did rob my master to that extent, but am innocent of any conspiracy. Stevens admitted that I did not send parcels to his house, and if it had not been for him such a thought would never have entered into my mind. I was brought up respectably. I yielded to the temptation only considering it a petty theft; there was no conspiracy whatever. Stevens is a very bad man, and would lead anybody to do wrong."</p>

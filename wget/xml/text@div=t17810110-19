               <p>I am a dyer in Shoe-lane. I was standing at my own door, and heard the cry stop thief! by this little boy. I ran down lane with Preston. I saw the prisoner turn up Brooks-court. He was running with a bundle under his arm, and the boy was runing after him. Mr. Preston and I seised him and gave the constable charge of him. I saw him drop the bundle; the boy said he had robbed him of the bundle. The prisoner said he knew nothing at all of it. We took the prisoner to Mr. Lawrence's, a constable, and charged him with the prisoner. He was taken to Bow-street, and examined. I went to Bow-street.</p>

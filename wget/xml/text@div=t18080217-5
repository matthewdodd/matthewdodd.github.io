               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her if she confessed. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not been to the prosecutrix's house for upwards of two months; I was taken up wrong for a bit of fish; she offered me money if I would own to this; I said, I had found some duplicates; I saw her about half past two o'clock in the day; she had a piece bread and two plates, with her sons dinner; after that she came to me very much intoxicated with liquor; I saw her home.</p>
               <p>COURT. The capital part of the charge you may dismiss; that in this case the prosecutrix says she received the shirts and handkerchiefs on Tuesday; she missed some of them on Friday night and some on Saturday morning; so that they may have been stolen in the intermediate time for any thing the prosecutrix knows, when some person may have been at home, she not having seen them since the Tuesday. The prisoner confessed to the constable that she had pawned the property. It is proved they were lost; she has confessed that she pawned them herself, and has given no account how she came by them.</p>

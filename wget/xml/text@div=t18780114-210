                  </hi>. I am a boat-builder, of 18, Beach Street, Deal—at a quarter to 10 on Saturday night, 29th December, I went home, and shortly after 10 o'clock went to bed with my wife and children, with the exception of one son, who was out—I saw the door closed; I closed it myself, and it was latched, I am quite sure of that—it was not locked, it was left for my son to come in—after I had been in bed some time I heard the latch turn—I should think it was then nearly half-past ten; I had been in bed a quarter of an hour—I got out of bed and called out, and not hearing any footsteps, I thought it was suspicious, and called out "Who is there?"—not getting any answer, I opened the front window and looked out—I saw no one standing at the door, but saw a man going along to the north, about 40 yards from me—he had some<lb></lb>thing on his arm—I cannot say what it was, but I thought it was a bag—I did not go downstairs directly, but very soon, and then I watched him tumble about with the bag, and he dropped it and picked it up, and then went towards the south—I then got a light and went downstairs—I found the door about three inches open—that was the door I had closed—I saw that the pegs on which you hang things in the passage were all empty, and I missed a jacket which I had put there at a little before 10 o'clock, when I went to bed—I called to my wife to know if she had taken it—I also missed three other articles which I had seen there when I went to bed, but I do not know what articles they were—I also missed two jackets and a waterproof cloak of my wife's, and my little boy's ulster coat—I next saw the coats at half-past 11 the same night at the police-station—they are produced in Court—these are the articles (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>); they are my property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the police force at Deal—on this Saturday night, 29th December, I saw two men in Alfred Square at a little after 11 o'clock—the two prisoners are the men—they were carrying a bag—I spoke to them and asked them what they had got in the bag—White had got the bag, and I asked him what he had got—he said "I have got nothing in the bag but what I am selling"—I told him it would not do, I must look and see what he had got, and asked him to put the bag down—he put it down, and Nicholson said something to White, and they both ran away immediately, but not in the same direction—one went to the south part and one to the north—I pursued White, but he got away from me, and I went back for the bag, and took it to the police-station—it contained the clothes produced—the prisoners appeared to me to be sober—shortly afterwards White was brought into the station by another officer—he is the man who I had seen before with the bag—I next saw Nicholson the following day, Saturday, at Sandwich—he is the man who was with White on the day previous—Sandwich is about six miles from where this happened—I spoke to him, and asked him whether he was at Deal last night—he gave me no answer.</p>

                  </hi> (Thames Policeman 34). I produce three labels, numbered 10, 377, 10, 399, and 10, 363, which I took from three mats of sugar which I found on a barge at Lee, on the Middlesex side of the river, about 9.45 on the morning of the 4th September—the barge had been lying at Wheatsheaf Wharf, Wapping, on the 4th August—the mats were full of sugar, and one of them was cut open—they were taken to the station—they belonged to Thomas Pillow and Sons, master lightermen—I received information, watched the barge, and in about an hour saw the prisoners come into Wheatsheaf Wharf—they walked on to the jetty, and I saw George slide down a pole into the barge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170048"></xptr>
               <p>—he then walked to the head, lifted up a flap, and pulled down this bag of sugar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and cut it open—he then pulled down this empty sack and ran away—Charles was looking at him, and could see all he did—Charles ran away, and George got up, climbed up the pole, and was run<lb></lb>ning through the wharf when I stopped him—I am sure he had not seen me—I asked him what business he had in the barge—he said that he never was in it—the barge in which the sugar was was on the opposite side of the river.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Thomas Pillow and Sons, lightermen—I missed four mats of sugar from a barge—they were labelled—two of these labels are marked with rotation marks—65, 174 is the rotation number of the cargo—I have a parcel sent up from Plymouth bearing the same rotation number, from the same cargo—I have not the slightest doubt that these labels belong to the three missing mats of sugar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman in the service of Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">George Howell's Defence</hi>. I did not steal the sugar—four bags were burst open at the police-court—I never cut them—I could not reach the barge's head-sheets.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 4, Rose-lane, Ratcliff, in the parish of Stepney. I have a saw-pit about ten or twelve yards from the side of my house, in a wheelwright's yard—on Friday, the 22nd of May, about a quarter after eleven, I went to bed—I think I was the last person up—I fastened the kitchen door—I swear it was fastened—my son got up first next morning—he is not here—when I got up the house was opened—I did not notice the kitchen window till we found we had been robbed—it was then unfastened—there was a broken square of glass the day before—a small wash-tub was moved, and placed under the window outside—a person could then put their hand in and undo the fastening—I missed the articles stated in the indictment—these now produced belong to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Robbins's mother-in-law. About nine o'clock on Friday night I placed these things in the kitchen—I missed them on Saturday morning—I got up about four o'clock to call my grandson, but did not go into the kitchen then—I cannot say I was the first person in the kitchen—when I went in I saw the braas footman taken from its place and put by the window—I had put the things the night before on the plate-shelf jo the kitchen—nobody could put a hand in at the window, and take them, but they must come in—I know these things to be the prosecutor's property.</p>

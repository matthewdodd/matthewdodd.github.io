                  </hi>. I am a lodger at 27, Green-walk, Holland-street, Black-friars-road—on the Saturday night that this fire happened, I came home a little before 12—it was at the beginning of April, I don't recollect the day of the month—I live in the first floor back room with my wife—a person named Ansell lives in the front room—Ansell's wife was at home when I came home—he came in shortly afterwards—we had supper together, and then went to our respective rooms to bed—there were two other lodgers on the ground floor; a man named Town and his wife—at the time I came in they had been asleep two hours—after I had been in bed some time, I heard somebody open the street-door, and go through the passage, and then heard the sound of a match, and I said to my wife, "There is somebody downstairs"—they then appeared to go out again, and close the door—about two minutes after the door closed I jumped out of bed, looked out of my window, and saw a light—I alarmed Ansell and his wife, and the others, by calling out "Fire!"—I then ran upstairs for my wife to come down, and then I went downstairs into the back kitchen, and saw a pile of things a-light close to a screen that goes in front of the fire to keep the draught away—they were away from the fire—the screen was alongside of them—there was no fire in the grate—the screen was on fire, and the clothes were in a blaze—Ansell took the kettle off the hob and put the fire out—Mrs. Waldron was in the front parlour while we were putting the fire out—she sleeps in the front parlour—I did not see anything of the prisoner till my wife let her in, and she came into the back kitchen—when she came in she asked where her husband Frank was—Mrs. Waldron was not out of her room, I think at that time—the prisoner spoke to her at the door—the door of Mrs. Waldron's room opens close to the street-door—she opened her door, and said to the prisoner, "You know where he is"—the prisoner then said, "What is the matter?" my wife said, "You know what is the matter; you have carried out your threats at last"—the prisoner appealed to Mrs. Town directly, and said, "You know I am innocent"—my wife ran out for a, policeman, and when he came he asked the prisoner whether she had got any way to get into the place—she said, "No"—he asked what she had got in her pocket—she said, "Nothing, only a box of matches"—she was pull<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>the box of matches out of her pocket, and the latch-key of the front door fell on the floor—she pulled it out herself—the policeman asked her how she came by that—she said, so help her God, somebody had put it in her pocket—he was standing by her side, and saw it fall from her pocket—Ansell picked up the key, and compared it with his own—the policeman tried it, and it fitted the front door—the prisoner was then taken to the Southwark Police-court, and given into custody.</p>

               <p>from our window—I got up, and the alarm was given—we went downstairs, and Mr. and Mrs. Ansell also—my husband went down first—he said the kitchen was in flames, and made the alarm, and told me to come down—I put my boots on, and went down as I was—as I got downstairs there was a rap at the street-door—my husband was in the kitchen at that time—I went to the door and let in the prisoner—she said, "Good God! What is the matter?"—I said, "You know what is the matter," and walked through the passage to the kitchen—she spoke to her mother-in-law, and followed to the door—she asked her mother-in-law if Frank was there—she replied, "He is not here; you know where he is, he is along with you"—the prisoner then said she knew where her husband was; that he had been jumping over a post and fallen and hurt himself, and was taken to the hospital—when I let the prisoner in I saw that she had on a dark dress, a lilac apron, and a drab bonnet; she had no shawl or other covering—I had not been into the kitchen before I opened the door for her—I could not see the blaze without going into the kitchen—I had not seen whether there was a fire in the kitchen or not—I had not seen the blaze from my room—when I went into the kitchen the fire was extinguished—Mr. Ansell was there, not Mrs. Ansell—the prisoner followed me into the kitchen—I fetched the policeman—I did not hear what passed between the prisoner and the policeman—the first time I ever saw the prisoner was a fortnight before the fire in the kitchen, and I then heard a quarrel between her and Mrs. Waldron—she was in the house about three hours; her husband was not in the house at the time—she called the old woman very bad names and said she ought to be dead.</p>

               <p>was standing on the stairs—the stairs are about four feet from the kitchen door; she went there after opening the street-door—I am quite positive that the prisoner had no shawl on when she came in—I can't say the exact number of fires there have been in the house in the last twelve months, but I should say seven or eight—I did not see the prisoner at any of them, except the last—the one that was in my room happened by my child getting his toys from under the bed with a match, and setting fire to the valens round the bed—that is seven or eight months ago; I was not in the house at that time—I was in the house when the fire occurred in Denn's room; I was in the front room; nobody was in Denn's room—the door was shut—I went down to open the door for my boy, and as I came up, I saw the reflec<lb></lb>tion of the fire underneath the door, and shouted for water—both the Denn's were in my room, and had not been out of it for an hour—there have been several fires, which nobody could account for—I can't say that the prisoner was not in the house; I don't know anything at all about that.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has she been in the habit of coming to the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, frequently—I have heard her quarrelling with Mrs. Waldron on several occasions, I suppose as far back as eight or nine months—I have seen her at the house as many as three times in a fortnight; I have seen her there from one night to another, quarrelling and smashing windows, and using bad language—I have heard her on several occasions say, "So help me God! I will burn the b—house, and the old b—in it"—the last time I heard her say so was about four months ago—I believe all the fires I have spoken of, except the one in my room, have been since I heard her use that express<lb></lb>sion—there was quarrelling between the prisoner and the old lady on the Saturday fortnight previous to the last fire, and the old lady sat down crying almost all the time; the prisoner called her all the foul names she could, and all the w—s she could lay her tongue to; she said she was a w—with Mr. Butler, an old gentleman who lives in the alms-houses opposite, who was in the kitchen at the time.</p>

DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you in the habit of being very much at home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; only of an evening—I return from my work about six, or a little after—these quarrels have been in the evening—other lodgers have heard this bad language; Mrs. Ansell has heard it, and Mrs. Denn, and all the people that have been called here to-day—I don't think Mrs. Denn lived there at the time the windows were broken; the last time was, I think, about 4 months ago—I have been speaking of 7 or 8 months ago—it ended about 4 months ago to my leaving, but I suppose it has gone on since—I never had occasion to have a bad opinion of the prisoner—I never spoke a word to her till she came there—Mrs. Denn and my wife heard the quarrel on the Saturday fortnight before the last fire—it was on the Monday previous, that I had the little <hi rend="italic">tiff</hi> with the old lady about the noise; those were the only words I ever had—there was a canary bird suffocated in Mrs. Denn's room—I told her she was to blame if she did not make a claim on the In<lb></lb>surance Company for it—I did not tell her to claim 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told Mrs. Wal<lb></lb>dron to claim for what she had lost, because she said people blamed her for setting the place on fire—I told her to claim for both Denn's things and her own, for the fire in the front parlour was the same night at 11 o'clock after Denn's fire—Mrs. Waldron was not in bed when that fire broke out—she was in the kitchen—nobody saw the prisoner in the house then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on the Saturday night, about 12 o'clock, I was in the kitchen—there was no light or fire there then; no candle or any fire in the grate—there was no bundle of clothes; there</p>

               <p>were some clothes hanging on the line across the kitchen; 2 muslin curtains, and a towel—I had been in the kitchen about 11 o'clock, and then there was a muslin curtain a-light; that was what brought me into the kitchen—I was up stairs in my own room, and I smelt fire and went down to the kitchen and found the muslin curtain at the window on fire—I assisted in putting it out—I am quite certain it was safely put out—Mrs. Waldron had set the candle on the table under the window, and by that means I suppose the curtain might have become alight—at that time the 2 muslin curtains were hanging on the line at the other end of the kitchen—the curtain was quite put out, and water poured all round the window frame—Mrs. Waldron sat in the kitchen about half an hour, quenching the fire out before she went to bed—I did not see her do it; I left her in the kitchen—at 12 o'clock I had occasion to go into the yard, and I looked in the kitchen to see that all was safe as there had been so many fires in the house, and everything was safe then—I went to bed about half past 12—I was disturbed by Denn—my husband went down in his shirt, and assisted in extinguishing the fire—I stopped to get some of my clothes on—I remained up stairs until after the prisoner came in—I have heard the prisoner and Mrs. Waldron quarrelling several times—she has said she would burn the b—house down, and the old b—in it—I have heard her say so several times.</p>

I am the landlady of the house, 29, Green Walk—the prisoner is my daughter-in-law—she has been constantly in the habit of visiting me—I had not seen her for a fortnight before this happened—I have sometimes had quarrels with her; little, slight quarrels—I never had any great quarrels; there was never any quarrel on my side—on the Sun<lb></lb>day morning I went to bed a little before 12, and soon after I was in bed, as nigh as I could tell about 5 minutes, I heard Mr. Ansell come in—I did</p>

               <p>not hear Mr. Denn come in—I fell asleep after Ansell came in, and after sleeping about half-an-hour or a little more, I heard the word "Fire!"—I can't say which lodger it was from—I got up, and as I came out of my room I saw the prisoner, she said, "What is the matter"—I did not see her come into the house—I did not know she was in the house until she spoke to me—she said, "Where is Frank"—I said I did not know—she said, "He has jumped over a post and broken his nose, and gone to the hospital"—I walked into the kitchen—she came behind me—Ansell and Denn had put the fire out—the prisoner asked me to lend her a shawl—I took her own shawl out of my chair, and said, "Here is your own"—she made no answer—she took it out of my hand—the last time I had been in the kitchen was about a quarter to 12—there was no fire then in the grate, and had not been for some hours—there was no candle burning there when I left it—I had placed a large towel I had been using over the back of the chair, and over that was a line upon which hung two curtains, that was all there was in the kitchen—the chair was close to the dresser opposite the window—there had been a small curtain on fire about 11 o'clock that evening—I put the candle as I thought at a distance from it, but whether in opening the back-door the wind blew the candle or not I don't know, but I believe it was caused in that way—I put it out—I did not leave the candle near any of the things after that.</p>

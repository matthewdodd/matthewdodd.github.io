                  </hi>. I am assistant to the prosecutor, a jeweller, of 154, Fenchurch-street—on 16th June prisoner came into our shop, and asked to be shown some plain rings—I asked if she meant wedding-rings—she said "No"—I then brought out a tray of gem rings and showed her—she selected one or two, and asked me to fit them on her finger, and I did—she requested that they should be put on one side, and she and her sister would come and select from them—she then asked to be shown some guard-rings—I turned round to get them, and when I turned back I saw that one of the gem rings was missing—she selected some plain rings and asked me to put them on one side—she then walked to the door, turned round, and said, "You will be sure to know them again"—I said "Yes, "and she went out of the shop—Mr. Cockayne was in the shop talking to a gentleman—I went after her directly, and brought her back into the shop—I asked her what she had got—she made no answer but put her hand in her pocket—I caught hold of her hand and held it, and the ring dropped from it on to the counter—she was then given into custody.</p>

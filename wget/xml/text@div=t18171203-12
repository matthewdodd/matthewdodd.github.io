            . I am warehouseman to Mr. John Hilton, who lives in Lime-street. The hydrometer was sent to him to pack with other things going to the West Indies-the prisoner was also a warehouseman there. I packed it in a puncheon that was going there; it went to the West India Docks on the 25th of October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It came to us from Mr. Bates's, in the Poultry. I did not open it before I packed it; it was packed with great care. There were three or four tied up together, and put in the middle of the puncheon.</p>
               <p>Q. For all you know, it was in the same state as when it came - A.Certainly. The prisoner saw me pack it up. It appeared to be in the same state as when I packed them-it could not be taken out after it was put in the puncheon. When the robbery was discovered the puncheon was fetched from the Docks; one of the hoops was disturbed.</p>
               <p>LAZARUS JACOBS. I am a broker, and live in Raven-row, Spitalfields. On the 24th of October the prisoner came to my house, shewed me the hydrometer, and asked 1l. for it, I gave him 18s. for it - I put it out; several persons offered me 14s. and 12s. for it. On the Monday, I sold it to a man who keeps a public-house in Bishopsgate-street, I believe his name is Sterley. I am sure the prisoner is the man who sold it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was between one and three or four o'clock; I never bought one before. I was asked concerning it about eight days after.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not tell the magistrate that it was between three and five o'clock - A. I might. I am no judge of hydrometers. I have dealt with the man whom sold it to once or twice before, not more. I never delivered any goods at his house.</p>
               <p>Q.On your oath, have you not - A. I never was at his house till to-day, nor did not know where it was before. I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>JOHN GIBBS. I keep the Mail-Coach public-house, in Camomile-street. I bought the hydrometer of Jacobs, for 1l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has he ever been at your house - A. Yes, he brought some chairs to my house himself, and has drank there. As I passed his house he called me in, and asked if I wanted such a thing? I had only got 19s. 6d. - he said he would call for the other 6d.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH STERNRY. I am shopman to Mr. Bates. The hydrometer is the same I sent to Mr. Hilton's to be packed up on the 15th of October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I sent four paper parcels, which contained the materials of one hydrometer. Gibbs sent it to me afterwards to ask for an explanation of it. I got information, and went to Jacobs's shop with Gibbs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the man till he was brought to our house. I was sent to fetch the puncheon back, and observed the hoops had been moved. If it had been in that state when it went to the Docks they would not have received it. I opened it, and every person said it had been opened at the bottom-every thing was right at the top.</p>

            . I brought the puncheon from the Docks. The bottom did not appear as if it had been fastened by a workman. They are always examined at the Docks, and if the hoops are not fast they will not take them in.</p>

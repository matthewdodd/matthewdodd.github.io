I was there five years, During that time I never handled a pound's worth of English silver or gold, and am a very poor judge of money. I got half a crown from my sister at Notting Hill, and received a florin from an omnibus conductor in change. I did not think I was getting bad money. I called for a glass of ale, and unfortunately gave a bad shilling. I then laid a good shilling down. The gentleman tries to make out that I had the tenpence-halfpenny at the time I gave the bad shilling, but the evidence shows that it was not so. With regard to the second case, I received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for work, two florins, a shilling, and a sixpence, one of which florins turns out to be bad. I told the Magistrate that I required the attendance of witnesses.</p>

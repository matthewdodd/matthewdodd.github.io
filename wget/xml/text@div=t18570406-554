Some<lb></lb>time in the month of March, about 11 o'clock in the evening, my house was safe; the shutters and doors were fast, I retired to rest, I saw the beef which I had bought, safe on the block—I was woke up by a noise, and about 4 o'clock I missed my beef—I found my house had been broken into—there was a shutter drawn out, and that was put up beside the other shutters—the beef was at the hack of the shop, they must have come in to get it—there is a piece of board against the shutters, and they must have got over that—the gas was alight when I came into the shop; I had put it out when I went to</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 299, Kent Street. I look after Evans's coffee shop—from half past 3 to 4 o'clock, on the morning of Saturday, 7th March, I was there—I was standing at the door, and saw three persons com<lb></lb>ing from the butcher's shop with caps on—they were outside the shop; I did not see them come out, they passed across the road—I had not seen them before—I did not see them going towards the shop, but I saw them do something with the shutter—I saw one of them trying to put the shutter up; I saw the gas was alight in the shop—they were coming across the road—they had got something in a bag—two of them were together, they had it in their arms; they brought it across the road from there to the court, which is by the side of Evans's coffee shop—I afterwards gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a married woman, and lodge at Evans's lodg<lb></lb>ing house, opposite the butcher's. On the night of 7th March, I got home at half past 3 o'clock—I went straight into the kitchen—I saw the prisoner's wife standing against the fire place—I did not see the prisoner then—I saw the prisoner and two other men coming out from the back yard—the pri<lb></lb>soner had a parcel on his back—the yard does not open into the court—the court goes up by the side of the yard, and there is a low wall between them—they all had caps on—the prisoner and the two men came down near the fire place, and the other two took the parcel off the prisoner's back, and lifted it on to the table—I then went out into the passage, the prisoner fol<lb></lb>lowed me out and said, "If you'll go to bed, I'll give you a shilling to-morrow"—I did not go to bed; we staid about five or six minutes in the passage speaking, and when we came back, the two men were in the kitchen, but the parcel was gone—the prisoner came in with me out of the passage—under the kitchen, there is a cellar, and you can get into it by the trap door in the kitchen—the prisoner and his wife, and one of the men who was a lodger, went to bed, and the other man who was a stranger, went out—some time in the night, two policemen came in—I did not see them do anything—next day, the prisoner and his wife got up between 10 and 11 o'clock—the prisoner and two others went down into the cellar (his wife was in the kitchen) with a lighted candle, and the prisoner gave her up some meat into her apron—several pieces—it seemed to be beef—after that, I saw the prisoner's wife frying the meat, and having it for breakfast—she gave me none of it—the prisoner and his wife ate it—I saw no one else, I am sure of that, they alone ate it—between 1 and 2 o'clock, three policemen came to the house and asked to go down into the cellar—they went down with a lighted candle and brought up the same parcel that I had seen the prisoner with—I can swear to the bag—that was the one that the three men had.</p>

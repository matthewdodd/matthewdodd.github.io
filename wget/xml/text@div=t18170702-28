On the 25th of June, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he called and had a pint of beer, there was no person in the house but him, he came and drank it in the back-parlour, where I was; while he was there my daughter brought me down the key of my bed-room, and laid it on the table. I was called into the bar, and forgot the key. Sometimes after the prisoner had drank his beer I saw him come down stairs, and asked him what he was doing there? he said he was going for Mr. Curry, as he had heard of a place for him, who was a lodger of ours-this was between eight and nine o'clock. I was going to put my child to bed between nine and ten o'clock, and missed my key; I did not miss it before. After I had seen the prisoner come down he went into the parlour and finished his beer - I was in the bar; he was gone when I missed the key. I tried the door, it was locked, we got it open, and I missed the property stated in the indictment out of my drawers, which were shut, but not locked; there were eleven 1l. notes and a 5l. check in the pocket-book. I saw the spoons again at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Curry lived on the two pair of stairs. I sleep on the first-floor-the prisoner did not stay long after he had finished his beer. Curry had been out all day, and was then out.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER BYERS. My wife said she had not got the key; I broke the door open, and missed the property; from what she said I suspected the prisoner, and got an officer. We searched the prisoner's lodging, but found nothing there; we found him at a public-house in Davies-street, I gave him in charge; the watchman took him away, and let him go, he sprung his rattle and secured him again; we immediately searched him in the street, and found eleven 1l. notes, five tea-spoons, two tablespoons, and the sugar-tongs, upon him; we neither found the check or the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He was not drunk - He was quite able to run.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PLANK. I am an officer. On the 25th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I went to the prisoner's lodging with Byers; I afterwards heard the cry of stop thief, and the rattle sprung; I pursued, and found Byers, the watchman, and the prisoner, struggling together; I searched him, and found fourteen 1l. notes, and one 2l. note, upon him, with the spoons and sugar-tongs; he struggled very hard to prevent me searching him, and I was obliged to cut his pocket off - He then said I had put the things into his pocket, which I did not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Curry had been with me. It is not likely I should remain in the house if I had got the property.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the fourteenth light dragoons. On the night of the 10th instant, between the hours of eleven and twelve, I met the prisoners in Covent-garden; I knew them about three years ago in the Borough; I went into Mrs. Belshaw's wine vaults with them; Atterbury asked me to go in to have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there. - A. About three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any thing to drink there. - A. No; there was a girl at Mrs. Belshaw's blackguarded me for taking up a deserter; I went away from there and went to <placeName id="t18080217-32-crimeloc178">Mr. Norris's wine vault in Great Russel-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18080217-32-crimeloc178" type="placeName" value="Mr. Norris's wine vault in Great Russel-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had the seals to the watch hanging out when you went into the house. - A. On entering the door I took the watch out and wound the ribbon shorter, they hung very low, that makes me sure I had the seals; after we had a glass of gin Brown came near me, I was standing up, he put his hand down my thigh, I felt it come near me; upon suspicion I stepped back; I said, I had missed my seals, you are playing tricks with me; I said to Brown you have got my seals; he said, how can you think so, I have not; I said, I am certain you have; I got my back against the door, and called for assistance; I kept in that situation till the watchman came and took them in custody; I wished to have them searched; the watchman would not do it. Atterbury says I will strip, I have not got them. They were taken to Covent Garden watchhouse by the watchmen; I stopped a bit behind to see if they had throwed them about; I followed them; the watchhouse keeper used me very ill; at length he made a search but not in a proper manner; nothing was found upon either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Atterbury at the time you felt the other man's hand. - A. About two yards distance from me and him both.</p>
               <p>Q. Your watch was not taken. - A. No, the watch remained.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear that the seals were gone. - A. The ribbon was cut across; I did not see any knife or scissors.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had much liquor. - A. I had been drinking, but not so much but what I knew what I was doing of.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you been drinking. - A. A glass of wine, two glasses of negus, a glass of gin, and a pot of beer in the day with the recruits; it had not taken any effect of me.</p>
               <p>Q. At the watchhouse the next morning did either of the prisoners say any thing to you. - A. Yes, Atterbury told me if I would not say any thing about him he would get me all my expences, the watchhouse keeper's wife says, if you have got any friends send to them; he gave Sheane, the watchman, two shillings to go to Gray's Inn-lane, to get some money of a woman that he lodged with to pay me; the watchman came back, and said to him, I see how it is, there is no person there that will give you any thing; he said, there was only a poor woman there where Atterbury lodged, she had no money for herself. The constable said it was getting late, they should go to Bow-street; Atterbury said if you will take a five pound note of hand, he would send for a friend, he would pay me; he said, I should ruin him for ever if they were both put in goal; if he was let out he could work for them both; he sent Sheane the watchman to a man to be answerable for the five pound to me; the watchman staid so long they were taken to Bow-street office; Atterbury came to me and says, d - n it, I'll give you seven pound if you will let me free. I should have taken the money if it had not been for the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take it. - A. No. Brown never made any offer at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the public house besides. - A. A young woman; she was at the front of the bar, not near me; no other person was in the house besides the person serving.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You have said it was between eleven and twelve o'clock when you lost your seals. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a <rs id="t18080217-32-viclabel179" type="occupation">recruiting serjeant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18080217-32-victim310 t18080217-32-viclabel179"></join>. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Common observations of life makes me know you are under the necessity of drinking more than any other man. - A. I might have been drinking more, but not so as to be incapable of knowing what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that you was perfectly sober. - A. I was not perfectly sober, I knew what I was doing; I cannot say I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. If you cannot say you was either drunk or sober; you were neither drunk nor sober. - A. I might be between both.</p>
               <p>Q. You met with these men just by Belshaw's. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this woman. - A. I am not acquainted with her.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose she is an unfortunate woman. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she toy with you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a strange thing that a girl should take a liking to you all at once and she was to treat you. - A. I cannot account for that.</p>
               <p>Q. After they were taken to the watchhouse they were searched. - A. There was not a proper search made.</p>
               <p>Q. That is for the watchmen to explain, do you mean to say that there was no other woman in company with you but the woman that gave you the glass of gin. - A. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women was there in the gin shop. - I do not think there were any.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be between the time you lost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170022"></xptr>the seals and the time the prisoner was searched. - A. Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took him to the watchhouse. - A. Two watchmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were under the observation of the two watchmen all the time they went from the house. - A. Yes, but they crossed the street to go to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time to this you have not seen any thing about the seals. - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Brown. I should wish to know whether he did not strike a woman three or four times at Mrs. Belshaw's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Had you any quarrel in the public house. - A. I cannot say I had any quarrel: the woman abused me at Mr. Belshaw's, and the landlord said he would have no row here; I went out.</p>
               <p>Brown. He was under nine or ten people in the house; the serjeant would have been beat well had it not been for me.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Covent Garden. I saw both the prisoners go into Covent Garden watchhouse; I was at the watchhouse door at the time they both went in; it was another watchman that apprehended them. In about five minutes after they had been in, a rattle sprung for another watchman to come in; I knocked at the door and Brown wanted to make his escape; I pushed him back. Atterbury sent me the next morning to his lodgings to get some money of his landlady he lodged with; after I came back he sent me to Holborn. He promised to give the serjeant a note of hand for five pounds; I went, and the gentleman was not at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Did you hear the serjeant say he would forgive them if he had a five pound note. - A. I heard him say give me a five pound note and I will not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Atterbury's Defence. I never sent for five pound, I was destitute, I could not; I said I would treat him, as he had treated me; we went to Mr. Belshaw's; immediately we came in the wine vaults he was knocked down, and he had twenty people on him; he did not say that he had lost his seals till he came into Mr. Norris's wine vaults; he said give me my property; I said I cannot, I had not got the seals; he says; I know you are not the man, if you will give me five pound I will not prosecute you. Immediately he accused us the young woman walked off. I had two glasses of gin there; whether they had one or two I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Brown left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called two witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

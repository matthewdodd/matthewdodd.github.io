On the 16th of May, about half-past six o'clock, we turned about sixty cart horses into the field opposite Limehouse church, and on the 17th, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I went into the field, and this gelding was missing; it was a black gelding. I found it at Brentford between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, in possession of Hitchcock - the prisoner was there in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIIPS. Q. Has your master any other Christian name? A. No; the field is railed all round, about four feet high; I believe the gate was locked - I know I shut it; there is a footpath through the field; I fastened the gate with a hasp; there is a small opening for persons to go through, with a post to it. I found the gate shut as I had left it.</p>

            . I live at Northall, near Harrow. - On the 17th of May I saw the prisoner at Brentford, with a horse; I wanted one, and asked him the price - he asked 25l., then agreed to take 20l., then 18l., and at last came down to 13l. - I asked him if it was sound - he said Yes, and a good worker; I thought it was not his, and would not pay him, but took him with it to the Pigeons, public-house, Brentford, and gave them in charge. Young came there, and claimed it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he sober? A. He looked intoxicated. I asked him whose the horse was; he said his father's, and that he was authorised to sell it for him; he appeared to me to be tipsy.</p>

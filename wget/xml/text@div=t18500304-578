                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Smith, of Hackney. The pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service—I went out with her on Saturday morning, 16th Feb.—she had complained of a pain in her shoulder, and I recommended her to a chemist's shop, kept by Mr. Kay—I sent her on there before me—I</p>

               <p>changed a sovereign with Mr. Kay when I got there—Mr. Kay put down a half-sovereign and some silver on the glass-case—he put the half-sovereign down first—I took it in my left hand, and put it down again to count the silver—the prisoner stood by my side—she had some errands to do for me, and I gave her two sixpences—I then caught sight of a friend, and turned away in a contrary direction from where the half-sovereign was—I then went with her, and was going home—I went into another shop, and asked for change for a half-sovereign—I then missed it—that was an hour and a half afterwards—I went home—I thought the prisoner took it—the prisoner opened the door—I said, "Mary, I did not take up the half-sovereign at Mr. Kay's, I suppose you saw it"—she said no, she neither saw it nor heard of it, and there were many other persons in the shop who might have taken it—I went back about it to Mr. Kay—the prisoner went out in the evening, and returned about nine o'clock—I told her I had been to Mr. Kay's, and he and another gentleman had told me that she had got the half-sovereign, that a lady came in, and took my place in the shop, and she had discovered the half-sovereign, and pointed it out, and that she, the prisoner, had got it—she said she had a half-sovereign from a young woman who stood by her, who gave it her to change, then afterwards she said a young woman asked her to change a half-sove<lb></lb>reign, and she said, "Why should I get change for your's, when I have one to change myself."</p>

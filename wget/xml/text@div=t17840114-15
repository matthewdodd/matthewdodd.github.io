               <p>Court. How many were there in all? - There were three or four, I am sure it was three, the one that came to me, whether he intended to strike me or catch me by the collar I cannot tell, but as he attempted to strike me, I stooped and he caught my hat from my head; I then stooped between the two that came up first to me, and endeavoured to pass them by, stooping under their ams to make my way under the scaffolding, and as I attempted to pass them the prisoner at the bar said, Damn him, shoot him, shoot him, if he will not deliver his money.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did the prisoner stand? - He stood at the right hand of me.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the prisoner at the bar? - Very well my Lord, he had his hair hanging on his shoulders.</p>
               <p>How near was you to the lamp? - About four yards.</p>
               <p>You could not observe the features of his face? - I saw he was a little pitted with the small pox.</p>
               <p>You could not see him so as to swear to him? - Not from his being pitted with the small pox, but from the colour of his coat and his face I could swear to him a month after; then they all ran away.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any arms? - I did not, I ran after the prisoner immediately, he ran down Lower Grosvenor-street, I followed him, and at the corner of David-street he was stopped by Mr.

                  </hi>. I am a draper, of 8, Broadway, Deptford—on Monday night, about a quarter-past eight, I had a roll of about thirty-six yards of shirting outside my door—my boy, William Jones, was watching outside—I heard him call "Master! master!"—I ran to the door, and saw the prisoner with some shirting under his arm—two others were with him—I ran after him and saw him throw it down at the constable's feet—I picked it up—this is it—there is my ticket on it.</p>

               <p>a quarter-past eight, I was outside the door; some one came up and spoke to me, and then I saw the prisoner put this roll of shirting under his arm and run away with it—I told my master.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

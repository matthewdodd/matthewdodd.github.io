                  </hi>. In April,. 1872, and to 1874 I was "check" steward—the prisoner was the, secretary—our meetings were weekly, Monday—nights—the prisoner's duty with reference to myself was to book all monies in the secretary's book, which he kept himself—he would take money occa<lb></lb>sionally from a member—it was my duty to receive money, not strictly his duty—if he received money it was his duty to hand it to me, and book it in his own—(<hi rend="italic">referring to look</hi>) there is an entry down here of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received on the 8th December—the secretary had sole control of the book; no, one ever had anything to do with it—the books have been bound up since 1873 every quarter. (The prisoner handed to the Court part of a balance-sheet, which stated that an amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was in the secretary's hands). The secretary was allowed to retain money—he had no right to retain money for the purpose of petty cash received by him from members—there is an entry in this book (<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>) on the 8th December of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Box—there is an entry on the 2nd February, 1874, of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from. George. Box—in this book—(<hi rend="italic">Referring to another</hi>) there is no entry of this in the other book—on the 2nd March, 1874, there is no entry—the entries. shoulder be made in both books, the prisoner reporting to me all monies received—there are no totals in the prisoner's book, and he has been, nine years, in the society.</p>

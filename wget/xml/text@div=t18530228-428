                  </hi>. I am clerk in the employ of Chaplin and Horne. On Saturday, 29th Jan., I was returning from the City, and was in High-street, in the Borough, about 9 o'clock in the evening—I was rather the worse for liquor, but I knew what I was about—I saw the prisoner just before I got to the Town-hall, and we went, conversing together—I had had no acquaintance with him before—we walked on, and went to the Swan Inn, in the Dover-road, kept by Mr. Speechley—we there had each of us a glass of wine—I paid for it—when we left the Swan Inn, I went towards home,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280118"></xptr>
               <p>across Trinity-square, to Horsemonger-lane—the prisoner went with me; when we got to Horsemonger-lane, we went to an oyster stall—that was about five minutes' walk from the Swan—we each of us had some oysters—I paid for some of them—we left together for the purpose of going home—I did not count what money I had when I left the oyster stall, but I know when I left the City I had a sovereign in gold, and some silver—I had not changed the sovereign when I left the oyster stall; nothing happened till I got close to the pavement of the house where I live, which was about a minute's walk—the prisoner then grasped me by the throat, and threw me on my back—he thrust his hand into my pocket—he grasped me so tightly that I thought I must have been strangled—all the next day I could take nothing but a little sago—when I got inside I missed my money—all the money was gone out of this pocket, which is the one that the prisoner's hand was in, and it is torn—I am as certain that the prisoner is the person as I am of my own existence.</p>

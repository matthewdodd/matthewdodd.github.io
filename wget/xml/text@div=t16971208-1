               Counterfeiting the Current Coin of this Kingdom, in the 9th Year of his Majesty's Reign
            </rs>. The Evidence swore that they found a great many Instruments fit for that Trade in Wilson's House, with several Species of false Money, which were produced in Court; That Wilson owned that Hill had wrought with him, and told where he might be found; That Wilson had borrowed 20 s. of one of them, for which he gave him 27 s. of false Money, and promised him more on helping him to more good Money, and offered to let him see them make false Money. At another time Hill borrowed 30 s. of good Money from one of the Evidence, and promised if she would engage to furnish them from time to time, to make her get above 50 l. a week, and would shortly inrich themselves, and keep their Coach and Horses. The Evidence farther deposed; That they heard the Prisoners say, that they had rather Coin Dutch Money than English, it being less dangerous and more profitable; And that the Prisoners owned that they and one Davis were so ingenious in Making false Money, that it could scarcely be perceived from that of the Mint. The Prisoners endeavoured to contradict the Evidence, pretending their Witnesses were not ready, and denied the Crime for which they were Indicted, which did not avail them, the Jury brought them in <rs id="t16971208-1-verdict4" type="verdictDescription">

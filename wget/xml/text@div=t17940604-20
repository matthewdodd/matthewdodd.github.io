               <p>Q. Did he mention the particular sort of ribbon that he wished to purchase? - No, he did not; I believe this ribbon was in the drawer, it was there the day before. He did not purchase any.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed him take away any? - I had not. I did not see the ribbon the morning that he came in, but I see it the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you perceived that this ribbon was missing, did you make any enquiry after the prisoner at the bar? - Yes. He was taken at the corner of Well's street, about five minutes walk out of the shop, he was not brought back again to the shop, he was taken into custody. I see him ten minutes after he was first taken, he was searched before I came.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You did not know this man before? - No, I never see him before in my life to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, I was coming down Ratcliff-highway, I heard a hue and cry, I saw the prisoner. I took hold of him, and found this ribbon in his coat pocket, it was sealed before the justice, it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You knew this man before, you have had him in custody two or three times? - I had him in custody about three months ago, and I found a parcel of oranges about him, and an egg in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he passes as an insane man? - Some people say so.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The silk has no mark, I believe it to be mine, I am sure we had the pattern in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court to Back. Did the prisoner say how he came by it? - He said nothing at all, I could not get any thing out of him, he stood like a foolish man, with froathing out at his mouth.</p>

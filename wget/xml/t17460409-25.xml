               <p>Q. What was it you missed?</p>
               <p>Leigh. A Piece of Irish Cloth. Upon missing that Cloth I examin'd all my Servants; upon the Evening of that Day I discovered this Man had laid it out of its Place; and in the Evening of that Day

             had endeavoured to throw it upon several of my Servants, in order to excuse himself. In examining him about the Piece of Cloth that he had carried out, I ask'd him how he came by that Cloth; he said he had bought it of an Irish Merchant's Servant about a Month before, and he had it away about a Week before, and I asked him whether he could produce the Piece of Cloth; he said he could. After he produced the Cloth, I asked him how it came to have my Mark upon it; then he said it was a Piece of Cloth that he bought of me a Twelve-month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. So he produced it, did he?</p>
               <p>Leigh. No, My Lord, we had it by another Discovery; we found Part of it in the House of one Mrs. Morris, and Part of it in the House of one Mrs. Winter.</p>

            (by the Council for the Prisoner) to Leigh. This Man has lived with you for sometime, has he not?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Then you can account for some Money that he has: Don't you know that he has an Annuity besides? Did you find that in his Box? Had he never any Cloth you for which he paid?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. And I suppose he might have had more.</p>
               <p>Leigh. He might have had any Quantity, because we never restrain any Body.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you say you don't believe he would have paid you for it? Did he say that he had stole it? that he had taken it out of the House, contrary to his Duty, and what he ought not to do? Did he confess before the Justice that he had stole it?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Yes, he did confess, Sir; he would not confess any Thing else but this. I found the Pound of Thread, and I found Part of the Cloth in his Box. I found this in Mrs. Morris's House [The Piece of Cloth produced in Court ] We ask'd him if he had taken it out of the House in an unlawful Manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was your's?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Yes, I can swear 'tis my Cloth.</p>

               <p>Morris. The 20th of March was the first Time I ever saw this Man; he said he had lived two Years with this Gentleman, and he owned him two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090018"></xptr> Years Wages, and that his Master had charged him with robbing him, and had taken twenty-three Pounds out of his Box and Pocket, and he left this Cloth in my House. I asked this young Man how he came to bring this Cloth from his Master's; he asked me if I could recommend him to a Lawyer: On Monday his Master came with a Search Warrant, and found the Cloth there.</p>

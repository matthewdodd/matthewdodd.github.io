                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live at 6, Old Pie Street, Westminster—on Christmas night I was at Mr. Ward's lodging-house between 9 and 10 o'clock—the prisoner and his wife were having supper in the room where I was—they were quarrelling—I turned round, and said to the prisoner, "Don't hit her!"—I thought he was going to hit her—the prisoner leaned over, and put a knife straight in the middle of my head—I was taken to the hospital, where I remained till 20th January—I did not see the prisoner again until the morning of 24th March—he saw me, and ran away; a policeman stopped him, and I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—on the night of 25th December I was at the lodging-house in the room where this occurred—the prisoner and his wife were having supper at a large table—the prosecutor knelt on the form, and leaned over the table, and put his fist in the prisoner's face—I could not say whether he hit him—the prisoner rose up; he was eating his supper, and had the knife in his hand—he made a blow at the prosecutor, and struck him on the head.</p>

                  </hi>. On 25th December I was house surgeon at Westminster Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there that evening between 9 and 10 o'clock, suffering from a scalp wound about an inch and a quarter long in the middle line of the scalp—it was bleeding considerably—it was a clean cut down to the bone, and must have been inflicted by such an instrument as a knife—he remained in the hospital until the 20th January—he had an epileptic fit during the night of 3rd January, and the following morning I found appearance of erysipelas—he suffered from erysipelas for about nine days—the wound in itself was not particularly dangerous.</p>

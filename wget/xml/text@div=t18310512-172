            . I am the prosecutor's son, and was taking care of this house. I left with the prisoner about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, on the 7th of November - he came out with me; I left the door shutter down - the door was locked, and I had the key; the bar was across the window shutters - they were all closed, except the door shutter; I bolted the back door with two bolts - I went to dine with my father, and returned to the house about dusk, and saw the prisoner within twenty yards of the door; as I went towards the house - he said, "Bill, there is a pane of glass broken;" I said, "I cannot see any pane broken;" he said, "Why, can't you see it?" and pointed to it - I found it was broken; the shutters were all correct, but a pane was broken in the front door, half of which is glass; I had left it all sound - the glass was broken close to where the door opens; a person could put his hand in and unbolt it - it was shut, and still bolted; every thing seemed right - I missed a blanket, but nothing else, not knowing what there was in the house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You came out at that door, how did you bolt it? A. I locked it - I found a trunk broken open in the room, but missed nothing; I had slept in the house the night before - the blanket was then on the bed when I left in the morning, and all correct.</p>

I came out of the house on Sunday morning with the prosecutor's son, and never went to it again till seven o'clock in the evening - I then went there, and went to bed; I saw the glass broken as we went to the house - when he entered he said he saw somebody had been into the house; he did not want his friends to know of it till the morning, but I said I would not stop in the house unless he let his friends know, and he went and told a friend - I slept there that night, and till Wednesday, when Mrs. Claridge said she did not care about any body sleeping there, and on Thursday morning, about six o'clock, they took me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ROGERS, JUN. The prisoner came out of the house with me, and parted from me two or three hundred yards on, between the house and Northall; when I came home in the evening I found him in the neighbourhood, and he walked with me to the house - directly we opened the door he went towards the back door, but I did not examine it, and cannot say whether it was bolted - the front door was fastened, but that shuts on being pulled too; the orchard goes all round the house.</p>

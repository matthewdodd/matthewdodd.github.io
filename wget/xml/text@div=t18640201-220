I manage the business at the King's Head, Fenchurch-street—on 6th June, between 3 and 4, the prisoner Baron came in and asked for three pennyworth of brandy—I served him, and he gave me a bad half-crown—I gave it to the waiter, Thomas, in the prisoners presence, and he had it cut in half, and brought it to me again, and I gave it back to Baron—he placed it in his waistcoat pocket, and paid me for the brandy in coppers—he made no remark—the cellarman followed him when he went out.</p>

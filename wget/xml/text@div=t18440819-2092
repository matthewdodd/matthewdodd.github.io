                  </hi>. I live in Orchard-row, Commercial-road, Stepney, and am a fish salesman. On the 30th of July I and my wife left the prisoner in charge of my house—he was a lodger—we returned at half-past ten o'clock at night—our things were all gone—some of them were pawned, and some were conveyed to Brand-street, Holloway, where the prisoner had taken a house—here is a tea-tray which I can swear to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mother of Edward Nathan, and live in White Horse-street, Stepney. On the 30th of July, between five and six o'clock, I went to my son's house—I knocked, and the prisoner opened the door, and said to me, "Have you seen my little girl?"—I said, "No"—he said, "You have got to go to Mr. Elliott's, in Broad-row, Ratcliffe, at eight o'clock to<lb></lb>night"—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he said my daughter had left—I however went into the house, and saw all the place in confusion, the chairs and the drawers were pulled about—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "I am going to clear out the place"—I said, "It is cleared"—he said, "It is no use going to deceive you, we are going to move, as we have got in arrears with the land<lb></lb>lord"—my son had taken the prisoner in with his five children, as he had lost his wife—the chest of drawers was the prisoner's, and my son purchased them of him for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the sofa and bedstead he bought of Mr. Solomons—they were never the prisoner's—the glasses my son bought—they never were the prisoner's—this tray is my son's, and has been in his house these three years—the prisoner has only been there twelve months—I went to Mr. Elliott's, and I had not been sent for.</p>

He brought the goods to that house, and when he took them all in I was standing at my window—he asked me where the pawnbroker's was—I told him I would show him—he brought out the tray and two bottles, and carried them to the pawnbroker's—I told him he might go in—he said, "No, I would rather you would go in, and pawn them for me"—he said, "Get 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or what you can"—I pawned them for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

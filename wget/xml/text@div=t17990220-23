               <p>Q. Are you liable to make it good, in case it should be stolen from you? - A. No doubt of that. The prisoner at the bar went through the passage into the yard, and took it; my wife went into the passage, and detected him with it under his coat; I was called, and when I came into the passage, I took hold of him likewise; he had the gown then, it was a pattern that I can swear to, for I never had a gown of the pattern in my life. I sent for an officer to take the prisoner in charge, and delivered the gown to him. He begged I would let him go, but I told him, I had been robbed so many times before, that I would not; I had been almost ruined, me and my family, by it.</p>

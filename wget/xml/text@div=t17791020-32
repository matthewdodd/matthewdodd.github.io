               <p>Was it so dark that you could not distinguish a man's face without the help of a candle? - It was so dark that I could not distinguish his face if I had not had a candle in my hand, and there was a lamp in the court; a young man came to our assistance, we took the prisoner into the house and sent for a constable, who came and searched him, and found a large chissel in the lining of his coat, and afterwards they took him to the Compter; I went in at the front door, which I opened with a key; I found the back door had been broke open; it stood wide open; the bolt was wrenched open; I could not tell with what; I found no one in the house.</p>

               <p>Crosby. The door of the pales was padlocked up; we searched the house so as to be sure that no one was left in it, and nobody could have been in it, as I think, but the prisoner. I am sure, from the noise, somebody was in the house; we charged the prisoner with breaking the house open; he grimed, and said he would dig some of our eyes out. I found three pick lock keys in the yard.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. How was I dressed? - In a light coloured great coat, a flapped hat, and buckskin breeches.</p>

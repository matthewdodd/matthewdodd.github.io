I struggled, and took hold of the Chain, but she pull'd the Key and Seal through my Hand, and gave it to her Companion Jones, who ran over the Way with it. I cry'd out as loud as I could, and still kept hold of Hewsly. Jones returned presently, swore at her, and called her foolish Bitch for staying with me, and said if I made any more Noise she'd make me hold my Tongue. The Constable and Watch came up, and I charged them with both the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Hewsly. I was standing at a Cook's-Shop buying a Bit of Meat. I saw a Woman in a white Gown jump out of an Alley, and presently the Prosecutor came and took hold of me, and said I had robbed him. But when we went to the Constable's House he stript us stark naked, and found nothing about us but what was our own.</p>
               <p>Murphey. She took hold of me first, and I never let her go till the Constable came. When she first surprized me, I did not know whether she was a Man or a Woman. She was searched slightly, but not stript stark naked. I found nothing on her indeed, but she had given the Watch to Jones before, and I never had it again.</p>

            ; I am in trust for the merchants and am responsible in certain cases, but I am not responsible in this case; between nine and ten, on Sunday evening, I received information that some iron had been taken out of my lighters; I got the assistance of Mr. Gottey, and other officers of the Marine Police-office, and I went with them, and the man that gave me the information, Mr. Williams, proceed to Paul's wharf; Mr. Williams pointed me out the barge of Mr. Jackson, where the iron was; she was twice or three times her length from my barge; she was loaded with coals, iron, and other goods; I went on board the large first; I went aft with a pistol in my hand; I found the two prisoners at the bar and three more persons on board; North, who is admitted an evidence, was one; there was one man, that was acquitted, Plumridge, who knocked down two or three gentlemen that were with me; we asked them where the iron was, which they had stole out of my lighter; one man jumped over-board, his name is Tridnall; the men at the bar were very quiet; I stood over them with my pistol, and swore if they were not quiet I would brow their brains out; and they certainly were very quiet; we secured Plum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040027"></xptr>ridge with cords, we tied him to the boat's bottom, and North was along with these two men; I had guard over the three; then we began to rummage; we asked them where the iron was, and they would not inform us, we were obliged to seek for it; we found it concealed under the bed place where the bed laid.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a place where goods are usually deposited? - A. No, I never heard that they were; I never saw iron deposited in such a place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a lighterman? - A. I served my time to the water.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find? - A.Eleven bars of iron; I did not weight them, but as far as I can guess they are between six and seven hundred weight; I sent for Mr. Jackson, to where they were, and asked him if he would give up the iron, and he said, no he was sorry for his men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You found North there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your going in you went in with your pistol? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.These men were very quiet? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN GOTTEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am in the employ of the Marine Police-office; I went with Mr. Hobbs, on board a lighter, where we found the two prisoners; as soon as we came to the barge, Hobbs and I went on board; we walked over the goods to the after part of her, to the place they call the cabin; I think there was a man of the name of Plumridge standing, or lying upon the floor, covered with bedclothes; they afterwards turned out to be the two prisoners, the man that was discharged, and North who turned King's evidence; I asked Plumridge, where the iron was that was stolen, and brought on board there; I took hold of him, and told him. I must secure him till I found the iron; Mr. Hobbs looked under the batches and said, there is some of the iron, I know it to be my property; Mr. Hobbs then sent for Mr. Jackson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the cargo consisted of? - A. There were coals and salt; Mr. Hobbs asked Jackson, in my hearing, if he had any iron stowed under the cabin floor, down that skuttle, pointing to the place where we found the iron; Mr. Jackson said, there was none there to his knowledge, if there was any it was unknown to him, they did not make any part of his cargo; then we secured them, and they were taken to the Marine Police-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. These men were lying down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were, perhaps, as much undrest as workmen usually are? - A. I believe they were.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hobbs. This is the kind of iron that my barge was loaded with, there were no other barges at Paul's wharf loaded with iron of that description; I had four, all one person's property; we call it all Paul's wharf premises, there was other iron upon the wharf belonging to Mr. Bellin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. There is no specific mark of your's upon the iron? - A. No; it has the merchant's mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity you had in these four barges? - A.Two hundred ton.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you then ascertained by any means, that there is any deficiency? - A. The land-waiter weighs them; and he said there was a deficiency.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I have been a wharfinger and iron broker fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the iron now produced of the same species as that on board this gentleman's barge? - A. Exactly, it is a very particular sort; it is what is termed in this country Russia tire iron, to distinguish it from common bars; I had never seen another sample of this sort of iron in the port of London before; I have no doubt in the world that it is Mr. Hobbs's, besides this; there were nine lighters loaded with iron in Paul's wharf; there was not room to stow the ninth, and that was stowed in a dock a few yards off, but there were no other lighters that contained similar iron to this of Mr. Hobbs's, and there was none of that kind landed at that time; there is but one other iron broker besides myself, and I think it is impossible that any of that sort of iron could have come to London without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cutler's defence. I had come from Buckinghamshire with a barge, and I laid down and went to sleep; I never saw any thing that is laid to my charge.</p>
               <p>Butler's defence. I laid in the barge, North and Tridnall were up, I saw nothing that went forward.</p>

             sworn. - I am a barge-master at Marlow; I know North, I would not believe him upon his oath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You never heard him sworn any where? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why would you not believe him upon his oath? - A. He is a wicked, blackguard, drunken fellow, he bears a very bad character; I never heard a worse in my life.</p>
               <p>Cutler called six, and Butler four witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

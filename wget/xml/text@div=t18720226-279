                  </hi>. I am the wife of John William Brown, and live at 24, Sutherland Street, Pimlico—I was upstairs on 24th January, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon and saw all the property which the police now have in their possession, safe—I went up about 7 o'clock, and missed the things: a counterpane, two shirts, one sheet, a jacket and other articles—the street door was locked that evening between 4 and 7 o'clock—I gave information to the police, and afterwards saw the things at the police-station—I did not know anything of the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi>. I was living with the prisoner; about two or three days after I was so living with him, I went with him to Sutherland Street—I stopped opposite the house I now know as Mrs. Brown's—the prisoner opened the door with a key—after he had opened it, he came away to see that no one shut it, and then he went back and walked in—I waited outside till he came out—he came out with a bag full of things—we walked home together—he said "Walk quick, because I see a man coming"—he after<lb></lb>wards gave the clothes to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the key he opened the door with—he made it himself with a little file.</p>

I live at Sutherland Street, Pimlico—on 24th January, about 5.15 o'clock, I was running down the area steps of Mrs. Brown's house—I saw a man come out of the street door with a large bundle on his back—I could not swear to the man, but I believe the prisoner is the man—he had on a pair of woman's shoes or a pair of goloshes.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 31st January, at a lodging-house in New Peter Street—I searched him, and found two keys—in the room I found a bag and two more keys, and a file, and a pair of goloshes—I saw the girl at the police-station, and she was then wearing the clothes; but she went with me to the room where I took the prisoner—I tried this key in the door of Mrs. Brown's house, and it opened the door—that is one of the two keys which I found in his pocket.</p>

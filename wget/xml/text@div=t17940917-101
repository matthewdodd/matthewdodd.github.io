I followed him and asked him who gave him authority to take it away? he said a man employed him to wheel it away for three-pence; I asked him if he knew the man? he said, no; I asked him if he had no objection to wheel it back again? he said, he should not; and then I took him by the collar and brought him back again, and had him taken to Guildhall, where he was convicted.</p>

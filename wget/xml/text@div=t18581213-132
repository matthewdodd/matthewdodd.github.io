               <p>we left Calcutta, they beat me severely, and took away my chain and dress—the mate put the pig's tail in my mouth, and put my hands behind me—the pig's tail was put in two or three days—he forced the pig's fat in my mouth—two days the pig's tail and one day the pig's fat—he had hold of me by the neck, and put the pig round my neck and forced the fat in my mouth: he put pork in my hand to go and grease the topsail-sheet with the fat—that is generally done by Europeans—it is not usual to put any grease on the topsail-sheet—the pork fat was put in my mouth more than once—the mate forced it with his hand—the chief mate was there when the captain did it, but the chief mate forced it with his hand—pork was rubbed over my face by the mate—eating pork is quite forbidden by our religion, or touching pork at all—I was pricked with the bayonet more than once—for two days the chief mate had the bayonet in his hand, and used to prick me, and order me to run—I was struck by the chief mate with this rope that I have brought with me, aud besides the rope, he cut me with the belaying-pin—I was struck with the rope, sometimes with one hand, sometimes with both—this began a month after we left Calcutta, and lasted till we came very near to Europe.</p>

               <p>prick the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> with it—I law a boy sharpen it before I cleaned it; I was sent for to clean it for that purpose—the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> was kept sitting on the keel of the boats, and he would go and ask him if he was cold; sometimes he was afraid to say he was—if he said he was, he would come down, and was made to ran fore and aft till he got warm—if he did not run fast enough, he would prick him with the bayonet—I heard there was blood; I did not see it myself—when that was done with the pork, I have seen the men go down on their knees and beg that it might not be done.</p>

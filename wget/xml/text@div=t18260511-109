The prisoner came to our shop on the 9th of May, about two o'clock, for a pen and a sheet of paper; my master does not make a practice of selling them - she lives in the same street; she asked my mistress to try the pen for her; mistress went into the parlour, to dip it into the ink; I was at the end of the shop, and saw her stoop down while my mistress was in the parlour - I did not see her take anything, but when she was gone my master missed the spectacles.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GREGORY. I am a spectacle-maker. I was in the parlour, and heard a woman come into the shop - she asked for a half-penny worth of paper and a pen. I had left a pair of spectacles on the counter - when the woman was gone I went to see for them, and they were missing. I went to Simmond's, the pawnbroker, and found her in the act of pawning them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not going to pawn them - I picked them up from the ground - I thought I would use them, as my eyes began to fail me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GREGORY re-examined. I left them on the counter, and no person had entered the shop but this woman, from the time I left till I missed them - they were wrapped in a bit of paper.</p>

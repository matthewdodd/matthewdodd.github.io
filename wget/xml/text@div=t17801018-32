               <p>I saw Allen go into Mr. Combes's shop and bring out a half firkin of butter; I was going past the door; I thought he was not doing right, and stopped to watch him. There was a person at the door, to whom he gave the butter. I did not take notice of the other person. As soon as they were gone I told Mr. Combes of it, and he went after them. I do not know whether or no he overtook them.</p>
               <p>From Allen. What time was it? - About a quarter before eight.</p>
               <p>Did you know Allen before? - Only by seeing him go by our shop; I am sure he is the person; there was a light in the shop, I saw him very plain.</p>

               <p>I was at Cow-Cross, I saw Larcher with a tub of butter on his shoulder a little before eight at night. This gentleman came up and asked me if I saw any body go along with a tub, I said I had.</p>

               <p>I had been to Smithfield that day and bought a horse. I went to the Bull's Head<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180036"></xptr> about seven o'clock , and stayed there till about eleven drinking with some friends. There are two men at the door who saw me there. I have been bad ever since I resigned myself to them. I know nothing of it. They wanted me to pay eighteen shillings for the butter. I said I could not pay for it at all; and the attorney wanted two pounds eighteen shillings for his expences.</p>

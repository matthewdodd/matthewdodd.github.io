On the morning of the 27th of May, the prisoner produced this mug to me—he said, "I wish to know the value of this mug, what is it worth for old silver?"—after weighing it, I said 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then said, "No, I will pawn it; lend me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it"—I did so—I asked him who it belonged to—he said, "It belongs to my daughter"—he told me his name was John Ewart—he came again the next day, and brought this other mug—he pawned this for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was made a present to him—he came again on the 29th of May, and brought this tankard—he said for a temporary convenience he wanted 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I let him have it—he said it was his own—he came again and said "I am disappointed, advance me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more on that mug"—I did so—on the 3rd of June he had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—on the 4th of June I directed our young man to watch him, and found where he lived.</p>

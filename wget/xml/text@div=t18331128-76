               <p>JOHN HARTSHORNE. On the 4th of November, I was obstructed in my way about eight o'clock in the evening, just by <placeName id="t18331128-76-crimeloc439">Cripplegate church</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How long was it after this, before any man was brought back to you? A. I never lost sight of him till he was stopped and brought back to me - I admit I never saw his face, but I never lost sight of his back - I did not say I could not speak positively to him, and decline to give charge of him- I don't know Murrell by name - I mean to swear solemnly, that I never expressed any doubt as to this being the man who was concerned in robbing me; I went to the watch-house with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you not decline, even at the watch-house, to swear to this man for some considerable time? A. No; I always said that was the man - I did not see his face; he was in the act of running as he pulled me round - I cannot tell how far he ran; he was not out of my sight; it might be twice the length of this court; it was light - I saw him clearly - I never said, that as I had not seen his face, I did not like to swear to him.</p>

            . I am ward beadle. I was leaving my home at eight o'clock that night to appoint the watch; the prisoner was running with speed; I joined in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280056"></xptr>pursuit, laid hold of him at Girdler's-hall, and gave him to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there not an officer who had him in custody? A. No man had him till I took him - there was a man who said he had heard a noise and ran, but I had the prisoner before that - there was a gentleman came up and said he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to meet Mr. Sadgrove: in crossing Fore-street I saw this gentleman crying, "Stop thief;" a constable came up and said,"Are you running from the cry?" I said, "No;" he said, "It is not him;" but I was taken to the watch-house; Mr. Hartshorne then came in, but did not swear to me; he was taken out by Lewen, and then he came in and booked the charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARTSHORNE. We went out to see for the watch.</p>
               <p>- MURRELL. I am a patrol of Cripplegate. I was on duty on the spot, and was present when the prisoner was first taken - the prosecutor came up and said, he could not positively say whether he was the person; I asked him twice, and he took me to the spot where the robbery took place; and according to the situation, I consider he must have lost sight of him while he turned the corner - the prosecutor said, he could not positively say he was the man, but he was running at the time - I remained about a quarter of an hour there; the prosecutor did not express any more doubt, but he said he could not positively say he was the man; he did not express any other opinion while I staid - I went away on my duty, considering it was a case that would fall to the ground - I took the prisoner in charge in the street; he pulled off his coat, wished to be searched, and said he was innocent; I went with him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been a patrol? A. I was appointed on the 31st of August; I was a watchman before - the prisoner pulled off his coat himself - there was no watch found on him - I know he had been running; the corner he turned was in London-wall; I was not there, but the prosecutor said he turned it - I consider if the prosecutor says he never lost sight of him, he must be wrong; the prisoner was taken about fifty yards round the corner - I have not known innocent men run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say upon your oath, that you collected from the prosecutor's conversation, that the prisoner was not the man, or one of the men? A. He could not be positive - he did not say he was the man, and give charge of him in my presence; I left him there; he said he believed the prisoner to be the man, but he would not be positive; he said he had not seen his face, but he had seen his back; I did not hear him say he had never lost sight of him.</p>

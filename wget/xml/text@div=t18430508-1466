                  </hi>. I now live in High Holborn; I kept a stop in Long-acre. On the 30th of June the prisoner rode up to my shop on horseback, and called to me to come out—he said, "I want to see a pair of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. boots"—he got off his horse, came into the shop, and tried on a pair of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. boots—he said, "These are ugly things, let me have a pair of those yellow ones in the window"—they were a pair of patent boots—he liked them very well, and took off a pair of old boots with the heels hanging to them, offered me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

               <p>and said, "I am a respectable man, a hone-keeper, and keep twenty horses"—I said, "I will not take the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I must have the money or the boots"—he looked into his hat, and said, "I am very well known in the neighbourhood"—he could see no maker's name in his hat—he said, "Come up to George Allen's, at the Cock and Bottle, Bedfordbury, he will give me a respectable character, and you will see I am not a rogue"—I went to the Cock and Bottle—Mr. Allen was not there—Mrs. Allen told me to get the money or the boots—I wanted him to come back and take off the boots and take his own—he had my boots on, and left his own in the shop—he had something to drink at the Cock and Bottle, and when he came out he would not come back to my shop, to return my boots and take his own—he said, "If you will come with me over Waterloo-bridge I will pay you; I have plenty of friends about here, and I will pay for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to take you home, that you shall not lose time from your business"—when I got to Waterloo-bridge he went down the steps to a hair-dresser's shop, and said, "Lend me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., d----n it, this man mis<lb></lb>trusts my honesty"—the man said he had not got it—he asked the man to drink—he stopped loitering about—the man would not come with me—he went as far as the theatre—it came on to hail or rain—I caught hold of the bridle of the horse—it was a very spirited animal, and began to rear—his hat fell off—he came off the horse and said, "Yon d----d fool, the horse will kick your brains out"—I let the horse go—he got up on the horse—a policeman came up—I was going to give him in charge, but the horse ran away with him on it.</p>

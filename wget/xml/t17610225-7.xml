               <p>Tomason Brown. The prisoner came to my mistress, and desired she would take her in; she did; and after she had lain there, the next morning after she was gone, I missed my stays. We went after her and took her, and charged her with taking them. She confessed she had taken and pawned them, and told us where they were pawn'd, the were found accordingly, and she owned they were mine. [Produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>

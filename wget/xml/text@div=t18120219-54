               <p>Q. Is that one found in your apron the same as Mr. Collicott directed you to do them - A. Yes, the vacant part is filled up with a seal, if it was a box instead of a bottle, it was filled up by pasting a label over it.</p>

               <p>Q. (to Mr. Linley.) Have you the book of stamps here - A. I have the specimens taken from the books; these are part of the book of specimens.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a sheet of genuine stamps - A. It is. These are the stamps approved by the commissioners; and these are the first impressions made, which are reserved in our office as documents.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, look at these sheets, except in the centre part, Jones, Bristol, is that an imitation of the genuine stamp - A. It is a good resemblance.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were to see the whole of the words, Jones, Bristol, in the centre, instead of a crown, you would not take it for a genuine stamp - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If the centre is cut out, or a seal upon it - A. Then I should take it myself, when I compare them together, there is so little difference.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these three, where there are labels, in the state in which they are do they appear to you to be imitations of the genuine stamp - A. A very good resemblance, it is such a resemblance as would impose upon any common purchaser, it might impose upon me, but on my examining these boxes, they have not the genuine stamps upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had not have been called upon to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190030"></xptr>have examined them, if you had gone to have bought a box, you would have bought them - A. Yes, I should have bought them without a scruple.</p>

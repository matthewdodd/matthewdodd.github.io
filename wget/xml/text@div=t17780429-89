Upon the 6th of March, which was on a Friday morning, Roach and I went down into this vault and unscrewed the screws of Mr. Thornton's coffin all but two, and returned again to our work; afterwards we, together with Elliott, agreed to go to work again upon this coffin. On the Saturday morning we went to the church; about five in the morning a watchman followed us in and desired us to plane a board, which I did; we unscrewed the other two screws, and turned the coffin bottom upwards, and so took off the outside coffin from off the coffin; we left nothing but the shell; we cut the leaden coffin to pieces, and then replaced the other upon the shell, and screwed it down again; by this time it was pretty near eight o'clock; we carried the pieces of coffin, and concealed it under the children's gallery; we proposed then to go and sell it; Elliott mentioned Parker, in Grubb-street. There were two pieces, one was put in a bag which was taken by myself, the other was put in a basket. When we got to London-Wall, Elliott beckoned to me, and we went to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290059"></xptr> shop first, where they refused to buy it. We then went to Parker's he immediately weighed the lead; he asked no questions; he said it was forty-two pounds, and he paid us three shillings and six-pence, reckoning it at a penny a pound. I was going away with the empty bag, Mr. Augur's apprentice came in and seized me, and desired Parker, who is a constable, to assist in conveying me and Elliott to his master Mr. Augurs, Parker said, you had better go to your master and try to make the matter up; we went and were all three charged; Parker said, give them a trevalle for it.</p>

               <p>What did you understand by that? - I did not know exactly what it meant, but supposed it meant that we should try to get away; accordingly we made a run for it; Parker ran too; we did not get far; we were soon stopped and secured.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Augurs: upon the 7th of March, in the morning, as I was going up London-Wall, about eight o'clock, I saw Roach coming down Wood-street with a basket upon his back; he seeing me crossed over the way. I said what have you here; he said his tools. I looked at the basket. Roach turned round as if to avoid my looking into the basket. I looked in and saw there was lead; I seized Roach and sent for my master. I sent for a constable to take Roach into custody; that was the occasion of my going to Parker, for Parker was a constable. When I came to Parker's, I met the evidence Gould and Elliott coming out of Parker's shop with empty sacks, I supposed they had sold something there. I charged Parker with them: he said you had better go to your master quietly and make the affair up. I went and told my master what I had seen; my master charged them all, Parker amongst the rest. As they were going to the Compter they endeavoured to make off; but they were secured; after this we went and searched and found the leaden coffin removed from its place.</p>

               <p>- REYNOLDS sworn.</p>

               <p>I am an undertaker. I buried Mr. Thornton in a leaden coffin. I surveyed the vault the 7th of March, and the coffin was missing. I compared the pieces that were found at Parker's with the rest of the coffin that was found under the gallery of the church, and they were all beat up together again into the same from, they made out together the quantity and form of Mr. Thornton's coffin; we found the plate of the leaden coffin with Mr. Thornton's name upon it in Roache's chest, the lead which Gould said was sold at Parker's, was found afterwards under the counter in Parker's shop, it weighed fifty-two pounds weight, there is the folder now upon those two pieces which were sold to Parker; it is a sort of lead worked in a fashion peculiar to coffins; people in the trade know very well that it is coffin lead.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 7th of March the evidence came into my shop with some lead to sell; I did not know it was stole: I weighed it and was paying them for it, and Mr. Augurs's apprentice came in and gave me charge of them; when I came to his master's he gave charge of me with them. I told immediately where the two pieces were that I had bought, and they went and found them.</p>

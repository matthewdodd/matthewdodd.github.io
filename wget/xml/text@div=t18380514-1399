                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Trafalgar-road, Greenwich. I remember the 9tb of November very well—it was the day her Majesty went to Guildhall, and was a wet day—I was not acquainted with the prisoner before that, but knew him by sight—I knew who he was, and I believe I had spoken to him once or twice—he came to me that day at a house where I was in Greenwich, and asked me if I would buy a silver snuff-box of him, and he showed me the one produced—I asked him whose it was—he said it was his; that he had given it to his father when he was in better circumstances, and his father returned it to him that day, knowing he Was very badly off, so that he might make some money of it—I asked him what he wanted for it—he said 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him I did not think it was worth so much, but if he would come to Mrs. Coppings, who kept a chandler's shop nearly opposite the house where we were, I would weigh it, and tell him what I would give him for it—(she was before the Magistrate on the former occasion—I mentioned this in my first deposition, but not the last time, as I did not think it necessary)—we went there together, and the prisoner bought 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of onions—we weighed the box there, and it did not weigh more than an ounce and three quarters by her weight—the prisoner had told me that it weighed four ounces, but I said I knew it did not weigh two, by the look of it—I was not satisfied with Mrs. Coppings weight, because I knew there was a deal of difference between troy-weight and avoirdupois, so I went and borrowed my father-in-law's scales, who is in the jewellery way, and I found it did weigh about an ounce and three quar<lb></lb>ters—I then said to the prisoner, "I cannot give you so much; it is old<lb></lb>shioned,</p>

On the 9th of September, about one o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and said he wanted to buy a watch; he gave me to understand in his language that he wanted to purchase a watch; there were watches in the window; he pointed to the watch, the watch he pointed to was marked four guineas and a half; I shewed him three watches, he did not approve of any of them; I shewed him the fourth, I reached it out of the window, and when I returned back to the counter one of the three was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you shewed him the watches were they directly before him - A. Yes; and when I turned round to reach the fourth watch I left them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons in the shop - A. One young man and a boy, no customers; my young man is not here. On missing the watch I jumped over the counter and took possession of the prisoner; I gave him to understand what he had done; he seemed to understand our language, though he could not express himself in English; he wanted to go away, I would not let him; I searched him in the shop, I could not find the watch about him; I then took him into the back parlour adjoining the shop, and made him partly undress himself. I then could find no watch; I then ordered my young man to search him; I was by when he searched him, he could find nothing upon him; I then called in one of his countrymen that was in the street, he could speak his language and could speak English; he searched him, and could not find any thing. I told him to tell him what he had done; he still denied having the watch, I then sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the watch ever been found - A. Yes, by the officer.</p>

            . I am a constable. About one o'clock I arrived at the prosecutor's shop; when I took the prisoner into the back room he would strip himself naked, he would not allow me to search him with his clothes on. I insisted upon his putting his trowsers on for decency's sake; when he was putting his trowsers on I saw the pendant of the watch in his hand, his hand was inside of the trowsers; on my seeing the watch, he let the watch fall through the trowsers, and it come out on the floor and broke the glass. I have kept the watch in my custody ever since. All the property he had about him was two shillings and four new half pence; the two shillings was tied up in the corner of his neck handkerchief.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

I am a poor man, a native of Spain, lately removed from Portsmouth, where I had been three years a prisoner; I came to London to look for a ship to go home; I went into a public house and got some liquor, I cannot recollect what happened. I hope your lordship will look into my case, as I am a poor man, and ignorant of the English tongue.</p>

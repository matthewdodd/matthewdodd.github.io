The prisoner came to me on the 10th of July, to hire a horse to go to Rumford the next day. I asked him who sent him; he said, his master, Mr. Smith, of Oldford. I said, I know Mr. Smith very well, you shall have a house. He wanted to have him that night. I told him he should not have him till the next morning. He was to bring him back the next day.</p>
               <p>- Larkham. I am a servant to Mr. Horsenayle. The prisoner came to my master's to hire a horse; my master ordered me to get a horse ready for him next morning.

            . I live at Chigwell. Upon the 11th of July, in the morning. I went to the King's Head, at Chigwell, for a pint of beer; whilst I was there the prisoner and another man came down stairs; they had laid there all night; they began drinking milk punch. The prisoner said he had a dark bay horse to sell; he said he had trotted him about to shew him to a neighbour of mine, but that he did not buy him. I ask'd the price; he bid me look at him; he brought him out, and rid him backwards and forwards. He ask'd four guineas for him. I said I could not run so much money; he said, will you bid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120015"></xptr> nothing for the horse? I told him I would give two guineas and a half for him. We agreed for that money. I went home and fetch'd the money, and paid for him. About three hours afterwards I heard Mr. Horsenayle had lost his horse. I went next morning to him, to know if this horse was his property; when I found it was I sent it home.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was the horse this witness sent you the same as you had lett to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Horsenayle. Yes; it was.</p>

When I got home I told my master that I thought he was the man that stole the horse. My master ordered me to take a horse and pursue him. I took him between Mile-end Turnpike and White-chapel, and carried him to Mr. Horsenayle's.</p>

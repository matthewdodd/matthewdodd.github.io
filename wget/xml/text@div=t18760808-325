I am a servant at No. 18, Drayton Park—between 11.30 and 12 o'clock on 12th June I was at the top bed-room window at Drayton Park—I saw at No. 21 a man opening the breakfast window; No. 21 is nearly opposite—there were two people, not both together, one was standing some way off; I did not see those persons close enough to recognise them—I ran for a policeman.</p>

I am servant to No. 19, Drayton Park—shortly before 12 o'clock on the 12th of June I was cleaning the drawing-room window—while doing that I saw opposite to No. 21 a man, not the prisoner, standing outside the rails—he remained there two or three minutes—I next saw the prisoner come up from the area steps from No. 21, next door, to see the man that stood outside—the prisoner went up the road, and shortly after<lb></lb>wards they came down again—there was a policeman in sight; they separated, and this man was taken into custody.</p>

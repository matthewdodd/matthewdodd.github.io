            . I live at No. 1, John-street, Newington. On Thursday night, the 16th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in the Kingsland-road, returning home from work. from my father's, in Clerkenwell; I was alone - and in Kingsland-road, Blackford overtook me - I am sure he is the man - I never saw him before; he walked with me till he came to a house on the left hand side of the road - he had inquired where I was going, and said he was going to Newington; when we came to the Carpenter's Arms public-house, on the left hand side, he said, he wished for something to drink; and from his appearance, I took him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130064"></xptr>to be one of the Newington carriers, and paid 4d. for what he had to drink - I took nothing myself - we were not in there more than two or three minutes - he accompanied me along beyond Kingsland-crescent, and I heard footsteps behind me - I was suddenly seized by the arm by somebody, who came up behind, and laid hold of my left arm; Blackford directly seized hold of me by the right arm, and almost at the same instant I received a severe blow in my right jaw, by a third person, who came in front of me; I was knocked down - I immediately called Watch! - the watchman came to my assistance, and they all three ran off, taking from me my hat and handkercheif - my hat was knocked off after receiving the blow - and as I recovered myself, on getting up, I saw Blackford pick it up - I am sure of that - I cannot be mistaken in him; I saw him pick it up and ran off with it - the watchman pursued them with me, calling Stop thief! till they came to the turning, where we lost sight of them. Blackford and one of them escaped towards Haggerstone; the other ran towards the Rosemary Branch - the watchman said he knew the party" - I went with the watchman to the watch-house, and gave information - the watchman went in pursuit of them - I remained there about a quarter of an hour, and in about an hour and a half, I saw Blackford and Riley brought to the watch-house - I said, I was positive of Blackford, and am positive now that he is the man who seized my arm, and took my hat - I cannot be positive of the others - I lost my hat and handkerchief, which were not worth much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BLACKFORD. Q. Did I drink the whole of the liquor? A. I did not say so; but I drank none; I paid 4d.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I the only person you took in there? A. Yes; nobody was with us, not in my company.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 16th of August, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in Kingsland-road - I saw the prosecutor there, going by my box, which I was sitting in - Blackford had got hold of his left arm; Riley was close behind him - there were four of them together, including the prosecutor - there was one before; one had hold of him, and one behind him - after I saw them pass my box, I darkened my lantern, went on the other side of the way, and followed them to the extent of my heat - they had not passed many minutes before one of them had hold of each arm, and the other struck him and knocked him down; he fell on the ground - I could not say which struck him - I immediately ran across the road; two of them ran down Haggerstone-lane, and one turned across the fields, towards the Rosemary Branch - the prosecutor got up, and we followed them a little way, but it was no use to run after them, for I knew the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the third man? A. I have no recollection of having seen Read before - I went with the prosecutor to the watch-house, to give information there: and as we came along the road, told the rest of the watchmen of it. We went to a hay-loft in Crooked-billet-yard, Kingsland-road, and met them coming in there - that was only Blackford and Riley; when they got in and fastened the door, we went in and took them - I could find nothing on them belonging to any body - I saw Blackford pick the hat up as he ran away - they both ran away together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How near were you to them at the time? A. I cannot say exactly how many yards - I was on the opposite side of the way - I never measured it; I was across the road; it might be eight or ten yards - I ran up instantly; I did not spring my rattle - I had not time, as it was buttoned in my coat; the watchman above sprang his rattle - I darkened my lantern while I followed them, and when the prosecutor fell, I opened it directly, to see which way they ran.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BLACKFORD. Q. Are you quite positive I picked the hat up? A. Yes, quite; I knew you before - you had a jacket on, a waistcoat with sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the other man who had his arm? A. Yes - it was Riley - he caught hold of his hand - he walked behind at first, and then one pinioned him on each side; as soon as Blackford saw us enter the hay-loft, he knew me, and said "You are a bl-y good fellow to come and take me" - that was when I said "Here are two of them here."</p>

            . I am headborough of Haggerstone. On this Thursday night, about twelve o'clock, I was coming up Brunswick-street, Haggerstone, and met Blackford and Read coming from Kingsland-road way towards Hackney - the clock had struck twelve a few minutes before. I had known Blackford before for some years - they were walking. Blackford had a hat in his hand, holding it before him; when he saw me he put it behind him, and when they had passed me he put it before him again. I went back to them, and asked what they had got there - neither of them spoke, but Read shoved me on one side when I went to catch hold of Blackford, and Blackford threw the hat at me, and they ran across the fields - one one way, and one another. I followed Blackford, but he got into a field, and as it was very dark, I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are headborough of Haggerstone? A. Yes - of Shoreditch-road. I know the crescent in Kingsland-road. I was coming from Hackney-road way just by the new church; when I met them I was in Brunswick-street; the gas work's clock struck twelve a minute or two before - I had not heard the church clock strike. I suppose I was about four minutes walk from Kingsland-crescent. I never saw Read before.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Kingsland-road. On this Thursday night, I was at the Carpenter's Arms, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, I saw all the three prisoners there. I saw them go in there in company - the prosecutor went in at the same time. I saw them come out again in less than two minutes. Blackford went on with the prosecutor towards Kingsland - he took hold of his arm, and walked with him - the other two walked behind them - they went up the road towards Kingsland.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw him go into the public-house, and the three prisoners go in at the same time? A. Yes - I saw them go in together.</p>

               <p>Q. The prosecutor did not go in with Blackford only? A. There was very little difference - I had seen them all three together just before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that before he went into the public-house, the three walked along the road with him A. No; the two were three or four yards behind - they were not all talking together; they went into the public-house about the same time - they had some gin. I did not go inside, but I looked in to see what o'clock it was. I did not see them drink gin. I could see them taking their gin - the prosecutor stood by their side.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see each of them drinking gin? - A. No; I saw one of them drinking; I cannot say which of them it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You saw them all four together in the house? A. Yes; I did not see a fifth man; I only saw the three prisoners and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You mean all four were in the public-house at the same time? A. Yes; they stood at the bar, very near each other; they seemed to be in company; I do not mean to say they were drinking together - I did not hear any conversation between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were only in the same place at the same time? A. Yes, in the passage before the counter; the prosecutor stood near them; he might have seen them if he had looked at them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were they standing so near together that the prosecutor could not avoid seeing the other two? A. He could not help seeing them, I should think.</p>
               <p>A. W. MOORE re-examined. Q. Who did you go into the public-house with? A. With Blackford; I have no knowledge of any one else - I was walking with him, and went in with him - I did not take particular notice of any one else; there might have been others there - I think Blackford spoke to some one in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed whether he was in company with any body before? A. No; he overtook me on the road - I did not notice any body following us in.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could there have been footsteps within two or three yards behind you without your hearing them? A. There might be without my observing them - I went just to the bar of the public-house - it is in front of the door - there is a wide entrance - there is a counter before the bar; the space before the bar may be about four yards; I had not been drinking before I went in - I was perfectly sober.</p>

            . Here is the hat that was thrown at me - I never saw Read before - it was rather dark; there was a gas-light opposite, and I have heard there is a person very much like Read.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said, positively, that Blackford and Read were together, coming from towards Kingsland-road - that Blackford had the hat, and Read shoved you aside, and so on? A. Yes; but I said I never saw Read before - I believe it to be Read; there was a gas-light opposite - it was a very dark night - I had only the opportunity of seeing him by the light opposite - they were then about ten minutes walk from the hay-loft - the field they crossed leads that way; I am certain of Blackford; the other man went down Haggerstone-lane - that leads in the same direction - it would lead to the hay-loft also.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you had not seen Read before, do you believe he is the man or not? A. I believe he is - it was a person answering him in every description, and he had on just the same dress as he has now, exactly so, a red waistcoat, blue apron, and that jacket, and he had a glazed hat - I saw that distinctly, and when he was apprehended he had the glazed hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there is some other person like him? A. I have been told so since.</p>
               <p>A. W. MOORE re-examined. This is my hat; I have had it some time in wear; the maker's name had fallen out about a week before - I named that to the Magistrate before I saw it.</p>
               <p>BLACKFORD's Defence. On the night of the robbery I had been drinking at the Eagle, in Kingsland-road; about half-past eleven o'clock, I was coming towards home: a person, who had been drinking with me, was rather intoxicated, and I led him home; this officer and a watchman came and said to me, "It is time you were at home:" I said, "I have been taking a man home." I am in the habit of going out to the markets about two or three o'clock in the morning, and thinking it was too late to go on further, I thought I would go and lay in the loft, as it would be time to get up soon; I went to the loft - the officer and watchman came to me; I was fast asleep; he said, "I want you:" I said, "For what?" he said, "You will know presently; by whose permission are you in this loft?" I said,"By the owner's." After I had been in the watch-house ten minutes, the prosecutor came in, and Jones had charge of him; the prosecutor said Jones was implicated in the robbery, and the officer would not allow the constable of the night to take charge of him, as he said he should want him to appear against the prisoners in the morning; the watchman said, "I will give charge of this man," and the prosecutor said, "Charge for charge:" he was so drunk, that he could hardly stand on his legs - they are now swearing false.</p>

            . It is false; the prosecutor came back from the watch-house to my beat, and asked why I did not come to his assistance: I told him I heard nothing of it, my beat was so far from the spot; he was rather sancy about it, and I took him to the watch-house for assaulting me on my duty; he did not charge me with being concerned; he was angry with me for not assisting him.</p>
               <p>A. W. MOORE re-examined. I was not drunk - it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130066"></xptr>quite false; nothing was said about charge for charge; I did not charge Jones with being concerned in the robbery; after I had given information, I was told to go home, and attend at Worship-street; as I was going home, Jones asked me if any of the men were taken; I said No, but I had to attend before the Magistrate; I said I thought the watchmen on the road were very neglectful, as I cried Stop thief! very loud: he said they should have enough to do, if they attended to every cry of Stop thief! I said by their not coming forward it appeared as if they were implicated; he said, "Do you mean to say I was concerned?" I said, "No; I said no such thing;" another watchman came up; I told him of it, and I was taken in charge, because I said I thought the watchman might be implicated; they took me to the watch-house at the time the two prisoners were brought in; the watchman wished the person there to take me in charge, but he would not, as I gave him my card; I did not hear any rattle sprung at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BLACKFORD. Q. How could Jones come to your assistance - Norton never sprang his rattle? A. A rattle was sprung by another watchman.</p>
               <p>RILEY's Defence. I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>READ's Defence. I am quite innocent, and have witnesses to prove it.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses deposed to Riley's good character, and one to that of Read.</p>

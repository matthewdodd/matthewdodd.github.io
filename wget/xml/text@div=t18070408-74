            . - Mr. Walfard. You produce a copy of the record of the conviction of Field and King. - A. Yes, I have examined it, it is perfectly correct, I got it from Mr. Knapp's office. (The copy of the record read in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Tuesly, do you recollect at any time losing any quantity of gun powder. - A. I lost three or four hundred pound weight of it in July 1806. I did not miss it till the 6th of August when we took stock. In consequence of the loss of the powder I applied to a magistrate. In the month of August I was sent for to Whitechapel office, there I saw Hall and the two persons that have been convicted, and the prisoner; they were in custody.</p>

In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner at the bar, I called on him, I told him I had an information of his receiving some gunpowder; going to the office, I asked him if he had sold any gunpowder, he said he had, he said it was brought to him by a man in a smock frock; he said he did not know where to find him, he had seen him but once; some time before then he brought a quantity of gunpowder to him, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080038"></xptr> said gave a shilling a pound for it, I asked him if he kept any for his own use, I know he went a shooting at times, he said he had about two pounds, it was in his bedroom upon the coppers; he meant a heap of halfpence; I went to the prisoner's house, I saw his wife, I told her I would thank her to go along with me, her husband had sent me for some gunpowder; she took a candle and went up immediately; she said that she had moved it from the halfpence on the drawers; she gave me a pound in one paper, and about a pound in an other paper; it was sealed up in this form (producing it).</p>

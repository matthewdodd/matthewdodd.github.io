            . On Saturday the 30th of July, I was at the Coopers' Arms, public-house. I saw Murty and Gantly there. Murty and I were taking a pot of beer - he observed that Gantly was there. Gantly came in, and Clines came in three or four minutes after. They both sat in a seat opposite to where Murty and I were. Murty continued sitting there for near five minutes, and when the pot of porter was nearly finished, he said something to me - we finished the beer, and he got up, and was going from the house - Gantly was still sitting, but as soon as Murty rose, and walked towards the passage, as if to go out (I was with him) he (Gantly) followed, and went into the bar, which is the way out. Murty stopped to take part of some beer in the tap-room - Gantly was then standing with his back to the bar; Murty would have to pass him to go out. As he passed him, Gantly immediately put up his right fist, and inflicted a wound on the left side of Murty's head; he struck him with the soft part of his hand. I saw Clines a moment after this, but not at the time the blow was struck. Murty stumbled over against the thing the gin cask stood against. Gantly laid hold of him by the right arm - Clines immediately came out of the taproom into the passage, and dragged me by the back of my neck from parting them - I was endeavouring to part them when he seized me. The blood came from the deceased's head in consequence of the first blow, and therefore I endeavoured to part them. The stillion supported him from falling. I saw several other blows inflicted. Murty kept on his legs, for he was held up by Gantly, and by the assistance of Clines. Gantly held him by the right shoulder, and Clines was behind the deceased with his two hands against his back, driving him up against Gantly, to prevent him from falling, while Gantly inflicted the wounds. Murty was struggling to disengage himself as well as he could, with his left hand; his other hand was held by Gantly - he had him by the right arm. Gantly's fist was not closed in the proper form; he had some instrument concealed in his hand - I could see about three quarters of an inch of it; it appeared to me a blunt instrument, about half an inch thick, and strait; either iron or steel - it was of a hard substance. I did not observe it after the second blow; each blow produced blood, as it was inflicted. Not a word had passed between them before the first blow. I am quite sure the deceased did not strike Gantly first. About five blows were inflicted before I went to the door and called Watch. I did not leave till it was all over, nor was I out of sight except in calling the watchman, which was only a moment - the watchman nor I could render any assistance, being unequal to them. When I returned from calling the watch, both Clines and Coin were about the deceased. I did not see Coin lay hands on him at all. I saw him drive the people back saying,</p>
               <p>"Let them, have fair play." There was a crowd about, saying it was a shame to see the man murdered. Murty was all this time bleeding from all parts of his head - his hands were then loosened; he was in a weak state, from loss of blood, and unable to offer any resistance. He was leaning against the end of the bar. When the watchman found he could do nothing he sprang his rattle, and other watchmen came from all quarters - it was just finished when they came in; it had continued from the time the watchman went for assistance until the others came - it lasted six or seven minutes altogether I think, but cannot say particularly. I saw four or five blows then. I came in with Mahoney the first watchman, and stood at the entrance of the door, intending to secure Gantly if he came out. My mind was more upon getting assistance than noticing them. After the first four or five blows, I did not see Clines do anything; he only kept close to Murty. I could not secure Gantly, but I told the watch to keep a look out outside. I am positive Gantly did not go out at the door I stood at. One door leads into West-street, and the other leads into Sharp's-alley. When it was over there was a search for Gantly - Clines and Coin were still in the tap-room, and were taken. Before that, I went into the tap-room, and said to Clines that it was a shame to see a man murdered like the deceased was; Coin was within hearing. Clines and a strange man told me to mind my own business, and sit down. Nobody gave charge of them, for we were in search of Gantly - the deceased and I came in and gave charge of them eight or nine minutes after. I had seen Gantly and the deceased together about a fortnight before, one Sunday night; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110018"></xptr>was in the same public-house, and saw Gantly challenge Murty to fight him; they tossed for the ground, and Gantly won the toss.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they going to fight about - A. The deceased had been beat by Gantly on the Saturday night, and in about twenty minutes after I saw them in the passage scuffling, and the watchman parted them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. You were a friend of the deceased's - A. I had known him for several years. I went into the house after nine o'clock - the deceased afterwards came in and joined me. Gantly and Clines were opposite on the other side of the room; they could not hear what passed between us. Murty was leaving the house, and met a relation who handed him some beer - I was right behind walking after him. Gantly was in front of him with his back to the bar. Clines had not left his seat, and did not come up till Gantly struck Murty - he came behind Murty after the first or second blow. Gantly kept striking. I only saw something in his hand once, which was the second blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Clines come up and say,</p>
               <p>"Let all be fair, man to man" - A. No; he said fair play, and dragged me back as I was going to part them, seeing the blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Coin come in with Rowland, the watchman - A. I saw him in the passage nearly at the finish of the fight - he was not in the tap-room. The prisoners had an opportunity to leave the house, but did not attempt.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When Clines was behind Murty, was it visible what the effects of the blows were - A. It was - he was covered with blood, and not resisting; he tried to strike, but the blow did not fall. Mahoney was the first watchman who came in.</p>

            . I am between fourteen and fifteen years old. Murty was my uncle; he sometimes went to the Coopers' Arms, and I sometimes go there. When you go in at the street door, there is a long passage which leads into the tap-room; the bar is on the left hand, before you get to the tap-room. On Saturday night, the 20th of July, a little before ten o'clock, my father sent me there for my uncle; it was all quiet when I went; I found him in the tap-room, in company with the last witness - they were sitting drinking. It is an open room, not parted with boxes. I saw both the prisoners and Gantly in the room when I went in; they seemed all three of one party, not in company with my uncle. I did not know of Gantly and my uncle having any words. I told him to go home, for my father wanted him; I spoke privately to him; he answered me; I waited for him in the tap-room, and in about a quarter of an hour he got up to go. I did not hear the prisoners or Gantly interfere with him. When he got up to come away, Heeney went with him; my uncle went first, and I was with him. Gantly followed my uncle out, and some person stopped to let him have some drink, when Gantly got before him and waited. The prisoners remained in the tap-room; Gantly stood by the bar, in the passage; my uncle bid the man who gave him the beer good night, and when he got up to Gantly, Gantly said,</p>
               <p>"You did not bid me good night, you b - r," and then struck him a blow over the forehead; the blood came from his forehead directly.

            , who had been in company with Clines, and who had followed my uncle out, hollowed out that Gantly was fighting; this brought the two prisoners from the tap-room to the place; several blows had been struck before this. I could see that Gantly had something in his hand like iron; his hand was shut, so that it must have been a small thing. All the blows were struck in the same manner, and on the head; each blow appeared to produce more blood. My uncle did not fall; I screamed out Murder, and called to Mr. Lake, who was inside the bar; he did not come, but said, he did not care for my uncle, what he got, or if he got as much more. My uncle tried to get away, but Clines came and held him, and Coin came and prevented his falling. I think he received three or four blows before the prisoners came up. Clines and Gantly were both beating my uncle - Clines gave him a thump on the mouth, and as he went away kicked him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Let the b - r go, he has had enough." My uncle was knocked down at that time. While this was going on, Heeney called for assistance, and

             went for the watchman; the prisoners went into the tap-room again; Gantly went backwards into the yard; there was a door there by which he could get out. My uncle was taken to the hospital about eleven o'clock. He gave no offence to Gantly or the prisoners, that I saw; he was much hurt by the blows; I cannot say whether the prisoners saw what Gantly had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you ever examined about this since your uncle's death - A. Not by any person but the Coroner; I have not spoken to any body about it since. I am sure both the prisoners were in the tap-room when I first went in; I have often seen them having a pot of beer together. I saw the way every blow was struck; I could see the iron at the bottom part of his hand; four or five blows were struck before the prisoners came up, and his blood was flowing before they came. Heeney stood at the tap-room door all the time; my uncle and Gantly were between the tap-room and street doors; I think Heeney might have heard what Lake said; he was near enough to see Clines strike my uncle in the mouth and kick him. The prisoners were sitting quietly till Dogherty went in and said they were fighting; Heeney must have seen the prisoners sitting at the table. There were many other persons in the room.</p>

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you a good deal alarmed - A. Yes; my attention was principally directed to my uncle; I did not observe Heeney go to the door; a watchman came in while they were beating him.</p>

            . I live in West-street, West Smithfield. I was at the Coopers' Arms about ten o'clock, and saw the deceased there; Gantly and both the prisoners were also there; I stood at the bar, and saw Murty come out of the tap-room; he went towards the bar; Gantly came by him from the tap-room, and somebody offered Murty a pot to drink out of; he returned the pot, and bid the man good night; Gantly turned on his foot, and said,</p>
               <p>"You b - r, you have not bid me good night," and struck him over the forehead, not with his knuckles, but with the soft part of his hand; the first blow fetched blood; he struck him several times. A woman named

            , who cohabits with Clines, cried out that Gantly was quarreling; Clines then came out of the tap-room; Gantly continued to strike, and Clines held Murty's hands, as far as I could see. I did not see Murty strike; Clines stood by his side, quite close to him; Murty tried to stumble<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110019"></xptr>several times; but he was kept up by Clines; Gantly continued to beat him, and Dogherty said,</p>
               <p>"Give it him - go it." I saw Coin in the middle of the row, at the entrance of the bar; I did not observe him do any thing; there were many people there; I saw Corker there; she was near Murty; she screamed out to the landlord to put her uncle inside the bar; he said he would not - that it served him right - that he wished he had more of it, for he had not had as much as he deserved; Coin was in the room when Corker called out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Have you no other name than Cahill - A. No; the man I live with is named Gavin; some people call me by that name. One Collins of Blackwall had taken me there to treat me with a pint of beer; I only went to the entrance of the bar; I was there before Gantly came out of the tap-room. Heeney came out of the tap-room, as far as the bar; I cannot say whether he came out with Murty. The tap-room door was open. Two blows were given before Dogherty sung out; then Clines came out first. I saw Coin in the midst of the row; there were so many in the room, I could not rightly tell who was there; but on looking about I saw Coin there, standing behind his back as it were; Clines struck him the last blow in the mouth with his fist. I have been at this bar seven years ago, for pawning from a ready-furnished lodging, and was confined twelve months. Murphy's head was all in a gore of blood.</p>

            . I am a shopkeeper, and live opposite the Coopers' Arms, in West-street. On Saturday night, the 20th of July, a little past ten o'clock, I heard a noise there, and went into the bar, which is near the street door; a great number of people were there; I saw Murty with his head bleeding, among a number of people, and one in particular, beating him; he held him, I believe, with the left hand, and struck him with the other. All the blows were with the flat part of his hand. I did not see the deceased return the blows; he was standing when I saw him; he was held by the men who were striking, and apparently by the mob behind him; he bled very much in the head and face, so much so that I could not discern his features. The prisoners were there among the crowd; I think there were twenty or thirty people there; a watchman came in; I did not notice one man more active than the rest; they appeared to hold the man up; the prisoners were in the mob, apparently assisting the rest; I was not there above five minutes. I cannot say that the man who struck had any thing in his hand, but I thought he had, by the manner of his striking. I have no doubt of the two prisoners being there when the first watchman came in. I did not see any body try to prevent what was going on; I was greatly alarmed; I saw Lake in the bar; he must have seen what was going on better than I; he was near to them. After the man was rescued from the men who were beating him, I thought all was safe, and went home; he did not appear to be particularly weak; he walked very fast to the watch-house, but the blood ran from him almost like rain. I recollect Gantly's person; he was the man who struck the blows. A shutter fell in among the crowd by the scuffle; that was two minutes after I went in.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 20th of July Mrs. Welch came out, calling Watch and Murder; my box is near the door. I went into the Coopers' Arms alone; I endeavoured to get to the man who was receiving the blows, but I was pushed back by many of them and overpowered. I stopped till I saw the man knocked down and then ran out and sprung my rattle; I went as far as Smithfield; I came back with assistance, and saw the man standing by himself by the bar; his head was covered with blood; he was the same man whom I had seen struck; I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were there or not. The deceased gave charge of the prisoners half an hour or twenty minutes afterwards; they were sitting in the tap-room.</p>

            . I am watchman of St. Sepulchre's. I heard a rattle spring, and went to the Coopers' Arms, about half-past ten o'clock; the door of the house was shut; I saw Coin standing at the door; about two minutes after the door was opened, in consequence of my orders, Coin and I went in together; there was a crowd of people in the passage; we went a little further; Coin's heels struck against a shutter, and it fell by accident. Some of them used very had language, and Coin said,</p>
               <p>"Don't ill treat the watchman; let him go on, as he is on his duty." They made way for me; I joined the other watchmen, and we searched the house. Murty was leaning against the bar counter; we could not find the man we wanted. I saw the back door was fast and the clothes horse put against it; there is a back window through which a man might escape, and that window was open. Murty was bleeding very much; he appeared very faint when he got to the watch-house, and was sent to the hospital.</p>

            . I live in West-street, about three doors from the Coopers' Arms. On the 20th of July my attention was called there by the cries of Murder. I ran in, and in my hurry got between two men who seemed to be fighting; but on looking further, I found one was holding up the other with his right hand, and his left was uplifted, and now and then he hit him on the top of the head in this manner, with the fleshy part of his fist, and there was a gush of blood every time he struck. I saw this for about five minutes; I did not see the person return any blows; he could not; he attempted to fall to the ground, to avoid the blows, but the superior strength of the man who struck him prevented him. There were a good many people about; it was a confused concern altogether; I cannot speak to the prisoners.</p>

            . I lodged at the Coopers' Arms at this time. The noise brought me from the tap-room to the front of the bar; I had been in the tap-room for an hour or an hour and a half. I had not observed Gantly; I saw him go out, and saw Clines pass me going down the room. When I got to the bar, I saw Murty and Gantly fighting. There might be a dozen persons about them. Blood was flowing from Murty's head and Gantly's nose. I saw Coin come in just before the row ended; he put his hands out in the room and said,</p>
               <p>"Make room," or</p>
               <p>"Fair play," or something.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first thing he did was to say,</p>

               <p>"Give fair play" - A.</p>
               <p>"Make room," or</p>
               <p>"Give fair play," which I cannot be certain. I saw nothing more; that was the end of the row. I might be there for three or four minutes. I have told all I saw; I saw both men fighting; the deceased man fought as hard as he could with his fist.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110020"></xptr>Q. In what manner did Gantly strike Murty - A. One man had hold of the collar by the right hand and the other by the left. The major part of Gantly's blows were directed to the head; I suppose I might see twenty or more blows; I did not count them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count the blows Murty gave to Gantly - A. No; he gave them so fast, I could not count them; both gave blows so fast I could not count them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the blows given by Gantly produce blood from Murty - A. Of course they must. I could not see any thing in his hand; it struck me that he must have something in his hand; I am a carpenter, and out of work at present.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Coin came in at the end of the row, and said,</p>
               <p>"Make room, or give fair play;" was that at the time the shutter fell - A. It was not many seconds before it fell; a watchman came in at that time, and the man fell directly. I had not seen Clines drinking with Gantly; I did not see Coin till he came from the street door; and said</p>
               <p>"Make way;" that was the first time I saw him.</p>

I then saw them both striking each other. I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were present when the affray began - I saw Coin a minute or two after it began.

I have seen both the prisoners before - I do not know whether they knew Gantly. Two nights previous to this murder, I conducted the deceased home from his master's house in Smithfield, by desire of Mr. Cressey, to his lodging - he had to pass the Coopers' Arms in his way.

            . I am house surgeon of Bartholemew hospital. On the 20th of July, I examined the deceased when he was brought in. I found the upper part of his body covered with blood, and several wounds on the upper part of his head - there were ten in number, and most of them an inch in length, and two about an inch and a half, and some about one sixth of an inch deep, and about half of an inch deep going down to the bone. I found a wound near the forehead, about an inch and a half in length, on the leftside, and going to the bone; there was hair from the head within the wound, driven into the bone of the scull; these wounds could not be inflicted by the fist, but by a blunt instrument - there were distinct incisions, and not contusions. I attended him for some days. It was about twelve days before symptoms of injury within the head appeared, which were the natural causes of the blows. There was an interval in which I did not attend him. I believe the chief, though not the sole cause of his death, was the violence he received; that his death was accelerated by the wounds - it was not the proximate cause certainly; I should more properly call it the occasional cause. I believe death might probably be produced by the injury, but as I did not open the body, I am unable to say, but it decidedly must have accelerated his death.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How many days before he died did you cease to see him - A. There was an interval of twelve days between his convalescence and relapse, when I did not see him. His liver was injured, which frequently happens by a blow on the head; and that is my opinion.</p>

            . I am assistant surgeon at St. Bartholemew Hospital. I saw the deceased on Sunday the 21st, the day following his admission. I did not particularly examine the wounds in his head, as they were bound up, and it would injure them. He did not appear labouring under any severe symptoms arising from the injury in the head at that time. I mean that he was quite sensible; about a fortnight after he altered - he always had an unhealthy appearance; no alarming symptoms appeared till the Saturday preceding his death - he had then a bilious attack, which was the consequence of the blow on the head when the patient was in a particular state. He complained of considerable pain in his head, and particularly of one wound on the left side of his head, all the rest were healed. He died on the 9th, having been trepanned on the 8th. I was present during part of the time the body was opened, and attribute his death directly to the injury he received,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110021"></xptr>being previously in a bad state of health. The fracture did not extend through the scull, only the outer plate of the bone was fractured, and matter formed between the two plates, which accounted for the pain in his head. The death was produced by the injury no doubt, but in my judgment the wounds would not have ended in death if given to a perfectly healthy subject.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you see the subject opened - A. My attention was turned to the liver, which appeared to be diseased, and that of long standing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the injury of the liver likely to cause sudden death, or protracted - A. Protracted; he might have lived twelve months or more, but I think it was incurable.</p>

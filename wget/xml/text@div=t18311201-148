On the 26th of October I took the prisoner's cab on Fish-street-hill; I had these knives and forks, and some other articles, which were tied in a handkerchief - I gave the parcel to the prisoner to put in, and he put them on the seat in the cab: I went in, and sat on the seat where they were - he sat outside to drive; he took me to my house in <placeName id="t18311201-148-crimeloc797">Ratcliff-highway</placeName>

The prosecutor told me to stop the cab, as there was a parcel in it- I pursued it; the prisoner drove on faster, and I lost sight of the cab at Ratcliff-cross; he went on as fast as the horse could well trot - I called after him to stop repeatedly - he must have heard me, but he drove on at a rapid rate; I told another officer of it.</p>

I heard the cab coming on as fast as the horse could trot; I heard some cry out behind it, but I did not know what it was - Gammage came up, and told me to pursue and stop it; I went as far as I thought he would turn to go into the Commercial-road, but he went on the farthest way; I knew there was no way for him to return but the Commercial-road, and I cut across to meet him - I stopped one of the Blackwall stages, and asked if they had seen a cab - while I was speaking the prisoner came up with his cab at full trot; I stopped him - he said, "What is the matter?" I said, "You have a parcel belonging to a gentleman who you set down in Ratcliff-highway" - he said he had, and gave it me from under the seat where he himself was sitting - it was between the cushion and the hay, not inside the cab.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I set the gentleman down it was one o'clock in the morning - I went along the highway, and saw the parcel; I recollected it belonged to that gentleman - I took it out, and put it into the dickey, intending to take it to the coach-office in the morning; I did not know what number the prosecutor lived at.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Broad Arrow, Milton-street, in the parish of St. Luke. The prisoner was formerly my pot-boy, and frequented the house since as a customer—on the evening of the 9th of Feb., after the customers had left, I went over the house to see that it was fast—the prisoner left that night about a quarter to one o'clock—I keep my copper money in a drawer in the bar—there was a shilling, a sixpence, and a fourpenny-piece there—next morning, when I came down, I found the bar doors broken open, which were locked overnight—I missed the copper and silver—the prisoner was apprehended—he was searched at his mother's house, in my presence, and 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a key found on him; and in a teapot, in the room where he was, were these coppers, a shilling, a fourpenny-piece, and sixpence—I had a penny-piece among my copper with the name "Pinning" branded on it—I had put it into the drawer the night before—the prisoner was asked how he came by that—he said he did not know—he knew where I kept my copper money—I found the drawer broken open, the parlour window-shutter open, the back door leading to the yard, and the front door leading to the court, were all open, when I came down—he must have got the steps from the back yard, and brought them round to the parlour window, where I found them in the morning—the top sash was shoved down, and he had got in at the top.</p>

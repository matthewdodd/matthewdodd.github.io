            . I am a driver to a stage waggon from London to Hertford. On the 22nd of November the prisoner, his wife, and child, I took up as passengers, and an empty box in Bishopgate-street, near the church to go to Hoddesdon, when I came to the Stones End I took up another passenger,

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, I am a journeyman carpenter, and was going on that day to see my relations with my wife and child, there were several other persons in the waggon all the way from town, and the waggoner's brother rode in the waggon part of the way; my box was only carried. I was so much agitated by the magistrates telling me he would send my wife to prison, and from the terror of that I should have confessed any thing whatever; the magistrate promised to liberate my wife. I am totally innocent, I had no knowledge of the articles being in the box, and have no doubt they were removed by some of the passengers out of mere frolic.</p>

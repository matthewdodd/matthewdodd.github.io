               <p>Prisoner. When I was at Worship-street he said I put them into my apron - I am a boot and shoemaker - I had an apron on. Witness. My evidence will prove to the contrary - I said he put them under his arm and ran away.</p>
               <p>PETER PIGE. I am owner of the shop. My attention was drawn to this circumstance on the 25th of May by the witness saying that a young man had taken something; I went out and saw a youth running - I followed him about three quarters of a mile, till I got to the Gibralter - I was then exhausted; a person asked what I was running for - I said "That fellow has stolen something" - he said"I will catch him for you;" I said thank you - when I came up I found the young man who offered to stop him standing over the prisoner; the prisoner was on the ground, and the young man said the prisoner had struck him in the eye - I took hold of the prisoner, he got up and kicked me in the groin; I still held him, he kicked me again; the people gathered round him; I got him down again, he got up and bit me through my coat and waistcoat to my breast, and fetched blood - a policeman came up and took him - I then heard that a pair of trousers had been thrown into a garden - I saw them, they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Directly he came up he threw me down on the ground; I never hit him at all, nor said a word to him- he kicked me. Witness. He kicked me first very violently, I acknowledge I afterwards struck him in my own defence.</p>

I saw the prosecutor in pursuit of the prisoner, he asked me to pursue him for him, which I did for about two hundred yards - I saw him throw something away over a garden, and these trousers were picked up there afterwards - when I got up to the prisoner he struck me in the face, and gave me a black eye; in the struggle I got him on the ground, he then kicked me in the face, and cut my eye.</p>

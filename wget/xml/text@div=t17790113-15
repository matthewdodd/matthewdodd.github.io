The tools being frequently lost, and having a suspicion of the prisoner, I and another witness contrived to open the prisoner's drawer, and marked two arbors, and put them in the drawer again. As the prisoner was going from me; I thought it proper to get a search warrant, and search his apartment. In a private drawer I found a number of things, among which were the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.)</p>
               <p>You find the workmen in tools? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not they frequently bring their own tools? - Not that I know of.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship street. On Wednesday night the 29th of October I was out on duty in Shoreditch. I saw the prisoner, I knew him well, I followed him from there to the tabernacle, there were two carriages standing within the tabernacle gates, the horses of both the carriages had cloths on; I saw the prisoner go up to one of the horses and take this cloth off. I immediately took him with it in his hand, when he had walked off about ten yards with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drover, living at 76, Wentworth Street—I saw the prisoner on the 4th October standing at the door of a public-house hold-ing up her fist at me—I merely walked indoors and she was abusing me at the door,<hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> me and calling me names—she went away for half an hour and came back again and said "Drover I want to speak to you"—I said</p>

               <p>"I don't want to speak to you," and she said "If you don't want to speak to me, take this," and some stuff went all over my face—she had it under her shawl in a half-quartern gin glass; the glass caught me in the chin and splashed upon my shirt and burnt my handkerchief—I ran in the yard to wash my face and looked in the glass and saw my face all blistered—I had not struck her—I was afterwards taken to the London Hospital and examined by a surgeon—I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I examined the prosecutor when he came there at about 9 o'clock on the evening in question and found a superficial burn in front and under his chin, and his linen and coat were much stained and corroded and burnt, appa<lb></lb>rently by some acid like sculpture acid—I judge partly from the colour of the stains.</p>

I was called by a man and saw the prosecutor who showed me his shirt, which was all black—it was pretty nearly all dry at that time—I went to the prisoner's residence and charged her with throwing something over the prosecutor's face—she was coming downstairs at the time—her husband was following her, and said "You have threatened to do it several times, and now you have done it", and with that he made a kick at her—I took her to the station, she told the inspector she had bought a pennyworth of vitriol, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought to the station by a person who did not attend at the police-court—the prisoner and her husband appeared not to be on good terms.</p>

               <p>I lost some money the 28th of August, in the morning, four guineas, two half-guineas, and seven shillings in silver, out of my pocket; I put my breeches underneath my pillow, and my breeches were taken from underneath my pillow, and the money taken out.</p>

               <p>How came they there? - I went with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Where did you meet with her? - At the Green-dragon in Bishopsgate-street; I was locked out of my lodgings, and I called there to get two penny-worth of gin and water, and this woman sat down with me, and persuaded me to go home with her.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Green-dragon? - Half an hour.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in bed? - Three hours.</p>
               <p>When you awoke was the prisoner there? - She was gone.</p>
               <p>How do you know you had it? - Because I felt for it in both my pockets before I laid my breeches under my head; the silver was loose in the right hand pocket, and the gold in a purse in the left; the prisoner saw me put it there, and nobody else; I took the prisoner the same evening at the same house, the Green-dragon; I found none of my money; she had other clothes on, and was very gay rigged out; I never got any of my money again; I was not in liquor, but I had been drinking.</p>
               <p>What did you drink at the Green-dragon? - Two penny-worth of gin and water?</p>
               <p>What a clock was it? - It was about one in the morning; we had been at the bean feast; it was on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Was you sober enough to take upon yourself to say upon your oath that you had this money in your pocket at the time you went to bed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I never saw the gentleman till he took me as a prisoner; he took another young woman first.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure that is the girl.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A carpenter.</p>

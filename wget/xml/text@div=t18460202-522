                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I came from Oxford—I was lodg<lb></lb>ing at the Cross Keys, Gracechurch-street. On the 15th of Jan. I saw the prisoner there—I knew him before—I went with him to the Shades, and when we were coming from there, he said he had not any money, and if I would pay for his lodging and what he had to drink, he would pay me in the morning—I paid for a pint of beer, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a bed for him—I had half-a<lb></lb>crown and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides—the half-crown was in my trowser's pocket—when I went to bed I laid my trowsers on a chair by the bedside—I got into bed, and saw the prisoner take a chair and sit down by the table—he afterwards came to bed—I did not hear him get out of bed, but in the morning he was tearing some paper, and it awoke me—he was very nearly dressed—I asked if he was getting up—he said, "Yes, I am only going down stairs; I shall be up in a minute or two"—he said, "It is moon-light, it is not time to get</p>

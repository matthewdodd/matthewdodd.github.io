On the 23rd of November, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, she came in and requested to be shown some silks, which I showed her - she purchased two yards, eight or nine yards of merino, and two or three of calico, which came to about 14s.; there were other articles on the counter - the shop was crowded with customers; while I was showing the silks I saw her putting something under her cloak - I then noticed her more particularly, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090016"></xptr>communicated my suspicions to Mr. Roope; after cutting off the silk I requested her to step to the other side of the counter to look at the merino, and observed the end of some silk laying on the ground; it was not off the same piece as she had bought - I drew it to me, and found it had no communication with the counter, and as such the roll must be under her cloak; she passed to the other side of the counter to look at the merinos - I did not disturb her till she had bought the other things; I then sent another young man round to see if he could see the end of it on the ground - he saw the end of it on the floor and took hold of it; he pulled it, and she was holding the roll under her cloak - he said, "What is this?" she seemed conscience struck that she had been doing wrong; she said nothing - we took her up stairs to the parlour; she held the piece of silk all the while; another young man went for an officer, and in the parlour she offered to pay the value of the silk if we would not send for an officer - the officer came, and she was taken into custody with the silk; she had not got the things she had bought under her cloak - she had them in a parcel; we estimate the silk at fifty yards, at 3s. a yard - it would contain about fifty-seven yards; it is worth 7l. at least, and belongs to Mr.

               <p>Q. Did she not say she got the silk from a person whom she named, to make up into cloaks? A. Yes, or other articles - I forget which; the name was something like Berkinson - I did not state this because it was not necessary, as I am positive the silk is ours; we have a private mark on it - I put my name on it after it was found, but do not recollect putting a private mark after it was found; I will not swear I did not, but swear there was a private mark on it before - the selling mark was on it before she took it I am sure; I think somebody at the office told me it was necessary to put my name or some mark on it - I put my name, but cannot recollect whether I put a mark; I did not go up stairs with the prisoner myself - there is nobody here who heard her say she would pay for it; she made the offer to my master, but not in my presence - she is a dress-maker; seven people were serving in our shop.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was fetched to the shop between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner up stairs with Mr. Roope- this piece of silk laid on the table before them, when I went into the room; the prisoner said she did not take the silk in the act of stealing, and begged Mr. Roope not to give her into custody - I took her, and in the way to the watch-house she said she got it from another young man who was at a shop at Knightsbridge; she did not know whether he was at Knightsbridge now, or in some part of Holborn - she mentioned his name, but I cannot recollect it; I told her I would go to Holborn to inquire after him at every shop there - she then said he might be in some part of the City; she said she had it that afternoon from him - she did not say he kept a shop, but that she often made up things for him; I asked if she had any thing in her house then, to see if she could find him out by - she said not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not say she was to make it into cloaks? A. Not in my presence till she got to Queen-square - the name was Berkinstall; I went to her lodging, found she was a dress-maker, and found pieces of silk there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did she live? A. At Walhamgreen, three or four miles from the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I saw this silk before she came into the shop - it laid on the counter before she came in; here is the private mark - three strokes stand for 3s., the cost price, and "fawn brown gros de Naples vg - t," which is 3s. 6d., the selling price; that is in the hand-writing of James Davie, who manages our silk department, and here is "Miss Townsend" written on it in pencil in his hand-writing - she wanted a match; I positively swear it belongs to my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate it laid on the counter before she came in? A. Yes - I do not recollect when I saw it last, but know I had seen it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you tell the Magistrate you had seen it on the counter before she came in? A. I did not - I was asked when I had seen it last, and did not recollect, but I since recollect seeing it on the counter; I believe I said I might have seen it that day or two days before - I have talked this over with the other shopmen, but it is not from what they said that I now swear I saw it before.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Do you swear you yourself observed the private mark on it before the prisoner was apprehended? A. I do - I had seen the silk so often with the mark on it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came you not to be able to tell the Magistrate it was on the counter? A. I did not recollect it so well then, but on the young men explaining to me, I now recollect perfectly well seeing it - I did not like to give rash evidence, and said I had seen it within two or three days; I thought that better than to particularize any time - I did not then recollect seeing it on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Winkfield, a hair manufac<lb></lb>turer in the Southwark-road. On the 5th of October I saw a person very much like the prisoner, come out of an iron-shop with a heavy bulk, which was put into a cart—I spoke to Morris, and we followed the cart to Petti<lb></lb>coat-lane—I there spoke to a policeman, who stopped it, and found it was curled hair—my master had lost such, and about the same quantity—there were eight pieces more lost—the carman, Dix, was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn and coal-dealer, and keep a horse and cart. On the 5th of October, about ten o'clock, the prisoner came and asked if I could do a little job with a horse and cart—I said I thought I could—he said, "You must come directly to Mr. Jones, in the Mint, I want you to take some goods to my house in Petticoat-lane"—I went, and got there at half-past ten o'clock by my watch—the prisoner pointed out two bales of goods which were in Mr. Jones's house—one of them was put into the cart, the other was very heavy—the prisoner was not able to assist me with that, and a person lent us a hand—the prisoner told me to go as quickly as I could to his house in Petticoat-lane, and he would be there as soon as I was—I went, and found him standing on the pavement—there was a scavenger's cart, and the prisoner said he did not think I could get by—I said I could if he would take the horse's head and turn it—I got out of my cart to lay hold of my horse's head—the officer then took me, and said I had stolen property in the cart—I said I was not aware of it, but there was the man who hired me—the officer said, "Where?"—I looked, and could not find the prisoner—I said, "He lives in here"—we went into the house—a person said he was gone up stairs, and another said he was gone down the street—I looked, and saw the prisoner walking about twenty yards from the house—I said to the policeman, "That is the man yonder, follow me, and I will soon catch him"—I ran and caught him—I said, "You have got me into trouble, you have got stolen property put into my cart"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "Never mind, come with me"—I turned him round, and the policeman took charge of him, and told me I must follow him to the station-house—I got into my cart and followed him with the hair—this is part of it.</p>

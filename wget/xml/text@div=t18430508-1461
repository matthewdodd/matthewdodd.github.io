               <p>Belli about ten francs, which ended in a scuffle between the two—I pushed Belli away from him, and then I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutor with a knife many times—if I had not interfered the man would have been killed—the prisoner cut me with the knife in the squabble—the prosecutor had no knife—after they were parted, and after the blows were struck, the prisoner said, "I will give you some more, if you want anything, if you have not had enough"—the prosecutor gave the prisoner no provocation before he struck him—he had not done or said anything to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prosecutor's wounds, I suppose, were common incised wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were—he was at the hospital eight days—I have not examined him since—the wounds all healed by the first intention, with<lb></lb>out much inflammation—if there was a struggle between two men, one being</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas Dutton Templar Sparrow, of Stamford-street, Blackfriars. On the 3rd of May, about eight o'clock in the morning, I put a child's chair outside for sale—I missed it in about an hour—Hockaday came to me and I told him—thii is the chair.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 178.) On Monday, the 5th of May, I received information, and went to the prisoner's house, in Ken<lb></lb>nington-lane—he is a general dealer—amongst other things there I found this child's chair, which was claimed by Mr. Dutton—the prisoner said he bought it of two lads for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he did not know who they were—I also found this apron, dog-collar, and milk-can, which have been claimed.</p>

               <p>they stole it—I did not see them steal it—I went to the prisoner's house on Monday, the 5th of May—I preferred the charge on the 6th—I should say depositions were taken then—he was examined and re<lb></lb>manded—I did not see Gallevant on the 5th, nor on the 6th—on my oath I did not see him on the 5th—I understood, from his own words, that on the 5th he was lodging in the Mint—I saw him on the 22nd—it was a female who told me about the chair, but I do not know where she lived—I took Davison on the 10th, I think, and I went again before the Magistrate on the prisoner's case on the Tuesday following the 10th—Davison was tried in this Court and convicted—the depositions in the prisoner's case had been taken—there were several remands—I do not know where Gallevant was all that time—I never saw him between the 5th and the 22nd—I then had some conversation with him, and he was brought forward as a witness the day following—he was in custody for stealing a truck—I went to the prosecutor in this case, and told him the whole circumstance—I told him where Gallevant had been lodging, and I bid no doubt I should be able to get him—I knew his address, because I had inquired.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the gentleman tell you that your conduct was so infamous that he would report you to the Commissioners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because he had seen the prisoner, and heard statements from him which I do not know he did not say that I had been making observations to him, that he intended to bring my conduct before the Commissioners, and he would not prosecute with such a case, because no Jury would believe me—he said he would not prosecute Gallevant, lest both parties should escape punishment—he did not say he would not prosecute this case—I did not understand him to say he would report my conduct to the Commissioners.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not said that he did say he would report you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not understand your question—this chair was on a bench in a room ad<lb></lb>joining the prisoner's shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mint-street, in the Borough. On Mon<lb></lb>day, the 5th of May, I was coming down Stamford-street—I saw a young lad that I used to call Jem take a chair from a shop in Stamford-street—I went and asked what he was going to do with it—he said, going to sell it, and if I would go with him I should have half the money—I went, and we took it to the prisoner's, in Kennington-lane—I had been there before, and knew the prisoner by sight—I asked him if he would buy a chair—he said he would—Jem is a little taller than I am—I cannot say his age—I called him in—the prisoner looked at the chair, and asked what we wanted for it—Jem said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner said he would give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then he said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and gave me one—the prisoner then said, was any one watching us, did any one see us take it away—we said, "No, there was not"—he told us, for fear any one migbt see us, to go into a little back parlour—we did so, and he paid us for it there.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 26, Clarendon Road, Bayswater, with a person named Chile—the prisoner acknowledged she was the mother of the deceased—she lived in the same house with me, in a room over me—I have known her three or four years—the child was born on the 5th April last—he was four months old—the prisoner if not married—a man named William Ware was its reputed father—I saw no change in it the first two months, but the two months prior to death—I saw it before it was taken by the mother to Dr. Lyle—when he saw it he said, after feeling its pulse, "Take it away, I will have nothing at all to do with it, take it to some other medical man"—the mother used to leave it at 10 o'clock, and not attend to it till the next morning, and it would scream and cry all that time—I used to feed it myself for the first two months, but not after—it was neglected in its food, and fed from a very dirty bottle—the mother lived on what she could get—the doctor gave me a powder, which I gave it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Clarendon Street, and am a single woman—I have known the prisoner for eighteen months—I saw the baby a week before it died—it was in my place the whole of the week with the mother—she stayed in my place throughout the day, to have her food with me—she never fed the child as she ought to have done—she made its food out of a dirty bottle—one morning I saw it drawing the dirty water from it, sour milk, and I cleaned the bottle, and the child drank very hearty—then she came in I showed her the curds in the bottle—I told her that she did not feed it properly, and so did a young man—she never answered—I changed the child—it made me reach, it had such a dirty napkin on—the child was strong some time before this, and was a nice little fellow.</p>

I live in the same house as the prisoner—I am a horse-keeper, out of work, in consequence of a rupture, and in the work-house through it—while there the prisoner was confined in the workhouse—I saw the child after she came out; it was a fine boy—it was called "The champion of the ward"—I have seen my wife feeding the child—I have observed a lot of black curd at the bottom of the bottle, and my wife often cleansed it—it was very sour and not clean—the prisoner left the child every night till morning—she had means to support it—she drank, and was locked up, and the child fetched to the mother by the police—I saw</p>

               <p>a kind of finger mark under the eyes, which the prisoner said the father had done—I saw the neck of the child, it waft like anything withering away—it seemed to be no bigger round than my finger—I spoke to the mother several times, and said "Mary, you will get into trouble some of these days," and she never took any notice of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered physician, practising at 2, Marlborough Terrace—I was consulted on the 13th of August, at 9 o'clock in the morning, by the mother—I examined the child carefully; it was hopeless, and past all remedy—she said it had not been seen by a doctor before—it appeared to be ill nourished—there were sore marks on the bottom, but not to any groat extent—I found the brain healthy, the other organs also—there was no disease to lay hold of and say it was the came of death—this was six days after the death—we could not make that exami<lb></lb>nation we wished of its bowels, as they were broken to pieces by decay—the glands were slightly enlarged, but not sufficient to say that that was the cause of death—there was also a slight wasting—it had not had suffi<lb></lb>cient food, and what it had had was not of the right kind—the digestive organs were not in a good condition.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I took the child to Dr. Phelps, and he told me to come again in the morning. It had the whooping cough. I went home, and it died about 12 o'clock at night. I had a person to look after it while it was ill. I was not rich, and I gave it what I could afford.</p>

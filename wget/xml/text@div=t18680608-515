I paid the money away, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Parker, of Collebore Villas, Denmark Grote, Peckham, secretary to the Metropolitan Water Supply Company. No cash, and no property but my stock.")—After the adjudication, one of our men went to the defendant's house and took possession; that was on the 27th—on the 29th I got a search warrant, and, in consequence of information, Went to No. 30, Heygate Street, Walworth Road, where I found a quantity of stock and furniture—the defendant said he had removed it from his place; that he had been badly advised, and he wanted to make a clean breast of it—he assisted me in the execution of the search warrant.</p>

               <p>the money—he hesitated, and said that he did not owe the money, or words to that effect—I then pressed him, and said, "Have you given up all your property to the messenger or creditors?"—he said, "I suppose I may as well tell the truth (looking at Mr. Croft); I have not done so"—he was further pressed, and he said that he had made this bill of sale to Mr. Lewis, and that the furniture had been removed, all excepting about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—he also said that part of the stock had been removed at the same time—I understood from him that there had been no consideration for the bill of sale—upon that information we applied for a search warrant, which was granted—he said he had been badly advised—I asked him who drew up the bill of sale, and he said, "Mr. Stanley, a solicitor"—he also referred to Mr. Parker, who was secretary to some water supply association.</p>

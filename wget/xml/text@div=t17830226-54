I turned my back upon him every time I shewed him these goods, and the last goods I took down to shew him, he took a hat out of the window, and opened the shop door and went out, he bought nothing. I missed the hat immediately and followed him out; I returned again, having nobody in the shop, and fearing left he should have an accomplice, and the prisoner got clear off; I found the hat at Mr. Wood's in Old-street, the man that was in the shop gave the hat to another that was in the passage; this is not the man that was in the shop.</p>
               <p>(The hat deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any other man in the passage at the time or not? - My shop having many candles in it, and the passage<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260087"></xptr> dark, I could not distinguish whether there was or not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going to my mother's, a man met with me, and asked me to buy a hat, he asked 3 s. I bid him half a crown, I gave him 3 s. and I was going to receive my wages, and I went immediately and pawned it for 2 s.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner is indicted for stealing a hat; the evidence against him is rather that of receiving it from somebody who did steal it, than stealing it himself; for unless you can go the length of inferring, that he was the person in the passage who took the hat immediately from the man in the shop, it is impossible to convict him of stealing it: It would be going a great deal too far to guess that he was the man in the passage, and we can do no more.</p>

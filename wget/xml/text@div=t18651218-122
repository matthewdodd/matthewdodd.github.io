                  </hi>. I am under-bailiff to the Edmonton County Court—I produce a plaint note—(<hi rend="italic">This was in the cause of Reed v. Judd, for Il. debt, and </hi>1 <hi rend="italic">s. costs, for damages to a donkey-cart caused by the plaintiffs careless driving</hi>)—I was present on 7th December when the case was tried, and law the prisoner sworn—the oath was administered by Mr. Geofrey, the acting high-bailiff—the prisoner swore that he was with Judd in the cart at the time of the alleged accident, which he said was on the 13th December, 1864.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the case come on to be heard on 21th November in the first instance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was partly heard before Mr. French, the Deputy Judge of the Court—Berry was examined on that occasion, and the present prosecutor was the plaintiff—the date of the accident was not men<lb></lb>tioned on that occasion by the defendant and his witnesses, that I am aware of, but it was mentioned by the plaintiff to be the 3d—the case was ad<lb></lb>journed for further evidence—it came on again on 7th December, before Mr. Gurdon, the Judge of the Court—the clerk keeps minutes, and this is headed "Adjourned cases", and I know it was adjourned because I was in Court and heard it adjourned—the clerk has some minute from which he can answer to the feet of adjournment—he is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to represent that Berry swore that he was present at any accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He swore that there was no accident—I was not present all the time of the first examination, but at the second I was present all the time Berry was being examined—he swore that when he was with the cart with Judd, no accident happened to the donkey-cart—he stated that the donkey turned out of the road, and came in contact, with the horse, therefore, of course, there must have been an accident—he swore that there was no accident when he was present in the cart, and that that was on the 13th; but he said that the donkey came round into the road, and came in contact with Judd's hone, and that that happened on the 13th—the examination lasted, I should think, four hours—that is all I recollect which I think material.</p>

                  </hi>. On 3d December I went to Ponders-end with a donkey-cart—I was in South-street at 5 o'clock, and my cart was standing with one wheel in the gutter, on the left-hand side of the road—that would be my right side if I was travelling—while I was at the door of a house I heard another cart coming along—I heard a crash, and found a horse and cart</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180053"></xptr>
               <p>against my donkey-cart—the wheel was behind my wheel—a man, whose name I found was Judd, was in the cart, and some females, but no man but Judd—I know the defendant—he was not in the cart—he was not there at all—I brought an action in the county court against Judd—the second hearing was on 2d December, and on 7th December, the last time the case was tried, I saw the defendant there—I saw him sworn—he declared that he and Judd were present at the affair, and no one else—he was taxed very closely by the Judge, but he could not say where he was in the cart—the Judge said, "I cannot make it out where you sat; did you sit in Judd's lap?—he could give no accoun what part of the cart he sat in—he made out that he saw nothing; that nothing took place—I think he said that the cart he was in did not come within a yard of my cart—at the second hearing he declared that it took place on 13th December—I say that it took place on 3d December, 1864—I was not at Ponders-end at all on the 13th, and did not see Judd, or his horse and cart—there was more said at the last hear<lb></lb>ing, but it was such a rambling story that I cannot tell you—I know that the accident took place on 3d December, because it is my rule to go there once a month, on Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>.

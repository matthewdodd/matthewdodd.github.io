                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live in Fenchurch-street. On 18th Feb. the prisoner was in my tap room, from 8 till 10 o'clock—I went into the tap room about 10 o'clock, and he was gone—I went to bed about 10 minutes before 12 o'clock—I and my wife were the last persons up—all the doors and windows were then safe, we looked round the house—about 10 minutes to 1 o'clock, when I came down, I found the place in a grest state of confusion—a pair of steps, which had been in the passage, had been erected and so placed that they could get at a pane of glass, by which means they could get into the bar—I unlocked the bar door, went in, and found it in a great state of confusion—the till was empty, and some silver, which had been in the bar, was taken away—I lost also some spirit stamps—I called in the police—I found the front door of the house open—I am sure the front door was closed when I went to bed—the police came, and we searched the house—I found a pair of boots on the parlour table, and a stick—the name of John Walker was written in the boots.</p>

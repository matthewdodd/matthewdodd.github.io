I took notice of the man the moment he rushed upon me, and I knew him the moment I saw him in custody, by his size and by his dress: he was dressed in a dark coat, light waistcoat and breeches. It was moon-light. I swear to his size and dress. I can swear to his being the man. I know his features very well, but not to positively swear. The watch I have got in my pocket, I never saw the chain again.</p>

            . I am a hackney coachman. On the 16th of August about half after eleven at night. I heard the cry of stop thief, about ten yards from the corner of Jerusalem-court. I saw a man running. I called to the watchman. I struck the man that was running with my umbrella over the breast to stop him; I pushed him against the watchman, they both fell together. I made an attempt to lay hold of him. He ran away. I followed him, he was never out of my sight. He was stopped by a person in Hooper-street; I then got hold of him. I am sure it was the prisoner, the mark was on his breast. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Bagnall, the last witness - A. Yes, immediately he was stopped Mr. Bagnall came up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bagnall. You immediately went up it seems, when this man was taken - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man that was taken the same man that took your chain and seals - A. I believe him upon my oath to be the man, there was no other person in the court when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. What interval of time was there between the time this chain and seals were taken from you, and the time you saw him in custody of the hackney coachman - A. I should suppose not above a minute, I ran after him.</p>

            . On the 16th of August, about half past eleven at night, I was taking my supper in the house, I heard the watchman spring a rattle; I went to my door; in a minute the prisoner came running down the court, and the coachman after him. He holloed out to me, that is him, stop him. I immediately ran across the way, and seized him by the collar.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman was very much intoxicated in liquor, and when I was taken as a prisoner he did not know who to say it was.</p>

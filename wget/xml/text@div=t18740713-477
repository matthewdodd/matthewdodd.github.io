I am the prisoner's wife—on the night of 7th July, about 10.45 I was in the passage leading from the street, in the dark going towards the stairs—I felt my husband take me by the head and pull it back—he was standing against the wall—I thought he was going to kiss me—in putting up my hand I felt that I was bleeding at the throat, not much—I did not feel any cut, I was so excited—I screamed "Murder!" and felt—I felt faint and do not recollect anything "afterwards—I did not see or feel any instrument—we always lived happily until last Christmas—he has been a good father to his children and a good husband to me as far as his means would let him, until this delusion of jealousy took place—he was jealous of a young man who lodged with us, and who left in January or February, and my husband believes that this young man comes to see me when he is away at work at night; he is a journeyman baker—I never gave him any cause for jealousy—the young man never interfered with me, and</p>

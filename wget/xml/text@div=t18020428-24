             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness: On the 10th of March I saw the prisoner come into our shop, as any person would who was coming about business, and in a minute or two he came out with a caddy under his right arm, and walked away the length of two houses, then he began to run; I went into the shop, he had not shut the door; I gave the alarm, he was followed and brought back in less than an hour.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HOBBS sworn. - I was where Mr. Booth was at work, Mrs. Booth gave the alarm that a man had taken a caddy; I ran out immediately, I saw a man with a caddy under his arm, there were three together, one of them ran one way and the other two ran the other; I saw the man throw the caddy over an area, he was pursued and taken in Pentonville-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man? - A. The man that had the caddy I believe to be the prisoner at the bar; I cannot be positive.</p>

               <p>Booth. This is my caddy.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Booth.) How long before the prisoner was brought back had you seen the caddy? - A. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man? - A. I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I solemnly declare I was never in the house till I was a prisoner; I was taken near a mile from the place; a man was pursued, who 
               <persName id="t18020428-24-person221">drew</persName>
             a knife and swore, if they attempted to take him, he would stick it into them; they then let him go and seized me; half the people that took me have been kept back, because they should not give evidence in this Court.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            ; I hired the prisoner to nurse me; the buckles were in my drawer; I did not went them in common; I missed them just after the prisoner was gone; she had a box in the garret, and she was always going backwards and forwards for five or six years; she was an old acquaintance: I saw my buckles at the pawnbrokers; the prisoner confessed that they were mine; (the buckles produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>- Conyer. I am a pawn-broker; the prisoner pawned these buckles with me on the sixteenth of last April; I lent her half a guinea upon them; I am sure she is the person that pawned them; I have known her and her husband for two years.</p>
               <p>Q. From prisoner. When were the buckles first brought to you to pawn.</p>
               <p>Conyer. I don't know; there was a pair like these brought before; I don't know whether they are the same; she brought them and had them out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring any in a short time before this sixteenth of April.</p>
               <p>Conyer. She brought another pair, on which she had half a guinea; she brought them a little before these, and had them out again; she came often to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. To prosecutrix. How long before the prisoner came to nurse you did you see them.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lambe. The Sunday before I was in mourning, and did not wear them; she had not quite left me when I missed them; she came in and out; I did not suspect her then; there were many other people in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never sell or pawn the buckles yourself.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lambe. No; that I did not.</p>

               <p>parcels in his hand—he remained in the passage four or five minutes, and the private door was opened—Mr. Wallons came into the shop at last, and received the two parcels—Bruneau then remained about four or five minutes, and then left without the parcels—I did not see him give Mr. Wallons the two parcels, but I saw them in Mr. Wallons' hand—I had seen Pettit and Bruneau also meet on four or five previous occasions, but not Crochevoix; and on each of those occasions parcels were given to Bruneau—this always took place at a few minutes after 1 in the day—after taking the prisoners to the station, I went to Mr. Wallons' shop, having first been to Mr. Laing—Mr. Laing went with me—I saw Wallons—there was some silk lying on the counter, which Mr. Laing identified—there were also some preservers, and three or four different articles which I do not know the names of, but they are here—I did not find anything else besides those—the whole of the property I brought from Wallons was shown to Pettit next morning, and he spoke to Mr. Laing about it in French, which I do not understand—I afterwards showed Bruneau the light-coloured silk which I brought from Wallons—I told him that Pettit had said he bad taken that from his master's stock, and gave it to him to take to Mr. Wallons'—he said, "Yes; that is quite right, I did so—he spoke English pretty well, and understood what I said—I asked him what Mr. Wallons had given—he said, "I cannot say; what he gave me I gave to Pettit"—Wallons also produced to me eight dozen catheters, and a piece of oil-silk—I showed them to Mr. Laing and to the prisoners.</p>

WILLIAMS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the policeman says that on one occasion Bruneau came to your side private-door, and you came down, and he afterwards saw a parcel resembling one that Bruneau had brought min your hands, it is not true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is positively not true—he may have made a mistake—the gentleman who was with me in the shop was between me and the door, and was striding about to show me his artificial leg—he may have been very near the door, which is a plate-glass one, and the policeman may have mistaken him—this was at 1 o'clock, and the parcel did not come into my hands till the evening—the catheters I bought were about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross—I have bought the same things at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when workmen are hard up, and the things are not wanted, we can get them for almost what we like—our men are mostly garret-men, and they will come and sell them at any price—I sometimes buy things for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which are worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prosecutor came to me and saw some oil-silk which I purchased of Bruneau—the first time he came he said it was not his, and he would give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I could show that it had ever been in his place—he came to me a second time, and said he was always engaged at the desk and counting-house, and really did not know what was at his place, for things came in and went out without his seeing them—he stated, in point of fact, that he could not identify the silk—these catheters are not at all different from others that are sold in the trade by hundreds—I could not swear to them—when he came with the constable to identify the goods he picked out one article which I had never Purchased of Bruneau, but had on my stock two years, and some which I had had more than that, and had made on my own premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a native of France, carrying on business in this country at Skinner-street, as a surgical-instrument maker and manufacturer of webbing and elastic things—I have looked at these goods (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Wallons'—to the best of my belief they are mine; I am quite certain</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186303020095"></xptr>
               <p>as to some of them—we have missed goods from my place for about two years, I should say—I have missed goods of this description during the last few weeks before the prisoners were given in custody—Pettit had access to everything in my establishment—he used to correspond and keep the French books in my warehouse; in fact, he had more privileges than any one in my establishment—he was manager—the dinner-time at my place was between 1 and 2 o'clock—he could get out without its being noticed what he took away—I remember some pieces of silk, which were brought from Wallons, being shown to Pettit by the officer—I spoke to Pettit in French about them—I asked why he had taken the thing which were before him—he said, in French, "Yes; I did take it"—I then asked him about this other coloured silk—he did not say at first that he had taken it, but acknowledged afterwards that it was from my place—I did not hear the other prisoners say anything about those things—they merely said that they had the goods from Pettit when I asked them—I have seen Bruneau before—he was introduced to me by my man—it might be a dozen times that I have seen him there with Pettit—I have not seen them go out together, but I have seen him come in and ask for Pettit to come out, that he wanted to speak to him for a few minutes, and Pettit asked my leave to go out with him, to which I assented—Pettit once told me that a friend of his had some goods to dispose of—I said, "I will not buy them because it is not in my business, but I will lend your friend 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on those goods"—then they wanted 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods—I lent Bruneau some money on them at the instance of Pettit—Brunean had the means of knowing the sort of things I dealt in—the catheters which I first saw I reckoned to be worth 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross, but what I have since seen I reckon to be worth 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross—I could not get them at 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now if I wanted them—I should like to be able to get them at 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are some which have been sold for a shilling a dozen, but which cost me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the value of the light silk is about from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the piece.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you to say these catheters are worth about 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they belong to me—I have not looked at every one of them—I am prepared to swear that every one of them is mine, because they have been supplied to me from two or three manufacturers tare in town—they do not make for me alone; they supply plenty other houses with the same goods—Mr. Wallons has not been in the habit of buying goods from those manufacturers within the last twelve or eighteen months—these have been taken from my warehouse and sold—I have missed them every day for this last two years, at least I find it out now; I did not have the suspicion before—I will not swear to these catheters now—I never bought anything through either of these men but French stamps; I have done that for the purpose of making money—they came to me and wanted to turn them into money, and I gave them five per cent, under the value they are in France; that is, French stamps that cost 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in France, I have bought here for 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my trade is that of a surgical-instrument maker—I would carry on anything that is honest and respectable—I sell a great many of the articles contained in this blue paper—we supply a good many wholesale houses with them—we do not supply them to Holy well-street—I can give you the list, from my books, of the houses we supply—I do a large trade in them—they come under my deno<lb></lb>mination as a surgical-instrument maker—all the surgical-instrument makers keep them, and the wholesale and retail druggists keep them—I do not know anything of their dealing in Prints; I have never sold any prints—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186303020096"></xptr>
               <p>have never, to my knowledge, been in the habit of exchanging prints for other goods—I have not dealt, traded in, bartered with, or exchanged any im<lb></lb>modest prints—I will swear that no immodest prints have ever been sold by me—about two or three months ago, a Spanish gentleman called and asked to buy some things used for surgical purposes—if you want to know what they are, I will give them you on paper—I was told that the authorities had stopped those few things in Boulogne—I know Messrs. Flageolot, a very res<lb></lb>pectable firm—I have been in the habit of consigning goods to them within this last five or six years—I was not present when the authorities stopped any goods, of a certain nature, consigned to them by me—I do not know whether they have done so; I was not there; I never sent anything—I do not interfere much in the business—the goods I send are Indiarubber goods, nothing but what are made in England to ship to my house in France, elastic stockings, catheters, and surgical instruments; nothing but instruments, except the one article which you allude to—I cannot mention the name of it; they are described as skin-preservers—I never sent them away myself—I happened to be out of town the very week they went away—when I saw the oil-silk, which I say is mine, I did not identify it at the first moment—I said, "I believe it does not belong to me"—I said nothing to Pettit about taking things to Mr. Wallons', except what I have stated—I asked him why he had taken those things of me—he said he felt very sorry indeed, and he scarcely looked at my face when he saw me—I never saw Wallons at all before Pettit was taken in custody—he used to supply him from my shop when he came in there—I have not asked him why he supplied goods to Woollums, who is my greatest enemy—I did not object to his selling those goods—he was obliged to sell them—I have never said, that if he would swear that the articles found at Wallons' were my property, I would handsomely reward him, and get him discharged; I took very good care not to say anything of the kind—I have not myself had an interview with Pettit's wife since he has been in prison—I said to my brother, "This woman is a very unfor<lb></lb>tunate woman; I do not believe she is guilty of this affair; give her work if you possibly can"—that is all I have done—I have sent no message to her about her husband—I have not sent a message to Pettit, while in prison, through anybody—he is a Frenchman; his name ought to be spelt differently to what it is—I daresay he speaks English a little; he always spoke French to me—he has been in my employment some time—he does not speak English, but I daresay he can make himself understood—he speaks very little English—I have known him more than four years.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bruneau's Defence.</hi> Pettit gave me two pieces of green silk for sale; I asked him if they belonged to him; he said, "Yes;" and I sold them at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the catheters at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a few pence, and I gave him all the money.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell Office: On the 19th of July I received information by Mrs. Hunt, that her neighbour had been robbed of a great deal of wet linen, and that she suspected the person right over the workhouse yard; I went into Mrs. Conner's house, No. 3, Indian-garden, St. George's in the East, and there I found her a-bed, about eleven o'clock in the morning; Mews lives over head in the one pair of stairs room, in the same house, and there I saw, in Mews's room, a quantity of wet linen and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180089"></xptr>stockings; I afterwards went into the garret, and there I saw the bed strewed all over with wet stockings, besides a large quantity of things on the line.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that garret belong to? - A. To Mrs. Conner; I went back into the yard; I found lines tied up there; there were three wet sheets; I then went up the one pair of stairs again, and looked out of the landing-place window into Union-street, where I received information that the property was stolen from, right across the workhouse yard: I then called out to Mrs. Hunt (seeing partly the garden from where the property was taken), for her to come and see whether any of the wet linen belonged to any of the persons she knew; she came and spoke to some of the property; I then came down to Mrs. Conner, and told her she must get up; I asked her who the garret belonged to; she said the person was gone out ever since Monday; I asked her whether she took in washing, she said a little; I told her there was a great deal of wet linen, she said there was no doubt but it was all her's; I and Mr. Rogers took her and the property to the Office, and there were other people came and spoke to the property; Mrs. Mews was taken into custody two or three days afterwards; there was a waistcoat found in her room.</p>
               <p>Q. What property was found in Conner's room belonging to Mrs. Rumford? - A. Six check cotton shirts, and, I believe, fourteen pair of stockings, one single one, and two frocks; that was all, I believe, that was found in her room, the rest of the wet linen belonged to other neighbours; this waistcoat was found in Mews's room, Mrs. Hunt swears to that.</p>
               <p>Conner. (To Brown,) Q. Did you find any thing in my room where I sleep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Conner. I know nothing of the transaction whatever.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where were the shirts found? - A. In the garret.</p>
               <p>Conner. He might find them there, but I do not know any more than the child unborn; this place I let out to endeavour to pay my rent; as to my part, I get my living by hard labour.</p>
               <p>Conner. (To Rogers.) Q. Did you ever know any thing amiss of me than getting my living by hard labour? - A. You bear a very indifferent character.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you accuse Mrs. Conner and Mews of it? - A. By a stocking being dropped in the workhouse yard, which is the direct road to Mrs. Conner's; as they carried them along they dropped a stocking; the other stocking was found in Mews's room.

                  </hi>. I was formerly inspector of police, and am now engaged by the Mint—in consequence of information I received I went, on 6th March, to 4, Caroline-place, Whitechapel, at 7 o'clock in the morning, accom<lb></lb>panied by Inspectors Fife, Broad, Bryant, and several other officers—the street door was open—I proceeded up stairs; the room door was partially open—I entered, and saw Warner partly sitting on the bed, and Haydon lying on the bed, endeavouring to undress herself—(I had heard a rustling noise as I ascended the stairs)—on the table, which stood near a clear bright fire, I found this plaster of Paris mould (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for making shillings, which was quite hot, and this tea-cup, containing fifty-six shillings in an un<lb></lb>finished state, some so hot that I could not hold them—I found this ladle near the fire, containing a small portion of metal quite hot, and two <hi rend="italic">gets</hi> quite warm; also some white sand, plaster of Paris, and all the implements of coining—there was no battery; they have got into the habit of electro<lb></lb>plating with the assistance of a wire only, which is also produced—here is a pad for holding the mould when hot—I said to Haydon, "Where is <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>?"—</p>

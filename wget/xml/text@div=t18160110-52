I put my breeches under my pillow when I went to bed; I am sure the money was safe. When I awoke, at about seven o'clock in the morning, I found my breeches nearly on the outside of the bed; I searched for my property, but when I took up my breeches, I missed the silver directly, by the weight. I felt after the bank notes when I missed the silver, and missed them also. When I missed my property, I went and called the girl, and awakened the landlord, and alarmed the house. The landlord went and fetched the officers.</p>
               <p>JAMES JOHN SMITH. I am an officer of Bow-street. I was sent for to the Northumberland Arms, on the 5th of this month. A brother officer named Ruthwin, went with me. I went up into the prosecutor's room first; I did not disturb any of the lodgers until I had searched his room; I found nothing in it, and then searched the room of the prisoner, which was immediately opposite; I knocked two or three times. The prisoner opened it, but had nothing on, but his shirt; he was very agreeable to my searching his room, saying he had been robbed himself. The first thing I saw on the table was a yellow canvass bag, and a shilling, and a sixpence by it. I asked him was it his; he said, yes, and that he received that one shilling and sixpence from the landlord in change the night before. I found a shilling and two sixpences in his waistcoat pocket; I then looked over his bed and about the room. The prisoner then said, as he had been robbed, he hoped the thief might be found out, and he followed me into the different rooms, and seemed desirious to find the thief. We went down stairs,and searched another room; he was not quite dressed, and I told him I did not want him to follow me about. I went up stairs again, and not being satisfied with the search I had made in his room; when I entered the room he was dressed; I missed the bag that had been laying on the table. I asked him where it was, and he denied all knowledge of it, and denied its having been there. I looked round the room, and then took off the bed clothes one by one. On the bed being pulled down from the mattrass, in the middle of the mattrass I saw four eighteen-penny pieces, a shilling, and a sixpence. I then told Ruthwin to go into the different rooms into which the prisoner had followed us, in hopes that he might find the bag, suspecting that the prisoner might have thrown it away, and I saw Ruthwin go over to the fire place in which the prosecutor slept, and pick it up from the fire place, saying, here it lies. I then ordered the prisoner to strip; he stripped to his shirt; I found nothing in his clothes. He sat down on the chair, and I unbuttoned his shirt collar; under his shirt collar there was another collar; I was about to unbutton that, when he was very busy with his hands behind this collar; I then bid him stand up, and underneath him, at his heels, where he sat, I picked up five one-pound notes. I then took him to the watch-house. I have kept one note, to which the prosecutor swears.</p>

            . That is the purse I saw upon the table.</p>
               <p>Archibald Ruthwin. The first thing I saw was this bag doubled up on the table just behind the door in the prisoner's room. There was one and sixpence and a gold brooch, lying by the side of it. I took up the bag, and said to Smith, here is a bag; he said, pooh, that is nothing. We then proceeded to search the other rooms; the prosecutor was not with us at first. The prisoner followed us down stairs: going down stairs, I was not satisfied about the bag, and asked the prosecutor, and he said his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100031"></xptr>purse was a yellow canvass bag. Smith told the prisoner to return to his room as he did not want him; and he returned to his room for five or six minutes before we went back. Then we went back to the prisoners room again, and on going into the room, both Smith and I asked him what had become of the bag which had been on the table? he denied seeing, or knowing anything of the kind. We then told him we were certain it had been there, and we proceeded to pull the bed clothes off the bed; the landlord's brother laid hold of the bed, and hoisted it off the mattrass, and then we saw some silver lying in the middle. The prisoner denied knowing anything of the money that was under the bed. He did not object to our searching him. Smith said to me, we must have the bag, and I opened the window of the room, to see if it had been thrown out. Smith told me to look in the prosecutor's room, and I looked towards the fire place, and saw it rolled up. I saw Smith pick up the notes from the prisoner's heels. There were no notes on the floor before, for I looked and saw the notes quivering, but whether that was from the wind, or from their having fallen just before, I can't take upon myself to say; I am certain it was impossible for any other person than the prisoner to have put the notes in the place where I saw them. Bruton was up the second time, but not the first. Upon this we took the prisoner to the watchhouse. Bruton told us that the notes he had lost smelled very strongly of musk. These notes did so, enough to knock a person down. I knew the purse to be the same, on account of the shortness of the strings. We examined the prosecutor's room at first, and I am sure it was not there then.</p>

            . I was so frightened that I did not go up the first time. This bag is very like mine but as for swearing downright to it, I can't, This note I can swear to, it is one of the five I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was fast asleep when he knocked at the door. I jumped out of the bed and opened it. He said he wished to search the room. and I told him he was welcome. On the table there was nothing but a pair of gloves, and one shilling and sixpence. I went down stairs with them; Mr. Smith said he did not want me, and I went up stairs again and dressed myself; then they came up again, and Mr. Smith made me strip myself. I was untying my neck cloth behind, and Mr. Smith picked these notes from right under me. There were other people in the room, and I knew nothing at all of the notes. There were nothing else found. There were four pounds six shillings in silver, and it is not very likely I should throw that out of the window, He said nobody else could put the notes under the chair. and the room is only five feet long.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the Pelter gun-brig, coming into Dartmouth about that time - A. Yes; I know I did the iron work of the Pelter gun-brig to a lee-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed by Mr. Tanner to do any iron work for him to a lee-board - A. Yes, on September 17th, 1795. I have my book here.</p>
               <p>Q. What work was that - A. It was iron work to a lee-board - new bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a new lee-board or an old lee-board - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of that work - A. Four pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that work done to one lee-board, or work done to two - A. I saw but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the work that was done - A. Certainly; I worked the greatest part of it with my own hand; I dare say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to certify that it was work done to one lee-board, or two lee-boards - A. That I cannot say; I never saw but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether you did any of the work yourself - A. I can say I was never out of the shop, and I rather think the work must past under my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Must the lee-board have been in your shop - A. No; the lee-board was not in my shop; the iron work was done in my shop and took to the lee-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that four pound six shillings been paid to you - A. I cannot say: in a running account among other things I rather think so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you any recollection how it was paid you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jarvis. Have you any other charge against Mr. Tanner for work that was done at that time to a leeboard - A. No, no other charge.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any demand against him for work done to a lee-board, done at that time, to a larger sum than you have stated - A. No, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the work that you did at that time for him - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know what vessel that work belonged to - A. I heard him say the Pelter gun-brig. I do not know that I saw the Pelter gun-brig in the harbour.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your entry - A. Mr. Tanner, for the Pelter gun-boat, September 17th, 1795 four pounds six shillings; that was made by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any communication with captain Tomlinson - lieutenant Tomlinson - A. No, I never knew him; I had no communication with him upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the lee-board after it became repaired - A No; I know not what became of it. There was some old iron work repaired.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you receive that from - A. Mr. Tanner's shipwrights, but to say which of them I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that bill and receipt - Is that bill of your hand writing - A. No; I never put my hand to that paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any demands against Mr. Tanner for the repair of this lee-board to the amount of the articles contained in that bill - A. No, I never had no more than four pounds six shillings; that is all the demand I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the receipt of your hand writing - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it like it - A. It is something like it; it is not my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the body of the receipt your hand-writing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose it is - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the signature of that receipt your hand-writing - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any agreement with Mr. Tanner to commit a fraud by means of a false voucher - A. No.</p>

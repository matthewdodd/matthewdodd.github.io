I live at the Destitute Sailors' Home—on 18th January, about 11 o'clock in the evening, I was in Nightingale Street, Wapping—I had had some liquor, and had been picked up by a policeman—after he left, three men came and stood over me—I don't know how long it was after—I had on a coat, vest, guernsey, and boots, and five or six shillings in my vest—a constable named Sharpe came up to me, and I made a complaint to him—I don't know what became of the men—when they had gone I missed my coat, waistcoat, guernsey, and boots—I have no recollection of my boots being taken off—I saw my guernsey at the station next morning.</p>

On 19th January, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prosecutor in Nightingale Lane, lying on the ground, intoxicated—at that time he had his boots, guernsey, vest, and a pair of trowsers on—I picked him up, and put him on his feet—I had not seen the prisoners then—I heard a woman cry two or three minutes after I left him—I went in the direction of the cries, and I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor was then on his feet where I put him—I saw the two prisoners and another man were round her, doing something to her; I saw them distinctly—I afterwards saw them coming towards me—I went up to the woman, and started her down the lane—I went on, and saw the prisoners on the prosecutor—I could not see exactly what they were doing; they were stooping down, doing something with their hands—there was a lamp nearly close—I was about fifty yards off—they ran away in the direction of High Street, Wapping—I followed them, cryig "Stop thief!"—Sharpe, the con<lb></lb>stable,</p>

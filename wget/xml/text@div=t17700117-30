When he came up to me he put his left hand to my collar, and with his right hand he put a pistol to my throat; he said something about blowing brains out. I said, What do you mean? I got hold of his collar: then another man came behind me and pinioned my hands down, while the man that stopped me robbed me. He took my watch (a silver one), six guineas, and two shillings: the watch was engine-turned on the edge of the case. I never found it again. As soon as they were gone I hallooed out thieves! and ran immediately after them. The people ran out at the Cross-Keys, and several neighbours saw them, but did not know what was the matter till too late. They took towards St. Giles's. The next morning I went to Sir

They put him into the Round-house; and on Monday he was sent for before Sir John; there he told many false stories about his lodgings. We went from place to place; and when we came to the place where he said he lodged, the people said he never lodged there; they knew no such person. He begged to be sent to Tothill-fields bridewell; he was carried there. He was brought up again on the Wednesday to be examined; then he brought a parcel of girls to swear he was with them the night I was robbed, till a quarter after eleven o'clock. There was a girl swore she parted with him at the time of lighting the lamps, and went down with him to where she lived at Westminster, and they were there together some time.</p>

               <p>Q. ARE you sure the prisoner is the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Thyer. I am. He was in the front of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Thyer. There was a lamp over my head at the time, and two in the front farther on.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Thyer. He had a brown coat on, buttoned up: and he had that same coat on the next morning when we took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Thyer. I never saw him before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not say at Sir John's that the man had a wig on?</p>
               <p>Thyer. In my fright I did say at Sir John's I thought he had a sort of a cut wig on, but I was not sure. (The prisoner had his own hair). I took particular notice of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not before Sir

            , say it was ten yards from the lamp?</p>
               <p>Thyer. No. I said it was about ten yards from the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not say I was like the man as one man may be like another?</p>
               <p>Thyer. They said, Are you sure that is the man? I said as much as one man is like another. Said Justice Wright, What do you mean by that? I said I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Would not Sir John have discharged me if you had not insisted upon prosecuting me?</p>
               <p>Thyer. A gentleman said, Let us have the two brothers up: his brother was brought up (or another man in that name ). I said they are not like each other. That is the man that robbed me, and pointed to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not swear before Sir John it was before the watch was set?</p>
               <p>Thyer. When I cried thieves (upon their running away) the watch was gone: then I thought the watch was not set. I told Sir John it was as night ten o'clock as possible, and that the watch was not set.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that night?</p>
               <p>Thyer. I had been with a gentleman from Lynn in Norfolk, at the Coachmaker's-Arms, Long-Acre. That was the only house I had been drinking at.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Thyer. I was as sober as I am this minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in your way home?</p>
               <p>Thyer. I had been with that gentleman from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170023"></xptr> Lynn (he is a cousin of mine) part of the way to his inn: he lodged at the Bell and Crown in Holborn, and I went as far as Turn-Stile, Holborn, and there I parted with him, and was going home and turned down Drury-Lane, and crossed over and turned down Brownlow-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you say at the Mogul, after the examination in the afternoon, that you could not swear to the man, because he had a black wig on?</p>
               <p>Thyer. No, I never thought he had a black wig on; I thought he might have a brown one. I said I was quite clear he was the man. I allow the wig had a little puzzled me, but when I came to recollect the man's face, it was all over.</p>

            . I am a carver, and live in Rebecca-court, on the top of Well-street, Oxford-road. On the day before Christmas-day, my wife and I, in coming home, about seven o'clock in the evening, met the prisoner in the piazzas, Covent-garden; we went to the Green-man, in New-street, and had a pot of beer, and staid there rather more than half an hour; he seemed to be a little in liquor. I parted with him at the door. He is a taylor. I don't know where he lodges.</p>

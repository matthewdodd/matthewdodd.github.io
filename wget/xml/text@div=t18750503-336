Baxter, potatoes, corn, and coal merchant"—I was not altogether satisfied and came up to town on Saturday, 6th February, and made inquiries, and on the Sunday I went to 27, George Street—I found there was no name over the door and I made inquiries from the people opposite—I then wrote to Baxter to meet the mare on the Monday, and arranged that a telegram should be sent—on Monday morning after</p>

Baxter "All right, the mare will arrive at Waterloo on Monday, 1.30 p.m., send or bring cheque for the price"—I asked him who sent him for the horse, he said young Mr. Baxter had sent him from 27, George Street, he said "He gave me two sovereigns to pay for the carriage"—I found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I asked him if he had been in the habit of working for Mr. Baxter, and he said he had done two or three jobs for him—he said he had fetched a horse from the station before—on 18th March I went to 20, Quadrant Grove, Kentish Town—I saw Barker leave that house and I ultimately took him in custody for conspiring with one J.

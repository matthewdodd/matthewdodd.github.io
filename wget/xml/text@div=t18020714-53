             sworn. - I live at Mr. Saunders's house; I saw the prisoner standing against the water-tub at the bottom of the kitchen stairs, about six in the evening; I asked him what he was doing there; he said, he had got a sister in the house; I said, if so, you have no business there; I saw him with the pipe in his hand under his coat; he instantly laid it down, and ran up stairs; the cock was fixed to the pipe; he was stopped in the passage by a little boy; in a few minutes after, I carried the pipe and cock up stairs, and gave it to a woman who was in the house; but I know not to whom, through the hurry; I do not remember ever to have seen the man before.</p>

On the 31st of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I heard a noise in their room - I thought it was a table thrown down; I heard bad words pass between them, and then heard something like earthenware breaking - I could not tell whether it was thrown or whether anything fell on it. The prisoner came into my room with nothing on but his shirt, which seemed very wet. He said,</p>
               <p>"See how I am used by this drunken woman." She rushed in after him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come out of this room, for here you shall not be," using very coarse language. She was in a great passion, and very much in liquor. Riley and his sick wife were in bed in my room; he said,</p>
               <p>"Go out of the room, both of you, and don't disturb my sick wife." She said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you and your wife." and took a plate off the table and threw it at him. She would not go out; Riley got up and pushed her out. I observed a little blood on her arms. She went out, brought in two watchmen, and gave charge of the prisoner and Riley. The prisoner was lame, and said he could not walk to the watch-house; he was at last taken there, but the woman being drunk, they would not take the charge. She charged the prisoner and Riley with heating and cutting her.</p>

               <p>"For God's sake leave my room, for I cannot leave my bed;" he had a bad leg. I heard earthenware break, and think that the woman fell on it, but cannot say; the prisoner came into our room; my husband has stated the truth. I said to the woman,</p>
               <p>"How have you come by this?" she said,</p>
               <p>"It is no matter how it happened, I have got it;" her face was all over blood, her cap off, and her hair hanging down; she kept rubbing her forehead, and said, she had got her death-blow from the chamber-pot; the prisoner said,</p>

            . I am surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital; the woman was brought there on Sunday morning, the 31st of January; she had a cut on her forehead, which laid the bone bare. I did not apprehend danger. I told her to come next morning, to have it dressed, but she did not come till Thursday; it was then very much inflamed, erysipelas had spread over her face; she died on the Tuesday week following; the erysipelas caused her death; it often follows wounds, where people have a bad constitution; it commenced first in the wound; if she had lived temperately. I think it would not have come on; my opinion is, that the wound did not cause her death.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the deceased was intoxicated, and had thrown a pot of beer, and the contents of the chamber utensil at him, and, by endeavouring to prevent his leaving the room, she had fallen over it.</p>

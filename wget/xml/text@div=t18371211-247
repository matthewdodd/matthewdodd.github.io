I employed the prisoner to clear a number of bricks at Twickenham—I lost a great number, and watched—on the 10th of November I saw the prisoner come to the stack and take seven bricks—I watched him, and hallooed to him before he got to his house—he came back—I ordered him to take them back to the stack, again, which he did, and then I got a warrant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He agreed to give me two months work, and I built a little Gothic work in front of the house—I told him I should take the bricks to build it with. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He said he should build it, but. he. did not say he should take the bricks—I let the house to a man, and he agreed with the prisoner to do the ceiling, instead of which the prisoner got and put the man's goods out, put in two chairs and a table, and would not let the man in again—I went to him as he was doing up the other houses, and said if he would <hi rend="italic">give</hi> up the key I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

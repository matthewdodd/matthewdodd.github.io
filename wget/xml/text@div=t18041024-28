               <p>(The prosecutor was a Swiss, and was a lodger to the prisoner at the time mentioned in the indictment; he had agreed to give Newman a pound a week for board and lodging, but had not paid him any; the prosecutor had taken his money out of his protection-box, and laid it on the table; there were several people in the room at the time, and the prisoner took it up as his right, for the trouble of getting him a protection, and for his board and lodging. The witness not being able to speak English, was allowed an interpreter. The Court informed the Jury it was a mere quarrel about the money, and not a felony.)</p>

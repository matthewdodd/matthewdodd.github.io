Goodburn took the parcel from under my arm, and said he would hold it while he sent me to the Temple to find a gentleman; he went part of the way with me; I could not find the gentleman; when I came back they were both gone; I received the parcels from my master Mr. Edwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards. On the 15th of August I delivered a parcel of buckles, containing thirty-three pair, and a parcel of sword hilts to my boy the last witness; the one he was to take to Salisbbury-court, the other to the Strand; the prisoners were taken, and acknowledged to me before several witnesses, that they took them from my boy; there was a pair found in Elburn's shoes; the rest were found at Mr. Price's, the corner of Drury-lane, Holborn.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you sworn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you was to speak any thing untrue; what would become of you? - I should go the Devil. Coming through St. Paul's Church-yard, the prisoner Elburn asked me the way to Cheapside; I told him I had a box, with a telescope, tube, and stand; he followed me till I came to <placeName id="t17780916-54-crimeloc276">Queen-street</placeName>

               <p>The two boys were taken together with Flint on account of another matter; they made a confession of this robbery, and Goodburn went with me to Price's, and pointed out the box; it was on a table up one pair of stairs; Goodburn said they took the box from a boy in Cheapside, and by the advertisement they knew who it belonged to.</p>

               <p>I saw the box at Flint's; he said he was going with it to Price, but I do not know how he came by it.</p>

I had not been home above half an hour, before a person came and told me my sister was in fits, and as I was going along with her, she said she thought my sister had lost all the clothes out of the house, but that the thief was in the house.

I went with him; he put them on my head; he said they were his own property. The next morning I went to see if he had been for them; I found he had not; I went to his lodgings, and heard he was in New Prison. I went to her again, and asked her to go with me to see what he was there for, and they detained me. My brother when he gave them me, said he was afraid they would open them, and bid me say I was a gentleman's servant in St. Martin's Lane, and was carrying them to wash.</p>

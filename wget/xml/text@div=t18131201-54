            . I am an Officer of Bow-street. On the 6th of November, between nine and ten in the evening, I and Humphreys went up into the Strand by Akerman's; there were gas lights. We went into the corner public-house. The landlord told us there were a great many pocket-books down the areas in Beaumont's buildings. We went into the Plough public-house: we saw the prisoner, he was warming some beer by the fire: he came to the door: Humphreys laid hold of him. I came up to him. I put my hand to his fob, and pulled out a gold watch. He said, are you going to rob me. I said, no, I want this watch. I asked him whose it was; he said, a man of the name 
               <persName id="t18131201-54-person678">

             gave him the watch, and told him to stay there until he came to him. He told us, if we would wait a bit, we should see, Phene Morgan would come in to him. We secured the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house. After that we went back to the house; Phene Morgan came in; we secured him, and put him in the watch-house.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Seaton, of Harding's Build<lb></lb>ings, Woolwich—on 10th September I was going from Plumstead to my father's, a man came up to me and knocked me down—I cannot say who it was—he began to take liberties with me—I screamed, and when I did so he put his hand up my petticoats with something sharp—I afterwards found myself wounded in the back part—I screamed—he ran away, and a young man came to my help—I was in the hospital three weeks and three days.</p>

"Police!"—I opend my window, looked out into the brick-field, and saw a man and woman on the ground—I took a poker, went out and asked what was the matter—I spoke to the man, and he ran away—he was then about 100 yards from the woman, and about twenty yards from me—I went after the man; it was the prisoner—I asked him what he had been doing, and he said "Fetch the woman here, and I will tell you"—I called to the woman to come and charge the man—she would not come—when I got back she was up—the man struck me, and I struck him back with the poker—he left his coat on the ground—he got away from me, and the woman walked away; she was bleeding—I saw blood on her blockings, and on the ground—the prisoner was not drunk; he had been having something—it was a light night; the moon was shining—he left his cap behind—Hunter came up to my assistance.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 15, Charles Street, Plumstead—about 9.30 on this night I was at 4, Lincoln Terrace, and heard a cry of "Murder!" three or four times—I was just knocking at the door of No. 4—the cry came from a brickfield—I saw the last witness, and followed him into the field, and saw the prisoner there—he ran away from the woman as we came up—I followed him—I knew him before—I said "George, what have you been doing of?"—he said "My name is not George, it is Charley Holmes, give me my b—y money, I have been robbed"—there was a struggle between Canning and the prisoner—the prisoner took his coat off as we got up to him—the woman walked away—I saw blood at the bottom of her stockings, and her petticoat—I went some 200 yards from the spot where I had first seen her—I saw her again sitting, opposite the road—I observed some blood there.</p>

I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—at 3 o'clock on Sunday morning, 11th September, Sarah Sea ton was brought to my house—she was bleeding and insensible; I examined her—I found she had a wound in the peritoneum about an inch and a half long—there had been considerable loss of blood; the wound was partly lacerated and partly incised—a blunt instrument, or a knife, might have done it.</p>

On the 21st of May we had a family from India, and a gentleman, Major Horsley. They left town on Saturday morning to go to Seven Oaks in Kent. After they were gone I received a pair of shoes for Major Horsley. The prisoner was then standing by me. The prisoner was <rs id="t18130714-18-deflabel110" type="occupation">valet and butler</rs>

I received the shoes, and put them in a desk in the hall. On the Monday following I had occasion to put some things in the desk; I discovered that the shoes were taken out of the desk; the desk was not locked. I made every enquiry in the house among our people; the prisoner denied any knowledge of it. We had lost several other things in the house, and suspicion fell on the lad I had; he was discharged his service on suspicion. This went on three or four days; we lost other things, and on looking in Murray's room I discovered this pair of shoes that belonged to Major Horsley, and because it should not hurt the house I paid fifteen shillings for the shoes. I mentioned it to Murray's master that I had found the shoes, and I told Murray that the shoes were in his possession. I went in his room, and saw the shoes were taken away. The officer found the shoes at his washerwoman's house.</p>
               <p>- TOWNSEND. I am an officer. I found these shoes at the prisoner's washerwoman's, 151, Swallow-street. They were tied in an handkerchief with two other pair of shoes. There is Major Horsley's name in them.</p>
               <p>MRS. SAYER. I live at 151, Swallow-street; I am a washerwoman. The prisoner came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140020"></xptr>house, and asked me to let him leave a bundle, and he would call again. That is the same bundle that Townsend found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bespoke a pair of shoes; they were to be sent home on Friday or Saturday; and when I came home to the hotel, she house-maid told me my things were in the desk; I took them up to my room. I thought they were the shoes that came from Mr. Vaughan, my shoe-maker; I tried them on, they fitted me.</p>

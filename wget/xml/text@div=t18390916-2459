                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Long-acre. On the 13th of September I left my shop to go a short distance—on return<lb></lb>ing I found the prisoner standing between two others, close to my shop-window, with his hands before him—I stood at the door about a second, and then went behind the whole three, and immediately separated then, one went up Long-acre, and the other two down—I observed my window was cut—I immediately pursued the prisoner, and gave him in charge—in the area under my shop I found some cards, one of which had contained a pair of ear-rings, some union pins, and another a pair of ear-rings, which had been taken from the window—there was nothing found but the cards—the prisoner's hand was bleeding, and cut across the knuckles.</p>

About half-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 13th of August, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and found the prisoner in the middle of a mob—Mr. Garrett gave him into custody—the skin was cut off the fore finger of his right hand—the mob said, "What a shame it is to use him so! see how his hands are cut"—I did not find any thing on him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a cooper. On Friday, the 21st of August, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming past the warehouse and I see a strong man scraping of some hams, picking off the straw from the hams; I went and looked at him; coming out again I see two soldiers standing on the opposite side of the way; I looked at them very stedfastly, and I went off; just as I went off I happened to turn round and see the prisoner, one of the soldiers, go into the warehouse, and then I see him come out with a ham in his apron, and I went up St. Peter's-hill, and went after him and took him. I never lost sight of him; he dropped the ham.</p>
               <p>Q. Who picked up the ham? - I did, I took him to the warehouse where he took it from, and put him in custody of a public officer that lived at the corner of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing at the time that you took him? - I asked him what was the reason he took it? he said, he never saw it.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the two men with the ham; I desired Mr. Wilson to mark the ham, and I left it in their possession; it is here.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot identify it; I lost half a dozen that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

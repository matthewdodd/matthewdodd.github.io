                  </hi>. I am a tailor, at No. 23, Milton Street. On the afternoon of 3rd April, I went to the Woolpack public house, in Cumberland Street, between 3 and 4 o'clock—before I went there I had taken part of a pot of porter—I was quite sober—I went to the front of the bar in company with a shopmate named James How—he was sober, and had been with me all the morning—the prisoner was there with a man named Waldern, who was afterwards tried (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 14)—I entered into conversation with them—I called, for some porter—we asked them to drink, which they did—we were some time in their company, I cannot remember how long—I became insensible—I do not know how long I was in the house when I became insensible, it might be an hour, or not so long—while I was there we are in conversa<lb></lb>tion with the prisoners and his companions—the last thing I recollect in the house was their giving me porter—when I went into the public house I had a watch, and a purse with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the sovereign was in a small com<lb></lb>partment</p>

On the afternoon of 5th April I was in the prosecutor's company—we went to the Woolpack between 3 and 4 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—I saw in front of the bar the prisoner and Waldern—I know the prisoner very well; he had a flannel jacket on—we were there till between 5 and 6 o'clock—liquor was offered to the prisoner and Waldern, which they drank—we were sober when we went into the house; I was quite insensible when I came out—I did not become insensible till I came to the step of the door; I found my senses leaving me—when I came to myself, where I live, at No. 27, Primrose Street, I found my pockets turned inside out—I had lost three or four shillings—I had been robbed.</p>

I am twelve years of age; I live with my father at No. 26, Cumberland Street—I was there on 3rd April last, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—my attention was attracted by two men coming along with Mr. Jackson—they took him to King's Head Court, and laid him down—they had hold of his arms—the prisoner is one, the other was Waldern—they tried to hold him up against the wall; then Waldern robbed him of his <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>, and the prisoner snapped the watch off the guard—Waldern went away and the other followed—I went down King's Head Court, and went up Black Boy Alley—I ran after them; some person stopped me—the prisoner and Waldern met again at the bottom of Quaker Street—they went down Queen Street, and went underneath the arches in Brick Lane, and cleared some money—they were halving some money—they went up Eyre Street, and went into a public house—they went to two beer shops—they went down different streets, and came down Brick Lane, and there they bought some apples—I lost them almost directly</p>

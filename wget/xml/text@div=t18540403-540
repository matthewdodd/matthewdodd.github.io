                  </hi>. I am the lessee of Drury-lane theatre.

                  </hi>. I am acting manager to Mr. Smith, at Drury-lane Theatre. I do not recollect the trial of Carter for stealing bills, I had nothing at all to do with it—I recollect the charge against him; I remember Pull coming to the theatre about that time—I saw him—he asked me if I would ask Mr. Smith to let him appear in the case against Carter—I said I would take the message, and I did; and Mr. Smith said, "Don't bother me, I have nothing whatever to do with it"—I gave Pull exactly that message—he did not upon that say anything about expense—nothing at all passed after that—I think he did say that it would cost Mr. Smith nothing, but I took such little notice of the thing at the time, I only delivered the message and the answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SMITH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you stated that when Mr. Pull called on you, you went up stairs to Mr. Smith, and he was very much engaged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I went down stairs—I found Mr. Smith very much engaged, and he said, "Don't bother me"—I am his acting manager—I have to exercise a little discretion occasionally upon things connected with the theatre—I had nothing to do with these bills; Mr. Smith was very much occupied; it is very likely he had hardly time to reflect upon the subject of my message, and his own answer—I have known Mr. Pull a few years—he did two or three things for me respecting messages, during the Marylebone theatre time, that is about two years ago; it was in the legal department—I had heard that he was in the law, and employed him to do little matters in the law for me—I am not aware that he ever prosecuted anybody for me, or that he ever defended any prosecution for me—I do not think he called upon me more than once about this prosecution, I cannot call to mind but the once—I took a turn with him out of the theatre after delivering the message; we went and had a glass of ale—we did not sit down at all—I do not think we had a gossip, it must have been very little—I was on friendly terms with him—I never had any reason to doubt his integrity—I always thought him a downright good honest fellow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect Mr. Pull saying to you, as the conversation drew to a close, "You know it won't cost Smith anything?" and then do not you recollect saying to him, "Well, well, do as you like, only it must not cost Mr. Smith anything?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—nothing more passed while we were having the glass of ale; I did not go on talking about this prosecution—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030092"></xptr>
               <p>I cannot tell what we talked about, I was not there above half a minute—I do not recollect his saying, "It shall not put Mr. Smith to any expense, the county will pay it, certainly not"—all I have stated took place at the com<lb></lb>mencement, and it was in the hall of the theatre, not in the tavern, we were not half a minute in the tavern; after having the glass of ale I returned—nobody else came to see me about this prosecution—at the same time that I delivered this message to Mr. Smith, I remember asking him about a private box for somebody—I do not know whether the person was waiting for an answer, but the message was sent to me while I was in the hall; one of, the men opened the door, and said, "Mr. Smith says it is all right, Mr. Wild"—I did not repeat the words, "It is all right," because the party was not there at the time; I was to send it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you, putting a benignant construction upon this matter, might not Pull have misunderstood that answer as applying to his errand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> certainly might, but I applied it to a private box—it was one of the carpenters that passed, and said, "Mr. Smith says it is all right"—I had asked him for a private box, or taken a message to him; it had nothing to do with this—Pull was there—he might have misapplied it to his errand; this was in the hall of the theatre—I recollect Mr. Serjeant Adams calling—I did not know the gentleman—he called on Mr. Smith—I saw him in Mr. Smith's room—I do not know whether he came for a private box—he was in the room previous to my going there—I was sent for, and Mr. Smith put the question to me as to what answer I returned to Mr. Pull, and I said, "I am quite certain he had nothing whatever to do with it"—the gentleman had his face to the fire, and he turned round and said, "I am quite certain you are speaking the truth, for you don't know me," and then I was introduced to him as Mr. Serjeant Adams—I was in character at the time, for this happened to be during the performance of the "Corsican Brothers "—I am quite sure he made that observation.</p>

               <p>was made at the time of the plea—sentence was passed, and between one and two hours afterwards Pull came to where I was sitting in Court, produced this brief, and said, "Will you endorse the brief for the costs that have been applied for and allowed?" and he pointed out that there was an endorsement on the brief by Mr. Horry, "costs allowed"—this is Mr. Horry's signature.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The brief was here read, as follows. It was endorsed</hi> "Middlesex Ses<lb></lb>sions, Westminster, 27th Feb., 1854.—The Queen, on the Prosecution of T. Smith, against George Carter.—Brief for the Prosecution.—Mr. Horry, one guinea. S. C. Horry.—Costs allowed.—Six months' imprisonment. C. T. Jones, 125, Long-acre." <hi rend="italic">The contents were as follows;</hi>—"West-minster Sessions, 27th February, 1854.—The Queen, on the Prosecu<lb></lb>tion of Edward Tyrrell Smith, against George Carter.—Brief for the Prosecution (see Indictment).—Case—The prosecutor in this case (Mr. Smith) is the lessee of Drury-lane Theatre. The prisoner was one of the bill distributors and supernumeraries at the theatre, in the prosecutor's employ, and his duty was to distribute and stick up the bills of the performance in various parts of the metropolis and suburbs. From in<lb></lb>formation which came to the knowledge of the prosecutor (see depositions), the prisoner was given into custody. It was ascertained he had been in the habit of selling the bills by <hi rend="italic">wholesale</hi>, for waste paper, stating that they were his perquisites. No one can tell the loss sustained by the lessee, not only of this but of other theatres, by such conduct, as there is no doubt the sys<lb></lb>tem has been carried on by others to a very large extent Whether or not Drury-lane was crammed to the ceiling every night, and whether or not many were unable to obtain admission, has nothing to do with the prisoner's conduct. Mr. Smith has no personal feeling against the prisoner, he has taken the matter up on public grounds. Counsel will be pleased to ask the learned Judge to take the case as soon as the bill has been found, on the ground that Mr. Smith has particular engagements at Drury-lane Theatre. Since writing the previous sheet, we are informed by Mr. Smith (through Mr. Wild) that he is not bound over to prosecute, the Magistrate con<lb></lb>ceiving the evidence sufficient without troubling Mr. Smith to appear. The case will therefore take its usual course, and there' will be no occasion to ask the Court to take it out of its turn. The bills in question were <hi rend="smallCaps">VERY LARGE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">posting</hi> bills, and coloured, and therefore very expensive. The prisoner disposed of them (it appears) to another party, who sold them for waste paper; yet Mr. Smith was charged weekly with the expenses of dis<lb></lb>tributing, posting, (fee.; so that altogether, what with the charges for the bills, and the charges for posting, he was a loser of several pounds per week. In one packet was found twenty-six lbs. weight of them, purchased by a Mr. Cook, a waste-paper merchant, in Lambeth-walk, to whom it was stated they were perquisites, being out of date. He (Mr. Cook), we think, was much to blame for not making inquiries, when the course he might have adopted was so simple. There is, we are informed, another indictment to be preferred against Carter, by a Freehold Land Society, for similar con<lb></lb>duct respecting their bills; but with that this case has nothing to do. Indeed, we may also observe, that <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> has suffered in the same way; but in his usual good-humoured manner, we understand, he has declined to interfere. We say again, the matter has been taken up on public grounds by Mr. Smith, as there is no doubt the managers of all the London theatres, as well as all public companies who have recourse to similar means of advertising, have been victimised in like manner. There are two witnesses in this case, Mr. Keeley and Mr. Dunning, who are engaged at Drury-lane</p>

               <p>Theatre; and if the case could be brought on <hi rend="smallCaps">EARLY</hi> it would be a great convenience to them, so that they might return to their duties. Proofs Mr. Keeley.—To prove that witness is the inspector of bills at Drury-lane Theatre; that several bills (from information witness has received) were afterwards found, which ought to have been distributed; that witness knows the costs of the bills to the lessee of the theatre (Mr. Smith); and will prove what those found at Mr. Cook's (another witness) cost him. Call John Quinn.—To prove that witness received the bills of the prisoner for the pur<lb></lb>pose of sale, and afterwards sold them to the witness Tingay. Call Gillis Tingay.—To prove that witness bought the bills in question from the witness Quinn, and afterwards sold them to the witness Cook. Call Gus<lb></lb>tavus Dunning.—To prove that witness is employed at Drury-lane Theatre, and as such gave the bills in question to the prisoner for distribution and posting. Call Mr. Riley, for Cook.—To prove that witness bought the bills of the former witness, Tingay, who said they were, 'perquisites' allowed to the bill distributors at the theatre. Witness is a wholesale waste-paper dealer, carrying on business in Lambeth-walk. Call John Baker.—To prove that witness is a policeman of the F division, 118 F; took the prisoner into custody, and the prisoner said nothing to him, except that he 'knew nothing about the matter.'")—<hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> When Pull said that the costs had been applied for and allowed, I said I had heard no application for them—I had not left the Court at all—I referred to my note book, and found that there was no entry—Mr. Horry's name was endorsed on the brief as it is now, and Pull told me that Mr. Horry had applied—I said, as I had not heard it, he had better request Mr. Horry to renew the application—Pull then went to Mr. Horry and spoke to him, and Mr. Horry spoke across the Court to me, and said that he had made the application—that does not at all alter my opinion on the subject—I said, that having no entry in my book I must request him to renew the application—Mr. Horry then made the application, in the presence of Pull—he said he renewed an application that he had made in consequence of the officer of the Court not having heard it—Mr. Serjeant Adams referred to the depositions, and then allowed the costs, for which I subsequently signed the order.</p>

               <p>—that order would not have been granted except on the assumption that the attorney had been properly instructed to prosecute—if the Judge had been aware that no attorney had been instructed, he would not have allowed it—on the Wednesday following, 1st March, something occurred which in<lb></lb>duced the learned Judge to ask a question of Pull—it was on another matter, and Pull was asked by the Judge if he had been concerned in any case that sessions before that day—he said he had, but he could not remember what—upon being pressed, he said it was Carter's case—the Judge then asked him whose clerk he was (he having previously said he was an attorney's clerk)—he said he was the clerk of a Mr. C. T. Jones, of No. 125, Long-acre—(I never saw Mr. C. T. Jones myself)—he said he became Mr. Jones's clerk on the preceding Saturday, the 25th—the Judge asked him whose clerk he was before, and he would not tell—he asked him whose clerk he was when he obtained instructions in Carter's case—he would not say—it ended in the Judge saying that he should make inquiries into the matter, and see whether his statements were correct—those inquiries have been instituted, and have resulted in the present inquiry.</p>

SMITH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you to say that Mr. Pull was asked about this prosecution of Carter's; did not he volunteer the statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, certainly not; he was standing near the counsel's seat, and on being pointed out by the prosecutor in another case, the Judge directed him to come forward in the body of the Court, and he did—I con<lb></lb>ceive that he tried to conceal himself in the first instance—this brief was brought to me in the first instance by Pull, according to my recollection, two hours after Carter's case was over—I should say from one to two hours; I think I said so before—it was certainly more than three quarters of an hour, and more than an hour, to my recollection; I should say from one to two hours—I did not observe the brief so closely as to ascertain whether it was wet—I saw sufficient to see that it was a very improper brief, from the manner in which it was prepared—it is not at all in the form in which a brief is usually prepared—it is not the way in which I should prepare a brief—I am an attorney—I should do it upon an entirely different principle—I should not do it in such handwriting as that; this is entirely improper—the proper thing is to commence a brief with an abstract of an indictment—there is no reference to any indictment there—there are four sheets of paper in the brief, very badly filled—I should think they could be easily written in one hour—I do not know that all the information could be obtained in an hour—it could be obtained between the time of the witnesses going before the Grand Jury and the case coming into Court—the person who prepared the brief, having a knowledge of the fads sufficient to enable him to write it, could certainly do it in an hour—I have frequently seen Mr. Horry's handwriting; I believe this endorsement, "S. C. Horry, costs allowed, six months imprisonment," to be Mr. Horry's handwriting—you must be better aware than I am whether it is usual for counsel to receive a brief after a plea of guilty—properly, an attorney should receive written in<lb></lb>structions before he acts upon them—briefs have been delivered to counsel, and costs allowed, in cases where prisoners plead guilty, on the immediate application of counsel—when a prisoner is arraigned, the counsel who appears for him usually mentions it in the ordinary course, so that the Court is aware at once whether counsel is retained or not; that is, if he is in Court—I am not aware that there was more than the usual confusion at the time of this arraignment—I have often heard counsel laughing and making a noise at such times, and at other times, also—counsel usually rise when they address</p>

               <p>the Court, and I should have seen Mr. Horry, had he risen—I was occupied in taking the pleas of the prisoners—I cannot swear that no application was made within an hour of the plea of guilty—there was none to my hearing, certainly—I can only depose to my own knowledge—the application that I did hear certainly took place more than an hour after the prisoner had been sentenced—I could not at all judge whether this brief bad been written the day before it was presented to me; I could not, of course, swear that it had not—I saw no counsel appear when Carter pleaded guilty—I was busy—the business goes on with celerity—I made out the order for the payment of the money; the treasurer pays none without an order—the direction of the Court is my authority for giving the order; I received Mr. Serjeant Adams' direction in this case—I heard Mr. Horry apply to the Judge for the costs; that was more than an hour after the plea—he stated that he renewed the application.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I presume one of the first things you would do in making a brief would be to obtain a copy of the deposition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, one of the very first things; it is not usual to travel out of the case shown in the deposition—there is a reference to the depositions in this brief, but there are none in the brief.</p>

I am a clerk, in the office of the clerk of the peace—I remember Pull coming for the expenses in the prosecution of Carter; I asked him for the brief—he showed me a brief, I found it was not signed by the counsel, and told him he must take it into the Court and get it signed—I am speaking of the signature to the fee, that was not on it at first—he went away, and returned with the signature to it—I do not pay any counsel's fee except it is vouched by his signature that it has been paid—I took the brief into Court to ascertain what fee was to be allowed—I told Pull it was necessary that the principal should be present to receive the money; I did not ask him if he was the principal—he said he would bring Mr. Jones, and he should sign the order for the money—he left for the purpose, and returned in about half an hour with the other defendant Jones; Mr. Jones said, "My name is Jones, and I have called for my expenses"—Pull said, "This is Mr. Jones"—I handed the order to Mr. Jones to sign, and he signed this receipt on the stamp—I then paid the money to Jones in the presence of Pull—it was paid out of the county treasurer's money.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Serjeant-at-law</hi>). I am Assistant Judge of the county of Middlesex—I was presiding in my court at Westminster, on 27th Feb.—I remember the prosecution of a person named Carter, he pleaded guilty—the clerk of the peace is not quite correct; whenever counsel appear for the prosecution or for the defence, it is my invariable practice, and has been now for a long period, to write the name down in my book—I do that whether the prisoner pleads guilty or not, I sometimes find it of use after<lb></lb>wards—Carter was arraigned with several others, and the custom is, when they are all arraigned, to select a certain number of cases to go to the second court, when there are two courts sitting; then the others are taken down while those who have pleaded guilty are sentenced consecutively—I remem<lb></lb>ber passing sentence upon Carter—at the time I passed sentence no appli<lb></lb>cation</p>

               <p>was made to me to my knowledge for the expenses of the prosecu<lb></lb>tion; no counsel appeared—an application was made to me some time after<lb></lb>wards on the subject of the expenses of that prosecution—that was by Mr. Horry; my impression is that that application was nearly two hours after the man had pleaded guilty—I cannot of course, with the business I have to do, fix myself exactly to the time, but I am confident it was a very con<lb></lb>siderable period, and after the Courts were going on—I remember when Mr. Horry applied he said something about a mistake, but what it was I do not know, I think it was that he had not been present, but he gave me no impression that any application had been made about the costs—I remember turning to my left hand, taking the depositions, reading them, and saying it was a proper case for counsel, and I have a distinct recollection of writing Mr. Horry's name in the margin of my note book—I saw Mr. Smith after this at Drury-lane theatre; there were two or three most unplea<lb></lb>sant and painful circumstances arising out of this; it is better I should say nothing upon that subject, but I thought it better before I gave any instruc<lb></lb>tions to an attorney that I should ask Mr. Smith privately if instructions had been given, that was for the purpose of satisfying myself on the subject—I then did nothing more but go to the solicitor for the county and say, "I think it is a proper case to be inquired into, and I will do nothing further."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SMITH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I have the peculiar felicity not to be at all known to you, Mr. Serjeant Adams; therefore, according to your own doctrine, I am sure your answers will be the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You must not quite take that answer in the way in which it was given, but it is quite immaterial—I did not go to the theatre to take a private box, or to witness a rehearsal, my days for witnessing rehearsals and private boxes have been over these thirty years—I did not say that the clerk of the peace was not quite correct; there is a difference between a person being himself quite correct, and giving an exactly correct account of what another does—he was correct as far as he went, but I do something more than he stated—he said nothing incorrect—I have not known him to be very incorrect; I think he is one of the most correct officers the Court ever saw—I remember Mr. Horry applying for these costs—I should never allow any costs in a prosecution without I thought the attorney had been properly instructed.</p>

Wild, which answered just as well—I did not converse with him as to the facts of the case, that I am aware of—on Monday morning he showed me a brief—I cannot say whether this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it or not; but I saw a brief like this in Pull's hand, early on Monday morning; it was between 10 and 11 o'clock, and before Carter pleaded guilty—Pull took down the names of all the witnesses as they were called in the Indictment-office.</p>

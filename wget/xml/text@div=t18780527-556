                  </hi>. I live at Park Terrace, Regent's Park—on 11th May, about 6.30 p.m., I purchased some fish in Billingsgate and a party in a white smock came up to me—I left my fish in a public-house, and when I came out I left the man in the smock in Pudding Lane—the prisoner then came behind me, threw his left arm round my neck, and another man threw his right arm round my neck, and a third man took me up by the legs, lifted me about two yards into King's Head Court, and threw me on the ground—the man on my left ripped my left trousers leg up and said "Keys," and then the prisoner ripped my right trousers leg up and tore my coat—the prisoner and the other man threw me on my back violently and fell on top of me, and the prisoner ripped my pocket right out, which had about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, passed it to his confederates, and they went away, but the prisoner did not get an inch from me—a police<lb></lb>man came up and I gave him in charge—I did not suffer much at the time but I have since felt great pain in my neck, and I have a great swelling on my hip—my wrist is also injured; I expect it was done against a brick wall, I still have a poultice on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to a brush maker and live at King's Head Court, Fish Street Hill—on Saturday, 11th May, about 6.30, I saw Sullivan at the entrance to King's Head Court, surrounded by three men—the prisoner was one—I saw them throw him down—I did not see what they did to his trousers but I saw the prisoner hand the pocket to his companion, who gave it to a friend of his, one of the three—I afterwards saw the prisoner pick up what appeared to be some coppers—I ran after the two others, but saw the prisoner again within five minutes—I met a policeman and told him, and the prisoner, who was at the bottom of Pudding Lane, ran off when he saw us, but the police<lb></lb>man took him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 708). Newman spoke to me and I went into Pudding Lane and saw the prisoner going towards Thames Street—I followed him and said "Wait a minute, you are wanted" I—Newman came up and said "You are one of the three who robbed I that man in King's Head Court"—Sullivan came up and the prisoner I said "I never saw that man before," and immediately after he said, "You had better be careful what you say, you have made a mistake"—he appeared sober, but when I got him to the station he appeared suddenly to come over drunk—he said to Sullivan "I saw you. run<lb></lb>ning up and down Thames Street like a madman"—I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1¼<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—he gave his address at Beehive Lodge, which is a common lodging house, but his name was not known there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was standing at the corner of Fish Street Hill and Sullivan came up and asked me if I had seen a man at Billings-gate. I said "No." He said "If you see him and he will come up as a witness for me I will give you a sovereign." He gave his name as Patrick Sullivan, and asked us into a public-house to have some drink. There were three young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> there half drunk and he interfered with them. He said that he was knocked down with a punch from a man.</p>

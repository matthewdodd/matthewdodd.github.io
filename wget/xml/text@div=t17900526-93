             sworn.</p>
               <p>At a quarter after four in the morning I saw the prisoner standing by Mr. Matthews's premises putting up the flap of his coat on one side: as I turned back he had one hand with a bag in it, and the other hand was up, taking something off the partition; I could not see what he took; but I saw him put it into the bag: I met him, and asked him what he had: he dropped the bag: the court joins to the prosecutor's house: I called an alarm: he was stopped in half a minute; I did not see him stopped: I am sure he is the man: I never saw him before: it was broad day light: I took up the lead, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you been watchman? - Five years.</p>
               <p>The front of the house leads into the lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the back part of the house? - There is a small partition made to the house.</p>
               <p>Did you take up the bag immediately as it was dropped? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>How long might it lay? - I suppose a minute.</p>
               <p>Other persons might have passed? - The court is no thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>What is next the court? - Nothing; the partition boards are as high as I can reach; they are about four feet from the house.</p>
               <p>Does any thing project from these boards? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>This is the side of the court wall; I cannot say whether it communicates with the house.</p>
               <p>Court. The back of this house is in the court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Part of that court is separated by a wooden building? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This lead is fixed to that wooden building? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that wooden building connected with the house? - I cannot tell.</p>

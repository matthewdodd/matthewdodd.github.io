                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. John Grant, a pawnbroker, of london-wall. The prisoner came on 2nd Oct. to redeem some pledges; I had known her before—she paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a few halfpence interest, redeemed the things and went away; a few minutes-after she had left, I missed a pair of trowsers which had been hanging inside the shop, not in the part where she was, but she would have to pass them in going out—I ran out and stopped her three or four doors off—I found the trowsers under her shawl—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—our private mark is on them—I had seen them about five minutes before she came in—I said to her, "This is not the first time that this has occurred"—she said, "Don't be too positive"—I gave her into custody.</p>

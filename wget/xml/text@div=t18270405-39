            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I went to the till about 7 o'clock in the evening, there was then 6s. or 7s. worth of copper in it - I served a customer, who I think shut the door when he went out, but I am not positive; it goes on a latch. I went into the back-room, and in twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour I went into the shop again, and missed the till; no other customer had been in; it was dark when I saw it safe - I believe the shop-door was shut.</p>

            . I am an errand-boy at a baker's shop near Mr. Hatt's. On Tuesday evening, the 6th of March, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of Hatt's shop, with the till in his hand, and give it to Taylor, who stood near the door; he said run, and they both ran away with it; the till was made of white new wood, not painted - I heard copper rattle in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. One door from Hatt's shop - I had often seen both the prisoner and Taylor about before, and am sure of him - I am thirteen years old - another boy ran with them whom I did not know - I told Mr. Hatt of it the same night, and saw Cooper next morning.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 6th of March, I saw the prisoner and two more lads running down Horseferry-road, he had a till, or kind of deal box; I did not hear money rattle; they ran down Little Peter-street, which is a very little way from Hatt's. I knew the prisoner before, and am sure of him.</p>

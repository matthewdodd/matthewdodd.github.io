On the 20th of August, at about eleven in the forenoon, I found the parlour window which looks to the street open; I had been out, and returned in about five minutes; I missed the spoons and ladle; I laid them on the sideboard near the window before I went out; I went into the street, and a neighbour's child told me a person was gone through the gate-way, who had put some silver into his side-pocket. I desired a drayman, who was in the street to go after him; he did, and brought back the prisoner; he was carried to the Three Crowns, a public-house, and searched, but there was nothing found upon him; the spoons and the handle of the ladle were found, when he was taken to the compter; the bowl of the ladle was neyer found.</p>

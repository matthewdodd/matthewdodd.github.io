On the Friday I lost a silver tea urn, some silver knives and forks, and tea spoons; I don't know the number, as the servant had the care of the plate. This shawl which I have on was also stolen. The urn was worth twenty pounds. On the day on which these things were lost I had seen some of them, for they had been in my room.</p>

            . I was housemaid to Mrs. Williams, but I did not live there at the time the prisoner went away; I came after she had quitted the service. In the course of Friday, the 4th of October, I had seen the different articles of plate mentioned in the indictment safe in the house. I had them under my care, there was a silver tea-urn, nine silver spoons, five silver knives and forks, one silver sauce ladle, one pair of silver candlesticks, a pair of sheets, a large India shawl, and an old silk shawl. I had seen these things after three o'clock, and at my mistress's dinner hour; she generally dined about five o'clock, but dined later that day. I think I saw them between six and seven o'clock; they were in a closet in my mistress's bed room on the second floor. I missed them from that closet, but not before the watchman came in, which was near eight o'clock, Before the watchman came in, I gave an alarm; I went up stairs for some china, and as I opened my mistress bed room door, I heard the back bed room which had been locked, open unlatch. I went into the bed room as far as the door that parts the two rooms, and saw a large black leather trunk removed. I came down stairs, and asked my fellow servant if she had moved it; she told me she had not. Then we went up stairs to look again, and I went close up to the door, and saw it a bit opened. Upon going down stairs again, I told my mistress I was certain there was somebody in the house, and I told her she had better have a watchman in, and accordingly we had, and he went up stairs to the garrets, and we could not see that there was any one in those two that were occupied. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300048"></xptr>we came down stairs, and went to the door where the prisoner had come out of, which was the back two pair bed room; the two Miss Hughes's, two young ladies who were on a visit at my mistress' slept there; we did not see any one there, and I looked into my mistress's bed room, and nobody was there, and I looked into the closet, and the first thing I missed was the tea-urn. I sent my fellow servant down, and on going into the room again, I missed the other things. Upon this, more watchmen were brought in, and every part of the house was searched, except one garret, which was not occupied; then a Marlborough-street officer and a Bow-street officer came; they searched all over the house, except my mistress's room, and my mistress objected to her room being searched again. On the Saturday I suspected all day that there was some person in the house, for on Saturday night when I went to bed, I heard a snoring over my head, and on the Sunday morning I and my fellow servant came down stairs, and opened the house, and

               <p>-STONE. On the 6th of October, I was sent for at about one o'clock. I went up and apprehended the prisoner. I found her in the cupboard. I have heard the account given by the last witness. As far as I am concerned, her account is true.</p>

            . I was once in the service of Mrs. Williams, The prisoner Carter, was a fellow servant of mine. About May last I attended Mrs. Williams, to a party, and on my coming home, the prisoner Woolams and two other young men were sitting very comfortable on the sofa, and the prisoner asked why we did not knock the old lady on the head, and another said no, we had better choak her, and take her property from her. The other two young men went away, and Woolams stopped in the house. When we went for Mistress, to bring her home she lant her carriage to bring another family home, and she came home with another family. As soon as we went down into the kitchen, Woolams's hat was on the table, and the prisoner Carter took it up. and took it into the pantry.</p>

I saw the Money there on Sunday the 15th of July, which was 2 Days before I lost it, and I went out about my Business, and the Prisoner had the Keys of my Room to clean it, and she lived by Grays-Inn-Lane, and she was my Acquaintance; and I came home again, and the Door was open, and so was my Box; and the Money, and the Seal, and the Linen were gone.

            . The Day my Uncle was robb'd he sent for me, and I went with him to enquire after the Prisoner at Holborn-Bars, we heard she had been there, and was fuddled, and went away in a Coach. Then we went to the Castle in Brook's-Market, and she had been there too, but was gone. We went out and met her in the Street with the Linen upon her. We got a Constable, and coming to Saffron-Hill, 2 Men came up, and said, she should go no farther without a Warrant, and so she fell down, and we could not get her along. The Constable desir'd us to make it up, because he could not carry her before his Majesty - the Magistrate, without a Warrant; so she said she'd give my Uncle the Remainder of the Money, which was 6 Shillings and a Penny, and he took it.</p>

            . The same Morning the Prosecutor was robb'd I saw the Prisoner in a Brandy Shop; she pull'd out nine or ten Guineas, and had got a new Gown and new Shoes and Clogs. I did not know of the Robbery then, but the Prosecutor told me of it soon after. We found her in Brooks-Market, and he said to her, Sarah! how came you to rob me? I rob you? says she, here, take your Linen. So we got a Constable, but two Butchers rescued her, and she beat me, and threaten'd to cut my Throat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor and I lived together as Man and Wife, but not contented with that, he lock'd me up for three Weeks together, and would not let me see Man, Woman, nor Child; and so at last I got away, and because I did not come home again when he would have had me, he said he would transport me. I have got three Love Letters here that he sent to me since I was in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court. Powell, look on those Letters, did you send them to the Prisoner?</p>

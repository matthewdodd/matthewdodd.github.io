                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the employ of Mr. Henry Hall, of Neesden. About half-past five, o'clock, on the 8th of March, I and Clark were about the garden—I saw Patrick in the rick-yard—he was Mr. Hall's servant—soon afterwards Sherriffe, the bone-man, went down the road with his horse and cart—he drove close under the hedge, by the rick-yard—Patrick brought part of a truss of hay from the rick-yard, and delivered it to Sherriffe, who put it into the cart, and covered it with sacks—he then got into his cart, and drove off as hard as his horse could gallop towards Acton—he kept look<lb></lb>ing behind him—after telling my master, I went towards Hammersmith,</p>

About a quarter before seven o'clock I was on duty in Friar's-place, Acton—I met Sherriffe with a horse and cart—he is a dealer in marine-stores, and lives at Hammersmith—I asked if he had an old mat for sale—I looked into his cart, and saw about three parts of a truss of hay, partly covered over with old sacks—he was going gently at the time, but the horse was warm, as though it had been going fast—he passed on—soon after that I saw Butler and Clark—they told me what had happened—I followed and took him at Hammersmith—I found no hay in the cart, but a little in the sack—the cart was littered with hay, and the back of the horse likewise—I have not been able to find where the hay went to.</p>

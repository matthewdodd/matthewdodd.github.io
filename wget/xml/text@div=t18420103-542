                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live at No. 23, Great North-street, Lisson-grove; my wife was lying-in, and the prisoner nursed her. On Thursday, the 16th of December, she' came and staid till Saturday, the 18th, and then left—she was. paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for her services—on Monday, the 20th, twelve napkins, a gown, a petticoat, a cap, and two pillow-cases were missed—I had seen the napkins and gown safe on the Friday, the 17th—the napkins were in a drawer, and the-gown on the drawers—on Wednesday evening, the 22nd, I went to No. 57, Salisbury-street, where the prisoner lives—as soon as she saw me she said, "I suppose you have come about those things?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "The things shall be all right to-morrow morning, if you will say nothing about it, if you will forgive me"—I said I should not forgive her longer than till I could see a policeman, and I gave her in charge.</p>

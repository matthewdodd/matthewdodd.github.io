On the 11th of June, at half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner came to my house, and called for a glass of stout; the girl served her, and she handed a coloured 6d., and said, "Give me change for this half-sovereign, and take for the halfpint of stout;" I stopped the 6d., and sent to my husband, who sent for an officer; I asked her if she had any more money about her; she said No; she was searched, and 1l. 0s. 6 1/2d. in good money was found upon her.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I offer you that to give change? A. Yes, and I asked where she got it; she said in change for a sovereign at a house in Grub-street; I went there, and she had not received change there - we went to the Coach and Horses public-house, and saw the brother-in-law of the landlord; he said the prisoner had change for a sovereign there, but she had offered him a bad half-sovereign first, and he had given her one pound's worth of good silver; the prisoner then said she took the half-sovereign at the Seven Stars public-house, Whitechapel.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took the prisoner. I found on her 19s. 6d. in good silver, and 1s. 3 1/2d. in copper - she was in liquor; I did not go to the Seven Stars.</p>
               <p>- HENSHAW. The landlord of the Coach and Horses public-house, in Bunhill-row, is my brother-in-law. The prisoner was there that day, between half-past six and seven o'clock in the morning; she tendered a gilt 6d., which I would not take; a person followed her in, and said she knew it was bad, and she had offered it at a house opposite: I asked the prisoner why she tendered that when she had money in her pocket; she said, because she owed that person some money - I would not serve her; she said she took it at the Seven Stars.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What money did I give you? A. You pulled out a sovereign, and some girl at the bar went out and got change for it, though it was against my wish; I counted it out before this woman, and told her to sound it before she took it away - she was partially intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I changed it when I was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110163"></xptr>liquor. Since the time my husband was killed I cannot recollect any thing: I received two sovereigns from my brother; I knew no more what I was doing than the dead- I was going to look for the place where I took the change, but could not make it out; I thought I took it of this young man.</p>
               <p>ANN FEELEY. She owned to me that she knew it was bad - this is the sixpence.</p>

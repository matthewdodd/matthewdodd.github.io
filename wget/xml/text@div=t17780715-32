               <p>The prisoner came into the shop about seven in the evening and asked for some soup; another man came with him; we had none; I gave them some tripe, which they had in the parlour; they kept the door half shut; afterwards a gentleman came in and the prisoner walked off; in about a quarter of an hour after they were gone, a pick-lock was found on the chair; I am sure, there had been no other person in the room but the prisoner and his companion. On the Sunday after, I met the prisoner in Drury-lane; I watched him to Brown's; I told my master of it; he went and he was then gone; at half after nine we watched him to Wild-street; he trembled very much; he was taken up on the Monday following; none of the things were found again; he gave before the justice very different accounts of where he lodged; he would not tell where he really lodged. Haines was not in the room half a minute before he turned back, and said, he had found the pick-lock.</p>

The first job he did was at the Duke of Marlborough's, then at Lord Godolphin's, and then at Eton College, and at several noblemen's houses: I trusted him with some scores of pounds; I never knew him wrong me of a penny.</p>
               <p>Did the girl give a contradictory evidence before the justice? - Yes, quite contrary; at the last examination I was not there; at the first, and at the second time, she said, there were two men besides this man there; she said the prisoner went out first, that another followed him some time after, and one of them took to his heels and had like to have thrown a woman down.</p>

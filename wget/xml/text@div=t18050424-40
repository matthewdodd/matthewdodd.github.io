             sworn. - On the 11th of March, about twenty minutes after eight o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise, apparently in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240039"></xptr>one pair of stairs room, which Mrs. Grace rents of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular reason to know that that was the precise time? - A. I know that was the time, I looked at the clock; I went up to the landing-place, and I found the door was broke open; I did not like to go any farther; I put my finger to the door, and it came open; then a man sprang from the landing-place of the two pair of stairs, and asked me if that was Mrs. Grace's; I charged him with breaking the door open, and sent for a constable and he was searched; we found nothing on him but a direction from Mrs. Inch; he said he had come from Mrs. Inch, and that was the direction from Mrs. Inch, who had been nurse to Mrs. Grace three weeks before; the prisoner said that Mrs. Inch had sent him there to call on Mrs. Grace, to make up a quarrel that had been that day between Mrs. Grace and Mrs. Inch; the padlock was found the next morning in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mrs. Grace? - A. She was gone out that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come into the house? - A. My door is always open till nine o'clock, my wife being in the milk business.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of the door being shut? - A. She told me so, and gave me charge; the next morning an iron crow was brought to me found on the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the clock in order to know whether it was the time of night to get the reward? - A. Far be it from me; my wife desired me to look at the clock, because I might be brought to a farther account.</p>
               <p>- GRACE sworn. - On the 11th of March I was obliged to go between six and seven o'clock to Mrs. Gray, that I wash for; I had not been there long before I received information that my room had been broke open; when I came to the lodgings I found the prisoner in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No; I know Mrs. Inch; she was sister to my husband; she was with me in the afternoon; he came with the direction; he communicated to me Mrs. Inch wished to make it up; we had quarrelled a little.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have never seen Mrs. Inch since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went to enquire about Mrs. Inch? - A. No, I think she is too wicked a woman for that young man to have any connection with.</p>
               <p>Q. What wickedness do you know of her? - A. She was very good before my husband died; after that she behaved very uncivil and cross.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of forty pounds as well as the last witness? - A. I do not know the meaning of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: I was sent for the 11th of March a little after eight o'clock; I searched the prisoner and found nothing on him; I took him to Marlborough-street, and the landlord brought these things which I produce; an iron crow, a padlock, and a staple.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.At the time you searched him, if he had any of these things about him you must have found them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to see a relation of mine at Paddington; Mrs. Inch desired me to call on her sister-in-law; she told me she had had some words with her, to know if she would make it up.</p>

I remember passing through the turnpike at Hyde Park corner at about ten minutes or a quarter past nine in the evening; we passed through the left hand gaite; I observed a carriage pass through before us, which had lights; we might then be ten or a dozen yards from it; we were going quicker than in general; it was a very dark night. We gained upon the coach that was before up, and got nearly opposite to it, bearing away on the right. In a moment I heard the coach run against something; I can't say whether it was on the left or right side of our coach, because I was in conversation with my wife; but the shock seemed to be on the left of our coach; the shock was very great; the other coach appeared to go straight forward. The prisoner appeared to me to be perfectly sober. I did not hear any one call out to make way. The prisoner did not stop at all after this to make any enquiry what had happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The coach in front of us had lights, I could not see any thing before us for the glare of those lamps.</p>

It was rather a dark night; I was standing on the Hospital side, that is the left side going from Town; I could see the carriages that passed and repassed most distinctly; I was looking in the road for a dog I had lost. I could see by the glare of these coach lamps; I think there was an advantage for a foot-passenger's seeing. I heard a voice proceeding from the opposite side of the road, and my attention was then directed that way. I observed the carriages two or three seconds before I heard the voice; what the voice uttered, I don't know. In about the space after that a horse could strike three or four strokes with his feet, I heard a crash; then I heard screaming; I principally heard a man's voice. I went across to the assistance of the people; but I found I could afford them no assistance. At the time I heard the voice, I saw the carriages going. The one that appeared to have done the mischief, appeared to be going fast. There is a little difficulty coming through the gate. The carriage with lights was on its proper side of the road; it a little preceded the coach the prisoner drove; but I think they were running in almost parallel lines; I think the prisoner's coach was more on the right than was necessary, supposing he was endeavouring to pass the other. I found the gig thrown over, and one shaft broken; I found the woman and the child thrown out by the shock; they were immediately taken to the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I believe there was room for the gig to have passed between the two carriages.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KIRBY. I was driving this gig on the 25th of August, in which were my wife, and child. About a hundred yards from the gate, I was on the left hand side of the road, and saw this coach a few yards before me, coming directly on me; I called out for God's sake stop, and drew up the horse; my wife screamed out; but it was so momentary a thing that he was upon us. With the force of his near horse coming against my near sharft, broke it; and my wife and the baby fell out on the near side of the chaise, and I and a son of mine about ten years old fell behind the horses hee1s. Then when the shafts were broken, the horse turned a little to the left, and the coach passed us on the left. My little boy and I got up from behind the horses heels, and my wife and the baby were taken to the Hospital. The coach that did the mischief was coming with a fast trot down a descent; I could not get out of the way, it was so momentary a thing. My wife and the baby were killed. I was driving very slow.</p>

               <p>MR. KERMION. I am house-sergeon at St. George's Hospital. I remember the unfortunate persons being brought into the Hospital; the child had a fracture on the left thigh, and I observed something farther wrong about the child, and I did not ascertain what that was until he was dead; he lived until five o'clock the next morning, and then died. I afterwards opened it, and found that two of the bones of the back were separated from each other, and the liver was ruptered, from which profuse bleeding had taken place.</p>

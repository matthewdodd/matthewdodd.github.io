                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Lofts, a bookseller, and live is Park-place, Mile-end-road. The prisoner was in my service nearly five months—she did not sleep in the house—about ten o'clock on Wednesday night, the 28th of May, she was going home with a parcel—I told her to leave it, which she did, in the kitchen—she came next morning, about half-past six—I opened the parcel about half-past nine, and found in it five half-crowns and eighteen shillings—I then asked her whether she had anything in the parcel besides her clothes—she said she bad not—her clean clothes were in the parcel—I showed her the money, and told her where I had found it—she said, "The money does not belong to you, and you have no business with it"—I asked whether it belonged to her father and mother—she said it did not—I asked whether they knew of her having it—she said they did not—I asked how she came by it—she hesitated, and afterwards said she found it at the back of the counter, among some papers—I sent for a constable, and gave her into custody—I had not missed the money; but, on examining my accounts, I missed 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the Monday morning till Thursday, from the drawer in the shop—I paid her 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week and kept her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I was sent for, and received the prisoner into custody—I asked her how she came by the money—she said she had found it in some waste paper, as she was clearing up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> As I was clearing away the waste paper behind the counter this money was with it; I thought no more of it, but took it down and put it with my things; I had no intention of keeping it, I meant to give it to my mistress the next morning; she sent me out with some wash<lb></lb>ing, and when U came back she had found it.</p>

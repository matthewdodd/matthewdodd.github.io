            . On the 17th of last month. I was at work at Mr. Hallgarth's public house, from ten in the morning, till nine in the evening; on that day the prisoner was sitting drinking with two more men in the tap room; they were there from ten in the morning, till five in the evening; I saw the prisoner with two women, drinking in the passage of the bar, he was standing between the two women; I saw his hand over in the bar, it was closed, but what was in it I could not see; this was about half past five; he afterwards went away with these two women, and returned about half past eight.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of June, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody, about half past eight in the morning I apprehended him. I found him in the custody of Mrs. Clark, she accused him of taking the watch; he struck her on the breast, and jumped out of the window; I brought him back to the prosecutor's house, and while I was searching him, the wife came in, and said, here is the duplicate and the money, let my husband go. In taking him to Tothill Fields, I told him, I thought he had made a foolish job of it; he said he was drunk, or else he should not have done it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses who have him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen that piece of printed cotton? - A. I have no doubt, in my own mind, that I had seen it during the morning, but not to make any observation of it; I said, a constable must be sent for, and she said, what for; it was not in her possession, but she was at least ten yards from the place where the cottons were kept; I sent for the constable and took her and the man to Bow-street; the man was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that cotton? - A.Fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in your shop at the time? - A. My young man was first serving her, he went away and then I took his place; he is not here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t18010916-3-verdict14" type="verdictDescription">

I was in Park-street, Camden-town, on the 1st of September—in consequence of what a boy said, I went into the fields by Chalk Farm—there was some linen spread out on the grass—the prisoners were there with another—I saw Flood packing up the linen in a bundle as I got up to them—I took them both into custody—Smith was standing by looking on, and was in his company—they all three came away together—Smith and his companion ran away, but Smith was secured and brought back to me—the bundle contained three table-cloths, three shifts, one pair of stockings, and a handkerchief—I took them not ten minutes' walk from the prosecutrix's—Flood said his mother had sent him out with the linen to dry—Smith said nothing—there were more people there looking on, but I was informed these three had been seen there by themselves—Flood was the only person I saw touch the property—I took them all into custody—it was between one and two In the daytime.</p>

                  </hi> I am a retired police inspector, and am employed by the Mint for the purpose of detecting offences—on the night of the 27th September I went with Sergeant Ham and some other officers to the Newcastle Arms beer-house, Lambeth, about half-past nine, and saw the prisoner standing at the door in his shirt-sleeves—he was seized by Morton and Ham—there were other policemen, of the L division, and a sergeant of the P division—they endeavoured to get him up stairs—he struggled very violently—they got him to the first-floor landing, and asked him whether he lived in the first-floor back room—he made no reply, but put his hand in his left-hand trousers pocket—Morton said,</p>

               <p>"He has got his hand in his pocket"—he took his hand from his pocket—Morton seized it, opened it, and found in it the packet containing three bad shillings, with paper between them—he said, "Protect me, Mr. Brannan; this b—has put them in my pocket"—he was very violent, and kicked the officers—another piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) fell on the floor—I put my foot on it—it was picked up, but there was nothing in it—Inspector Bryant was using efforts to open the back door with a sledge hammer—the prisoner said, "Wait a minute, I will give you the key"—he did so—the door was opened, and the officers commenced searching—the coat the prisoner now wears was hanging on the wall—he was asked by one of the constables whether it was his—he said, "Yes; give it to me: Mr. Brannan, you need not search it, for your b— —will put some<lb></lb>thing into it"—it was handed to Inspector Bull in my presence—I saw him search it, and take from it this packet, containing two counterfeit florins, with paper between them—he handed them to me in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner said, "The b---- has put it in my pocket."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">P</hi>). I was with Brannan and the other officers—I was one of those who seized the prisoner—I told him we had a warrant for the purpose of searching his room for counterfeit coin—I had one of his arms, and Morton had the other—he made a jump, and caught hold of a window leading to the bar—he struggled very hard, and kicked violently—we got him upstairs—got him in a corner—I seized him, and he said, "Wait a minute, allow me to put this money in my pocket"—he had nothing in his hand whatever—he struggled very hard, and succeeded in getting his left hand into his trousers pocket—I can swear there was nothing in his hand at that time—Morton said, "He is drawing something out of his pocket"—Morton seized his hand, which was clenched, and took a piece of paper from it, which Brannan opened—we afterwards got into the room—a coat was hanging up, which I believe to be the one the prisoner has on now—Morton said, "There is a coat hanging up here"—the prisoner said, "That is mine, you shall not search it; allow Mr. Brannan to search it"—Brannan took it from the wall, and handed it to Inspector Bull, who found a paper parcel in it, which he handed to Mr. Bryant.</p>
